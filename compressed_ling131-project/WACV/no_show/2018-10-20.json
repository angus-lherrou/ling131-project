we've got funding for comedy here now on the health and will show with David aren't just real quick to seven nine seven four three one that's three three four two seven nine seven four three one and you can talk to David urged right and speaking\nOf talking you know those two characters that don't that scared a Martin and the jury lose your your leisure Martin talking good and very were funny I oh you know they they started out in\nA in a ball bill and a night clubs and uh somebody\nAccidentally kind of put them together and I thought it was hilarious and they ah they started working together and then they you know made all those movies I don't know if they ever had a TV show or not I know they had a radio show\nYeah but uh then you know they kind of went their separate ways right and everybody thought a dean would just kind of disappear but you know he comes out he comes up with the singing thing they did they needed a he did a lot of movies so to Jerry Lewis\nBut I remember when I got back together on the telephone you remember the hell yeah hell on big reunion yeah those are amazing they ... they really did some good thing I think Frank Sinatra brought him brought him

habit ... couples and I'm not going to get into that one\nToday I I Know where you're Vietnam\nYou see that a lot now you do it you know it's the same thing yeah\nSo the thing is it's very important to work together and to care for each other and to make sure that if something happens to one does that happen to the other or vice versa or if something goes wrong the other one we the the last man standing last woman standing that'd be careful about that one too\nIs taking care of\nThose words you don't want to just leave them Standing Alone and then she told me just a few moments ago oh women live on an average seven years longer than their mate they do so here's some things you can do you can make a list of ... a lot\nOr when Kay your IRA your bank account of your life insurance and that's a big one right there oh yeah life insurance can take care of some of your sins if you've already sent much those words you've got too much coming in and it's going to cut off\nLife insurance has one way mhm okay long term care policies that's another thing we got to talk about that we're going to talk about that in the special show in itself in the future very soon\nA minute is et cetera but the other way is to show his to know what benefits are available to you from Social Security administration and this is very important is talking about it a little bit earlier lump sum benefits monthly benefits payable so spouses and children no information on your spouse's employer\nThat is approximately earnings for the last two years and we're to locate tax returns those are important gotta have that information how to find a marriage certificate so scared numbers for spouses and children\nIt's also good to review our a bank accounts retirement accounts and for one case for the updated beneficiary information and make sure that the beneficiaries lot of people don't know this\nIf you don't have a beneficiary name besides your spouse you are messing up there are tax free exchanges you are refusing my friend you are missing the boat if you don't have your children are loved one's own there if you don't know how to do that call me I'll do it for you for free\nThree three four two seven nine seven four three won that take your right to David artist yes a lot of people say hey it's good is this retirement account it'll just go through probate are oh she's got a wheel or he's got a wheel that doesn't stop attacks my friend ... ... it just sounds who gets but\nUncle Sam that guy with a beard in the hat is still standing there with his hand stuck out in his biggest ran on his face going\nYou didn't call digit [laughter] and I'm not saying yes he knows the number that number too but he won't he won't tell you he would like for you not to call that number that's why he would like for you not to know the information that I can\nGive you all of your our eyes all we're unqualified accounts can go to your spouse\nTax free exchange all of them can go to your ... your children tax free exchange now I'm Talking about income taxes my friends I'm not talking about estate taxes if you're over Fifteen million dollars you got to do some trust in some other things oh yeah I Am talking about the way the money can be passed\nStrict I got a question yes go ahead of me and my wife are almost right at the same way she wants difference right so we've got to like oh I don't know sixty five sixty six and I had one on transgender operations as long as she was\n... [laughter]\n[laughter] I just know uncommon okay I may be but I just cut that out right now [laughter]\nI was a good guy [laughter]\nAs a way every issue I see I just just questions just going to come to mind there you know that is something\nThat we're going to kick to the physician okay not the lawyers are not the financial advisor but your um your physician like it's a good question\n[laughter] yes it it could be a good question [laughter]\nAh\nFor for four to seven or seven for three one I'm sure you've got some better questions and that but only when I asked David aren't\nYes yes I Hope so I mean don't take me wrong rescue that was a good question but please ask me better questions if you can okay no problem wheels will not insure that dress has passed to your loved ones right again I Will say that your will will not as sure that your assets were passed properly to your\nThe only way to ensure your assets go to those that you intend ... beneficiary designations owned your insurance on your pensions\nEt cetera et cetera et cetera tax free exchange most of the time\nDoesn't mean that you get out of Texas and the long run but it does mean right there at that point in time still no taxes will be generated a lot of people make the mistake the pension is taxable what if it had a hundred or two hundred three hundred thousand dollars or more oriented ... ah your Uncle Sam\nStanding right there maybe he'll get a third of it he really loves you because you didn't even put his name them that he's got a a wheelbarrow in a shovel he's ready to go\nYeah so without this feature your assets would pass through probate and be distributed according to court instructions ... and guess who gets that money all I can imagine it on a ... in the average sea for just putting probate through the court is around five to six percent ...\nSo that means somebody gets paid for doing something that you could have done in fifty seconds or everybody sixties like everybody's\nGot a handout how fast can you write your name I don't know I saw you may uh Korea [laughter]\nWas it was like what happens is so anyway\nGetting back to what you should and shouldn't do if you or have a spouse or a loved one that is a cohabiting with you there are a couple of more stamps I encourage people to take if your spouse is a veteran are if you're a ... a veteran\nGovernment life insurance and veterans' benefits may be available to you is very good to know these questions and answers\nI have a nephew who is a veteran yes and the thing about these are the benefits are they're not going to come to have it on the door hey you know you got some benefit oh no if you're a veteran I urge you to go and ask\nAnd and find out about though and it takes a while for them to decide the tab on that a riot they will because they're kind of slow their color bureaucracy yes another is to ditch shade important estate planning documents in other words\nWere are those papers the you know when he left those papers are she lived those papers before she died were higher those papers you get you a safety deposit box or safe deposit box of what they call it and keep all those papers in there and you might be a pain to have to go to the bank to look at your papers but they're all in one safe place right\nAnd I cannot stress more bad at the very least everyone should have a wheel a power of attorney\nBut trust and guardianship for any minor children these things don't cost much\nThey don't cost much and they don't do themselves you know if you don't have those things we can get those things for you cheep cheep cheep cheep cheep cheep cheep cheep cheep cheep cheep [laughter] once you're estate planning documents are finalized selected in state administrate door\nAnd when we start looking to the side issues or whether it be you know a ... something you know saluted the guy who body slammed a journalist and he's he's now equal to the Saudis cutting a journalist to ribbon you up on on that the emotional play\nThat the Democrats are trying to use in these midterms might that be effective given the difficult tenants out there\nWell I think ... to ... in my view\nThe Democrats have no agenda I mean the economy isn't very good shape extremely good shape unemployment under four percent but when the economy is good the economy is usually not the issue something else becomes issue [noise]\nUh and I think that the that the Democrats are really they're pushing this ... thing and and the the murder of him and this tremendously literate tale of murder and the consulate in Turkey\nI think too you know there are they they have no agenda and they're seizing upon this and trying to attach it to to Trump but it was or what exactly for him and\nHis the Democratic party's great agenda what is their contract with America what are they going to do more pretend they're going to do since the only house they can get I Believe is the one house of representatives what is their agenda they don't have one the big issue in this campaign is Trump\nRight no that's all they have I mean this is the he is he is the centerpiece and I'm ... now you're seeing some pollsters saying by internal polls are the president's approval ratings are surging\nAnd that the Republicans could squeak out just enough seats to hold onto the majority if that doesn't happen if the Democrats take control of the house even by a slim majority what do you think happens what will the next year look like for Trump [laughter]\nI'm sure did help [laughter]\n\nLiterally gay shouldn't you know as far as they\nSay anything that can enact anything they can't you know we revise Obamacare and send it over to Republican Senate then send it down through\nPresident Trump why those so they can't do anything so they're going to investigate everything they will be looking into his tax returns are going to be looking into any financial connections with Saudi Arabia they got to get the ... report\nW looking into alleged alleged a obstruction of justice and the Russia investigation\nAll of these things and New York\nThe southern district of New York will be investigating and the grand jury here in DC so I think that's all that they've got going for that\nYou've wondered if you ask him deeply what you believe it ought to be they would say you know the goal here is impeach crop and lock him up\nBut you know I hadn't announced that is your goal\nAnd you shrink your base your democratic base down to it's hard core which is insufficient to win the house of representatives to the degree that you rally those folks in the Democratic party on that issue\nYou don't get the broad based sort of the ballots and you live over in northern Virginia you know they've got a fighting chance on this congressional district here right if you did something like that it would kill it\n... that I Want to play something you you just mentioned the impeachment and the I word impeachment uh last night ... go to ... three games a bit of a ... who is Ted Cruz's challenger in Texas did a town hall meeting and he had this to say\nAbout that and that in July that you would as a member of the house right now vote to impeach hadn't changed your mind I haven't\nAccording to the constitution that mean that the president has committed the crime the tree than primer bribery or a high crime and misdemeanor which one of those I think the president has committed\nWouldn't like in a impeachment to an indictment there there is enough there to proceed with a trial for a full vetting of the facts and to make the best informed decision in the interests of this country and our future\nYour reaction to that that does that help him and helped democratic candidates across the\nGun it still didn't hear the charge was\nThe exact opposite\n[laughter] does that help it doesn't help better over arching it was in a and veterans got his own problems he's nine or ten born down or sixty two million in the bank got\nBut ah you know no I don't take it helps him I think we're better off work it seems to me he's running short of heart left or very far left for Texas a course in a foreign land for the Democratic party\nI'm beginning to wonder if he doesn't see himself as Abe Lincoln lost the Senate race and Eighteen fifty eight and came back to win the presidency and a Eighteen ...\nYeah well aside from height to there's very little commonality there that I think you I I don't remember on his name on a skateboard but maybe I missed that chap ah your final moderate I put him in a corner you put you on the record year do you think the Republicans hold the house and Senate\nGoing into these midterms where do you think the populace is right now you know the the the people out there who are elected Trump\nI think the I think over all that you would have to say that the Democrats are probably going to get to twenty three votes to take the house I mean that would be a dramatic victory over the Republicans and I think the Republicans are favored by even more to hold on to the Senate\nThey've gotta lose a number of races where they're hit right now to lose the Senate and so I Would say it's going to be a Republican Senate dealing with Supreme Court nominees and appellate court nominees and it could be a Democratic House with all these investigations over as but I don't necessarily believe\nThat it's a bad thing to have Nancy Pelosi's crowd and in charge of the house and doing all these things with the American people I don't think you're going to be enthusiastic about it especially if they've got great foreign domestic problems\n... ... you can always great to hear from you thank you for joining us and we will be in touch OK you take it easy Randy\nThank you fat and er into old you are listening

I think there are some industry is lagging stays and um I thank you and appreciate the call I ... and here's the thing that I Would say\nAnd you're right now is the time for the president to back off the the bruise or if you will and start being the the the salesman Trump and selling the great things he's delivered on and that are already underway\nUh we do have great economic news the the industrial output the manufacturing output the the the unemployment but at the same time Steve there are people like you who aren't feeling the full effects of this\nAnd need to know that the ... he's doing everything he can be the president is not a wizard or a magician\nHe doesn't fix everybody every aspect of every life\nThe only things as I mentioned to Pat Buchanan the two things that that people want from a precedent our security and prosperity\nAnd prosperity is best gained by having an even playing field where you're not owners sleep taxed or regulated out of business and where you can you can grow a business and grow a family that's what the president should be about I think that is what he's about but that's a very limited his powers are limited\nAnd I think the media and everybody else I mean why are we focusing on a journalist that may have been brutalized by Saudi Arabia now I understand he wrote for the post\nA but\nWe can't control Saudi Arabia they were rogue regimes all over the damn world Cuba China North Korea\nOr some of our allies including Saudi Arabia when you get into the middle east it is a crap shoot and let me tell you they don't they don't you're talking about due process then no due process as they're due process as well let's see what side do you want to be roasted all well and from understanding\nAs well as the the journalist wasn't even a U.S citizen of course he was resigning here but he's our domestic Saudi Arabia to politics problems that would be best\nYeah well that's what I mean there that's beyond the president's ... of capabilities and frankly beyond his purview he did what he could and what he did was he sent Mike Pompeo to question them we should be concerned and I had been concerned about four years about human rights religious rights abroad\nWe have to protect those and use the might of America to push these regimes toward greater freedom and liberty for their people but that said we're not\nWe don't touch dominion over those countries all you can do is suggest push agitate and that's what the president did enough enough but on the media I can prove it to\nMSNBC and CNN all last night and the night before ran on this or a ... story okay the journalist that may have been mutilated dismembered in a Saudi Arabian consulate in Turkey okay we've got two problems here turkey and Saudi Arabia\nOkay neither of them have particularly great human rights records back they don't but we can only call them out\nMSNBC and CNN to live with this for two nights they lost the ratings by double digits Fox had more viewers than both of them combined\nNo one is interested in this story and it doesn't change one American Life and it doesn't affect our policy or the presidency in the least and it'll have no impact on the midterms so\nTo push that narrative and to drive it to try to hit Trump it's too but it doesn't work where to take a quick break when we return all of your calls what's driving you to the polls\nEight five five forty and Laura Raymond ... sitting in for lower income with lots of cultural news to share with you soon I'm On Twitter at Raymond the royal\nShe sat Ingram angle and be sure to watch the younger mangled tonight ten pm eastern live Trump rally from ...

the\nRest of your show for joining us over those five\nTwo to five to five five two to five Leno is with us in Hartford, Connecticut Hi\nHow are you I'm good thank you so much for taking my call sure what's up [noise]\nUm I'm calling because my husband and I just started I'm really getting serious about the debt snowball we have approximately Seventy thousand dollars in debt mainly from my student loans and um we have fifty six hundred dollars in savings\nAnd my question is um we have\nA baby coming and maybe a um April nineteenth of the duty right\nYeah for excited do wish that I was initially going to use you know get the thousand dollar emergency fund any forty six hundred to pay off bills yeah but now with the baby I didn't feel right that's what I was wondering what how we should kind of attack that\nWhat I Would suggest should do is push pause on the total moneymaker over okay and pile up cash as big a pile as your compiled between now and the term by becomes\nOkay and um and then whatever your piled up and and then when mommy and baby come home from the hospital and everybody's fine and I ... was\nYou think we would have had about that is behind us right um well I mean there's the whole thing of raising the baby but I you know ... years yeah there is now but I but basically the you know we want to make sure labor and delivery and everything goes and we don't have any hiccups and when we got money okay so let's say you save up what what's your household income\nRight now it's about a Seventy seven thousand okay\nSo let's say you save up twenty five thousand dollars between now and then to use it in twenty four thousand after you come home from the hospital and push play on your total moneymaker over and take your account down to a thousand dollars and throw it at the at those a student loan you will have lost no ground\nOkay unless you go baby spending crazy during the next few months\nWe had a lot of stuff like this is our second child how can you had a lot of stuff the only thing that would be a little bit different and uh they gave me the boy 'cause I have a lot of girls close\nWhen there is no but I mean I don't think you know what I'm Talking about by baby crazy events from friends do that or they just like oh drop twenty grand to get ready for\nYou know on a pound human being I mean they just go nuts and so if you'll just calm down and just you know manager budget like you were trying to get out of debt\nBut instead of throwing it at the debt you keep everything tie you throw it in a pile of cash and then we don't spend it on baby a than is necessary for my survival and we uh throw it at the dead one by being mommy come home we push play again\nI'm good how are you doing\nBetter than I deserve what's up\nOkay so my husband and I got to pay for our wedding and um we didn't get to the insurance are or are we park is our life insurance and we got our permanent and heart term and of course\nAnd often turn about a week ago so I take that our financial advisor and we immediately wanted to get rid of the term sorry the permanent and just have term and he said Dave Ramsey is talking about oh a permanent insurance not portfolio base permanent insurance which is what you\nDo it they'll bad shall we still didn't get the odd term\nI apparently he doesn't know much about Dave Ramsey [laughter] okay Dave Ramsey does not ever invest I was real clearing the lesson you heard me yeah when you never tell you under any circumstances\nTo use life insurance as an investment vehicle one hundred percent of the time it sucks\nWhen you say because what we told him we wanted to do it\nI Would say you need more new financial advisor okay that's what I Would show you you don't have a financial advisor you have a life insurance salesman okay is selling you insurance\nSo what we were thinking we should do is switch to four hundred thousand just as term each and then that money we were 'cause it was like three hundred dollars a month which I'll do a lot yeah um and just go ahead and open up our rah rah are IRA and start getting money into that\nIn that it would mutual funds okay it's exactly what you learn in class was uh yeah so you already knew what she said yeah he this language tells me one of those things either this guy's a liar or he's ignorant\nBut he's a family friend isn't the [noise] um actually one of our friends did apparently gave them our number became a youth and for you as well\nYeah okay so I I don't know which is I mean I I don't know I don't know but but I Do know that I have never in my life told someone to buy life insurance as an investment under any brand heading name or description ever\nRight and the last thing it on our term policy um on your car he said you know twenty or Thirty years whatever went on and our term policy within ... eighty with hand\n[laughter] okay\nWhy don't you jump on the sand or insurance dot com and see what you can buy a twenty year level term policy for I think is going to blow your mind how much this guy's overcharged you for everything he sold you okay look are and you're probably going to end up just canceling everything with him so this kind of really needs a good firing\nOkay that sounds like well Oregon ... I'm In the end of this week\nAll right thank you for calling in and when you compare the prices you'll see what I'm Talking about and you understood the lesson when we were talking about using life insurance as an investment vehicle and the reason is folks for those of you that I haven't seen the financial ... never for some reason I heard a Ramsey talk about this\nCase someone else ever brings this up because it does come up periodically um\nThe people who sell investment based or\nWhole life or permanent live or portfolio or universal or anything where there is an investment going into insurance\nAre not happy with me they don't like me and so they generally try to ignore me or lie about me or something else because I pretty much cost them all a bunch of business because they sell crap\nCrap in a bag that's what it is okay it's pretty simple so here's the thing when you use life insurance as an investment vehicle hey\nMost of what they quote you after they take\nAll of their fees which usually in the first two years is one hundred per cent\n\nSometimes up to four years is one hundred percent of what should have gone to the investment goes out and fees even after that you're going to make three four five percent on your money and you should have been in a good mutual fund making ten eleven twelve percent on your body\nAnd that's where you should be when you die\nWith cash value permanent portfolio universal indexed universal life insurance they pay only the face amount of the policy not the extra money that you put into the investment that money is gone\nSo you have a savings account that for the first several years I keep all your money after that they give you a better rate of return and when you die they keep it all\nThis is a bad savings account bad investment broker the pay the the\nLife insurance products that give you the opportunity to pay\nTwenty times more than you would pay for term insurance in order that you create an investment inside of the policy\n\nAre basically the payday lender the middle class their crap and that's what Dave Ramsey has always said for twenty five years here on the air upset it for twenty five years is all live on that myself I have never owned\nWhile this show was operating in any\nKind of whole life or investment based life insurance of any kind ever not did get a horrible northwestern mutual whole life grotesque old\nSchool one of the worst of the worst of the whole lives when I was in my early twenties and it was the same way Britain they it was a guy my wife knew from college came around selling right after we got married and we bought this crap from him\nI had it for about nine months until I finally sat down with some guys who unpacked the numbers for me and I about kicked my own but when I saw how bad it was and got rid of it and since then I have never owned it and since then I've never told anyone to buy anything\nOther than\nFifteen to Twenty one year\nTerm life insurance about ten to twelve times your income on you the best way to buy life insurance is through a broker the shops several companies the best way to buy insurance of any connoisseur a broker that shop several companies and get you the best possible deal\nOr their car insurance your homeowner's insurance your long term care insurance your life insurance or insurance of any kind\nLetter broke her shop among several companies and get you the best kinds of deals and that's why we've endorsed for about Twenty years ... insurance\nJeff sander has become a personal friend of mine during that time and I buy my personal life insurance from slander and I don't own Zander insurance on our own any of it that's the other a lot is always told about me\nI Would I Would have a whole lot more money if I did on the sand or insurance because Jeff has done rather well due to the Dave Ramsey endorsement but the reason he's done well is he said he's got a very very good system for getting you the best possible price on term life insurance and it takes about like Thirteen seconds\nAnd they don't sell your name the list of people when you go on there either so that's why I've endorsed it's real\nAnd you need to get term life insurance have been cost that much so just jump in there and do it so Brittany thank you for calling with that question given the opportunity to clarify on that yet again yet again and again yet again yet again\nYes you need life insurance oh by the way a broker you know like even with your car insurance jump on the air with ... with the help of usually indoors local providers for your ... what we call PNC property in casual you got your corner homeowner's insurance you can shop most people say three to eight hundred dollars a year\nOn their car and homeowners when you're shopping among several companies [noise] instead of using what we call a captive agents in the business a captive agent can sell for one company like a state formation\nForeign nation wide in Asia [noise]\nPeyton Manning and Brad Paisley can sing to you agent [noise] was it nationwide that's nationwide and letting them [noise] but um\nAnd they're both good guys I like both of them something to do with that what you're paying for those guys\nWhen you when you use that insurance it's ... it's built in it and neither one of those guys were cheap I'll just tell you this is the day Ramsey show\n\nFocus is one of my favorite times of the kids in school football season is here and people everywhere are preparing for the new routines well while you're in preparation mode think about this one was the last time he checked on your financial plant\nYou heard me or do you even have one\nI listened with a financial planning and pleasure more likely to reach your investment goals and the best place to start is by sitting down and talking with investing professional our smart best her program helps you quickly fine the only professionals in your area that our team personally works with\nEnjoy to not have a ...\nNamed country wide on my back bank of America on my back\nCan't even imagine it's been so long since I've had any debt just his heart I think I Would probably like having anxiety attack it would be bad Carl is with us and Pennsylvania hate Carl welcome to the Dave Ramsey show\nI gave thanks for taking my call I appreciate it sure was up\nHey I've got a good problem but I'm hoping he can give me some advice on I'm forty eight years old would that free uh recently at our house off waiting\nYeah we're happy about that a decided to sell off some investments just to do that people kind of\nSaid well why would you do that oh the people's money as your interests and that's right and I tell you what the peace of mind is great fun and I had the good problem I have is we were able to\nDo some ... option and I've got about five or six hundred thousand dollar suit that I'm trying to figure out what to do with um excuse about about the same amount in four one K. which I have to be in the market\nUm I'm a little nervous about possibly also investing that amount of money and the market and I'm\nFive foot palms we for about ten home in the past and I'm thinking about using that money to buy rental properties outright mhm and a and B that and maybe diversify a little more [laughter] and I want to hear what your thoughts were on that\nOkay um I think is excellent if you've got the stomach for real estate real estate gives you a better return than the stock market will give you but it's a higher hassle factor yup it is you know you put money mutual fund they don't bother you you know but you you put put a renter in a house they go down you [laughter]\nSo there's a ... you know you've got the hassle of buying it you got to pay the taxes you got to pay the insurance I mean they're dealing with managing real estate all the aspects of it is a hassle factor I've got a bunch of it um amounts by far I have more in real estate than I Do in the stock market I've got a lot in both\nBut a real estate will give you a better rate of return but it requires\nManagement by you or someone else and even if you have somebody else do you got to manage the manager you cannot ignore it and so\nMy real estate with an internal right of return which is the tax benefit the the you know the depreciation schedule in other words the actual cash on cash return the ... modest expenses as a return on investment and the growth in value you put those three things together and real estate you get the actual returns which is called the intern right of return the IRR\nOkay what you would compare to a mutual fund right of return to do apples to apples higher\nHassle factor but most of my real estate is Seventeen to twenty percent

and if you want to fund a Roth IRA re for her or something the point here in this situation is when you have a kid running a business to the point is not the business the point is and what the kid is learning\nThey're learning work they're learning interface with customers and how to treat people\nAh they're learning that they have to deliver on time they have to deliver quality they're learning how to put prices on something they're learning that it's a good thing to make a profit the capitalism is not evil ... these are the lessons are what is important\nTo understand the accurate if she make some money that's just a bonus\nRight but what ... what are you what you've identified as you've identified the way this kid is wired\nAnd a lot of us that are entrepreneurial are are a lot or at least a little bit ADD [laughter] right right I mean how much of a pass anything the shiny I run towards that you know so it's I'm sure\nYou know but I ... if you start maybe they're starting to like a hundred thousand dollars a year or something you may want to do it in all asleep but if you if you're making under a hundred grand where the profit\nI mean that's not you know unless you just hit some bizarre thing or something like home depot wants to buy or out or something I don't know but you know what you're trying to do is teach her the lessons of how to set up operate a business\nDeliver on time follow through responsibility the character of work ethic those kinds of things that you have to have to run a business initiative\nSpread I mean it's it's even cheaper probably than that but it's amazing and people just assume all of college is the same cost it's just not and it's the number one mistake people make when they don't have a lot of money and the kid is going off to school it draws people understood that 'cause they simply go to school they can't afford\nAnd as you know we have a student loan crisis with a half a trillion dollars\nIn student loan debt we have an entire department within our company called Ramsey education\nThat puts a curriculum and the high schools and in the colleges across America we're now in forty percent of the high schools teaching high schoolers this common sense stop of staying out of debt and being on a budget and learning to save money and all of that kind of thing\nAnd what happens from time to time is the schools can't afford the basic resources and so someone will come along side in the community a business or an entity of some kind and we'll pay for that high school to have\nFoundations in personal finance curriculum from the Ramsey organization is that we've had about four million students go through one of the coolest things has happened lately is the University of Wyoming\nHas decided that every high school in the entire state of Wyoming needs to have this curriculum and they're sponsoring it in paying for it\nDang dang touchdown baby\nThat's how that happens the college university says we're going to take care of these high schoolers\nIn our state and make sure they learn about money and of course the University of Wyoming is the best cost alternative in the Wyoming area to go to college so this all works out really really good\nNow Tyler Moore is with me on the line and tile is from the University of Wyoming usually associated vice provost of enrollment\nKyle White uh go man thank you for doing that\nWell it's a pleasure to be with you David ... thanks for that we are certainly Saturday here in the state of Wyoming can be able to partner with a Ramsey education and provide some practical applicable\nBeing for students to be able to apply that college search and and and be a real fatty consumer of higher education yeah because you guys do have\nAnd couldn't write is are we are we having the lowest resident tuition at any public institution that grant doctoral degrees anywhere in the United states\nOf all fifty states of all the rooms are like so like you were cheaper than my University of Tennessee or your cheaper than the University of dot dot dot\nThat's correct wow very cool very cool and I got to tell you when I\nWhat your whole promotion was behind this\nI immediately wanted to steal it and bring it and use it some more and like in the University of Tennessee and I'll tell you were doing a few minutes but I Will get them to do it yeah you guys are creative I Love this tell everybody about this uh about this campaign and the the motto for the campaign is hands down the best thing I've heard\nSo that our our our campaign is called the world needs more cowboys we're we're not talking about guys in cowboy hat that ride off into the sunset but we're talking about a state with a long heritage and a university mascot and a cowboy that\nCan be anyone from any gender any background but we're talking about that enters here we're talking about a curiosity independence boldness\nAnd the pursuit that adventure and we're talking about someone who changes landscapes and and books for opportunities to make differences in the world we're talking about trailblazers and people exemplify the spirit of the underdog you\nKnow it's not a cowboy isn't what you are but it's who you are\nYeah well and you guys are the cowboys\nI mean so it's a play on words obviously I mean if you're a mascot right vessel decorate your football team your basketball team won Evers the cowboys I mean like my University of Tennessee Volunteers I think they ought to steal it inside of the world needs more volunteers that makes it just as much sense right and so it's just good I play on words but you you guys got though that you got to the table first with is why it a go\nIt it's a great motto and it goes it says so much in just a so few words very very cool well we're really grateful to all of our sponsors around the country that are helping us and you got sponsoring the high school every high school in Wyoming is going to have\n... as a coming up soon the the high school curriculum because the cowboys paid for it [laughter]\nThat's pretty cool guy thank you man\nWe're happy to be happy to be a partner we uh we are we are state that is very practical were state that very\nMuch um applicable in terms of being smart with our money and we wanted to make sure that we were not leaving out our opportunity to educate the future generations\nAnd know that there are opportunities in higher education to be smart with your money to be smart about that investment and your future and the University of Wyoming is a way to do that and we're we're helping helping our students in our future generation in the state of Wyoming through the Ramsey education product\nWell as one of those when when when things as far as I'm concerned because you're you know you're you're helping them by sponsoring this and they're going in there we're blessed because you're doing it with us and we appreciate that\nI'm In the winter is is that you get to put the University of Wyoming cowboys right in front of every high school student and remind them that's where they ought to go to college\n'cause sometimes people do silly things like wander across the state line I talked to a lot of Provo is around the country a mile and chancellor and vice chancellor diversity as a Tennessee and it's a constant thing\nAnd then you the state is trying to woo their own residence to their own university and it's become a thing you gotta you gotta go after it don't you\nSir absolutely and we have a lot of great students here in the state of Wyoming and there are a lot of great students across the country who\nOut of state but you have to be\n... you have to do your due diligence in that process of searching for higher education in addition to being the lowest cost per resident tuition of Dr ranting institution\nYou're near the very lowest for non residents to come to Wyoming so we have a lot to offer not just here in the great state of Wyoming but from coast to coast north or south\nWe can be a solution that provide students an incredible opportunity for education and we're going to be very very good at making sure that we are helping\nA student be successful not just students success and part of that is not racking up a lot of debt at the end of their degree completion\nMeant so how many students on your campus\nWe have we have a little over or twelve thousand so it was twelve thousand a little over four hundred students here that are called himself cowboys\nNow that's a good size school it's not too big and small and so that's a that's just right those are ... Dale dress right very cool very cool ... it's an honor to talk to you again rather thank you for coming on more than ...\nThank you very much a best wishes to you and your team there in uh in Tennessee and we appreciate the opportunity to say the world needs more cowboys\nAnd I love it I Love the motto and I think the world does need more cowboys in so many ways [laughter] good stuff I got a little picture John Wayne going in my head I can't help but it's just the way it is but a bottom line is lesser mascot and so now it's uh that's very cool stuff I Love it\nAnd want a neat thing that the college University of the state is buying it for every single high school now if you're a business or a university and you'd like to do something like that maybe you don't have to maybe don't have the money to buy the whole state or something every high school in the states some states have more high schools and others can you imagine you know but um\nYou know maybe he just wanted to be to the hospital used to go to um I Want to wear spoke to them in the building where I used to go to hospital ... now a middle school so I don't think forty really bright and shiny little eighth graders looking\nAt me that's the hardest speaking of or have all this time um\nBut uh as Anthony all males got tough job but I'm pretty cool it's pretty cool to go back over there and you know if it wasn't by the way that the school has our curriculum furnish it on the streets are on that\nBus see that's how you doing just that easy one end of the world needs more cowboys I liken this is the day Ramsey show\n\n\nAnd\nWhy in the world would you trust some random guy in a Q when getting your mortgage you really think he cares about your longer ... doesn't those\nCompanies care about getting you into whatever home loan programs that are pushing that week when it comes to ordering a cheeseburger the meal deal works fine but let's get real people were talking about the largest investment you'll probably ever make so don't be naive and trust in order taker pressures you into a pre packaged alone\nMy friends at Churchill mortgage I'm In helping my listeners for over twenty five years\nI Know it feels like it's ... times down but we said get out because you feel defeated he felt like you have all these talk messages that everybody telling you that you can't do it the culture telling you you're always going to have that student loan or they're always going to have that house payment that we said get up\nWe say work your butt off one job may not be enough and then you might need a second job you might need a third job ... and then last but not least we say tell your story\nShaun I think she can fill in or if I'm not here\nShe's got a doll that have had\nPets are about Iran's oil\nSo honored and I'm so proud of you are you guys are just impressive rock stars meant well done well done well done\nWe've got a copy of course organs retire inspired book for you that's the next chapter in your story making this kind of money with no debt millionaires about twenty minutes now a pretty incredible and outrageously generous as you go along and you're already leaving the classes and all that and sharing your story and that's a\nSign of the cheaper to generosity already on your so say mantle done very well done proud of you guys are cute man I was so proud of your well done\nMan you can do it\nAll and Maria dollars taxes on the board thousand dollars but all in thirty six months making a hundred and forty to or to eat\nWhat Sarah ...

car\nTo the dealership or at this point do just keep the vehicle or none of the above\nLet me take her car back that you own money on or signed a lease on that's effectively a voluntary repossession and that that would be dumb because they're going to sell the car after they've repossessed it and the other an already possession lot and then they're going to sue you for the difference\nIf you don't pay them the difference of media\nAnd you don't have the different she goes you're broke so I don't know that would be a dumb idea we're not going to do that [noise] um what we are going to do is find out two pieces of information one is called the car fleece company that you are paying the ... to ...\nAnd find out what the early buyout on the car is\nNow the early buyout is different than

find\n... four thousand dollars in the home and you sell the car for sixteen you've got to put four thousand dollars cash with the sixteen in\nOrder to get the title for the\nUm you have to have that other four thousand dollars to be able to cover the whole picture and the amount that you are upside down\nIn the way you would do that is obviously alone and so you start working with your local credit union with your local bank and you get a loan lined up for the amount but you're upside down and you put the car up for sale and you sell the car\nFor as much as you can possibly get for which is more than they will show at four in the report a lot to the bottom line is you're going to be responsible for this difference either way but the differences greater and you do more damage to your life and lose more control of your life by doing a repossession and so\nYou cover the difference cover the amount that you're upside down with another loan and I'd rather be four thousand dollars in debt than twenty four thousand dollars in debt or whatever the numbers are\nSo um they rooms utility to borrow money no diversity is telling you to move some of the dead and get rid of the majority of

weapons throughout the world and of course it starts with both Russia and\nUh the United states I think that a President Trump is pragmatic he he does want to you know kind of get the rhetoric lower uh not only with the Russians but with the Chinese now people argue well was he doing with this trade war and and like\nWell he's representing if you look at the national security strategy and the national defense strategy that were published in the last year\nHe is trying to make sure that people understand America is first he's not going to sit back and see other countries take advantage of it is but at the same time he does want stability he does want in the tensions but at the same time it's very high today for a variety of reasons\nWell let's pay the China you mentioned the trade wars\nAre ... and how people need to appreciate how this trade war strategy or terrorists\nOr against China is is not just economics it's also national security and that if I Would argue if we don't engage in this trade war now\nWe're going to have to end up fighting on the battlefield later is this and it tends to weaken China significantly economically so that they can't uh\nA cheese military supremacy over the United states\nWell clearly we have as the number one and number two\nEconomic powers in the world there is a lot of competition but there's a lot of commonality a lot of mutual interest to keep both economy's going along and the Chinese and the in the last year or so I have seen somewhat of a ...\nYou know there is what six and a half percent growth and the last quarter which is down over the previous quarters [noise] uh but the fact is that we need one another\nAnd yet if we continue to allow them to take jobs to manipulate and our businesses and Robert intellectual property in and Trump says while we're losing something like three hundred billion dollars of intellectual property to\nChinese and not only cyber attacks but through your company the company relationship and company to state relationship with Beijing then that's a national security issue he makes it very clear and the national security strategy that\nYou know economics is\nNational security we can't afford to lose jobs we\nGo to China and so he's trying to level the playing field he wants a fair playing field arguably president and chief said much the same but from a very different position so\nAre there hopefully going to meet within the month maybe and Argentina will see and if they do maybe we can get kind of movement in the right direction I Know the Chinese media is is trying to figure out Trump and just like the\nAmbassador to Washington from Beijing said on Fox News this past weekend they can't figure him out and I think that's to the Americans advantage you always want to keep\nYour opponent you're adversary or even your friends to a certain degree guessing and Mr Trump certainly does\nThis or do you call it an alliance of evil yeah between the Russians and the Chinese and perhaps there are other uh components to this Islamic terrorism perhaps but in terms of ... the Russians and the Chinese becoming a bed may is is driven by\nIdeology in any way or are there still vestiges of a communist ideology here or is this simply about hedging many\nWell it was a combination of things I I don't it's not as simple as communism versus liberal democracy as it was I Would argue during the old Cold War\nA potent for his own ideology is about order and bringing jobs back to Russia bringing confidence in where the nation is as opposed to what they would call and a moral west\nA and the things that they represent they paint the wife says what Hollywood is spewing all over the world and they said you don't want that in fact\nYou know putting is is famous for embracing Christianity and family values and\nAnd and the things that you know used to resonate in the United states in the fifties so\nHe you know even though we thought were carrying a he still is perceived widely as a leader of the common man in the in Russia and as a result there's a lot of confidence in him that he has adversaries but\nYou know it was just this week\nYou had you know a gentleman by the name of Valerie ... who is the chairman for the Russians constitutional court who even started to you know hand\nAt perhaps we ought to amend our constitution much like the Chinese did this past year and allow potent in this case to serve\nBeyond twenty twenty four because he was just elected of course uh yeah this past march [noise] you know they're beginning to see that we need longevity and we need to have the capability to\nAh keep the momentum going in and they feel confident that putting his doing that much as the Chinese are feeling confident and president Xi is well\nYou're not exactly painting potent as an evil adversary and yet the ... the title of the book is alliances evil so why why should we aside from the fact that the Russians have a vast nuclear arsenal\nWhy should we be fearing ... and an alliance with China\nWell what they're doing is they're weaponized seen everything against us you know if you look at political ... predatory economics strategic extortion\nInformation warfare um covert action you know I I could go through every one of those Richard and there was a long history and in fact in alliance of evil I go through six\nAnd our lives and they like blinking red light and they suggest very strongly that yes we're representing their interest in Russia and China are collaborating just like the\nRussian prime ministers I'm In a Russian Chinese leaders have been meeting here recently in their parents ministers just met you for your time over the top\nSorry for the interruption I got to jump in here will pick this up on the

com\n[noise]\n\nLieutenant colonel Robert McGinnis the author of alliance of evil Russia China the United states and a new Cold War has the mystery of the end times finally arrived who do you perceive us the greater threat right now to the United States Russia or China\nImmediate threat Richard is Russia a given their provocation but also a their military capability or which they're not shy to exercise around the globe\nWhopper ration demo Richardson\nHas said recently we were in the fourth battle of the Atlantic the first one was in World War one Second World war two the old Cold War with the third one or the Russians have put in place a nuclear submarine and\nAnd I ... a diesel powered submarines that are just as capable almost as certainly hours not only in the Atlantic but Mediterranean and elsewhere\nAnd of course they're confronting us militarily and in the air or they're back off our coastlines\nAre they're very aggressive in terms of cyber as we know all about the allegations and in justifiably are the sanctions put in place because of their interference in the twenties sixteen election\nAnd here recently or in the twenty Eighteen mid term we arrested a someone of course this was a Chinese person in Belgium you know these sorts of things are not to be ignored or the Russians are bellicose and they're\nYou know claims against us and to a certain degree uh we're pushing back you know President Trump's not a backing down and that\nAnd given that there's you know some given some take but maybe it's not a favoring an outcome that uh is going to suit is all\nAh and then of course you joined that with what's going on with the Chinese and perhaps in the south China Sea East China sea and of course their belt and road strategy ... an issue all over the world where they're buying up infrastructure and using that as a\nWay of planting their People's Liberation army capabilities you know literally across the globe you know do I say Russia is more dangerous now China is certainly the long term more dangerous adversary\nWhile we vanquished the former Soviet Union economically we brought them to their knees or they have an economy which is what their GDP about the size of Texas now why why couldn't we do that again with another arms race\nWell we are in an arms race or I mentioned earlier the hyper sonic or weapons is\nA potent puts forward keep in mind you know you're right there GDP is miniscule compared to ours um but they hide a lot of the stuff so it's not really as obvious as one would think in terms of how much they're really plowing into their capabilities\nAnd he said this week you know we have these capabilities\nAnd our experts don't contest that yes they are working on capabilities and they probably will feel them and the and the near future\nAnd are they willing to use it as well put and says you know he's not going to be the first to use nuclear weapons even though you know there is a strategy called escalate to de escalate which isn't there twenty Fifteen doctrine that in fact they might use a tactical nuclear weapons which is\nWhy the U.S Congress or in the national defense authorization act twenty Nineteen uh wants to fund a new counter to\nAh that to provide us a tactical capability in Europe so you've got all these kind of flood arena around there I I Would say right now because of the capabilities that Russia is posing against NATO\nOr and they of course the more strategic capability that he's been modernizing with his platforms and his uh weapons\nUh that they're the the mere threat in the long term threatened and especially if they collaborate as they are as I pointed out earlier with defense ministers consistently meeting and you mentioned the Vostok twenty Eighteen joined exercise which is going to be an ambulance\nAnd demonstrate that these two nations are pushing back against the former yeah dominance that we had across the world and arguably you know you can come up with the conclusion I think that\nPerhaps were not as dominant perhaps we are weakening or certainly up until the ah the Trump Administration came in and started to refuel our defense industry\nA and our Pentagon to have capabilities that we were really bleeding a and therefore we're not able to stand toe to toe with the rising Chinese\nMilitary and of course\nThough not as big as the former Soviet Union the Russians have capabilities that are clearly we don't have and they were trying to catch up with even now\nLet me ask you about NATO article five course the cornerstone of the the North Atlantic Treaty Organization an attack on one member of NATO was an attack on all of its members should we really go to war with Russia is let's say they roll tanks across the stony and border we want to go to war maybe World War three over ...\nWell that's a that's why you know Trump has been over there you know trying to shake them up saying you've got to spend more\nAnd you know you know even the idea of accepting Macedonia we already have twenty nine members to we need to all these other little countries\nYou know might Russia going in and and disturbed that country and then as you're right we could clear article five and we have to go to war now there's only been one a declaration of course that was two thousand and one when we were attacked a\nYou know in New York and Washington and Pennsylvania and and the light can we declared war on terror and we're all over the place to include Afghanistan et cetera so [noise]\nUm no I I don't think that we should you know jump at that and I think that's what is in the back of Trump's mind says you know I'm not sure I Want to throw my entire nation's\nCapability and wealth and and statue in future into the hands of these little tiny nations need that may not have the wherewithal not only to push back against the Russians but to a you know make these tough decision so\nThat I think is very much on the forefront that's what John Bolton perhaps it's going to talk to his counterpart in Claremont next week\nAnd certainly you know the defense ministers are are talking that I Know the general Dunford was just over at his counterparts than NATO and\nAnd he was saying look you folks you've got to wake up and he said yeah they are waking up to the threat posed by Russia [noise] uh but we as a nation you certainly the United states\nAnd I had better make it very clear that if if we can't back\nA an article five declaration by even one of these little tiny countries that are threatened Lithuania Estonia or even pollen which is a really a very concerned about the Russian Bear and what they might do perhaps similar to what they did with Ukraine\nThese are all issues of great a magnitude that um we've got to decide and thus far we haven't backed out of NATO but perhaps that's something we need to rethink\nUs to talk about China um we've been hearing all about Russian collusion in elections and so forth are Nikki Haley the UN ambassador\nAnd the president has accused the Chinese of of meddling in\nThe mid mid term elections uh there's obviously a huge amount of economic integration with China in the United states I'm the big concern as I see it again comes back to cyber warfare and all these talks about a Chinese made computer chips income\nOr even in US military equipment talked me about the series the seriousness of that threat\nWhile it is a very serious threat in fact over the last year and certainly at the Pentagon you know the\nDefense secretary Jim Mattis a without a mandate say look\nYou know even in these Chinese made yeah phones you know who you were not going to sell them in our\nIn our post exchanges are you know our our stores uh we're not going to buy certain items because we're suspect\nThat the Chinese have\nAnd somehow and put chips and these devices that can turn on and transmit information that we don't want to lose so it's not only impacting individuals' it's impacting institution and of course you're right you know we're in bed with the Chinese on all sorts of economic\nThis service is free and you can get answers to your questions regarding Medicare

are staring a new dual Cold War in the face and could lead to events that open the door for a biblical times we'll get to all that in the moment just to remind also at the top of the next hour\nAre

the coast to coast am where I went master shot a lot of shore as posted that\nThere are a patriots and other fads to a Russian as four hundred a that's why yeah there's a it's a non ... we just won't do it\nAnd that is a major um bone of contention and of course that there are others even though we've tried to maintain good relations with the Turks\nAnd up until now uh you know subsequent to the Nineteen thirties when Ataturk tried to secular rise that nation a air to one is doing just the opposite trying to radicalize it with his Islamic viewpoint and trying to return to the granddaughter of the Ottoman Empire\nA so NATO no I I don't think that they should be a member of NATO in NATO such a complex\nThing for us today as we mentioned in the last hour uh because you know anyone could call for an article five say you know the Russians are picking on me please come to my rescue or do we want to be tethered in the future war world to that well\nYou know we have that alliance and they keep in mind I have no doubt that the Russians and the Chinese\nAre just you know very tight now out of necessity\nThey don't want to be contained by us and I don't know that we can contain them\nUm but they want to form their own little alliance and to a certain degree this belt and road strategy of president Xi around the world and collaboration with the Russians and military exercises this is all painting the picture where you can see a divided world emerging\nA so to abandon NATO even though it has all sorts of you know warts and problems with it at this point might not be well advised but certainly allowing turkey into our secrets and tour\nSystems with a Russian made air defense system is not a good idea either\nFar from it for me to to um stand up for the house of Saud by\nA given that so much of the narrative of the ... murder has come from the Turks and also cutter or another sort of sworn enemy of Saudi Arabia is it possible do you think there's anything to the the idea that that cutter turkey are trying to\nDrive a wedge between the United states and uh there's there are their allies the Saudis with is\nCourse you know that's a sort of thing that you know\nKind of the poker and the intern job political world that takes place all the time behind the scenes\nYou know who were the people that were in the [noise]\nYou know the Saudi embassy that night I suppose some details will eventually come out with the clandestine type of operations for one nation to another or perhaps not nation states but other activities\nTake place unfortunately all the time you know we're in a tight spot what can President Trump do he can sanction entities and individuals\nOr even if the show was you know\nDemonstrated to have been murdered as it would appear to be by a henchmen that were under the\nLeadership of saw him on don't know but that could be clearly we could cancel the arms deal but I mean we've been not only a hundred and ten billion it's far in excess of that\nAnd we have a lot of people on the ground working hand in glove with them but we risk a relationship\nWith a with the Saudis against Iran and of course the Saudis interestingly are aligned with Pakistan Pakistan has nuclear weapons um and the packs of course distance from us now aligned with the Chinese so\nFacts of any decision geopolitically and that part of the world uh otherwise you end up with no one that you can go to and work with and given your your vested interests and of course the the human situation we've been helping them a great deal there ria Riyadh government\nAnd trying to battle the who tease others of course the Iranians through proxies in that part of the world um [noise] I Wish it were simple it's not simple uh the world's divided\nAnd of course as we see this when I called the alliance of evil Russia and China and using the mechanisms behind the scenes to variety of proxies not just the north Koreans from Iranians but others\nI think on a era one is going to be one of those proxies to certain degree even though he would like to think that he can rule the the Muslim world um I think the Chinese have a better idea for him\nA ... if you were in John Bolton supposition you had the president's ear who knows maybe you do or what would you be advising have how is this how do we counteract this how do we step back from the brink of of war\nWell I I Do believe tumble and we'll talk onto his counterpart about renewing new start which expires in twenty Twenty one we've got to do that it's in neither country's best interest to not have a an agreement that isn't for civil the problem is\nAnd the Russians notice that a Nineteen eighty seven I enough treaty was was violated a with their own cruise missiles and uh you know they probably will admit that behind the scenes or you know we've done a lot of in the open so I I think that will will get something I Know that\nYou know they had was from Trump asked for you met with putting in Helsinki in July that you know they did talk about that issue and potent surreal is you know yeah he he has grandiose ideas about the fact that he can meet with the world leader ah on the west Trump\nYou know in the eyes of the the Russian people means that they are great power again and of course you know putting his meetings with President Xi on a frequent basis just solidifies that viewpoint so if I were both ... and I I'm ... you know I I've I've talked to John Bolton before and so I\nI kind of have a sense that that's what he's going to do you know he's a real pragmatist he is a tough guy and but he does have the president's ear and I think that that's a that's going to be the top of the agenda and of course uh he'll probably try to deal with the issues in Syria um and with\nAir to won a fan of course uh the Iranians the Iranians are our problem for Israel\nUh we we have no question I think after Netanyahu revealed months ago you know those volumes and volumes of evidence regarding their nuclear programs\nUm we don't acknowledge a lot of things but I suspect that uh you know there's good reason to believe the Iranians are up to no good\nIf there weren't any regime regime change in in Iran and and hopefully that'll come about by the Iranian people\nAre just getting fed up with the situation with and chasing the mullahs out of there if Iran were to become a secular non align nation or you know again leaning to the west as they did for many many decades\nHow would that change the situation because obviously what's going on in Syria is it's not about a civil war it's about a proxy war and it's about Iran so Iran has regime change\nWell if you don't have the ayatollah running you know the [noise] you know the military and their diplomacy or you\nKnow for to\nPromote their their sheer world view a and the autocratic rule view of of the ... and I I think that you find that they're not involved with the who these are not involved with\nAssad or they are less involved with Russia accept because of economic interests and perhaps even to a certain degree with China [noise]\nUm [noise] and it's\nThe problem is the age old tension between the Sunni and Shia and Riyadh in Tehran is going to continue um but it it if they're not involved in you know in fueling terrorism such as has ... in\nSouthern Lebanon and you know encouraging Hamas and\nAnd Palestine and so forth and [noise]\nYou know we'll have an easier way in that part of the world we can we can work with them a heavy rains are wonderful people are very bright capable Persian people and they have a long history I Would hope that they will\nReplace their autocrats with people that are have a a more a better sense of history and were were they ought to be going but we're not going to eliminate all the tension unfortunately\n[noise] well another follow from that are positive aspect of that might be a liberalizing Saudi Arabia because before the Iranian Revolution I think Saudi Arabia was far more liberal but the the habits were sort of seen as a counter measures to the she influenced so maybe we'll see\nSome positive effect Sen in Saudi Arabia is well here's ... van Morrison taking us into the break with the band low stairway will open up the phone lines questions and comments for lieutenant colonel Robert McGinnis when coast to coast continues right after this\nLieutenant colonel Robert McGinnis is witness before we go to the phones a Bob let me ask you\nThe last three years while protecting into next year\nThe Trump Administration is earmarked ... trucks mentally to point to a to point three billion dollars increase defense spending we had seven hundred and sixty billion a couple of years ago seven hundred and five I think last year in another seven hundred coming up this year\nA ... is is that enough I mean a lot of that obviously is going to salaries and so forth but is it enough\nYou know half of it you're right does go to the salaries and that's why people often say well gosh you know you know how can\nThe Russians and the Chinese beat such an adversary and competitive with us while they hide most of what they're spending on their own national security you know the answer is uh we'll see\nUm the concern is here this past week the president came and said we're going to all parts of the U.S government must ... five percent well we went through this sequester ration period in which had just crippled our readiness our ability to go out and trained to be ready to fight to replace\nYou know with the new aircraft are these\nAntiques that we're trying to fly around the world the same thing was ships and it's an incredibly expensive\nTo have an armed forces and you know it reminded me of of something that a Ronald Reagan said you know and this was obviously a few years ago and basically says that\nIf you want to be free you have to be willing basically to to pay the price and the price in this case is to have a modern armed forces nobody's going to see to contest well today we're being contested\nA serious way on all fronts by a both China and Russia especially combined a fierce form in the new alliance\nAnd so if we don't sustain as you know the chiefs of staff and the and the chairman of the joint chiefs General Joe Dunford if we don't sustained the investment in long term capabilities\nUh then we're going to fall behind were already falling behind in terms of hyper sonics and artificial intelligence or even in any investment in our our blue water navy uh\nUh the last couple of years have been great it's only putting it on our rights glide path if we can sustain it\nLet's say say hello to the west of the Rockies in Las Vegas good evening good morning Steve welcome to coast to coast Dana\nThank you very much a Robert you were talking about the\nChinese tapping our electronics for information or I'm really concerned about is what if the Chinese have programmed an end date into all of these electronic chips so that everything shuts down at the same time some time in the future\nYou know it's it sounds a little paranoid but I think it's very feasible and that's really a something major that could happen\nQuick question Steve is that possible Bob\n[noise] well I'm not an electronics are no expert however I Do\nUnderstand the question and I share that concern a and that's something that I think that\nTerry a is concerned about that\nThings like that could undermine the complexity of our systems and if we get a programmable and reversible inundated electronics aboard our satellites or missiles or aircraft\nOr ships and it's and so forth and we could find that this could be catastrophic so\nYou know I I think there's plenty of caution today a there's a wakeup call across or certainly the U.S military and I think our allies are are joining that understanding that this is a very new world that we're facing\nAnd we have to be very careful of\nOf the type of equipment that we do embrace and so this is I don't think it's out of the possibility\nIt reminds me of um winter in the U.S spy plane that held in ... was held in China for some time\nUh I think there was maybe a near collision involved and and I'm I'm just wondering is that it it that might be what we're talking about here perhaps it was it was ... it landed there because of being hacked into somehow\nYou know well you know that's the sort of thing that we are very concerned about a cyber battleground of cyber as a woman before that I point out an alliance of evil and\nGo into great detail is two and not only the threat\nOf taking down our own infrastructure a hacking into our elections and doing all sorts of things that uh we hear about every day\nAnd this is an existential threat to us and in fact when you look at the president's strategy and he says that there's a there's a possibility that we would respond to\nA cyber attack a with a nuclear weapon that's how serious it is today\nA and yet you know there's so much we don't know so you know could somewhat takedown it aircraft because they take down a satellite takedown of Los Angeles I think all that is possible or if we don't put fire walls and

that we would do unless we perceive that the threat was a against\nOur key allies and against our interest in those five claims that you know the he go from the west will come upon the whole face the earth of all not touch the ground\nAnd it will destroy the ram that has the two horns and said the the ladder horn is the bigger that comes up less than the first one would be Iraq that's already been conquered but the last time that comes up will be destroyed and claimed that no one will help\nAnd says that you know a a nation that comes from the west will not touchy to brown which means it's going to be a naval or an air force\nA pack or Iran is you know a huge country and that and uh but it's also states that no one will come to her aid\nAh and I find that kind of interesting since it has you know alliances with a we're actually North Korea China and uh uh Russia\nIt was a dual application prophecy also uh I Know Alexander the great a Congress but he did not use or anything but an infantry a probably a column a hundred and some yards wide they're not covered the whole earth as being a law explained in this prophecy so\nAh and actually it also mentions that he goes I'm from the

the direction of extra Jesus in terms of you know what's the context of that particular scripture [noise] I have not studied Daniel aid to the degree that Don or would\nYou know benefit from an analysis of that so I I really can't answer the question though I Would say that yeah\nIt's not my experience that our chiefs of the armed forces are terribly a biblical illiterate and therefore are in tune with a Bible prophecy I'm not that they shouldn't be but I just don't get the sense that they are and certainly the material I read doesn't suggest that they have\nA Susan is on the wild card

[noise]\nI'm not a young person in a [noise] and I've been in this country and uh haven't went anywhere around the world and all I have never left the country and it seems extremely obvious to

go defend our our country's freedom and a charm military\nUh in our military really is and our military anymore as far as I'm concerned it seems obvious that we're not really in control of our government anymore it seems very um yes and uh it seems like a people in a you know\nUber America's was you know in the fifty cents for each case and ah they've lost touch with me I Would they didn't lose touch it just it was never a savvy to them or what came before them in a [noise]\nA a you know I'm not a country his opened up prisons around the world can ... people\nI Know that's not an

a\nRichard wants to leave my meal\nHere said you're fading out on me again Tom so I'm I'm I'm Sorry I'm going to have to I'll respond but then I'm going to have to want to thank you for the call [noise] well before Kennedy was McKinley and there was Garfield and there was Lincoln and there were\nMultiple attempts on other presidents um I don't know that that\nCertainly something changed since Kennedy [noise] um but has much changed I think once\nThe United states\nAre sort of grew up in matured and became a major player certainly after the civil war or after the first World War and began to engage in multilateral trade organizations\nAnd um then all of those things that some of the founding fathers sort of warned against foreign entanglements I think is what they called they called it a this these sorts of\nUm games dirty wars and so forth are almost inevitable when you become entangled in in uh in other countries' business and and you put yourself out there or\nYou end up fighting wars on foreign land so that those wars don't visit upon your own soil\nAnd yes it's it's nasty and it's dirty but one thing that the United states has I think that most other countries that don't have and that is the power of redemption\nI'm I'm a Canadian so I'm a bit of an inch or low over but I have strong emotional ties to the United states and I believe strongly in the idea of the United states and I believe in American exceptionalism\nHasn't been fulfilled perhaps the way we'd like it for the United states\nInvolved if you talk about to lend day in Chile and the overthrow the government in ... in Iran and in in the in Nineteen fifty three and in Guatemala and so forth\n[noise] just doesn't kill you to the United states most other countries that have the kind of a power and responsibility\nAt the United states has they do the same thing but they\nDon't reflect upon those so it was dark chapters in their history the way the United states does they don't talk about it on public forums they can't they're not allowed and there was no redemption\nAt least in the United states that exists\nWe reflect we're right we Sean and we try to make ourselves better and I think we should all be thankful for that Tom thank you for your call a Doug is Easter the Rockies in the great state of New Jersey Doug welcome\nThank you very much our either the thirty ... I'm well thank you\nI'm Glad to hear that I'm going to go a little bit off topic here um I Try to get some time ago um it was a guest host them so to so and ah they were talking about climate change in a warming and\nThe rising over the ocean now I'm not a a um you're not going to go either way with the pro or con on a global warning or anything like that\nBut uh they're talking about how the season the oceans are rising which are that is fact it is a measure of all they can tell that but I was wondering I've never heard anybody take into consideration water displacement\nEvery year we put billions upon billions upon billions of vessels in the water whether they be military whether it be Jain a multi ... a million dollar a a cruise ships\nSubmarines we're thinking I'm subways out here on the east coast to make artificial reefs were sinking old military now this is taking up space\nAnd uh I Know that Hawaii has been having a volcano that hasn't stopped for some time and that's also taken a while about taking of water but it's adding land\nAnd uh I I think if ah if anybody or you know of a needed against that you've a hat on or heard speak about this uh ever brought up the theory of water to this place\n[noise] uh\nNot that I'm I'm aware of um I I think the type of sea level\nRise that they're talking about is about you know the the the ... the ice melting that's in the water because you know what happens when when ice cubes melt in a glass of water doesn't overflow\nI'm Talking about bits of ice shelves breaking off and so forth but\nWater levels sea levels have been rising for a very long time or were wearing a kind of a trans glacial period we're coming out of an ice age we're still technically in and I say we have ice in the north and south poles we always we haven't always had ice at the north and south poles so\nIce is melting were coming out of a a a glacial period and water levels have been rising and will continue to rise and I think it's normal but water displacement will have someone on to talk about that thank you cat Stevens taking you send in the break with sitting here on coast to coast more open lines when we continue to\nAnd a welcome

terrible problem with my father as a picture of you with other little ones and not for the more of this and not go on what this was going to go on for years and decades and decades hundreds of years\nAnd I can't go on and I thought the promise\nI looked at the pitcher couldn't believe it I have a milder today and I smiled and the father was saying to me it's not going to go on it's going to end if people just don't\nThey are they're going to be standing in place will join us we are going to be standing or laying are sitting in their place and uh they're not going to know that this comes

have said China and Russia to hold out Iran of course the satellite state and they said you are going to bow down to us\nAnd you are going to expect our way you're there except or corporation and all of our norms are those are going to be a war\nAnd called me yesterday most American you have to when he said if you did you catch that Richard when he said Russians when the war comes if we get a tax

conscious um [noise]\nIt's a a super conscious mind that's what's soul is in the very high state ah as for the process of crossing over usually people come to a gate a gateway and are they are met either by their guide or maybe a family member\nUm if they don't cross over a they will either told to go back or maybe they may talk to someone and they usually come back into the body you know near that\nNone of full death experience but there are books written about life between lives his which I Do live between allies [noise] although most people don't do that they don't call on me to help them do that they rather do some hailing were\nAnd some of the things that we do is work with angels and arcane rules and they're healers and sometimes they're guides\nSo as far as uh do we do we\nHave a do we continue to live yes we do\nA more importantly we can experience happened we can experience what it's like the crossover would out dying by going through some kind of spiritual

experience and um when people feel a presence when they're at the gate is usually the light of heaven and yes they do people well within this light a when they go through the what we call the gateway\nUm and you start to acclimate yourself in that world\nAnd um the there's a lot of a ... communication so there's no\nFacade so to speak is no lying because people know each other you know they know who you are to do well at the soul level because you're so right on\nJoe let me ask you a couple of questions do you believe in reincarnation\nTop I work with that a law All right well how

quadruple bypass surgery\nAnd he was\nThe doctors were telling my mom her brother and sister that it's time that is probably not coming back he's in a coma that there's really not that they could do his heart is that you guys need to consider pulling the plug while my mother was\nThe one that took care of everything and the family so it was her decision whether to let him live on life support or let him go well she made that decision\nAnd to let go\nAnd her brothers and sisters have been mad at her her whole entire life over there that he wasn't it was done with that their dad was gone but he told me to for everything for her\nAnd you didn't know this about what had transpired with your mom and your and your grandfather\nNo I had no idea I'm forty one years old I was probably seven team a team fan and I I don't know I don't remember any of that was never cold 'cause I Know my grandpa was in the hospital I remember being in the hospital but I don't I was never told anything about that\nRemark I had were accurate is\nFailing yeah yes so super on that I I I Wish I could do it all over again and asking more questions I'll just step awesome awesome experience as\nWell here's hoping here's hoping you don't get the chance for very long time Curtis thank you for that call halfway thank you so much like really pretty sure that's\nAll right uh Ghana the wild card line TJ is in Minnesota hello TJ\nGood morning good morning\nI've I've got I'm curious a lot of callers on a lot of shows have been talking about you know all the drama and pour me\nAnd I do have a a near death experience as well but we can go into and that's created a lot of issues for myself but\nI I I struggle to understand what happened to humanity\nI mean\nThe war and everything I mean we're uh we're human race and that's going to be just the way it is\n\nWhat is it going to take to fix that and I have become sensitive after a suicide attempt in two thousand\nAnd\nSo I understand there's another side so we can take the conversation and a number of ...\nYeah but you and your death teaching\nI made a mistake in two thousand I've lost my family I'm Out war veteran a disabled war veteran\nAnd ah when that happened and I walked myself up from the outside who is trying to be gentle that way I I Walk my cell phone from the outside and now I experience\nA lot of things that most people can't see or hear and so it's a big comical is\nReally complicated so you have developed you believe psychic abilities as a result if you're near death experience\nUm I I wouldn't call them psychic I Believe I Would rather lean towards a being a sensitive okay\nAnd what sort of things are you sensitive to\nI can tell when somebody's around that can I can hear the voices I can see I've got videos of them to prove that I'm not an accurate I have pictures of them to prove I'm not an accurate\nAnd recordings I'm I'm a big fan of coast to coast and and I've I've gotten a lot of the products that coast to coast has\nChilling effect well thank you for importing are sponsors for absolutely and and I did it just to prove I wasn't crazy because I thought I was going crazy yeah I'll bet yeah yeah it's it's tough to deal with like\nLike ah\nThere's TV shows you know that that Long Island medium and and other TV shows and uh so I started doing that and it it really isn't something I don't think most people want to do\nYou're talking about communication with the dead\nYeah it's not something that you want to do on a regular basis\nUm once once as well if it doesn't stop\nWouldn't be my cup of tea no so you can't shut you can't turn it off\nI don't know how to turn it on or turn it off right either way\nI Know they are the spirits are they trying or they do they want something from you do they want you to do they want your help\nCommunication with other people and when that happens it scares the heck out of all\nYou see fallen aberrations or do you just feel their presence\nUm all all of the above and it scares the heck out of everybody else around me and it's real it's a real deal\nI just not sure how to perfect that\nLike everybody else does I it's a\nIt's a tough situation\nHow bad I Can't imagine so you're just walking around let's say you're in the grocery store and all of a sudden someone who is passed on will\nApproach you in the freezer Ireland and say here here I Am I Want you to I Want you to contact my wife or my daughter or or would it ...\nIt's ironic you put it that way because one of the five or six times that it's happened it was in a grocery store with exactly that case yes that is\nThat is weird and and when you see them or if you see a full an aberration I'm you know I'm thinking of of um the six ...\nTotal total know total human form a writer\nSee them as little as the so do you see them like you know if they had a violent death do you see them\nSort of thing or um\nI have\nI have and I know that it went through a struggle without question yes sure I got to answer that question yes\nYeah that would be pretty hard to do that would be pretty hard to take a while\nAnd went to jail have you ever did it all started after I tried to kill myself and I

coming up an hour is one and two lieutenant colonel Robert McGinnis or as we say up here in cannot stand left tenet colonel Robert McGinnis retired he says America is locked in a new kind of dual Cold War with the Russians and the Chinese\nThe Russian Federation under a populist opted authoritarian leader seriously threatens the west through cyberspace and military uh thanks to that country's heavy investment in sophisticated mass killing weapons\nThe People's Republic of China\nIs a great power with global ambitions led by a new kind of communist leader focused on rapidly growing use nation economically and militarily and together China and Russia collaborate to dominate our future and that pseudo alliance could well become\nThe catalyst that leads to the prophetic and times\nLieutenant colonel Robert McGinnis author of alliance of evil is here for hours one and two\nHours three and four and let's see what shall we do I thought maybe we could exchange some veal recipes because there's absolutely nothing going on right\nI I actually remember slow new date news days back in the nineties when we would sit around and say wow there's nothing going on well that certainly isn't the case these days\nWhen was the last time we had a slow news day open lines in the last half hour of this audio transmission of course there's the murder of Saudi journalist ... there are migrants on the march ...\nAh that's something that I Know when Mr Yeltsin or the new president after Gorbachev stepped down came to this country met with Bush at Camp David\nWe had the opportunity to do more than just give them a few crumbs we could have brought them into the fold and I think that that really is you indicate ... you know fuel the rise of Vladimir potent\nAnd you know potent of course has captured the imagination of the Russian people and as a direct result\nAs you know really fueled\nNationalism and patriotism in a way that um they're somewhat um I Would argue blind to perhaps with the west is looking at because\nThey want to rise again they want to be a great power again ah and they do have them the means through their nuclear arsenal and of course I'm putting you know here even this week when he was down and so she was arguing that\nYou know we have a modern weapons systems\nThat really a push against the emergent and they're very capable west and he talked about the Auburn guard a twenty time speed of found a nuclear capable go anywhere breakthrough any a defense system\nWeapon system a hyper sonic weapon system much like what the Chinese are working on the Russians are really for to find themselves they're pushing back\nThey are concerned about NATO and we did violate a the initials trust that we wouldn't push against them we did and so we find herself in a very dangerous position today\nBut also president Xi in China\n[noise] how much has the narrative of Russian collusion handcuffs the Trump Administration into perhaps\nSmoothing over relations pulling his back from the brink if you will because now\nBecause everyone is seeing a I'm a Russian under their bed in the closet in the White House\nUm that he has to he has to appear almost overly aggressive against the Russians how much has this this Russian collusion narrative endangered American national security\nWell I think that it has and in fact potent said once again this week that he believes that Trump clearly wants to stabilize and improve U.S Russian ties\nYou know when they met together\nAnd he'll think he this July uh they talked about a host of issues now of course all those are a an not out in the open because president's talking confidence about things of concerned but one of the things he talked about was ridiculed production of nuclear weapons throughout the world and of course it starts with both Russia and\nThe United states I think that a President Trump is pragmatic he he does want to you know kind of get the rhetoric lower uh not only with the Russians but with the Chinese now people argue well what's he doing with this trade war in in like\nWell he's representing if you look at the national security strategy and the national defense strategy that were published in the last year\nHe is trying to make sure that people understand America is first he's not going to sit back and see other countries take advantage of it is but at the same time he does want stability he does want to get in the tensions but at the same time it's very high today for a variety of reasons\nSo let's pivot to China and you mentioned the trade wars\nAre ... and how people need to appreciate how this trade war strategy or terrorists\nUh against China is is not just economic it's also national security and that if I Would argue if we don't engage in this trade war now\nWe're going to have to end up fighting on the battlefield later is this and it tends to weaken China significantly economically so that they can't uh\nCheese military supremacy over the United states\nWell clearly we have as the number one and number two economic powers in the world there is a lot of competition but there's a lot of commonality a lot of mutual interest to keep both economy's going along\nAnd the Chinese and the in the last year or so have seen somewhat of a ...\nYou know there is what six and a half percent growth and the last quarter which is down over the previous quarters [noise] uh but the fact is that we need one another\nAnd yet if we continue to allow them to take jobs to manipulate and our businesses and Robert intellectual property in and Trump says while we're losing something like three hundred billion dollars of intellectual property to\nChinese and not only cyber attacks but through your company to company relationship and company to state relationship with Beijing then that's a national security issue he makes it very clear and the national security strategy that\nYou know economics is\nNational security we can't\nOur wealth go to China and so he's trying to level the playing field he wants a fair playing field arguably president chief said much the same but from a very different position so are there hopefully going to meet within the month maybe in Argentina and we'll see\nAnd if they do maybe we can get kind of movement in the right direction I Know the Chinese media is is trying to figure out\nTrump and it just like the\nAmbassador to Washington from Beijing said on Fox News this past week and they can't figure him out and I think that's to the Americans advantage you always want to keep\nYour opponent you're adversary or even your friends to a certain degree guessing and Mr Trump certainly does\nThis do you call it an alliance of evil yeah between the Russians and the Chinese and perhaps there are other\nUh components to this Islamic terrorism perhaps but in terms of ... the Russians and the Chinese becoming a bed may is is driven by ideology in any way or are there still vestiges of\nA communist ideology here or is this simply about hedging many\nWell it was a combination of things I I don't it's not as simple as communism versus liberal democracy as it was I Would argue during the old Cold War\nA potent for his own ideology is about order and bringing jobs back to Russia bringing confidence and we're the nation is as opposed to what they would call and a moral west\nAh and the things that they represent they paint the wife says what Hollywood is spewing all over the world and they said you don't want that in fact a potent as is famous for embracing Christianity and family values and\nAnd the things that you know used to resonate in the United states in the fifties so\nHe you know even though we thought were carrying a he still is perceived widely as a leader of the common man in the ... in Russia and as a result there's a lot of confidence in him that he has adversaries but you know it was just this week\nYou had you know a gentleman by the name of Valerie ... who is the chairman for the Russia's constitutional court who even started to you know hand\nAt perhaps we ought to amend the constitution much like the Chinese to this past year and allow potent in this case to serve\nBeyond twenty twenty four because he was just elected of course uh yeah this past march ... they're beginning to see that we need the longevity and we need to have the capability to\nAh keep the momentum going in and they feel confident that ... is doing that much as the Chinese are feeling confident and president Xi is well\nNot exactly painting potent as an evil adversary and yet the ... the title of the book is alliances evil so why why should we aside from the fact that the Russians have a vast nuclear arsenal\nWhy should we be fearing ... and an alliance with China\nWell what they're doing is they're weaponize eat everything against us you know if you look at political coercion predatory economics strategic extortion\nInformation warfare um covert action you know I I could go through every one of those Richard and there's a long history and in fact and\nAnd which those things just come out alive and they they like blinking red light and they suggest very strongly that yes they're representing their interests and in fact Russia and China are collaborating just like the\nRussian prime ministers have been a Russian Chinese leaders have been meeting

sixteen election and here recently or in the twenty Eighteen mid term we arrested\nA someone of course this was a Chinese person in Belgium and all these sorts of things are not to be ignored or the Russians are bellicose and they're\nYou know claims against us and to a certain degree uh we're pushing back you know President Trump's not a backing down and that\nAnd given that there's you know some given some take but maybe it's not a favoring an outcome that uh is going to suit is all\nAh and then of course you joined that with what's going on with the Chinese and perhaps in the south China Sea East China sea and of course their belt and road strategy ... an issue all over the world where they're buying\nUp infrastructure and using that as a way of planting their People's Liberation army capabilities now literally across the globe\nYou know do I say Russia is more dangerous now China is certainly the long term more dangerous adversary\nWe've anguished the former Soviet Union economically we brought them to their knees or they have an economy which is what their GDP about the size of Texas now why why couldn't we do that again was another arms race\nWell we are in an arms race or I mentioned earlier the hyper sonic or weapons as a potent puts forward keep in mind you know you're right there GDP is miniscule compared to ours um but they hide a lot of the stuff so it's not really as\nObvious as one would think in terms of how much they're really plowing into their capabilities\nAnd he said this week you know we have these capabilities\nAnd our experts don't contest that yes they are working on capabilities and they probably will feel them and the and the near future\nAnd are they willing to use it as well put and says you know he's not going to be the first to use nuclear weapons even though there is a strategy called escalate to de escalate which isn't there twenty Fifteen doctrine that in fact they might use a tactical nuclear weapons which is\nWhy the U.S Congress or in the national defense authorization act twenty Nineteen now wants to fund a new counter to\nAh that to provide us a tactical capability in Europe so you've got all these kind of flooding around there I I Would say right now because of the capabilities that Russia is posing against NATO\nOr and they of course the more strategic capability that he's been modernizing with his platforms and his uh weapons\nUh that they're the the mere threat in the long term threatened and especially if they collaborate as they are as I pointed out earlier with defense ministers consistently meeting and you mentioned the Vostok twenty Eighteen joined exercise which is\nCaters to demonstrate that these two nations are pushing back against the former yeah dominance that we had across the world and arguably you know you can come up with the conclusion I think that\nUh perhaps were not as dominant perhaps we are weakening or certainly up until the ah the Trump Administration came in and started to refuel our defense industry a and our Pentagon to have capabilities that we were really bleeding a\nAnd therefore we're not able to stand toe to toe with the rising Chinese military and of course though not as big as the former Soviet Union the Russians have capabilities that clearly we don't have and then we're trying to catch up with even now\nLet me ask you about NATO article five course the cornerstone of the the North Atlantic Treaty Organization an attack on one member of NATO was an attack on all of its members should we really go to war with Russia if let's say they roll tanks across the stony and border we want to go to war maybe World War three over ...\nWell that that's why you know Trump has been over there you know trying to shake them up saying you've got to spend more\nAnd yet you know even the idea of accepting Macedonia we already have twenty nine members to we need to all these other little countries\nYou know might Russia going in and and disturbed that country and then as you're right we could clear article five and we have to go to war now there's only been one a declaration of course that was two thousand and one when we were attacked a\nYou know in New York and Washington and Pennsylvania and and the light can we declared war on terror and we're all over the place to include Afghanistan et cetera so [noise]\nUm no I I don't think that we should you know jump at that and I think that's what is in the back of Trump's mind says you know I'm not sure I Want to throw my entire nation's\nCapability and wealth and and statue in future into the hands of these little tiny nations name that may not have the wherewithal not only to push back against the Russians but to a you know make these tough decisions so\nThat I think is very much on the forefront that's what John Bolton perhaps is going to talk to his counterpart in criminal next week\nAnd certainly you know the defense ministers are are talking that I Know the general Dunford was just over at his counterparts than NATO and and he was saying look you folks you've got to wake up and he said yeah they are waking up to the threat posed by Russia [noise]\nUh but we as a nation you certainly the United states\nAnd I had better make it very clear that if\nIf we can't back a an article five declaration by even one of these little tiny countries that are threatened Lithuania Estonia or even pollen which is a you know really a very concerned about the Russian beer and what they might do perhaps similar to what they did with Ukraine\nThese are all issues of great a magnitude that um we've got to decide and thus far we haven't back on a NATO but perhaps that's something we need to rethink\nTalking about China um we've been hearing all about Russian collusion in elections and so forth are Nikki Haley the UN ambassador\nAnd the president has accused the Chinese of of meddling in\nThe mid mid term elections uh there's obviously a huge amount of economic integration with China in the United states I'm the big concern as I see it again comes back to cyber warfare and all these talks about a Chinese made ...\nBack door or even in US military equipment taught me about the series the seriousness of that threat\nWhile it is a very serious threat in fact over the last year and certainly at the Pentagon you know the\nDefense secretary Jim Mattis uh put out a mandate said look\nYou know even in these Chinese made yeah phones you know who you were not going to sell them in our\nIn our post exchanges are you know our our stores are we're not going to buy certain items because we're suspect\nThat the Chinese have\nAnd somehow and put chips in these devices that can turn on and transmit information that we don't want to lose so it's not only impacting individuals it's impacting the institution and of course you're right you know we're in bed with the Chinese on all sorts of economic\nHow about a three time unit for only four

suggesting the anomaly was some kind of anti or perhaps even a ghost you can read all about it see the video for yourself and the highlight carousel up the coast to coast am where a webmaster shot a lot of shore as posted that\nWe will not connect our patriots and other fads to a Russian S. four hundred a that's why yeah there's a it's a non ... we just won't do it and that is a major um bone of contention\nAnd of course there are others even though we've tried to maintain good relations with the Turks\nAnd up until now you know subsequent to the Nineteen thirties when editor tried to secular rise that nation a air to one is doing just the opposite trying to radicalize it with his Islam at a viewpoint and trying to return to the granddaughter of the Ottoman Empire\nA so NATO no I I don't think that they should be a member of NATO in NATO such a complex thing for us today as we mentioned in the last hour\nOr because you know anyone could you know call for an article five say you know the Russians are picking on me please come to my rescue or do we want to be tethered in the future war world to that well\nYou know we have that alliance and they keep in mind I have no doubt that the Russians and the Chinese\nAre just you know very tight now out of necessity\nThey don't want to be contained by us and I don't know that we can contain them\nBut they want to form their own little alliance and to a certain degree this belt and road strategy of president Xi around the world and collaboration with the Russians and military exercises this is all painting a picture where you can see a divided world emerging\nA so to abandon NATO even though it has all sorts of you know warts and problems with it at this point might not be well advised but certainly allowing to turkey into our secrets and tour\nSystems with a Russian made air defense system is not a good idea either\nNow far for me to to um stand up for the house of Saud by\nA given that so much of the narrative of the ... a murder has come from the Turks and also cutter or another sort of sworn enemy of Saudi Arabia is it possible do you think there's anything to the the idea that that cutter turkey are trying to\nDrive a wedge between the United states and uh there's there are their allies the Saudis with is\nOf course you know that's a sort of thing that you know\nKind of the poker and the Internet geo political world that takes place all the time behind the scenes\nYou know who were the people that were in the [noise]\nYou know the Saudi embassy that night so I suppose some details will eventually come out but the clandestine type of operations from one nation to another or perhaps not nation states but other activities\nTake place unfortunately all the time you know we're in a tight spot what can President Trump to he can sanction entities and individuals\nOr even if ... ... was you know demonstrated to have been murdered as it would appear to be by a henchmen that were under the\nLeadership of saw him on don't know but that could be clearly we could cancel the arms deal but I mean we've been not only a hundred and ten billion it's far in excess of that\nAnd we have a lot of people on the ground working hand in glove with them but we risk a relationship\nWith a with the Saudis against Iran and of course the Saudis interestingly are aligned with Pakistan Pakistan has nuclear weapons [noise] um and the packs of course distance from us now\nAnd third order effects of any decision geopolitically and that part of the world or otherwise you end up with no one that you can go to\nAnd I work with a given your your vested interests and of course the the human situation we've been helping them a great deal the rea Riyadh government\nAnd trying to battle the who tease others of course the Iranians you know through proxies in that part of the world um [noise] I Wish it were simple it's not simple uh the world's divided\nAnd of course as we see this when I called the alliance of evil Russia and China and using the mechanisms behind the scenes the variety of proxies not just the north Koreans Iranians but others\nI think on a ... era one is going to be one of those proxies to certain degree even though he would like to think that he can rule the the Muslim world um I think the Chinese have a better idea for him\nA ... if you were in John Bolton supposition or you had the president's ear who knows maybe you do or what would you be advising have how is this how do we counteract this how do we step back from the brink of of war\nWell I I Do believe tumble will talk to his counterpart about\nRenewing new start which expires in twenty Twenty one we've got to do that it's in neither country's best interest to not have a an agreement that isn't for civil the problem is and the Russians notice that a Nineteen eighty seven I N F treaty was\nWas violated or with their own cruise missiles\nAnd uh you know they probably will admit that behind the scenes or\nYou know we've done a lot of in the open um so I I think that will will get something I Know that\nYou know they had was from Trump asked for you met with putting in Helsinki in July that you know they did talk about that issue and potent surreal is you know yeah he he has grandiose ideas about the fact that he can meet with the world leader ah on the west prompt\nYou know in the eyes of the the Russian people means that they are great power again and of course you know putting his meetings with President Xi on a frequent basis just solidifies that viewpoint so if I were both ... and ... you know I I've I've talked to John Bolton before and so I\nI kind of have a sense that that's what he's going to do you know he's a real pragmatist he is a tough guy\nAnd but he does have the president's ear and I think that that's a that's going to be the top of the agenda and of course uh he'll probably try to deal with the issues in Syria um and with air to want a fan of course uh the Iranian the Iranians are our problem for Israel\nUh we we have no question I think after Netanyahu revealed months ago you know those volumes and volumes of evidence regarding their nuclear programs\nUm we don't acknowledge a lot of things but I suspect that uh you know there's good reason to believe the Iranians are up to no good\nIf there weren't any regime regime change in in Iran and and hopefully that'll come about by the Iranian people\nAre just getting fed up with the situation a witness and chasing the mullahs out of there if Iran were to become a secular non align nation or you know again leaning to the west as they did for many many decades\nHow would that change the situation because obviously what's going on in Syria is it's not about a civil war it's about a proxy war and it's about Iran so if Iran has\nWell if you don't have the ayatollah running you know the [noise] you know the military and their diplomacy or\nYou know for me to promote their their sheer world view a and the autocratic world view of of very removed and I I think that you find that they're not involved with who these are not involved with\nAssad a there are less involved with Russia accept because of economic interests and perhaps even to a certain degree with China\nUm [noise] and it's the problem is the age old tension between the Sunni and Shia\nAnd Riyadh in Tehran is going to continue um but it ... if you're not involved in you know in fueling terrorism such as his ... and you know southern Lebanon and you know encouraging Hamas and\nAnd Palestine and so forth and [noise]\nYou know we'll have an easier way in that part of the world we can we can work with them a Iranians are wonderful people are very bright capable Persian people and they have a long history I Would hope that they will\nReplace their autocrats with people that are have a a more a better sense of history and were were they ought to be going but we're not going to eliminate all the tension unfortunately\nWell another followed from that are positive aspect of that might be a\nLiberalizing Saudi Arabia because before and the Iranian Revolution I think Saudi Arabia was far more liberal but the the hobbits were sort of seen as a counter measures to the she influenced so maybe we'll see\nSome positive effects in in Saudi Arabia is well here's van Morrison taking is into the break with the band low stairway will open up the phone lines questions and comments for lieutenant colonel Robert McGinnis when coast to coast continues right after this\nLieutenant colonel Robert McGinnis is with

dollars increase defense spending we had seven hundred and sixty billion a couple of years ago seven hundred and five I think last year in another seven hundred coming up this year\nA it is is that enough I mean a lot of that obviously is going to salaries and so forth but is it enough\nYou know half of it you're right does go to the salaries and that's why people often say well gosh you know you know how can\nThe Russians and the Chinese Pete such an adversary and competitive with us while they hide most of what they're spending on their own national security you know the answer is uh [noise] we'll see\nUm the concern is here this past week the president came and said we're going to all parts of the U.S government must ... five percent well we went through this sequester ration period in which had just crippled our readiness our ability to go out and trained to be ready to fight to replace\nYou know with you know new aircraft are these\nAntiques that we're trying to fly around the world the same thing with ships you know it's an incredibly expensive\nTo have an armed forces and you know it reminded me of of something that a Ronald Reagan said you know and this was you know obviously a few years ago and basically he says if [noise]\nIf you want to be free you have to be willing basically to to pay the price and the price in this case is to have a modern armed forces nobody's going to seek to contest well today we're being contested a seriously on all fronts by\nA both China and Russia especially combined forming a new one alliance and so if we don't sustain as you know the chiefs of staff and the and the chairman of the joint chiefs General Joe Dunford if we don't sustain heavy investment in long term capabilities\nAre then we're going to fall behind were already falling behind in terms of hyper sonics and artificial intelligence or even in any investment in our our blue water navy uh\nUh the last couple of years have been great it's only putting it on our rights glide path if we can sustain it\nLet's say a say hello to the west of the Rockies in Las Vegas good evening good morning Steve welcome to coast to coast Dana\nThank you very much a Robert you were talking about the\nChinese tapping our electronics for information or I'm really concerned about is what if the Chinese have programmed to an end date into all of these electronic chips so that everything shuts down at the same time some time in the future\nYou know it sounds a little paranoid but I think it's very feasible and that's really a something major that could happen\nQuick question Steve is that possible Bob\nWell I'm not an electronics are no expert however I Do understand the question and I share that concern a and that's something\nDefense secretary a is concerned about that\nThings like that could undermine the complexity of our systems and if we get a programmable and reversible inundated electronics aboard our satellites or missiles or aircraft\nAre ships and it's and so forth and we could find that this could be catastrophic so\nYou know I I think there's plenty of caution today a there's a wakeup call across a certainly the U.S military and I think our allies are are joining that understanding that uh this is a very new world that we're facing\nAnd we have to be very careful of of the type of equipment that we do embrace and so this is I don't think it's out of the possibility\nIt reminds me of um winter and the U.S spy plane that held in ... was held in China for some time\nUh I think it was maybe a near collision involved and and I'm I'm I'm Wondering is that it it that might be what we're talking about here perhaps it was it was ... it landed there because of being hacked into somehow\nYou know well you know that's the sort of thing that we are very concerned about a cyber the battleground of you know cyber as a woman before that I point out on the lines of evil and\nGo into great detail is two and not only the threat\nOf taking down our own infrastructure a hacking into our elections and doing all sorts of things that uh we hear about every day and this is an existential threat to us and in fact when you look at the\nPresident's strategy and he says that there's a there's a possibility that we would respond to\nA cyber attack a with a nuclear weapon that's how serious it is today\nA and yet you know there's so much we don't know so you know could somewhat take on an aircraft because they take down a satellite because they take down to Los Angeles I think all that is possible or if we don't put fire walls and the capabilities to prevent this in place\nWildcard line Don his intent Ohio Don good evening good morning welcome to coast\nBrother Robert happy Sabbath a and lieutenant colonel I I really appreciate your service your patriotism and your wisdom during the meanings that you have do they ever consider the Bible prophecy of Daniel eight where America will attack Iran and destroy it\n[noise]\nYou'd have to remind me of ... and Daniel eight where you're looking at dawn I'm you know I I understand perhaps where you're coming from a you know I I don't\nKnow that ah that's something that we would do unless we perceive that the threat was against you know our key allies\nAnd against our interest in riverside claims that you know the he go from the west will come upon the whole face the years there will not touch the ground and it'll destroying the ram that has the two horns you said the the ladder horn is the bigger horn there comes a blast in\nThe first one would be Iraq that's already been conquered but the last time that comes up\nWill be destroyed and claimed that no one will help\nIt says that you know a a nation that comes from the west will not touch the ground which means it's going to be unable or an air force\nAttack or Iran is you know a huge country and that and um but it's also states that no one will come to her aid\nOr and I find that kind of interesting since it has you know alliances with were actually North Korea China and uh\nUh and this is a dual application prophecy also uh I Know Alexander the great a conquered but he did not use or anything but an infantry a probably a column a hundred and some yards wide they're not covered the whole earth as being a law explain to you know this prophecy so\nAh and actually it also mentions that he goes I'm from the west will have her a has the wings of an eagle\nAnd those wings will be plugged in to stand up as a man so uh I didn't know if the joint chiefs are considered any of those biblical prophecies in there a a summation of this whole incident over their\nGreat question John Bob would say you\nKnow I I understand you know we're done coming from the eagles certainly you know we like to think of as the United states and its its use elsewhere even and revolution\nOr the possibility of interpreting and like that you know I I tend to you know of shy away from a eases cheeses and going more in the direction of extra Jesus in terms of you\nKnow what's the context of that particular scripture I have not studied Daniel aid to the degree that Don or would you know benefit from an analysis of that so I I really can't answer the question though I Would say that\nYeah it's not my experience that our chiefs of the armed forces are terribly a biblical illiterate and therefore are in tune with a Bible prophecy I'm not that they shouldn't be but I just don't get the sense that they are and certainly the material I read this suggests that they have\nA Susan is on the wild

going to take you to pay that off when I say it depends on what kind of doctor your uh-huh well I've got a job to have so that's a good question uh-huh and\nDo you do it so you are a doctor or say you're a businessman you say well wait a minute\nI'm making some good money here making a I don't was let's just say it was\nA hundred thousand a year I just thought of which is a pretty good so well I mean you know but some doctors make two three four hundred thousand so whatever it is you making it and you say you know I really would like to relieve some of that debt you just get out of school are you're a businessman who's a business lady and they are your are your children\nThat they ... they had to borrow a bunch but you'd like to help them early ... you can now use these for one case from what I'm hearing a we haven't got all the specifics of it where we're getting that because it's so new ... these things are so new\nBut if you're going to be able to get rid of the debt by using four oh one kings\nIsn't for one k.'s and get rid of it may be a you know is going to help you with your taxes but he's going to get rid of the day and then you can retire\nBecause that debt is going to kill the retirement just thinking about it if you got a lot of dead and it's accumulating on you and it's a lot of people don't understand this one you know there there's this thing called bankruptcy you've heard of that I've heard that\nOpposes the uh-huh you cannot bankrupt student debt now uh\nI understand that that is relatively new because people I think people didn't they just changed that here not long ago or am I mistaken\nI don't know I haven't researched the it that far back as soon as the last few years I've known that you couldn't do that brought you there's a few things that you came bankrupt and that is a ... hour is came bankrupt at too easily\nUh you know there's things you can do him but you know when they cannot another was paying ... like in your death is about [laughter] you know I Am sometimes they'll take a reduced amount uh-huh but\nThis this thing about getting out from under state of death is it's like a chain around your neck ... down ... down if you're in that situation or if you're thinking about doing that situation and\nYour father your mother are you are involved in the business of maybe you need to call me because there's a way and we're going to get more information every day about this about how you can use this four oh one K. benefit to pay off your student debt\nAnd there's a lot of folks out there with it yeah there's a lot of it now one of the if you're with a regular company\nIt probably unless they go in and revamped it mhm not going to work so easily because companies have to set up the abilities for money is to be taking the news for certain ways ... and one of the biggest things that I have seen now hospital workers out there\nIf you're a hospital worker and you're hearing my voice right now in this city\nYou need to call me because there's some things about your retirement plans that you don't know or if you do know\nThat you can fix because there's some uh for example did you realize that if you're working in the hospital in the city most of the plans as long as you're working will not let you take it withdrawn unless it's like uh the\nUh what's it called a hardship and then you might not be able to take more than five thousand dollars that right\nYou can borrow up to a five or ten thousand dollars ... ball on your own money paying interest on your own money which is not a whole lot of money when you're paying interest on it but\nHave nurses and folks all the time who are like in their sixties they cut down to like partial a retirement and they can't get a dollar out of their retirement they work because they have to be Seventy and a half\n... to get the money so these are things that need correcting and Donald Trump's working on it so shame on you medical people out there that are setting that up and allow knows a financial gains are ... lizards to talk to you in the last name ah\nI'm not talking about you workers I'm Talking about you you a management people that are being deceived you all you got to say no you can't come into this whole it unless you fix it where they can take their money out at least fifty nine and a half is just don't work\nAnd you use reminded

I guess that's what they're calling karma right so we hear a couple of people in the church and fall and older people that I got into this and they had fallen in the bath tub bathrooms and I'm like\n... and I'm the sad thing is there's four or five I'm just like bam bam bam and two or three of them die had hit a hit their head on something and that\nAnd I was like you know I said our ... ... getting ready to the bathroom to the same brush my teeth and then I get ... and you know I just saw her staff I feel a little prayer and I I figured you know I thought well I just don't understand how that happened so I get in the shower and I come out ...\nBam right down on the ground man and I do have some sharp ... the the Jacuzzi is Taliban and all that and then I sit there for men and of course my daughter here's me inside of the and the living room goes he okay cause you know two hundred and Seventy pounds fallen is is is pretty heavy\nOr you don't and uh we were out of the place other day talking to the gym about to learn to lift and ah why was it now but I was just road with a friend but um they we've got to talk about things and all that we finished up and not a ... you know listen to the whole show or the ... own show and\nThen he goes oh really is yeah it's a deputy chaotic as I said man you've got to in a one of the things as funny as refrigerators I said are you now you've got a fridge right or that Scott screen on outside and you can call up recipes are and above it didn't you tell me that that if your program it right or whatever then as you put things in there it scanned and tells you what's in there\nAs exactly right and also and tell you something has been voided in other words it's a ... plus it's got cameras you could see a way if you're a grocery store and you forget what's in their cameras up and down in the middle of the scans\nNow by me I got a question uh like Dale so he put some in refrigerated and want to his kids get to meet you can go back and see who ate it [laughter]\nI mean I got the uh you could put a smart so that's a good idea or there was record that's right and I was\nMissing a chocolate milk last night uh Dale was not happy about is not happy and that is that purity chocolate milk you know man that's good stuff but so I told the guy and he's like I said you know all the homes this everything's going automation he goes\nHe said you know what the next refrigerator I'm about as I go out and he goes the ones that you open the door and get your eyes out of the tray no water dispenser on the front and he goes I Want a simple refrigerator because they always break\nAnd I go well okay I understand I could do that so uh but the technology bother coming in with what you're talking about the ... and that's part of the smart home technology right\nOh absolutely here and I tell you the thing about these these smart thermostat they do save a lot of money I mean imagine saving twenty ... twenty five percent on your energy bills and things like that that really adds up especially if you've got to you know pretty good size home I tried you know things like that it really adds\nUp and so for the for our listeners I'm sure you've heard about him you know home automation at ... ... what it sounds like and that's having the ability to control the items around the house from window shades to pet feeders now we control and pet theaters where it drops the food\nThat too sure that I mean and it was a simple push of a button or voice command some activities like set up a lamp to ...\nAnd relatively inexpensive or simply a simple and relatively inexpensive others like advance surveillance cameras require more serious investment of time and money but you know Bob Hope and keep on going on that because that's what was going to talk about this more about smart home but you got to start with what Bobby is the smart home hub and control the right\nYou're absolutely yeah you have to have something like a lot of these like like I was talking about just now some of these smart thermostat as if you look in the big plant they will say will tie on two legs are Amazon you know diets and things like that because ... that's that's what you got to look for the last couple of bills\nRight and we're talking about your mind control so that's you know that's everything he usually is going to run pretty much through that and then uh you know and have you heard of the wing cub\nOr yeah sure had yeah it works for the devices lives the way it was it can be drawn clear connect kitty Bluetooth and why and it's part of the future to now you know some people such as I I mean I think Matt fighting it or the technology thing says if you don't like talking in prefer controlling things old fashioned way\nYou know ... ... ... do you do that by pushing buttons to\nOh yeah [laughter] yeah so there's a there's a product out there this ultimate universal remote for a reason that controls a lot more than just a TV [noise] uh and that is pretty pricey but uh it connects with the\nTo control other Bluetooth ... the way our infrared devices in your home and so you can do that Bobby at the home ISP six six smart plug that's the ones that you plug into the plugs you ought to have to make them a smart plug right\nThat's right that's correct so you know you want to check that and you got to have I mean it all fits in but you got to have it set up first and that's what we're talking about star with the controller\nAnd are you know and then you you go to the others and then you've got the cameras and you can put in your smart homes surveillance cameras a\nAnd we talked about this when I called W. why's he can vie to have you heard I always though yes\nAnd it's a ... you know it includes motion tracking enhanced all audio capabilities and it's more powerful has a you know nobody would know this ... since we're seeing more as\nSo uh it's still the smaller Social Security camera and they've tested it and and it's an incredible bargain other Otis down here in Nineteen Ninety nine but [noise] and it got sky bill from ... from ...\nPercent is that there is that what is at home security that's what that is a

boat tell you the lead you in are lock you out or lock in for the night or whatever so [noise] you know all these things covered I guess they all have to be connected into the wife our right\nYes they

me I'm Sorry I interrupted when he was talking and and I know you have some questions so go ahead yeah go by\nYeah cannot one question I had a is that you know sometimes when you see a new subdivision being built and after about six or seven years some of the trees that they plant will get the root system will get up under the concrete and just break it up to the side walls or even the driveway and things like that would\nNot have found and foundation and found an\nFoundation share what other trees out there will have a root system that will not damage stuff like that or is there such a thing there\nThere is and there are some species that are more apt to have surface roots a ... but typically those we don't even consider using in the landscape anymore some of the ... the big issue way back when it started in the forties or so with silver maples\nAnd every body plan is silver maples because they were rather fast growing but because they were fast growing they were ... brutal trees they also really likely to have surface roots\nAnd so they were terrible so we've gotten that you don't use those in the industry anymore I've started using some other there are some varieties of red maples that I've seen that do the same thing and I'm not sure exactly which varieties they are but they will have surface roots\nHowever if the plant the trees properly to begin with again you don't have a problem you're most likely not going to have an issue right or if you do have an issue it will be years and years down the road but uh uh if if it's planted properly you're uh you're you're usually not going to have an issue with\nNow I don't know what to plant the tree is but I'm downtown to cater to cook and cooks vast control he you know always did a lot for the community he planted

there about\nTwo hundred and fifty five hundred parts per million and they pay their better because they have more silver\nPlus the answer is they're not actually better because of protein ... of

million silver\nAnd we decided that we would make a prescription product that people could use that would be a lot safer a lot more effective and you know better but in order to get the estimated Clarence on that we had to go head to head with that with a drug products that are already the ... and we take it over the\nWell we did was we took thirty two parts per million of our ...\nPills or

a question you can argue as to why you can argue the fact that we don't do it because we had three different studies which brings me don't kill the good stuff\nInteresting stuff too is that we were doing a study with one of my son's preschool science project and he took milk and he put it out on the counter and he took unprotected ... put it out money to put males count and they started some silver and doesn't amount\nAbout two weeks later this science fair project one of them started just think that ... I didn't have any silver and then turn this thing all the milk fat and stuff and it's gone to the bottom it was downloading it was horrible the other one look perfect I find it still looks like a glass of milk\nSo I took the class and I should get a little crack I thought oh my gosh we made yogurt like killing the bad bacteria but not the good bacteria in the mail never went at\nIt just

have these types together so that to me it's much more about the quality of the meeting is just a ... a month\nOn the other hand if you you know if you just have a quick end to cover you know it's it's mid week or you know it's like hey we got to get together and do a\nQuick problem solving peace or\nWhatever yeah do you know\nTake ten minutes it there's there's there's not a a template for those\nLet's talk about when I when I first entered of the research that I Do on the demographics and the generations of the workplace either one of the early pieces of advice that was being bandied around does give\nThe at the time it was the millennial generation a clear responsibility in the meeting make them responsible for teaching or bringing a topic to the meeting and it's a way to keep them stimulated engaged and feeling like they're part of the team do you have any thoughts on that\nI I agree I I I wouldn't necessarily limit that to an age group um I think that's really good practice no matter what and I'm In my in my work with uh some generational topics um I'm a I'm a little bit I kind of go a little bit up against some of the conventional wisdom on some of this but\nThat's a concept of people having ownership and having a chance to uh share or present or ask questions or whatever is great and I think that's you know\nNo matter how old you are indeed that we all have um a need for autonomy and control and\nThis practice regardless of the participants in the meeting\nAbsolutely had an end up at the same time they might have somebody just as the end of that and they don't they really don't like going out and that's also perfectly acceptable it's not it's not a cookie cutter\nLet's talk about this Google research that I remember coming across or maybe it was eight Eighteen months ago now they invested in extraordinary amount of time and money into figuring out which teams were the best they were looking at personality profiles they were looking at backgrounds they were looking at levels of education\nTrying to figure out how to create high performance teams using all these different variables\nAnd I'm making some things up here but after that let's say Eighteen to twenty four months of doing their research and first categorizing people based on all these variables and putting them together something became clear to them about the teams that did most of them were most effective and that was\nPrior to the official start time of every department of meeting\nThe manager the meeting owner got there early\nAnd sat down in the room and as people began to trickle in for the meeting here she engaged each of them individually and asked them about their weekend in what was going on and not work place topics but individual\nPersonality curiosity type topics so that by the time the room was full people had been talking about things that we're not we're based and there was some energy in the room\nAnd the meeting began with a kind of quote unquote by union for the manager already furthermore\nThis manager according to the Google research was very good at reaching out and making sure the opinions of those who may not be the most vocal people in the room was acknowledged by saying things like\nThat you haven't said anything this far I'd really like your thoughts on what's going on here\nHere she was very good about engaging all the people all the personalities not letting the most distant demonstrative people dominate but pulling in those that are the least demonstrable and the result was a very hard performing pain but it mattered nothing about the education\nIt better than nothing about the age of ... nothing about the expert piece of the specialty\nBut about the amount of time the manager spin prior to the meeting of engaging the people as they were coming through the door\nWhat does this surprise you would shock to me\nA ... not at all I in fact that's really really encouraging to hear that at that is exactly in line with um other studies and even some of the best practice concepts and I'll I'll and I'll interpret it ... maybe a little differently and he had his manager\nSitting there and what you just described as relationship that\nYou described um a kind of a holistic way of managing where you're selling caring and respect and you're interested in your people and you're making sure they have a choice the these are all part of what they call the top ... management skills each each of those discrete items and less and\nLess literally what you're describing the manager and body in this way it would be an end it ... and having that happened\nRight there when people are coming in is at stake I Would suspect that that manager though\nDoes that anyways that's probably part of the way here seeds I I'm sure he or she is not a jerk on you know the other times and then all of a sudden these days relation All right and when people are coming in I think that that is probably a manager that just does this in general and so people come in\nThere's warm there is um accepted theirs dialogue that has not work related that's holding steak relational managing right there and during the meeting like you said you know making sure that people have a voice on this is\nReally what it looks like a large anyways\nWell let engaged when it became clear from the Google research that I read again about eight to twenty four months ago was that when this individual colder meaning or whether it was regularly scheduled I don't remember that\nPeople knew to get there early the meeting will begin let's say at eight thirty but the well let's start showing up around ... because we really enjoy this this casual dialogue and and it became a quote unquote known thing that an eight thirty at eight thirty to meetings going to start\nLet's talk about workplace morale and how uh it shaped how it's defined and you know the great quote that we see on T shirts or the beatings will continue until morale improved which is one I Love\nLet's talk let's begin abroad conversation about morale in the workplace\n... yeah that's um that's quite often to where we start ... managers we have a five day leadership development workshop we probably spend the first couple of hours really big on and on this topic because I find that it's ...\n... e misunderstood and\nThe dogs eat in many ways people see it managers can tend to see it as an extra no big deal thing or it's a touchy feely and it really isn't I mean that's what I I think that's what I Would normally asked if the managers all of our classes um what what do you get an organization Louie get low morale\nName off of the things that you could think of all off\nPoor decision making a antagonism back biting a lack of enthusiasm for pleasing the customer achieving the goal I mean the list goes on and on\nCapitol Hill and you've got\nBrits even cut he quotes um she says you couldn't pay me for my back in my hands but I volunteer my heart's in my brain and that is so true and the the way it works is is if if I don't have moderate to morale as an employee or if it's if\nIt's a low morale work environment which is a real saying um it is really hard to volunteer heart and brain\nOr you're going to get the basic stuff but you're not going to get the extra you're not going to get the stuff that you can't pay for and you can't punish for um that means you're not and it gets creativity you're not going to get the loyalty or you're not going to get the extra effort and the whole focus on quality and the pride and the ownership\nYou're not going to get the great attitude um you're not going to get the fantastic customer service say one of my big soap boxes is our organizations that um there's been a lot of money and time on something like\nA big safety initiative or a customer service initiative but they haven't dealt with employee morale and the fact is those initiatives are not going to be sustainable over time if you have a low morale work environments because people aren't volunteering their heart and their brain and so you know you're not going to be giving the kind of customer service\nThat we would hope if you yourself have low morale in the workplace where does around stem from where does have a good or bad where does it come from\nWell specifically I'm ... and that's one of the questions that we posed to our groups we actually spent a fair amount of time digging into this um but according to research and kind of the punchline of our training that in them in the morning of the first day is left\nTo look at specifically where morale comes from and what and what the research tells us and and by the way morale has been researched and research to research says you know [noise]\nUm [noise] it comes from four main places and and in kind of an order of um wait I'll start with the lowest um I think this one is about to get the swine usually about eight percent and it is the individual you know in the sense that um\nYou know there is an individual components to morale that that was for example I don't have you ever met that kind of person who is not going to be happy unless they're unhappy [noise]\nYeah we we parity or there's a certain football coach in our little wind seems to be only on fire when he was miserable\nOkay yes I can imagine that I did that so that yeah so so eight percent of workplace morale comes from the fact that individual people have their own capacity for morale either lower high I I Know people that could be happy no matter where they work and I know people that could be miserable them I don't why they work but we only give that ... percent\nBecause we're not talking about his personal happiness we're talking about workplace morale and those are very different\nAnd so we only get that about eight percent a next about twelve percent we give a the the coworkers people I work with people that I spent all my time with 'em if I'm having to work with slackers or negative ... or\nA highly political soft focus people that's going to impact the morale of the people all around them [noise] um the third category about Fifteen Percent be give this one is uh the work itself [noise]\nUm I like to work I Do um my work feels important [noise] um cetera\nAnd ended up big one which is pretty common sense about sixty percent it's just leadership and and and the obvious piece here is um a hip click analogy I used to my first career with social work and I worked with families [laughter]\nAnd I can't tell you how many times I got the phone call that said hey can I can fix the kids and we didn't have a lot of seminars for the kids right our our work with the parents that if you want to see a family\nBe healthy and have let's call it high morale you're going to work with the parents it's going to be about their their ability to parent well it's going to be about their ability to be on the same page as one\nFor ... and did boundaries I'm so you know I don't want to take that analogy too far 'cause we're not talking about children and parents but systems are systems an end to end the workplace and the morale of the workplace is absolutely dependent on the building of managers to manage in lead well\nYou know what is so sixty five percent in leadership\nIs it the behavior is it the the job description that the leader gives the subordinate but in parents morale is it the little things that they do we talked about them coming the leadership coming into the meeting early\nOr earlier in the show tell me what it is in leadership that determines so much of workplace brown\nI'm a ... I hate to say this but the answer is all the above um\nThere's there's what we call this thought Fifteen management skills and it really does include all those things so bad and and that's based on a ton of research by the way these these management skills are based on a a a Gallup study that studied hundred thousand groups over ten years\nPlus a bunch of other studies and and everything you just said have been there for example I'm clear expectations or you know\nCould roll clarity I Know that kind of thing um [noise] the behavior of the managers I the first thing we we learned when it comes to what it means to be an effective manager you actually have to show caring and respect to your people and that means I'm you know your average employee when they when they get a job if they\nStart to kind of zero in on their manager what they're looking for subconsciously is does this person actually have my best interests at heart\nAnd if as a manager if I'm not feeling that if I'm not demonstrating that I actually care and I don't really care about you and the like we're going to go barbecuing together on the weekends it just means I respect him as a human being I'm I'm here to make sure that your needs are met and that um you have what you need at that you're [noise]\nYou know that you're successful and if I don't sense that from my manager and the way he or she talks to me or works with me [noise] um that's going to be a blow to my workplace morale so yeah it's everything it's expectations it's how I treat my employees it's to do they have a voice and you know do I ask their opinions list goes on\nSome of the new manager that may be listening to this here she is just recently been given the management leadership job and they want to create as any new management would\nTime around when there weren't place one of the biggest mistakes that they make or the biggest things that they are unaware of their behavior their their their eye contact their behavior\nActually influences the morale in the workplace\nThat is a tough question um I the first thing I thought that when you said that was um I think the mistake would be a manager who doesn't understand\nThat one of their jobs really is the morale of their employees meaning a including um\nBuilding relationship with them so this is the manager who thinks that um well my job basically you know when I'm driving to work in the morning when I'm thinking about is tasks you know what I'm thinking about is the thing is I have to get done and and that means I'm going to go to work and get my stuff done\nAnd I'm going to tell you what stuff I Want you to get a\nUm that creates a vacuum and an absence of um an employee feeling valued um\nThat we we come to work as employees and believe it or not or I guess like it or not or kind of subconsciously looking for something from the person who has power over us and that means I Want to feel safe with that person I Want to I Want to feel heard um that that's a big one right there I there was a study at Cambridge I I Am\n... these these teenagers were\nHaving conversations with an adult I'm In the control group and the other group that was the same conversation but the adult was practicing a specific set of listening skills and the kids later on when they report it out\nAnd there was nothing in the conversation that what it indicated carrying it was just the fact that the person you had to lift and so there's a there's another relationship building these right there so I Would say that the abroad answer your question is is the manager who doesn't recognize that the morale and the sense of wellbeing of their employees is their job\nThat actually is what being a manager and leaders about it at least in some some stuff\nSo I see and this is my case uh when I get up in the morning or good for the uh typically begins evening before but I finished it in the morning is to do list here's what I'm going to accomplish tomorrow here's my big goal for the day I'm gonna put just across the top in big bold letters and hear the number of things that I Need to get going to get done\nMost managers new managers are task driven unless they know what you and I are talking about their task driven and they were to do list whether it's in their head or printed it's going to be tasks up and down the list what they need to do\nThat wraps up this week we'll have another show next week everybody who we talked to say [noise]\n[noise]\nRiverside several a master control center says is W.

Lindsey Graham did this morning on Fox and friends\nSay Saudi Arabia the secretary of state heading over there now to try to get some answers about what happened to the Saudi embassy outside turkey you know what happened\nWho's to blame well I Know there's nothing happens in Saudi Arabia without NBS knowing it so Sandy I have that thirty three year old ... and John them over other people have found is that exists contain and I think he's on a on a bad\nTrack I can never do business with Saudi Arabia again until we get this behind us\nAnd what does that mean that means I'm not going back to Saudi Arabia as long as this guy in charge so you're selling the crown prince has to leave this up to them\nSaid they talk about what they can do to us and when we can do to them in in a situation where they need more than we need them or is it is it is still in New Jersey is very key player in Middle East diplomacy for a correct\n[laughter] well they are and they aren't uh they were before uh they uh badly strain the Gulf Cooperation council um and uh uh remove cutter from it or not actually literally put these sanctions against counter\nOr how how we can Saudi Arabia's hand among the Sunni Arab countries um\nAnd also which the United states there's been some real violence about whether or not this was really a good idea given the cutter is a huge military base where the United states where um the other thing that's interesting is could we used to rely on Saudi Arabia for oil\nIf you're interested in ten years ago we imported fourteen thousand barrels of oil a day from Saudi Arabia today that's down to eight hundred thousand that's a very small amount\nAnd most of it comes in to a single and Saudi Arabia who burn a oil refinery in Louisiana so we are almost independent from Saudi Arabia and Saudi Arabia which side to cut off that eight hundred thousand barrels a day we could ramp up production or buy it from someplace else fairly quickly\nOn the other hand um Saudi Arabia buys almost all of its weapons from United States they have um possibly a hundred billion dollars a weapons on border blocked\nUm what they have done is signed kind of letters of interest that doesn't mean they're actually going to buy them they are contracted now for about eight billion dollars of weapons\nThough the president has said that they could buy those weapons from Russia or China it's not really correct um they are set up claimed a and maintain to operate American want pets so if the United states were to say okay until\nThe crown prince steps down and tell you a knowledge what happened to uh to uh uh ... we're going to suspend those arms sales I think that would put a lot of pressure on Saudi Arabia they really don't want to buy weapons other than ours\nThey did by British again I I met with the current king many years ago\nHe looked at me and said we'd much rather buy American weapons we don't go into like the British ... [laughter] I bought it and just to send a message to the American means that we want to buy your weapon stop putting each restrictions on\nSo I think that if the United states or to to say seriously if Senator Graham were to say seriously if you don't\nMake good on this and acknowledge that crucial which burger it's there aren't serious repercussions for the people responsible for doing it when it will suspend arms sales I think Saudi Arabia would have to respond they will not turn to Russia or China they really don't want to buy those weapons only Chinese bought them stay bought were\nSome long range ballistic missiles they bought back in Nineteen eighty nine they realized that really aren't very good on I think that's pretty much the end of the idea of buying Chinese or Russian weapons by Saudi Arabia\nNow that they find a model aircraft and then trying to tell you that with the Chinese model that doesn't that network\nThat does not work out some of the way it does not work all their pilots are trained in the United states\nAll of their maintenance facilities were really operated by American contractors to a six and a modernized there there at the Danes um they're buying a new set of a modern ... a ... about Fifteen sixteen years um\nI don't think a lot of American equipment the operator barren ground landed American tanks tend to think that the American ... tanks state of the art tanks they have no intention of buying\nRussian tanks which really orders blood and they're just not set up to to run them they're not they they have a crane for them they have a set up to maintain them so\nI think that uh there's very little chance political by anybody's weapons other than one country the United states here you\nKnow we had one more thing they beep and very clever and spending their defense contractor run the United states ... he got the bench contracts in Montana Arizona in St Louis Alabama and other places in congressional district where they do create a new job so\nThere is some political support for selling Saudi Arabia without\nUnderstanding that the highest models or they go to invite or is they have Seventeen they don't at all the way they have\nThe F ... the best when they have is called the F ... can you ask 'em as for Saudi Arabia a but it is a ... it's not quite as good as what Americans fly and they don't have the committee to they're not going to get the thirty five\nBut for their purposes a death of king asked a very good airplane um it's burning modern or they bought a lot of them are they're well maintained by American contractors so it's a very capable airplane it's it's as much as they meet\n[noise] it's insane to me that\nThey answered this solution to all of the problems is oil important stepping down because you can say I gave it unlawful command so I'm at fault with that the people who have said carried it out we're doing it as a command for me they came to know about it and boom he's out\nThat would be the easiest out for Saudi Arabia I really don't think the current there's blame this on a rogue agent is really going to work it just lacks credibility\nAh and I think that ... that's probably the best answer if I were president crime or I Would say look at my country at church concrete would change that\nBut I Would make a bribe communication to king Solomon and say that using clay out for all of us are so we keep this firestorm from escalating is\nGone priests needs to step down and you need ... what happened a unique apologized you need to compensate the family a and the point of view crown

uh Mohammed bin Nayef on and I was\nActually a a crown prince himself he was ministry of interior he's somewhat conservative um but his son I'm a home it was a ... a colonel prints English kind of

at absolutely have to have so date or an as Saturday turns out that will then that hurt their revenue stream and put them in dire straits\nYeah this is this is a a a gun aimed boat when he's on the one hand I'm bank withhold oil and that would drive prices wait a oil prices are about eighty dollars a barrel now um\nIf they grind them up to a hundred or a hundred and twenty dollars a barrel then that could slow down the American economy as well as the economy ...\nCountries that are all they could ultimately it's ... a global recession possibly bought Saudi Arabia need so rapidly that they have committed to ... indeed\n... dollars on a new project involving there's massive city uh up in the northern part or Saudi Arabia or they were hoping to bring that investors and in fact next week they're going to have what they called Davos in the desert to\nA big conference that brings in lots of international law companies to uh to plant or invest in in Saudi Arabia is a lot of the donors by the way have now said we're not calling me\nWhich is also good hurt their Saudi Arabian economy so yes Saudi Arabia could raise oil prices they could withhold below a memorial market they hope that it causes recession but that's money that they don't have ... well\nI think it would be awfully foolish on their part to really concur with the oil market because the last time they did at\nA world

Want to raise the envy now\nBack to the ... news ... something to do to do it this way we are very strange in the house [noise] I have a question coming in for viewpoints [laughter] no love to hear that [noise] I\nWas talking about the retirement system or in the right over to already saying what's the status of that because you mentioned in the show I Am so roe inquiries about they like can you give him ... down to\nUm besides going as rapidly as we would like and and and frankly anticipated I was chairman of the county commission you know five\nOr six or seven and whenever it was at the county moved over and frankly was ... fairly paint let's say it was pretty easy we had a eight hundred employees are we only had one system so we were able to do it\nAs a ... well after we got to vote and that took us a while to to explain it to everybody and then take the boat I think it was like eighty to eighty three percent\nThen we start the real work um there are\nFive different systems\nRetirements particularly in public safety that's where it really gets a little dicey and so uh we've been laboring trying to get\nA way we could get adult mechanized we found that a lot some of our files are are not mechanized away having to get those loaded then it just\nToday as a matter of fact uh we ask\nThe board to name a chairman of a committee that really would have a a purview over the the project or Scott Miller who's a member of that board or is now the chairman ... uh from our I'm\nA tea or organization and Mac representing the Mac McLeod represented the mayor's office are three person committee that's really going to be calling the shots that get it\nWe would like to get it done um sooner rather than later but it looks like it's going to be the June July timeframe or next year before we're ever\nA being a position to actually go there so we\nCould start by June July August we would know Jane we will be able to make the cut in June and if we're that with all that kind of over to cut over and if we're that far downstream we probably will wait ...\nFiscal year how many employees would be affected by this um we got twenty five hundred\nBecause initiative to go through an X actually explain to twenty five hundred with all this may well what we've already done that okay and we've had myriad of meetings because they employ every employ had to vote\nTo go now majority rules\nThe first step and that's probably five or six month process just understanding it working with a A R I say and and his team to to be able to do that\nAnd then two O. meetings over thirty or\nForty five day period to give as many people as possible the opportunity not once but twice to ask the questions because they are a few situations if you are working with us and you're in the retirement system already the state retirement system\nYou can't have two retirements so there are a few people that they got to be special circumstances I liked it officials they can't go and so you got to\nWork through those special circumstances and the fire department I think there's two different retirement says in a place as as a couple of retirement system whether it's twenty five but where there's twenty or so it's a herculean effort to do that\nBut it's well worth the effort because if we don't do it in Twenty years we'd be at forty fifty percent of payroll trying to support our retirement\n... expect that there's going to help longevity within payday\nAh once we get there I think it will because what what we're seeing now and I think we're about over it because we just in the last a couple of weeks if\nI'm convinced ouch sales that is going to be a ... we all thought we could get there by January one uh and so those that were going to retire with their retirement\nI think you've already done they may be one or two others um so ... dinosaurs yes I think it will help us I think it may even help us bring some people back uh because of they will ... or maybe a ... with us going into the state and now they can come back in there in that state retirement\nInteresting I'm just talking about police and I'm just going then you know issues that you that you ... yeah I'm a ... is still in that\nSub five hundred level I think the ... I think it's like forty seven or we do have a class it is it up to forty yet last heard I was in the low thirties where shooting or some time and\nI think it's mid November to have a class of forty so we'll have some folks are being early had to to be able to do that but if we get\nThirty five or or forty or even thirty or we do a really good job in the police Academy of hiring those that are not going to get washed out\nFor it and we don't do this wasn't in the fire or we were looking maybe a forty or fifty percent and the far side of the equation but because of EMT or the ... the emergency medical part is the tough part with the fire a but owned the police that\nUh once you get through the academics or in the PTA Yemenis like easy sale and so if we got this say make it easy if we got thirty we would anticipate getting twenty six twenty seven out of the citizens and the big man choice does every farm in ...\nUh the basic course yes it could be an officer you gotta have EMT\nInterest in Newtown anytime soon at their motion America a change in the house and be right back\n[noise] Dannemora show news to on a three point one and found\n[noise]\n\nWhat we can kill you unequivocal early is in sixteen\nAnd Seventeen and Eighteen the violent crime is down about five or six percent\nOr ... homicides between last year this year I think we've had thirty and we had like forty four last year or so you would you know an average you have thirty five thirty six thirty seven so we're on that\nThat track I can also tell you that the the total crime is down about three percent\nSome of the uh ups are in vehicular incidents like leaving your car unlocked and they've taken stuff from you are a break in state of the car things like that what we're beginning to see in the last few months\nIs more juveniles involved and some of the crime\nAnd that's prevent us\nAnd repeat offenders and that's led us with the district attorney to do two things first of all we're all supportive of of him and his efforts owned the pardon and Paroles for governor in the United as it is absolutely I mean we we we see that\nTime and time again and and some of the stuff you just got to shake his hand in the world could that happen um ... we're absolutely supportive we help the governor of can do something or other than or Seventy five day a moratorium there's gotta be a lot more sense to build it they\nThey say it's not a bad day loading the population in the presence of vows just leave that to\nTo what the facts are but the other thing that uh we we've got to do a better job of is holding parents accountable and so what we've done with the district attorney and his dad and I reached out\nThe hard way is to meet with those judges and figure out a way to enjoy it and I'm not sure and joins the right legal work but to in joined the parents I Am told that\nIf a judge today a center says the juvenile and says to the parents and you need to attend parenting class there is no obligation there's no penalty if you do not\nDo that I've heard that from the administration added the juvenile they need to order those parents to attend and if they don't attend if they don't take care of the kids then they got to be in harm's way it's the parents we got the whole responsible\nAnd we had to buy them when I was I was going down it was just absolutely incredible I should have\nJoined with him he didn't ask for it to a district attorney has a\nPowerful person so a ... he can be totally successful and we join hand we support him in that effort as a he's supporting us and and figuring out ways to hold parents response as soon as opposed to a game changer for the most of them are so young with mayor ...\n... ah I have a ... a pest control or a path out there\nAnd I go out on our wrote it down the hallway law that is like a map and all of a monk I thought of\nThat is rough that I've ever been on a mile up\nYou know we hear that a lot and and we've actually looked at that\nAnd put that in the context of of relativity I guess would be the right way to say it because we now have a pilot program where not the naked eye not the human eye but that machine that's what's he saying to me uh okay uh\n... they're saying hunter estimates about four hundred thousand dollars or to do but and you put that in the scheme of all of the others it doesn't rank at the highest level to get it because we're going to spend something in the three to four maybe as has five million dollars in a paving program\nHalf of which are going to be in the neighborhoods and a half of what you're going to be in these connector but I\nIt just to his latest three months ago we looked at that hunger loop road scenario and did not deem that to be at the top of the food chain or own own meeting needing paid now\nNeedy pavement and getting it done today so the best I can tell you is it's on the radar screen we know what the estimate is and at some point in time it will be put into the program but it's not in this year's program\nJust come over there while ago and I'm at four or five of the drugs and they're beating at all\nWhy we need to charge him due to use that kind of ... the other day you got is a down all lessons said either\n\nGames were hanging up I I tell you is on the radar screen we do know about it we do know the cost it probably um and who not down on a lot of several you must kill people and ... it's all the others have called on uh on on that path\nTo where we were very Rhode Island yeah well I don't know if it really should be finished uh we just signed a letter or this week maybe yeah yesterday or to start the process own from the ...\nOut to this to the county limits as soon as those whereas when it wasn't as well as one of them on board\nThank you for taking my call here I'm well one of the first ball and co a widow another caller said though I'm sure you go to a big concern when you leave it\nIraq [laughter] go ahead rich oh I don't care what they do not come out a way if I Try to cut you off by saying okay well um one thing that I wanted to bring\nUp and and it's kind of been a one in ... in the room and nobody wants to discuss it in the recent one bringing up on these shows because it is strong feelings about it\nA lot of our businesses are sticks and bricks businesses that we depend on for taxes locally are in the life blood or me Mr powders or providing services a lot of these are going under because they can't compete with online ... do not like\nWhat are your feelings about the mayor and where do you think should be done\nHere speaking to the crowd we are the big city mayors along with the league of but it's about Israeli been fighting this or when this whole issue came up a five or six years ago the state legislature in their wisdom decided that they were going to make a volunteer program\nWith is Internet sales and offered them an incentive incentive was that rather than paying the ten percent\nThat is if if if if you didn't have the next day we got a nexus you gotta pay the full freight but if you if you didn't have a nexus uh they they cut it from ten percent to eight percent\nWell in the ten percent that we have here for goes to the state three and a half goes to the city and two and a half goes to the county one of which goes to education and so what they did was instead of cutting from ten to eight and have every one of us take out a little hair cut\nThey gave the whole day I got to the city and the county they kept therefore but pulled us down to two and the county down to two well there's no well you know ... and you know you know when I asked the question to the leadership [noise] you know what the answer was we did it because we could\nNow that scientists are are there were alive so let me just say this is no candy\nOr let me say very few if any counties that have attempt to ... percent sales tax most of them and the one one and a half [noise]\nThe the city's own average you're going to be in the three and a half to four but we'll sit five ... five four and a half\nSo they are getting a huge hair cut so what we've been doing is we're been trying to work through\nGetting some parity because the brick and mortar ... are getting hurt\nAs well as the cities and the candidate getting hurt so we tried for the last two years to get some legislation that would get more and parity what we were able to do is to get the county to lessen the resident a fifty fifty it's a sixty forty six to the city forward it to the candidate 'cause that's where all the activity goes\nAnd now because of the ... the ruling by the Supreme Court more people are going to be involved in paying\nEven the eight percent now we would love and the league um this task exist there's\nInternet sales ought to be ten percent and we shared just like we do that\nProtects us and it protects the the brick and mortar people I don't think that's going to happen maybe nine but it's probably gonna\nContinue to be eight and what we were trying to do then is to make sure the city's a do not get disenfranchised but I got to also tell you the county has got a very strong a lobby so\nI agree with you a hundred percent here's the here's the thing that that frustrates me and you go to the retail association the retail associations and asked them what their position is oil some of the\nI chose they're paying big bucks and so they're not only in on the eighth versus staying at the end of the day it should be ten percent on the Internet sales but I ...\nI'll give you some of

person that you want to hold up as a as a principle accuser to dislodge or otherwise interfere with the person who was known in fact running the day I work for the FBI correct\nSounds look a lot of stuff as is tangled\nBlight this I think at Rosenstein is doing the right thing by taking a step back even though I agree with the motivation of a lot I was they were probably changed it sounds like he was willing to come if it was an informal meeting all kind of off the record not sworn testimony by when it became clear the Republicans wanted him\nTo be under oath he said you know what we're having a schedule problem right\nWell they don't want to go under listen they are co equal branch of government he can racist them they have been subpoenaed him they have to worry about a perjury trap I\nI I don't know what he's worried about except that he's probably doesn't want the transcripts out there and you know they'll get out\nAnd that's exactly what the problem is that that is why was this an doesn't want to do it is that the ... summit lake in it can kind of blow something this big are going to be known but it was every time I was in a major withdrawn Trump is a lot of confidence in him\nAnd they you know they're not a battle and I either will just sign is burn up where he's telling the truth and he's very believable to uh to Trump to let me go into a part of the Trump interview\nAnd where he's talking about uh what was in China newness is cutting number for where we're just going to stop and go here folks Mrs Trump this morning in a box\nYou traveled to an air force one and Rod Rosenstein was a ... who had apparently a forty five minute conversation with him I think if we're going down to Orlando for the police chase a conference apparently a number of Republican congressmen and\nWanted to have him on on Capitol Hill today how they wanted him to be under oath a and he was reluctant to do that reportedly he would've preferred an informal meeting with perhaps just one or two members not a whole hearing but\nApparently you know we just had a great Jarrett on and he said that he probably didn't want to show up because they didn't want to be under oath [laughter] you know the rumor is the day after the midterms are going to fire him you're going to fire the attorney general [noise]\nWell I actually get along well with ... that we have a which aren't going on which is disgraceful and I have to tell you I'll take these Republican guys who was Mark Meadows Jim Jordan and engaged in giving president and all of\nI I hate to mention a few names because there's so many um\nSmart guys said you know there was no collusion and turned out with Russia collusion but it was Hillary Clinton and say I mean why didn't as an example to take the DNC server and then taken\nThe tensions nowhere there's\nSo many questions but I'm Wondering how safe is Republican last time I think they're becoming a folk heroes and these are degraded grade the ball and they want to get to the bottom of it and you know\nWhen I heard Mr President the people in your ministry Rod Rosenstein will not show up on Capitol Hill to you know since I was surprised Congress that\nActually I was surprised that I Would think he would uh he mentioned certain things to me that you know a car very positive about that event and I would imagine that you'd want to put that down and frankly whether you were under oath or not shouldn't matter\nBut he mentioned things to me that I Would think would be fine for him to testify in ... when Congress call so I Would I'm a little surprised that Roger\nDo it to have a good relationship with Iran because we work with a lot of other thing\nI heard your bonded by one thing you're just trust of Andy McCabe and you believe that and the bad\nGuy hadn't called me is a bad guy don't forget these are very bad guy is kind of very lucky one I fired him\nAnd I you know rod wrote up a big memo about how horrible they read the novel how horrible calling me isn't he was a horrible guy and he lied in the league\nHe lied before Congress but he was leaking all over the place and not only through is professor you know he's a professor friend who took to stop at least whenever you wanted to do so call me it was a bad guy\nBut I became a very bad but he works with Kobe remember one thing about\nHis wife was running for office and he had seven hundred\nAnd fifty thousand dollars from Hillary Clinton centrally Packer was run by Terry McAuliffe who's absolutely Hillary Clinton was absolutely Hillary Clinton's best friend and Bill Clinton they gave me seven hundred and fifty thousand dollars for his wife nobody even knows if she spent the money\nHe might not have spent the money and this was at the time that she was being investigated\nBy McKay because somebody came is investigating Hillary Clinton and her pack\nEssentially by her best friend is paying became seven\nHundred and fifty thousand dollars to me that's a big deal and nobody ever mentions that is really a ... you know we've got a horn and says I think I'm not a great service to this country 'cause I suppose so much when you look at the emails between the two lovers ...\nAt least a page and you say the insurance policy where they're still wanting to win against Trump but then in a moment of silence they said well is that doesn't work out [noise]\nWe have an insurance policy while the insurance policy is what has gone on for the last ... fairly long period of time there was tremendous corruption and\nI'll tell you a lot of these people want to get to the bottom of it and I don't think people like never known as you you should get\nIt turns out like everyone thinks it will seven known as they get the medal of honor and she is really what he's gone through and his bravery should get a a very important in\nA metal naval called medal of freedom because we actually given a high orange for civilians and he's he's done an amazing you know guys like matter there's an end to end all human and all of these people let's say you want to go through\nAnd they're right and then they can't understand why they're being stymied at so many different levels but now it's coming out and it's really sad I did a great service for this country\nWhen I fired call me he was a bad guy with a bad intentions\nAnd you look at the way he handled and the one thing just to finish\nOh me more than any human being he actually did Hillary Clinton at least favorite because she shouldn't be in jail\nBut it should they should take it or right off the campaign but he did or a big fire but but the Democrats hated call me hated him\nAnd I said the one thing is what I fired him I said I was going to get my partisan support and you look at them and all those people they put out a horrible statements about comedy you should be fired carries a disgrace the minute he was fired\nThey came out and said he was a wonderful man [laughter] I said I Can't believe it I Can't remember what they said\nAfter he was hired it was like from a different planet so you know a lot of politicians what can I tell you I'm\nGlad you brought fire and your wife recently had an interview when she send their people\n... sorry I missed that I did the wrong one there because did you notice how he was asked a question about Rosenstein and he said I'm surprised that he did and\nThen he turned it immediately to comb may and then he was also known by McKay yes and so ... and ... and exactly then it would end so he went back to what I Believe he was telling him and they just go to generals report and investigation\nAnd I think that's why he did it that way so in other words you I'm I'm I'm surprised he didn't but then answer do with the economy and and basically that gee do you think that's what's going\nTo make is I again I go back to I think Rosenstein it probably is that I G report or words is doing it again bugs the first thing ... was only the Clinton email investigation look mid year review is their goal and the FBI\nWalk Horwitz is now working on what the inspector general is now working on is the beginning of the Russia probe this isn't the bowler investigation this is ... ... it became Bain still going on the election is yet to happen and struck opens up the Russia investigation on Trump\nAdult Carter Page and the fog of war and that's what Michael Moore what's the idea is looking at\nAnd it will be all these players as my family that's probably what Rosenstein knows about and he does want to have to say no comment to Congress or say something that will get people off because Congress is like a ... right because\nThen it says that they I mean you're talking about taking the deputy ... you may be talking about\nTaking the former director out because he went to he went to a bass player pretty fast now and the nation should thank me for that\n... he did it pretty fast and so I think the McCabe like and what McCain is saying particularly this this in the Washington Post between Rosenstein and became today which is usually no usually usually I usually futures but they're going to have and who's to blame and that I'm OK but still going back and said yeah he really did say that\nThen if he goes and says what did new suddenly made up and here's the evidence that they do how do you know it gives the evidence of it then you kind of blown which one is going on here and there was a grand jury this town only Cape don't you love this\nYes this is how much fun it was on any one show will be back right

from a distance away you can't exactly target the lands that are sticking out for you to take off with a knife so yeah so\nWeapon crafting arena for which was the really for me the real real fun part of that game seeing what like I said playing it yeah what type of things I could put you in here and there and whatever but\nIn the end just ended up being something with a lot of uh some with a lot of animal with the top and something that cleared space for me so it was basically forced gunshot gun and things of that nature of building up the law\nSo like when the the force for when you get crowded by or like the little a horde you know like the little\nThings went over there amount or those um those enemies that don't take much damage I mean 'cause the force then\nIt gives you push back but it is very little to no damage yeah so the best thing I could do with that was put spaces on every shot so he will push back and slow you down at the same time so get the most to get the most I could out of that thing for crowd control really okay I'm outside of that are played a bit of a\nSeoul covers six which came out this past friday I'm so spending a little I played the demo when it first came a ... about a month ago I guess about a month go to Sam ... are getting some measures and what they're trying to get familiar with are my main character of speak for aid\nBut not the full games out I can look at the ... list and see what ...\nWhat a what he is capable of and the game a lot of new stuff I've gotta learn gotten to learn some things about the system so I haven't had the online matches yet I Want to get a good feel for a while my character can do now and then uh\nLast stop playing some measures on line to see how a while I hold up against the rest of the players out there\nThat's pretty much all flavors we\n... and ... you know\nI'm a leak dangerous thing with ah with Kevin uh we actually he decided to\nAct microphone I decided to ... know what did I read about this elite dangerous is getting a ready for sure yeah yes off visit this month is supposedly when they don't have a day and just this month some day soon it's supposed to quarter for\nIs what they say and they're doing a lot of uh changes to it which I'm excited about their change exploration they're changing mining which is really\nGot me excited because one huh when you get more\nIt's just ... well yes in a way because like edited now you get your little mining lasers on your on your ship and you go to an asteroid or you know like a rock and stuff like that and it's like shoot at the laser and some stuff falls out and that that that kind of boring now with the new one you could actually fracture asteroids\nAnd if you go deeper you know like in the deep space where that after I was actually break up and it's more dangerous viewership 'cause you got you know now debris flying toward you but you get better awards and better uh materials\nSo there's a risk board kind of thing do I just do a surface mine and get like the the smaller stuff to do it you know deeper mine in like actually like you get some really things\nOkay you said the debris is fine towards the ship you don't have to be stationary well do it as a asteroid split do you\nMove around while you can but it's you know it's still like the video that I saw the just the best way to just breaking apart was like a pretty cool so I'm In their change some stuff for exploration just various you know like it's going to be a pretty good uh\nI'm chunk of a of an update so I'm excited about it and um so yeah Kevin I've been doing that and he decided to stream or not that long you know like I think it was Wednesday night or something like that\nAnd we've got a couple of you know people falling us and one of the guys who was watching our stream is just like hey you know I just started this game and I don't know what I'm doing some like\nIt at least dangerous as the Koreas for that where you know it basically opened up the galaxy for you and says oh half on by\nYour head it's up to you to figure out what to do and how do you want to do it\nJust went through the I've heard that this is not one of those games in ...\nAnd then I'll say with just play with it and see what happens so you know we were talking with him and on the K you know join our games if you want a got 'em on our discord channel or for ... and stuff like that and\nSo I mean you and I have the ability to to invite people to her discord I Believe um we don't know how we don't have the ability to change the way to change stuff but we have the ability invite people let me ask word because\nI Know me and random or doing something and he tried to invite somebody in it whenever discordant would not you know yeah we we apparently have their thing locked down pretty tight I guess as far as you know what people can do and when they can\nCome in what they can do while they're in there and um that we were\nTrying to take a ... you know like Ken are going to take a ... or are weighing a tea is upon and a mentor on which\nYeah I'd like to open something up for things like that for yearly dangerous so that they can see\nThe they can see the discord somewhere I don't know where when you send it or when Kevin censored or anybody they can send it and then come in and play at least dangerous in their own channel and I'd love to do it as well for our clan and destiny to yeah so I can put something up and say\nHere's our discord they can come in and talk with them yeah exactly um but I don't know how to I have no idea how to do any me neither [noise]\nOn disciplining breathe yeah go ahead\nWhat we're doing that because\nThe thing I'd as much as it is just sort of an open in whatever in a way that does not hold her hand\nI like how the fan base you know get together and helped each other out or where they have a a group called the fuel rats where if you're stranded\nYou can get on there just court channel and you talk to them and say hey here's my coordinates I met a fuel and they will actually like it people who just their ... and they like to cause play as fuel rods and they will send to ship out there\nAnd you give them some money or some material and they give you feel ...\nAnd I'm like that's kind of neat that you end up player you know interaction I guess not NBC it's an actual person on the other end you know flying in and like air got you feel they they have like a\nIt's kind of like the east India trading company\nIn a way that um if you need materials for certain you know some of the missions you get on there and you talk to them and like you make up a deal like I'll give you X number of materials that he gave me this stuff and then you meet and then like you try and swap out and so I kind of like that and feel on the camaraderie in that game\n[noise] well he's been waiting on yeah you're a while and I I Am assassins grade or does that said well we'll get we'll get back to talking about going to react to current and he's been waiting for about eleven that was my fault for not going to them as soon as you don't you know after doing his thing there hey chronic always enjoy\nListening to you guys I learn things I think you were just describing sounded like firefly but you know the show firefly yeah\nAs a first thing that came to mind is pretty neat that you can interact with other people in a ... involve them in one that's pretty cool and RJ were you talking about magic earlier magic 'cause I have a ... is that on line now\nMagic no um we were talking about magic and the fact that a quality comics as magic ...\nYes this is why I call when you first took the uh began advertising at them as a sponsor a I wanted to call because every time you do this and I get this really short paying like a big door and writing to God in your wallet\nAnd the guy oh\nYeah because when I was a little guy my dad had comics and he gave me and those were from the fifties\n[laughter] and then I I Know where this going yeah\nThese ... of a nice 'cause when I go out ... leaves and cut grass I'd run down the store and get the latest whichever came out yeah I'd yeah good air things I had a trunk full now my nephew\nUh this was back in the late eighties and early nineties reason I asked about magic is 'cause when he started playing manager key started collecting all those cards playing maddening dry ...\nPrice so he got be a little bit bigger and I'd been trying to teach him about how things are worth something particularly if you take care of them so I thought he was a big enough fell on I said here I'm giving you my comic book collection and take care of this this will be worth something you can read them and look at them enjoy them\nBut take care of them because they'll be worth something one day you will appreciate that aren't so he goes off into the navy goes around the world three times he's back in town a visiting I ask him I said\nI'm a Brotherhood revelations was revelations yeah Brotherhood revelations and then assess discreet three heads and by then the story I'd gotten horribly out of the hands of the writers yeah um especially the original writer or because Patrice had been fired by the soft\nUm and so they went their own way with it and it just it just kind of broke down but the seeds that were planning to build up the story of one were fantastic it just does not have a pay off so I don't necessarily know that it's good for you to go back to but uh especially story wise but you can really see the difference and mechanics\nSet a precedent from there on through probably up until a origins I Would say get 'em\nAs to how these are going to start working now and how this is all working and how this is going to be set and how it's all\nIntroduced and and just it's it's set the pattern for image cookie cutter will it became the not necessarily the litmus but it became the um the mold yeah it became the mold which everybody all built off of um\nThe standard really yeah because the standard and then you go from there and then for forever in a day you have\nNew open your own game go to the towers and unlock the towers new open world game well here's a\nHere's an escorting mission law or here's a trailing mission um hate those yeah but yeah it open it opened up everything and even black flag opened up a lot of stuff as far as ah the ship the ... and say here's something new tacked on to something that we've been doing forever now so\nTo really brought that stuff into\nA into focus whenever they whenever they release that and they never really veered off from that up until they got in order to origins because at this point\nTo it's starting to one but it was even more so into that you could become this killing machine [noise] um and nobody can touch you because of the way the combat system works and\nSet into combat system just really never took a change for the rest of the series up until the origins when you could get multiple you get a tax multiple times it wasn't just punch punch counter kill type of situation it was a lot of different things in aspect to combat\n... the ads in the new thing with the shield like now like the Athenians and the Spartans human shields and not to the extent of it where you actually have like one of the perks you either she'll break or we like if it's a smaller she'll do you think actually tether shield way down but the bigger shields you can't but I mean now\nYou know almost everybody has like some kind of shield it seems like ...\nOr a or the spartan kick is just so much fun 'cause ... she is very vertical an aspect because he embraces a hilly area\nAnd like you're up on a cliff and even if there's a mercenary that like two levels ahead of you and it's tough to you know if you were just to fight you get them close that you know edge of the cliff nice parting kick him and he'll fall down and gravity and like it could kill him and he's like I just did that and said it's all it's it's fun\nWe take a break Chris if you can hang on to the line we're going to come back to you once we get done with the uh the commercial break here are going into this

in sunshine and rainbows employees working a hundred hour weeks over the course of the year this sparked a huge thing he had to clarify his comments on the one hundred hour weeks are telling could talk that it was only a handful of senior employees who worked extreme hours for just three weeks\nAfter working on the game for seven years to senior writing team which consist of four people um had as we always do three weeks of intense work when we were wrapped everything up\nThree weeks not years we have all work together for at least twelve years now and feel we need to get this everything finished\nHe went on to clarify the studio employees are not expected to work this way with additional effort being a choice no one senior or junior is ever forced to work hard I Believe we go to great lengths to run a business that cares about it to people and to make the company a great place for them to work\nOkay\nI think this is going to be even more we're hundred hour weeks deserves the falls to\nThe point I was trying to make in the article was related to how the narrative and dialogue and the game was crafted I'm\nAs a as a last flu myself three weeks not yours you know that's the

Dead redemption develop a rock star games lifted its social media policies telling employees there were no longer banned from speaking about their work experiences on Twitter and Facebook\nMostly positive stories are coming from the staff\nBecause of course yeah they like having a job yeah the music department first off this is one of the most rewarding and least stressful projects I've worked on I Know what after crunch feels like but this was managed in such a way that I feel happy and healthy this sounds like propaganda [laughter]\nWell it does is you know you\nHere's the problem\nIf you're going to speak up about your job\nIn a in an honest way\nTo the public\nMy jobs the best thing ever and I feel completely satisfied\nWorking there you're going to say stuff like that and I don't necessarily know that old boys lie and I don't know but there's this this is our yeah but you will never you will never find somebody who is currently in a job a game hasn't released yet by the way it still has to release which means do still got a job um\nHe's not going to sit there and crap all over the company and publicly let's say let me tell you what really goes on of them are going to do that now let's see you pull a telltale situation\nThen you started getting the word out let's see let's see it just suddenly start counting people but left and right and see how honest you come out

there that have wonderful voices that have\nYou know they're trying to make a living that you know telling stories blah blah blah yeah you know yeah it it's terrible for me and I you know unfair or whatever but don't punish them because you know there's other people there too yeah I'm like are All right that's interesting\nAnd I'm Still trying to it's just you're not going to get any of that

right because I look at my collection the way it's growing now and I'm like why did I start doing this because you feel like it what was I going to do with these\nI haven't done anything with them yet other than just sitting in you know they're sitting on the shelves and boxes and things and they're great but there are collection those you'd police but they are both to put the ball display in a bar
