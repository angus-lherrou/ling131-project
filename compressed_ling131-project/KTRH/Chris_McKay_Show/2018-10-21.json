I Believe in his seventies or Thomas Jefferson and so forth that that that doesn't disprove that he made the point is obviously\nYeah I Would say read the book check it out give it a shot I think it's better than you might think it would be\nUm the Elvis spoke to some people they deal with different different parts in time and um you know I spent ten years researching this was a and you know after you are not quite that much for sure but um there's this the information in the book is is pretty compelling I Would check it out\n[noise] uh east of the Rockies Martha is in Gulfport, Mississippi Martha good morning welcome to coast\nThank Richard thank you for taking my call my play the\nIdea that the ... originally made their money to the science trade them for a day a wet I'm more a humane

guy\nThat I never have no idea how the relatives out well and and and they\nHave a clue as to how they make their money ranching right\n[noise] well I Know that I I yeah I Do\nActually and the tour guide at the Roosevelt mansion mentioned this they were actually in the timber business so I was told 'em and they were dealing with timber in a in the United states and they also we're dealing with timber and South America so that's\nWhere allegedly there and when they came from and if I'm proven wrong then so be it that's what I was told uh at the Roosevelt mansion and they were very good at manipulating the stock market just like the Kennedys were\nSo I mean you're dealing with the\nStock market was not as big as it is today and there are only a handful of major players back then you know in today you know the world is on our stock market other countries are in the New York stock exchange back then it really wasn't that way so a handful of players could really influence things they can create the peaks and valleys in the market\nSo when you have the money to start with and you can you you can influence where the bottom is and you know what the topic is you can make a fortune pretty quickly\nAnd Joe Kennedy did the same thing this is why when a after they made their money they shut the door so no one else could do that and they started the actually see the security Exchange Commission and FDR actually put Joe Kennedy in charge of it because according to FDR quote unquote effects accrue to crush across\n[laughter]\nReally interesting stuff so that's what I Know

I don't know if this is true but the the um that's FDR's mother to Delano side of the family\nHad made their money during the opium wars as well so I'm sure there was a lot of a lot of those they used to call them the Boston brain and those very wealthy east coast families\nAnd I think a lot of them were involved in the east India company a and a lot of that was the opium trade so there may be on that as well [noise] yeah I had heard\nThat about the Delano family as well there is so much information out there I mean I spent so much time digging and digging these guys are never written a book\nLet me tell you what if I was paid a penny an hour I'd be lucky [laughter]\nThe time you research and dig and dig and dig because if you attach names who wants to be as best they can you know

two zero I remember you have absolutely nothing to lose because you can try ... absolutely risk free\nSo that number to call is one eight hundred eighty two three nine for two zero I'll give it to you again\nIt's one eight hundred eight two three nine for two zero if you're just joining us I've got Dr Michael Pincus on the phone today and we're talking about something that we're all too familiar with these days and that stress\nAnd we're finding out about the damage that everyday stress can do to our bodies the warning signs that we should be aware of and what we can do to alleviate and even eliminate the effects of stress\nAnd Dr ... you were talking earlier about calcium and magnesium and how we need these nutrients in our bodies to fight the effects of stress in your ... formula can help us in this battle against stress\nI'd like to talk for a minute about how the magnesium factors in I mean\nI I'm starting to understand about the calcium but what does magnesium\nOr we're talking about stress and we're talking about stress affects the body and first of all in order to function at all your body needs magnesium is probably of all the vitamins I could\nList many of them is probably the most important vitamin on the planet right now\nI've not heard a whole lot about magnesium ... why is magnesium so important\nThere is over three hundred and twenty five bio chemical reactions that magnesium is involved with it it's almost like a hormone wow and for example with low levels of magnesium\nYour heart beat ... very important factor in life I Would say so\nIn fact let me just read a list of some of the conditions are associated with magnesium deficiencies okay\nUm you have attention deficit disorder Alzheimer's or anxiety asthma autism\nChronic fatigue syndrome congestive heart disease caused the patient diabetes fibromyalgia high blood pressure insomnia migraine headaches multiple sclerosis muscle cramps\nParkinson's not due process and the list just goes on and on and on and\nAnd this is this is associated with a a lack of magnesium and the money\nSimply a lack of magnesium bully too so it's nothing to really mess around with that what happens is that you need the magnesium and your body in order for the calcium to be absorbed\nOh so it's it's a necessary thing in order to get the first component which has calcium\nThat's right they work in combination with each other now there's many more practical applications of this ... formula mhm first of all like I said you drink it so it gets into your system and one of the first thing we use it for in our clinic is for people who are under a lot of stress and they can't sleep well at night\nIt works better than anything I've ever seen for people that have trouble sleeping really because it relaxes your body needs to do actually fill the relaxation after you drink the after you drink a cup of the comics formula\n... interesting\nNow the other thing that it's really really good for our people who are in pain\nOkay and I have a whole bunch of stories to tell you and and a case studies of people actually taking account max formula and getting rid of pain and this is included arthritic type pan fibromyalgia which is a form of arthritis back pain muscle spasms migraine headaches there's a whole category of of areas I'd like to discuss with you\nWow that's fantastic some of those things that you've named seem to be age related or or things that we experience as we grow older is there a link there\nYeah there's a vicious circle that I'd like to discuss what happens is that when a person has\nMagnesium deficiency specifically magnesium they don't absorb their food as well\nAnd so they go into what we call mal absorption syndrome which millions and millions of Americans have and it's not like you feel sick or you know this that use it might be overtime just starting to feel more tired and tired and tired mhm and that's just a real graduate overtime type of thing and a lotta people justify that they're getting old and they just need more grass or whatever\nRight that that's what I Would think\nThat what happens is that when when you get less absorption you actually increase the efficiency in your system of magnesium blend\nThat and that started to take the calcium out of the bones you start getting bowling lost you start getting a muscle loss because it also reduces the muscle mass and pretty soon before you know you are feeling old yeah and your body that actually starting to manifest\nAt well all due to a simple lack of these nutrients\nCalcium and let me tell you and it is simple the problem in being a doctor researchers how do you get this into the system\nThe formula we have the ... formula is so fantastic because get that a powder form you take hot water and you make if you put it in a cop take a teaspoon of this powder and mix it in you and your drink is cut down this great absorption rate is really incredible because it actually goes right into your bloodstream\nAll right and this is probably a good time folks if you want to get a free book about calcium and magnesium and try Dr ... formula there is a special toll free number to

the phone today and he's telling us about stress and how important it is to ensure that you've got the proper nutrients in your system specifically calcium and magnesium\nAnd how much of an impact that has on our overall health so I guess one of the things that people should really be aware of is because this is an instant thing that triggers you to say oh I'm sick but you know instead happens gradually over time\nIt's very possible that people might not even be aware that there is a deficiency of calcium and magnesium and their body\nWell that's the thing is that a deficiency is or not like I'm In the head of a water main break in or you have a real noticeable thing the right to their little trips little leaks here and there and so what we have is a cumulative effect\nWhere a person starts to go downhill just a little bit at a time yeah to the point where they don't realize how bad they've actually gotten before it's too late\n[laughter] Dr bank is you'd mentioned insomnia we talked about that a little bit what about back pain\nCalcium many of them is excellent for back pain because the calcium goes into the muscles magnesium actually helps the translators and the nerve\nAnd when you take this ... formula many times they will calm your back pain wow I Know I I it a couple of years ago I herniated disc and my back mhm and I always try and everything and I took out the comics formula and I drank it and I couldn't believe the difference within about a half hour\nI Would functional again not wasn't completely gone but I I drank it over a ten day period in it
