in vitamin D\nAnd because of that deficiency it's causing health issues like pain muscle weakness immune problems and the most vitamin D supplements are not the best form and more importantly is not the right amount of vitamin D to really make an impact is that what you're saying\nYeah exactly what I'm saying for instance a multifaceted problem where one we're not getting enough vitamin D three in our system ... vitamin D three is responsible for activating two thousand different genes in the body controlling everything from diabetes to hormone production to\nMuscle strength heart beating correctly digestion immune system\nIt's a really long list and I honestly it surprised me because of medical school\nWe learned that vitamin D was necessary for the bombs we get enough being outside and in our milk and end of story right and for the first\nTwenty some years I practice I never prescribe vitamin D I just didn't think it was necessary and then in the early to thousands the study started coming out and now there's over twenty three hundred studies\nThat just show the vitamin D is absolutely necessary it's not just a good idea it's absolutely necessary it's a hormone\nThat should be in the body and it's not there\nAnd you share some of that research Dr ... and more importantly what's the conclusion of the research related to vitamin D\nWell one of the biggest studies ever on my ... D were from the U.S navy okay so I think it was like a hundred and forty five thousand men and women were studied and they found that the number one and a non combat reason that people died in the navy was\nDue to melanoma so skin cancer so I'm reading this study you know I I kind of plot is right there and I went yeah it makes sense you know people are out on the decks of shift in the equator and all over the world and they're getting the harmful ... young raise and and they're developing skin cancer\nBut then I read on and it said most of the victims were office workers like clerks and people in hangers and inside and I went oh my God it was a link going back to vitamin D deficiency in the body\nWhat about muscle and bone strength ... three formula help with that\nYeah it's critical like if you're someone that's over fifty especially here seeing a progression of the core muscles in your body is starting to slow down first it's kind of a ... that people kind of feel like they're getting clumsy physically and then at the lack\nOf flexibility that you start to stiffen up and you feel it at night especially if you're in bed\nRole in from side to side you wake up with your knees hurt in your legs are restless your shoulders hurt\nThat sets this setting in that's associated with a lack of vitamin D three of my formula so\nIf you're someone listening right now and you're having a lot of joint pain bone pain muscle pain fibromyalgia I Would say start on my formula like immediately and start taking one or two of my vitamin D three's a day for the first week or two to get your doses up quickly\nSo let me ask you about these gummy vitamins does that work can you put enough vitamin D into a little gummy bear and is that the best way to get it in your body\nSo of course that Chris you know they'll go to any type of lengths to try to market thing that thing good about you're taking a lot of sugar and gelatin wax my thing is it's not what you take what your body absorb\nWhen I Want to talk more about what happens when people start taking your fast melt the three formula\nBoy that's a really good question because the first area that vitamin D seems to affect as your energy\nYour sleep your outlook your moods and then after being on it for a while your core strengths will come back so for those of you who have slowed down you're going to feel more energy like physically and so it's kind of like feeling a little bit younger Chris\nOther was start off with mark [noise] say John we are seeing a positive slow traffic inside\nForty five north bound between the south Sam and few way of course we are watching some construction activity inside to Ninety westbound is between guess during the west side Houston toll way an entire stretches shut down through Monday morning five o'clock and Martin and the ...
