eight hundred eight two three nine for two zero I'll give it to you again\nIt's one eight hundred eight two three nine for two zero if you're just joining us I've got Dr Michael is on the phone today and we're talking about something that we're all too familiar with these days and that stress\nAnd we're finding out about the damage that everyday stress can do to our bodies the warning signs that we should be aware of and what we can do to alleviate and even eliminate the effects of stress\nAnd Dr ... you were talking earlier about calcium and magnesium and how we need these nutrients in our bodies to fight the effects of stress\nIn your ... formula can help us in this battle against stress I'd like to talk for a minute about how the magnesium factors in I mean\nI I'm starting to understand about the calcium but what does magnesium\nWhile we're talking about stress and we're talking about stress affects the body and first of all in order to function at all your body needs magnesium it's probably of all the vitamins I could list magnesium is probably the most important vitamin on the planet right now\nI've not heard a whole lot about magnesium ... why is magnesium so important\nThere's over three hundred and twenty five bio chemical reactions that magnesium is involved with it it's almost like a hormone wow and for example with low levels of magnesium your heart won't beat ... very important factor in life\nAnd I would say\nIn fact let me just read a list of some of the conditions are associated with magnesium deficiencies okay um you have attention deficit disorder Alzheimer's or anxiety asthma autism\nChronic fatigue syndrome congestive heart disease caused the patient diabetes five on my own job high blood pressure insomnia migraine headaches multiple sclerosis muscle cramps\nParkinson's not due process and the list just goes on and on and on and\nAnd this is this is associated with a a lack of magnesium and the money\nSimply a lack of magnesium bully too so it's nothing to really mess around with that what happens is that we need the magnesium and your body in order for the calcium to be absorbed\nLow so it's it's a necessary thing in order to get the first component which has calcium\nThat's right they work in combination with each other now there's many more practical applications of this ... formula mhm first of all like I said you drink so it gets into your system and one of the first thing we use it for in our clinic is for people who are under a lot of stress and they can't sleep well at night\nIt works better than anything I've ever seen for people that have\nTrouble sleeping really because it relaxes your body and you do actually fill the relaxation after you drink the after you drink a cup of the comics formula ... interesting now the other thing that it's really really good for our people who are in pain okay\nAnd I have a whole bunch of stories to tell you and and a case studies of people actually taking account maxed formula and getting rid of pain and this is included arthritic type pen fibromyalgia which is a form of arthritis back pain muscle spasms migraine headaches there's a whole category of of areas I'd like to discuss with you\nWow that's fantastic some of those things that you name seemed to be age related or or things that we experience as we grow older is there a link there\nYeah there's a vicious circle that I'd like to discuss what happens is that when a person has a magnesium deficiency specifically\nMagnesium they don't absorb their food as well and so they go into what we call mal absorption syndrome which millions and millions\nOf Americans have and it's not like you feel sick or you know this that I use it might be overtime just starting to feel more tired and tired and tired mhm and that's just a real graduate overtime type of thing and a lot of people justify that they're getting old and they just need more grass or whatever\nRight that that's what I Would think that what happens is that when when you get less absorption you actually increase the efficiency in your system of magnesium blend\nThat and that started to take the calcium out of the bones you start getting bowling lost you start getting 'em ... muscle loss because it also reduces the muscle mass and pretty soon before you know you are feeling old yeah and your body is actually starting to manifest at\nWell all due to a simple lack of these nutrients\nCalcium and I'll let me tell you and it is simple the problem and being a doctor researchers how do you get the end of the system the formula we have the ... formula is so fantastic because get that a powder form you take hot water and you make if you put it in a Coptic a teaspoon of this powder and mix it in yeah and you drink this cut down\nThe great my absorption rate is really incredible because it actually goes right into your bloodstream\nAll right and this is probably a good time folks if you want to get a free book about calcium and magnesium and tried Dr ... formula there is a special toll free number to call\nIt's one eight hundred eighty two three nine for two zero ... is a unique blend of calcium and magnesium that gets absorbed into your bloodstream so you can replace those vital nutrients that your body burns up when you experienced stress\nAnd I want to let you know the doctor Pincus has arranged a very special introductory offer it's only available to your listeners so when you call be sure to mention this program and you'll get a risk free trial of ... again this was only available to listeners and only if you call this toll free number\nIt's one eight hundred eighty two three nine for two zero\nSo if you're feeling the symptoms of stress the lack of sleep the low energy pain and stiffness and your muscles and joins your body is telling you is lacking the calcium and magnesium it needs to handle the effects of everyday stress you know if you're concerned maybe about bone health or osteoporosis do you want to improve your heart health your digestive health\nAnd even reduce or eliminate the effects of stress I encourage you tried the ... formula only have to do is pick up the

to ensure that you've got the proper nutrients in your system specifically calcium and magnesium\nAnd how much of an impact that has on our overall health so I guess one of the things that people should really be aware of is because of this isn't an instant thing that triggers you to say oh I'm sick but you know instead happens gradually over time\nIt's very possible that people might not even be aware that there is a deficiency of calcium and magnesium and their\nBody well that's the thing is that a deficiency is or not like I'm going to have a water main break in or you have a real noticeable thing the right to their little trips little leaks here and there and so what we have is a cumulative effect\nWhere a person starts to go downhill just a little bit at a time yeah to the point where they don't realize how bad they've actually gotten before it's too late\n[laughter] not your bank is he would mention insomnia we talked about that a little bit what about back pain\nCalcium many of them is excellent for back pain because the calcium goes into the muscles magnesium actually helps the translators and the nerve\nAnd when you take us combat formula many times it will calm your back pain wow I Know I I a couple of years ago I herniated disc in my back ... and I was trying to everything and I took out the comics formula and I drank it and I couldn't believe the difference within about a half hour\nI was functional again not wasn't completely gone but I I drank it over a ten day period in it at a completely alleviated the problem\nNow what about heart disease\nHeart disease is\nOr something you have to watch out for both dietary and going down the genetic line yeah and if anyone had any history of heart disease or you've even had bypass surgery you should be on his comics formula and I can't say that without enough emphasis because it's something that will completely give you a new lease on life\nIsn't that amazing we talked about arthritis what
