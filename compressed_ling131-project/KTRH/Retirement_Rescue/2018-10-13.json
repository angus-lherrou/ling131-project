{"month": "10", "state": "TX", "station": "KTRH", "content": "[noise] there's no way to say that what happened to you even if it was true and awful\nIs what happened to this woman who claims that happened\nAnd that's the bigger issue we struggle with here in much the same way that when we try to talk about race\nThere is a continuum that there is one extreme of people who are physically harmed by someone because of their race all\nThe way to the other extreme of someone who claims racism only because they want to win a lawsuit or they want to get back\nAt someone or they want to make up but they want to create a distraction from what's happened they want to get their job back that they were fired from\n[noise] you simply can't say that just because this happened to me that's what happened [noise]\nAnyway that's been on my mind I don't know if we added anything to it but let's move on from that I got a lot to your listening to Michael shell\n\n\nYears it into a thousand well\nThe belief was that Romney had won it was shocking that Obama won momma was so unpopular [noise]\nBut the guy who nailed it was a guy named Nate Silver [noise] he had created a very sophisticated\nModel that yielded the most accurate\nPredictive polling\nNow in the four years since he's not always men right but he has come to be widely respected for his methodology in in\nPolling well he tweeted today this morning the bay though coverage is kind of dumb 'cause the big story\nBig story today was that they do raise thirty eight million dollars and\nIn the third quarter the ... coverage is kinda dumb in our polling average he's gone from being down three to four points at his peak to being down six points now\nThat's not great Texas has gone from leaning Republican too likely Republican but the coverage was wrongly treating it as a toss up before and as wrongly treating it as safe Republican now\nWell part of the problem there\nIs that there was so much passionate Democrat spin trying to say that beta was\nGoing to win and text I had people call my my school there's there's by you know your ... ever wires Michael yard signs\nA vote or ... ... ... there's three of them in my neighborhood how many houses in the neighborhood I don't know if there's at least three ... five hundred house and you never yeah\nThat's um less than one percent voting for ... and maybe some people to vote for ballot don't have you aren't well I'll just say Michael crudely put some signs out here how about we look at the polling does how do we look at the historical ...\nOn your precinct and see that you're in eighty five percent Republican precinct and that's not going to change this year he's seen a more ... ... ...\nPeople get caught up in the things that don't matter the shining nickel\nPeople get caught up in stuff that doesn't matter the size of crowds at concerts the size of rallies\nYou've got millions of people in Texas\nThe fact that you can get five hundred of them to show up in Amarillo or El Paso or Dallas or Houston\nFor you to prance around and talk about how Nancy Pelosi should be the speaker of the house and Chuck Schumer should be the Senate majority leader and that's who you vote for that's great\nBut that's not where the votes are\nAnd the media has a vested interest in telling you that the candidate they're supporting and endorsing that they've fallen in love with is dead even or that he has taken the lead\nJust remember they're not to be trust period Dana you're on the show\nOh I Am just Michael berry is man this is my first\nTime calling you I'm I'm I Want to comment on your comment about people and the common thread being perfect and far persevere and\nI'm very interested in the subject mainly from the standpoint of programming your subconscious mind which when you are and you have a burning desire\nYour desire to tap and so all you have to do it never give up keep going after it in spite of any evidence to the contrary you will get their jobs are severe\nYeah I'm I'm fascinated by the kind of mind over matter\nPhenomena and you know I look at people who run ultra marathon for instance I look at people look at a guy like Marcus la trail and he talks about the\nTraining they do is navy seals to get ready for war and to be able to persevere you know when your body is telling you that your bleeding out you've\nBeen shot multiple times you're falling off the side of multiple mountains and you're probably going to die and everyone who came in with you has already died that the natural inclination is to shut down and simply die right there but the mind over matter to push beyond that\nTo push through that\nI'm Marcus has a friend named David ... they're doing the Patriot tour next month and I'm going to moderate Ramon I'm pretty excited about and David ... is a Navy SEAL he's one of the very few black navy seals in America's ever had\nAnd he decided remember his story he decided he was like a hundred pounds overweight size will start running and now he runs a ultra marathons hundred miles he runs a hundred miles\nYour body is telling you it eggs he ran so far at one point that the bones in his feet were broken from the pounding and he continued on and his kidneys had shut down miles before and he continued through pushed through and finish the race\nMost of us our body is telling us through pain to stop to stop doing what you're\nDoing if you're running that pain is telling you your body is is enduring potential damage you need to stop\nAnd walk\nDon't push through any further and this is true in every way\nI was having lunch with a friend of mine today and we were talking about Asians who come to this country and how successful um we were talking about uh we were at a Thai restaurant but we were talking about the Vietnamese who come here and how successful there\nAnd we were talking about the level of perseverance and I said you know I don't speak Vietnamese but when I Try it's difficult because of the inflection and the part of the mouth from which you speak and all I sit and do you realize it as hard as that is for us to learn\nThe inverse is true for the Vietnamese who come here\nAnd you see these these communities of of people who come to this country and succeed can you imagine how easy it would be to give up\nIf you could just teach your kids when they fail to continue trying to kick down that well if you don't say to your kid it's okay but uh you failed you know ... it's not your fault it's the teachers' fault it's the coaches\nFault it's its whatever's fault it's everybody else's fault you were if the refs fault I hear that one a lot\nNo teach your child at perseverance because I'll tell you this when your long gone and that person as an adult and you can leave them all the money in the world if they have not learn to overcome adversity they will not be in any sense of the word successful professionally personally\nIn any way but if they are if they're a survivor\nIf they're uh persevere [noise] ... [noise]\nGovernment to say that so so here's the deal last time you're on the show Chris ... because you you know it was ... all the things you've done which is really incredible you're you're working career and the successor you've had\nWhy does somebody from that side of the ledger that being the the big companies you know when you're running you know the mutual fund for them and and things like that how do you go I'm going to step back I'm going to join a family owned business in Houston I'm going to go hang out with Troy adjusting to sharpen oak harvest how did that decision come about\nThat decision was twenty plus years in the making Iran large mutual fund pension fund endowment money for about Fifteen Years\n... hedge fund money off and on for about five years and ah you know had some time to to think and reflect after the crash in two thousand two thousand nine and change of career path I had some opportunities to leave Houston and manage money elsewhere for big organizations\nAnd at the end of the day kind of looked at where I was happy is where I was most successful I was happy is working on small teams whether there are small team in a big company or a small team\nYou know Fifteen person company I've done that in the past largely because those big mutual fund\nAnd he's particularly the active ones you know all the names out there are now almost entirely driven by the marketing departments in sales departments\nAnd they're not driven by the clients and I wanted to work some place that was coined focus for investment management\nYou know sit down and meet with a client understand their goals and objectives and then invest the money for their goals and objectives verse a spreadsheet that said\nWe got fifty million dollars in last friday because there was a payday yet to have it invested Monday by noon which is actually what happens now day and all these passive instruments that are starting to take over in the market\nAnd even at the big fund companies that are fantastic and what they do like a vanguard\nTheir goal and objective is different than our goal and objective for planning for our client and reaching retirement goals\nYeah so I think that's interesting you know your career paths Troy we've certainly talked about Troy and Jessica they ended up doing what they're doing an ... an obviously love helping people that's why they that's why you all do what you do is you're to help people come up with a planet and a strategy for their retirement\nAnd and doing all you can to make their retirement the one that they've always hope to dream for so Troy let's get into market volatility we know the markets and twenty Seventeen to nothing but go up and up and up there was hardly a blip on the radar I think was or even a three percent drop maybe once that was it I think February of twenty Eighteen we saw a couple of different blips where's the market at today\nSo right and this is Chris and so right now I'm we're back into a very low volatility market for the market overall so if you look at the S. and P. five hundred\nEver since the February sell off which is about eleven percent I think in two or three weeks the market is kind of recovered back to where it was at the beginning of January\nThe end of January in a relatively straight line volatility the way they measure it in the markets is around twelve\nIt got his low is I think nine somewhere around there in January when we had to kind of blow off earlier in the year I'm your correct last year was an anomaly really over the last hundred years we went up pretty much every day a point and a half\nIn a straight line and that's pretty much unheard of the interesting thing about volatility though and for managing money here at all ... is what you're seeing as a lot of single stock volatility because of the whole dynamic that I was trying to get to a little earlier about active first passive management\nSo this time of the year a lot of act managers\nLook at their portfolio of on that a big mutual fund company my tax year ended last friday the end of September or it's going to end at the end of this month it most big mutual fund companies they look over their spreadsheet see where I have a big loser semi conductor stocks financial stocks\nThey sell it almost regardless of whatever the prices because the tax loss is a bigger deal than the actual stock themselves so we're actually it'll cars as an active manager managing money individually for clients were able to take advantage of some of that dynamic in that volatility\nAround single stocks which will probably pick up again in the next week or two because earnings are coming out for single stocks now\nIn Chris actually has a a new report that he's a recently finished talking about some of these trends that we're starting to see a shift in the market\nAnd some of these dynamics play out\nAnd how we brought this report to help investors understand how to get ahead of this so if you want to copy of this investment report\nSo Chris just finished the report to three investing mistakes and how to super charger portfolio for retirement if you want to copy of the report give us a call that one eight hundred eight to two sixty four thirty four one eight hundred eight to two sixty four thirty four three investing mistakes and how to super charge a portfolio for retirement to take advantage of these trends\nAre the crust is talking about right now in the show and one thing I Want to go back in touch on there because when I\nWhen I first talked to Chris and looking at his resume I'm a couple of things came to my mind one is this guy going to have a big ego coming in\n'em and he's the most humble guy you know one of the most humble men that I've I've met so that was I'm really not only surprising but just just heartwarming honestly and the ...\nThe more I talked to Chris the more I saw that his expertise managing billions of dollars for these large mutual fund companies not just that that the accomplishment and the performance um that he's had in\nPast was going to be an advantage for our clients but some of these insider um 'em knowing what goes on with these mutual funds when they have these big sell off dates when they're doing tax harvesting in their portfolio creates opportunity\nAnd part of the harvest investment approaches to take advantage of this opportunity for you and your portfolio in retirement\nSo when you have this big mutual fund company let's say American Funds has to dump eight million shares and they're doing some some tax harvesting and even though the stock is still a good by\nThat causes the price to go down and this is really what you're getting at is the active market\nIs there's a lot less liquidity today than there was let's say Twenty years ago because so much money is going into these passively managed vanguard funds where you buy stocks when you get your money to vanguard they going by every stock in the index regardless of the price\nSo when you have active mutual fund managers are selling off particular stocks during like this tax harvesting time it doesn't necessarily mean you don't want to own those stocks but it creates a great buying opportunity\nYes dry and then we've used that opportunity over the last three weeks in front of these earnings to to buy some companies that I for clients that I thought we wouldn't have an opportunity to do but since we're not being run by the marketing department that has two hundred people involved in it for being run for our clients\nThey give us a little bit of leeway in getting the money invested and and doing what's right for them as opposed to what's right in the performance rankings that come out every year and you know I was part of it for a number of years we were ... ran the number one fund twice than ever to find a choice for extended period of time\nNumber two is good enough for main them you know person I worked with wanted to be number one that that whole dynamic is an offer to hear what is operative is let's do what's right for our client what's right to meet the goal and objective in their retirement plan or the investment plan that they have\nSo to sit down and we're going to offer the next ten callers a portfolio review where we look at your portfolio and we see where you may have a little extra risk based on your\nA comfort level based on where you are in retirement maybe you're five years away maybe you're in retirement humble we want to offer as the next ten people are complimentary portfolio review and risk assessment and you can also get a copy of the report\nAh three investing mistakes and had a super charge a portfolio and retirement based on these trends that we're seeing happening of course has been talking about on the first half of the show to set the appointment and get your portfolio review and a copy of Chris's investment report\nOne eight hundred eight to two sixty four thirty four one eight hundred eight to two sixty four thirty four\nSo this is a retirement income show with Troy sharp the c._e._o. of a chorus financial Ruben Chris parish the chief investment officer at over ... we're talking about the market today so Chris just brought up active management we're gonna talk about active management versus passive management what does that actually mean\nAnd then during your working years is it makes sense to be passive and when you get to retirement should go to active or is it vice versa or does it just depends on the situation will find out in our next segment stay with us this is the retirement income show which really sharp credit for this [noise]\nSo you're going to have enough money to travel and be there when you first

the red Sox manager for asteroids bench coach Alex Cora will counter with Chris Sale more news and a half hour valley Adams on news radio seven forty Katie our rights\nAre with us today for the retirement income show I'm Mark ... and I'm here with the c._e._o. of a Congress financial ripped Troy sharp is also a certified\nFinancial planner you like to find out more about drawing the team you'd like to find out about workshops they typically do a couple of times a week there's no cost to attend these you do have to sign up those sitting is limited all that information and more is on the website ... harvest F G dot com ... F G dot com Chris Faris\nWith us today the chief investment officer at oak harvest in Troy I Want to ask\nYou this because I Do think it's interesting you know\nIf we've worked for twenty Thirty years and most people heading into retirement now probably or it in the four oh one K. world for three or four fifty seven whatever we're not in the pension retirement world anymore like our grandparents were\nSo that means if you have all your money in a four O. one K. that means it's all in in Wall Street so as we head into retirement is at a time 'cause you never would say because you you and Chris and a team of Congress hand a lot of money in the markets it's not about pulling everything out but it's having a plan about where your money's invested I Would imagine\nIt comes back to having a bold faced retirement plan\nWhen you sit down with a professional who does retirement every single day and they understand concepts like what we call sequence risk which that's the combination of market losses and income withdrawals how that impacts your portfolio over the long term\nWhen you sit with a professional understands what the future costs of medical expenses in long term care expenses in this country and how that might impact your portfolio\nWhen you sit down with a retirement professional that understands the retired yours are so much different from a planning perspective than the working years\nYou're able to have these intelligent conversations and build a portfolio that has some protection that has some the core foundation is is preservation of principle\nAnd when you start to look at what are your income needs how much you need to withdraw\nMost importantly what I say when it comes to income is not just how much you withdraw the where do you withdraw that money from which account\nBecause there are huge opportunities to save taxes to reduce income taxes and to to make your portfolio last longer and retirement when you understand how taxes play into your retirement income decisions\nSo when you sit down with a professional who understands these more nuanced concepts of retirement planning an income taking you're able to have a better and more clear discussion about risk\nDo you need to have seven percent a year do you need to make nine percent a year or you know what based on the tax strategy the income strategy and a growth plan you really only need about four and a half five percent\nThese more nuanced discussions can lead to a very very clear understanding of how much risk you need to take in order to have a successful retirement\nAnd so once we get into this this this transition from the working years into the retired years these are the exact conversations we have with you we can ask the questions to help get a more clear picture as to to what your asset allocation needs to be in retirement\nAnd and this is so different from walking into a fidelity office or a Merrill Lynch or Morgan Stanley\nUm those guys are great at the accumulation phase they're going to put a bunch of money into mutual funds and and that's what they do but they don't have these more nuanced discussions with you about where to take income from how to reduce taxes how do we plan for long term care intelligent Lisa what's an asset on your balance sheet not an expense\nSo once you you you have these discussions about\nGoals you understand what strategies you need to employ and then we can talk to you about tools but when we look at Chris ... specifically we're talking about stocks and in in funds on the shoulder\nWe look at these tools and how we position then ended the portfolio\nMost of our clients are comfortable having some market exposure and they should you know historically stocks are the best performing asked the class and you should have some money in stocks\nSome of our clients asset protection and preservation of principles the number one thing and we we try to achieve four or five six percent growth with the least amount of risk for those people and then others they're comfortable I talked with a guy just yesterday in Ninety eight percent of his money is in stocks and he's sixty five years old he is comfortable with that amount of risk\nTo that person Christ the one who is comfortable with risk and having their money in the stock market for retirement\nWe're we're sending out the pod cast this week to our clients and this is something we send up due to all of our clients to give them and then up to the minute or update on what's going on in the market what they need to be aware of and what we're seeing from our perspective\nWe're gonna be talking about the school day lives in the three bears concept so we're seeing this this these economic numbers and economic data come in wages are rising GDP is looking solid\nJobs um are being obtained in unemployment rates are at all time low hs ... those are the good things in the economy but what about the things that are more important to the stock market\nYeah choice ... those are the are the Goldilocks economic\nFigures that are out there right now and if you turn on the TV all\nYou hear the term Goldilocks and then you see the stock market down one day or then you hear bad news and see the stock market up that day and sometimes it's hard to wrap your arms around it but\nAfter all these years I I've looked at you know what is out there that really drive stocks and we all know that that's earnings first and foremost so then there's a couple macro things out there that actually drive earnings\nAnd they're generally available to every one I mean you can pull 'em up on the Internet but if bond market yields are rising slightly that's usually a good sign you know inflation's picked up a little bit gross picked up into the bank stocks are going to make a lot more money\nIf the dollar is getting a little weaker that's usually good for companies earnings because so much of our large cat earnings in the United states comes from overseas markets in a slightly lower dollar helps their earnings\nAnd then slightly higher oil prices is the third one\nUm that if oil prices are going up slowly all the big energy companies we normal here in Houston they're making more money and so those three things are really the Goldilocks factors in earnings behind the stock market's\nThe bears are exactly the opposite so if you're straight start raising\nReally fast that's bad or if they start rallying if interest rates started to go down and believe it or not that's actually bad for stocks because earnings would be lower or if the dollar starts to rally a lot and starts to get stronger\nYou know you would think that would be a great thing 'cause money's coming to the United states where the best country in the world highest economic growth it hurts earnings and the U.S and the five hundred and then finally and that kind of the death now to the market is if you see oil prices I Know Houston would love it if oil prices go up fifty percent a hundred percent year over year", "year": "2018", "show_name": "Retirement Rescue", "city": "Houston", "day": "13"}
