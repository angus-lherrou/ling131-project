and meet with a client understand their goal and objective and then invest the money for their goals and objectives verse\nA spreadsheet that said we've got fifty million dollars in last friday because there was a payday you have to have it invested Monday by noon which is actually what happens now day and all these passive instruments that are starting to take over the market\nAnd even at the big fund companies that are fantastic and what they do like a vanguard\nTheir goal and objective is different than our goal and objective for planning for our client and reaching retirement\nGoals yeah so I think that's interesting you know your career path Troy we've certainly talked about Troy and Jessica how they ended up doing what they're doing an ... an obviously love helping people that's why they that's why you all do what you do\nIs you're to help people come up with a planet and a strategy for their retirement\nAnd and doing all you can to make their retirement the one that they've always hope to dream for so Troy let's get into market volatility we know the markets and twenty Seventeen to nothing but go up and up and up there was hardly a blip on the radar think was or even a three percent drop maybe once that was it I think February of twenty Eighteen we saw a couple of different blips where's the market out today\nRight and this is Chris and so right now we're back into a very low volatility market for the market overall so if you look at the S. and P. five hundred ever since the February sell off which is about eleven percent I think in two or three weeks\nThe market is kind of recovered back to where it was at the beginning of January\nThe end of January in a relatively straight line volatility the way they measure it in the markets is around twelve it got his low is I think nine somewhere around there in January when we\nHad to kind of blow off earlier in the year I'm your correct last year was an anomaly really over the last hundred years we went up pretty much every day point and a half and a straight line and that's pretty much unheard of the interesting thing about volatility though\nAnd for managing money here it'll ... is what you're seeing as a lot of single stock volatility because of the whole dynamic that I was trying to get to a little earlier about active first passive management\nSo this time of year a lot of act managers\nLook at their portfolio of on that a big mutual fund company my tax year ended last friday the end of September or it's going to end at the end of this month it most big mutual fund companies and look over their spreadsheet see where I have a big loser semi conductor stocks financial stocks\nThey sell it almost regardless of whatever the prices because the tax loss is a bigger deal than the actual stock themselves so we're actually it'll cars as an active manager managing money individually for clients were able to take advantage of some of that dynamic in that volatility\nAround singles stocks which will probably pick up again in the next week or two because earnings are coming out for a single stocks now\nIn Chris actually has a a new report that he's a recently finished talking about some of these trends that we're starting to see a shift in the market and some of these dynamics play out\nAnd uh we wrote this report to help investors understand how to get ahead of this so if you want a copy of this investment report so Chris just finished the report to three investing mistakes and how to super charge portfolio for retirement if you want to copy of the report give us a call that one eight hundred eight to two sixty four thirty four\nOne eight hundred eight to two sixty four thirty four three investing mistakes and had a super charger portfolio for retirement take advantage of these trends\nAre the crust is talking about right now in the show it one thing I'm going to go back in touch on there because when I when I first talked to Chris and looking at his resume I'm a couple of things came to my mind one is this guy going to have a big ego coming in\n'em and he's the most humble guy you know one of the most humble men that I've I've met so that was I'm really not only surprising but just this heartwarming honestly and the ...\nThe more I talked to Chris the more I saw that his expertise managing billions of dollars for these large mutual fund companies not just that the the accomplishment and the performance um that he's had in\nPast was going to be an advantage for our clients but some of these insider um 'em knowing what goes on with these mutual funds when they have these big sell off dates when they're doing tax harvesting in their portfolio great opportunity\nAnd part of the harvest investment approaches to take advantage of this opportunity for you and your portfolio in retirement\nSo when you have this big mutual fund company let's say American Funds has to do eight million shares and they're doing some some taxed harvesting and even though the stock is still a good five\nAt causes the price to go down and this is really what you're getting at is the active market\nIs there's a lot less liquidity today than there was let's say Twenty years ago because so much money is going into these passively managed vanguard funds where you buy stocks when you get your money to vanguard they go and buy every stock in the index regardless of the price\nSo when you have active mutual fund managers are selling off particular stocks during like this tax harvesting time it doesn't necessarily mean you don't want to own stocks but it creates a great buying opportunity\nYes joy and then we've used that opportunity over the last three weeks in front of these earnings to to buy some companies that I for clients that I thought we wouldn't have an opportunity to do but since we're not being run by the marketing department that has two hundred people involved in it for being run for our clients\nThey give us a little bit of leeway in getting the money invested and and doing what's right for them as opposed to what's right in the performance rankings that come out every year and you know I was part of it for a number of years we were random number One Fund twice and number two fun destroy said for extended period of time\nNumber two is good enough for me and them you know the person I worked with wanted to be number one that\nThat whole dynamic is an offer to hear what is operative is let's do what's right for our client what's right to meet the goal and objective in their retirement plan or the investment plan that they have\nSo to sit down and we're going to offer the next ten colors a portfolio review where we look at your portfolio and we see where you may have a

F G dot com\n... F G dot com Chris Faris with us today the chief investment officer at oak harvest in Troy I Want to ask you this because I Do think it's interesting you know\nIf we worked for twenty Thirty years and most people heading into retirement now probably Rick in the four oh one K. world for all three B. for her to seven whatever we're not in the pension retirement world anymore like our grandparents were\nSo that means if you have all your money in a four O. one K. that means it's all in in Wall Street so as we head into retirement is at a time because you never would say because you you and Chris and the team but Congress had a lot of money in the markets\nIt's not about pulling everything out but it's having a plan about where your money's invested I Would imagine\nIt comes back to having a goals based retirement plan\nWhen you sit down with a professional who does retirement every single day and they understand concepts like what we call sequence risk which that's the combination of market losses and income withdrawals how that impacts your portfolio over the long term\nWhen you said it was a professional understands what the future costs of medical expenses in long term care expenses in this country and how that might impact your portfolio\nWhen you sit down with a retirement professional that understands the retired yours are so much different from a planning perspective than the working years\nYou're able to have these intelligent conversations and build a portfolio that has some protection that has some the core foundation is is preservation of principle\nAnd when you start to look at what are your income me how much you need to withdraw\nMost importantly what I say when it comes to income is not just how much you withdraw the where do you withdraw that money from which account\nBecause there are huge opportunities to save taxes to reduce income taxes and to to make your portfolio last longer and retirement when you understand how taxes play into your retirement income decisions\nSo when you sit down with the professional understands these more nuanced concepts of retirement planning an income taking you're able to have a better and more clear discussion about risk\nDo you need to have seven percent a year do you need to make nine percent a year or you know what based on the tax strategy the income strategy and a growth plan you really only need about four and a half five percent\nThese more nuanced discussions can lead to a very very clear understanding of how much risk you need to take in order to have a successful retirement\nAnd so once we get into this this this transition from the working years into the retired years these are the exact conversations we have with you we can ask the questions to help get a more clear picture as to to what your asset allocation needs to be in retirement\nAnd and this is so different from walking into a fidelity office or a Merrill Lynch or Morgan Stanley\nUm those guys are great at the accumulation phase they're going to put a bunch of money into mutual funds and and that's what they do but they don't have these more nuanced discussions with you about where to take income from how to reduce taxes how do we plan for long term care intelligent Lisa what's an asset on your balance sheet not an expense\nSo once you you you have these discussions about\nGoals you understand what strategies you need to employ and then we can talk to you about tools\nBut when we looked at Chris the specifically we're talking about stocks and in in funds on the show today we look at these tools and how we position them into the portfolio\nMost of our clients are comfortable having some market exposure and they should you know historically stocks are the best performing asked the class and you should have some money in stocks\nSome of our clients asset protection and preservation of principles the number one thing and we we try to achieve four or five six percent growth with the least amount of risk for those people and then others they're comfortable I talked with a guy just yesterday in Ninety eight percent of his money is in ...\nFox News sixty five years old he is comfortable with that amount of risk to that person Christ the one who is comfortable with risk and having their money in the stock market for retirement\nWe're we're setting out the pod cast this week to our clients and this is something we send out to to all of our clients to give them and then up to the minute or update on what's going on in the market what they need to be aware of and what we're seeing from our perspective\nWe are to be talking about the school day lives in the three bears concept so we're seeing this this these economic numbers and economic data come in wages are rising GDP is looking solid\nJobs um are being obtained in unemployment rates are at all time low hs ... those are the good things in the economy but what about the things that are more important to the stock market\nYeah choice ... those are the are the Goldilocks economic\nFigures that are out there right now and if you turn on the TV all\nYou hear that turned Goldilocks and then you see the stock market down one day or then you hear bad news and see the stock market up that day and sometimes it's hard to wrap your up your arms around it but\nAfter all these years I I've looked at you know what is out there that really drive stocks and we all know that that's earnings first and foremost so then there's a couple macro things out there that actually drive earnings\nAnd they're generally available to everyone I mean you can pull him up on the Internet but if bond market yields are rising slightly that's usually a good sign you know inflation's picked up a little bit gross picked up into the bank stocks are going to make a lot more money\nIf the dollar is getting a little weaker that's usually good for companies earnings because so much of our large cat earnings and the United states comes from overseas markets in a slightly lower dollar helps their earnings\nAnd then slightly higher oil prices is the third one\nUm that if oil prices are going up slowly all the big energy companies when all mall here in Houston they are making more money and so those three things are really the Goldilocks factors in earnings find the stock market's\nThe bears are exactly the opposite so if interest rates start raising\nReally fast that's bad or if they start growling if interest rates started to go down and believe it or not that's actually bad for stocks because earnings would be lower or if that dollar starts to rally a lot and starts to get stronger\nYou know you would think that that would be a great thing 'cause money's coming to the United states where the best country in the world highest economic growth it hurts earnings and the U.S and the five hundred and then finally and that kind of a death now to the market is if you see oil prices I Know Houston would love it if oil prices go up fifty percent a hundred percent year over year\nBut that's pretty much the death knell to almost every bull market we've ever had here in the United states because Seventy to Seventy five percent of all our domestic gross domestic product you're in the United states is service based and its consumption or consumer driven economy and", "show_name": "Retirement
