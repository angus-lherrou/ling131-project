Seventeen percent higher for those at a two servings of grilled broiled or roasted meet each week\nThe risk of developing high blood pressure was also a Fifteen Percent higher and people who prefer to

bit more space so getting to the new building is a bit stressful um but it's something that that we're really looking forward to\nUm in January will be there so I mean really really excited about that\nI look forward to that and and you can probably go to the website there might be some pictures that show up every once in a while on an update on the new office\nOak harvest F G dot com\nYou know try and when you think about a lot of people go into retirement and they're confused between what is a retirement tool in what is a strategy a lot of people think that there are tools are their strategy for example I've got a four O. one K. works well that's how I'm gonna retire it's my four one K. so that is my plan before on cable four one K. is actually a tool\nNot a strategy could you talk a little bit about tools versus strategies\nYeah so you have to understand the process of retirement planning and we start our process with with you if you come in and see us for a visit what we do is we ask you what is your vision of retirement\nOkay not think about this for a second if you're if you're about to retire maybe you've just entered retirement or or maybe you've been retired for some time or maybe it's you know five ten years away and you're you know to me in to become educated about retirement but just stopped for a second and think or envision what is your retirement your best day in retirement what's that going to be like\nYou know who you're with what are you doing what does it feel like what does it sound like where are you at\nYou you start to have this vision of what retirement actually is and what this does this springs retirement from this\nMythical far off place that some day you're you're going to get to and reach it makes it more real it gives you more clarity surrounding what retirement actually means for you this for so many of us retirement is is it's in the future some something that will plan for that whenever we get there\nBut what are we planning for you know what is retirement going to be like so starts with your vision and then once you have a very very clear vision let's say you're surrounded by your your your kids and your grandkids spending time at church or spending time in the community you're maybe going on two trips a year you want to go maybe you'd like to ... and you always wanted to travel around Europe\nOr whatever your vision of retirement is just exercise is critically important to building your retirement planning in generating income\nSo you start with this vision just my wife when she she does amazing work with with women she works with all types of women single women married women divorced women with other women she makes um she has a conversation with all the women that she works with and families and she gives them this little vision book\nAnd she asked them on the first deployment to take this home and really get clear about your vision\nYou know because once you're clear about your vision we can really help you bring this vision to reality but if you don't have a clear understanding of what you want to retirement and we can't help you\nSo this is the first and most critical part of understanding tools and strategies as you have to have a vision because once you have the vision you can clearly defined your goals\nOkay once you have those clearly defined goals now all we have to do is figure out what's the best strategy and what's the best tool so here for one thing that is an account okay four O. one K. is just to section of the tax code section for all one subsection pay that deals with retirement accounts in the workplace\nOkay that's not a strategy I'm really it's not even a tool it's just an account I guess we could call it a tool and the sense that it's an account\nBut what's your four O. one K. is designed for is gross while you're working\nSo that's the strategy you want to employ while you're working inside your four O. one K. is a gross strategy now what's the best tool historically speaking to grow your money over the long term let's say a thirty year working career\nHistorically speaking stocks are the best place to invest your money if you have a long time to allow them to grow deal with the volatility so that the tool that you want to use inside your four O. one K. strategy\nThe growth strategy is a stock\nWe've written a report and the report is for people who are either retiring about to retire maybe being laid off\nAnd it's the five things to know in the four costly mistakes to avoid with your four O. one K. where do you have the next ten callers the Freeh report when an email it out to you\nAnd you have to give us a call to get that report one eight hundred eight to two sixty four thirty four one eight hundred eight to two sixty four thirty four to five things to know in the form mistakes to avoid these mistakes could save tens of thousands of dollars in your retirement accounts one eight hundred eight to two sixty four thirty four\nSo we're talking about tools versus strategies when it comes to retirement well most of you if you have ... and I raise your tools then are in Wall Street\nWhat happens if there's a market downturn [noise] we'll discuss in just a minute this is the retirement income show what choice sharp the c._e._o. of OPEC harvest financial back\nSo you're going to have enough money to travel and be there when you first grandchild is born while you can if you start planning now Sean Hannity here you know smart retirement planning includes knowing what will happen and all kinds of scenarios so how old are your portfolio performer we experience yet another quote market correction\nIt's easy to ignore these things and most people do but not you\nYou want to know the best ways to thrive in any economy\nAll Troy sharp at old harvest financial group right now eight hundred eight to two sixty four thirty four scheduled time that'd be a retirement portfolio stress tests that when you do you're going to learn how much risk you presently Kerry and what your risk exposure is during a market correction\nGet guidance on wealth and retirement knowing that Troy is going to treat you like family but as he knows that family moments like visiting your grandchildren are what's most important in life\nEight hundred eight to two sixty four thirty four oh harvest financial group eight hundred eight to sixty four thirty four [noise]\nWhen you're with us for their retirement income show I'm Mark Kelly is always I'm pleased to beer with Troy sharp of open harvest financial group you know Congress looks at it like this\nGetting paid to keep your money safe and they do this by using retirement plans that are predictable and reliable because when it comes to your retirement you need a balanced approach for growth and risk management if you have questions you can always sit down with drawing the team it's eight hundred eight two to six for three four there's no cost there is no obligation there's no pressure\nAnd when you think about your retirement lasting twenty thirty forty plus years\nThis might be the most important phone call you make and it certainly will I'm betting it'll be the most important pogo you'd make today eight hundred eight to two sixty four thirty four\nFor talking tools versus strategies when it comes to retirement IRAs coral one case those really are not strategies they are tools\nAnd and certainly you just said Troy at the end of our last segment that the best place if you need growth is to go to Wall Street well people that I have four one K. is an irate typically are and especially the four oh one K. world are in the wall street world which is also the world of risk if we're getting ready to retire saying two thousand seven\nAnd we're going to work through two thousand they retire and two thousand nine and all of our money and it was in Wall Street we lose forty fifty percent it could change the picture\nA blending growth with safety in our portfolios but we do need a lot of people anyway need you know what money in the market no challenges is what percentage should there should be there when we get to our retirement

purge steakhouse and grill I mean there's a lot of options for you can always go to the website to find out more about that and just remember there is no cost to attend these but you do need to sign up because seating\nIs limited we're talking today about retirement tools versus retirement strategy so I've got a four O. one K. and I look at that as my strategy will know what's a tool for my retirement\nAnd you know one of the challenges throwing one of the the topics you always cover in the show besides income because income is probably first and foremost what we need to take care of heading into retirement to replace those paychecks are no longer coming in but it's taxes a lot of people go into retirement feeling like okay I'm no longer getting a paycheck\nI Will be paying less in taxes than they forget that therefore when cases diaries that they haven't touched yet now they're going to start using that for income now they're paying tax obviously on every dollar that comes out that they pull out\nTaxes could go down for a little bit but more than likely want you to Seventy and a half requirement um distributions pop up or taxes can be a bigger factor\nThe new tax bill that passed in January we have the greatest opportunity in decades\nTo distribute money from our retirement accounts and pay less taxes than we would have otherwise but this is temporary\nUnder the new tax legislation the personal income tax rates that you pay today that you're going to see the savings that you're going to going to receive on your upcoming your tax return that sunsets after the year twenty twenty five\nRates are going to go back to how they were last year\nAnd a good example I had a good client come in recently Jim and his wife marine\nAnd um for for new clients when you become a new client with us we usually sit down about four to six times during that first year depending on how much planning we need to do\nSo what we do for a new clients as we lay out what to expect is this plan of implementation and let's say your goals are earning complain reducing taxes long term care legacy planning\nWell we can't do that on one visit\nSo once you you you become a client and we lay out this plan of attack this plan of implementation for you the very first two things were going to do is build you a retirement income plants that you know where you're getting your income from how much income that is how long it's going to last\nAnd how you're going to reduce taxes okay but this is something we look at it on an ongoing basis\nAnd then we'll have a review and three months answer questions make sure you're familiar with the technology and software and how to access your accounts make sure everything is working smoothly say hello answer questions et cetera\nAnd then six months some time in between three and six months will maybe take care of the long term care planning component if that's one of your goals and maybe six months we'll have another review and then we'll we'll take care of the legacy planning goals\nAnd sometimes that takes two or three months sometimes we can get it done in in in a couple of weeks just depends what entailed\nNow after this first year and we've implemented your plan\nMost people want to meet twice a year moving\nOur subject came in and he's on the twice a year review plant so Jim comes in and it was really exciting about my job is the everything\nIs when you build a retirement plan and and you know what you're doing you're good at it you build these flexibility points into the plan so when things change in the future you can pivot your strategies and you can adjust things to improve the situation whether this is increasing calmer reduce taxes whatever it may be\nSo this is this happen for a lot of our clients this year when they came in for their reviews after the tax bill formed or the tax bill passed so Jim times edited and Murray was or wasn't able to make it\nSo we're doing a review of where he's going to get his income from this year\nAnniversary of the previous plan and we start to talk about the new tax bill\nAnd he has some questions he saw it on the news but didn't really know too much about it so we're going through this with him and he says Troy we have these stocks and we have these games I think I'm going to sell my stocks outside of the retirement account I think that's the best place for me to to get my income because I Know and I sell the stocks I only pay capital gains rate which is Fifteen Percent\nSo now we have one I don't want to call it a requirement but it's a strong encouraged me before you take income from your retirement plan we always ask our clients to make sure you check with us because we want to save your taxes and if you take it from the wrong place well you'd that can't be fixed\nSo he said I'm In here this is where I Want to take my income from you needed about fifty thousand dollars\nHe says what are you guys thing I said well sounds good general will have the analysts look at it will run it through the software and we'll meet back in a week so we finish the employment reviewed his investments et cetera and Jim goes home\nThe following week he comes back in and breathe able to come into this time and you know Nancy ... greets them up they're really good friends with Nancy at the front desk and she gets in their cookies and uh they like milk so we have cookies and milk\nAnd we sit in and we say Jim we got some really good news for you because of the new tax law what we want to do is we want to take some of the these moneys from your retirement account\nThe rest of your income we want to take from the non diary accounts and this is going to do two main things for you one it's going to create three thousand dollars in savings on Social Security taxes which Murray was thrilled about this because she loves her Social Security income\nAnd not only that but I'd taking the money this way taking the income this way now for the rest of the year your dividends and capital gains are going to be tax free\nSo this was really really cool and we've been able to do this for a lot of people this year with when your adjusted gross income is less than about Seventy eight thousand dollars with the new law your dividends and capital gains are tax rate\nWhen you understand the tax code and and how it's like a snowball and depending where you take income from it causes your snowball to either get bigger or smaller\nAnd there's really for things you need to be aware of your", "year": "2018", "show_name":
