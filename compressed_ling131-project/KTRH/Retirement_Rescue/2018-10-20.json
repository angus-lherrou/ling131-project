broiled or roasted meet each week\nThe risk of developing high blood pressure was also a Fifteen Percent higher and people who prefer their food well done\nWell grilling isn't something you should

of course Chris parish destroy said in these guys and electrical engineering degree from Georgia Tech graduated semi ... got his Harvard MBA and now Troy you got your GED finally right you finally got the\nWay that you're a Florida State grad and you're a certified financial planner so you you can hang in there I guess where the Harvard NBA gay [laughter] well\nJeez marked I see how you really think about and that is\nSo you know we're talking about obviously something that that people get emotional about and I think this little number and all the other that both of you talk about this because I Do think this is the challenge\nFor people like me that do not work in the financial world I mean Troy you and Chris work in this world day in and day out helping pre retirees and retirees come up with a plan that makes sense for their situation that gives them the opportunity to live their retirement they've always dreamed of\nNineteen eighty to twenty Fifteen if you just look at this as some ... five hundred during that time period at thirty five year span Nineteen eighty to twenty Fifteen yesterday was a twelve and a half percent gain during that thirty five year period\nBut if you missed twenty of the biggest days in a thirty five year period your return was now seven point two percent so positive but five percent a little over five percent down and here's the one that's just crazy if you miss the biggest fifty days in a thirty five years banned from Nineteen eighty twenty Fifteen here again was only two point two percent\nThat's incredible to me out of a three thirty five years spanned fifty days took us from twelve and a half percent gain to a to point two percent game that's where the emotions come into this whole thing don't they yeah\nYou know in Chris and I were just talking the other day\nYou know part of our job is to make sure that we're not taking the advice of our clients [laughter] I mean to say you know one way 'cause you know we have some clients that I'm emotions you know really\nYou know way on them and and really drive their decision making process so we have a patient investment process here where we want to take advantage of opportunities as they present themselves\nBut a lot of times clients you Troy the market's going straight up we need to be all invested we need to buy right now and they're trying to tell us to buy you know you know sometimes we see often they're trying to tell us to buy at the very top of the market and that's their emotions they're seeing the market go up they don't have historical perspective\nThey don't have ... what would I be calling the Paris indicator um which is a kind of lets us know internally systems and and things that we have in place to let us know when good buying opportunities happened in in\nTypically and he's having two to four times a year but they allow their emotions to dictate when they want to be in the market and then they allow their emotions to dictate when they want to get out of the market\nSo a professional money manager professional investment advisor part of our job is to to help\nHave those conversations with you and take that emotion off your plate so we can make\nA well thought out an emotional decisions about your goals your situation and when is the best time for um for for the money to get invested to give you the largest potential for a good rates of return over the long haul in the market\nSo when you look at those numbers missing what'd you say mark the top fifty days the return of the U.S and the five hundred over the past thirty five years goes from twelve percent a year twelve and a half percent to a to point to and that's why we don't want to be in the situation where you're trying to time the market you're trying to get in there trying to get out\nBecause when you you allow your emotions to dictate your decisions oftentimes you're you're making that decision at the wrong time and your costs to yourself you know these big days in the market which can really make a difference in your portfolio overtime\nSo what we're going to do is for the next ten callers we're going to provide a free portfolio review make sure you're in

what happens is just Chris has a very expensive at a time twenty five years in the financial world and it's certainly done some incredible things Troy is super excited have Christmas part of the carbon steam\nSo we're talking about the markets today and Chris I'm gonna ask you a question because you've\nWorked with the number one and the number two mutual funds and in an entire year according to the lip or report or whatever that's pretty impressive most of us like me don't really get all that so it sounds really good I'm impressed so here's my question\nWe're seeing volatility and twenty eight team that we did not seeing twenty Seventeen so my guess is it twenty Seventeen is the abnormal year where there was no voluntarily whatsoever because if I look at history and over a hundred and Thirteen year period from Nineteen hundred twenty Thirteen\nThere have been a hundred and twenty three market corrections during that time period which means\nAt least one correction per year maybe sometimes to and during that same time period Nineteen hundred and twenty Thirteen there have been thirty to bear market which is a drop of twenty percent or more now the corrections tend to Nineteen percent so we are talking ten percent or more of happened under twenty three corrections during that time thirty to bear markets\nThis how the markets work right Chris they go up they go\nAnd that goes sideways and if you're trying to rely on the income from Wall street to fund your entire retirement that means you got kind of what if income doesn't it\nAllies speak out about this show these

F G dot com of course also with us today is Chris parish crust the chief investment officer at ... financial group and\nYou know we were talking during the break guys and you know Chris you brought up and kind of an interesting point then Troy and I discussed is probably a month or two ago about tools versus strategies a lot of people like me to do work in a financial think hey my four oh one K. that is my strategy while the four one K. as a tool\nRight so we do get caught up in tools versus strategies that they're different and a lot of people think that the the tools are the strategy that's not how it works at a car but certainly Chris really what do you think about it it's the tools needed to do what you need to have happen for your retirement I guess\nYeah it's it's it's having more than one golf club in your bag right if you if you only have a driver you know maybe that's the stock market and you're young that's great you can get at three hundred yards and and recover but if you get older you want more tools you want more diversification 'cause you're you're game requires a little more flexibility and adaptability to life\nDidn't realize until I came in worked here really that\nYou know when you're younger your financial life is pretty simple you make money you save money you invest in the rents in a repeat it's only when you start retiring that your financial life gets very complicated and where's the income going to come from you know what are the taxes I'm going to pay how do I get money out of my four one K. window and take Social Security\nThose all ... all require different strategies and different tools you need more clubs in the bag to play the game and that's really what we do here at all ... we just have more tools available to meet your financial goals and objectives and create flexibility\nWhen people said you know come in and sit down with you I think a lot of times people think well Troy and Chris do car resorted to give me my retirement plan and the one thing that it is not would be set in stone right has\nTo be flexible because it doesn't matter if you're Ninety years of age or you're Thirty years of age life comes at you and things are all your curve balls were coming all the time it seems this plan that you put in the process you go through with your clients and your prospective clients is not something in stone it's flexible it's got to be able to adjust to whatever's going on doesn't it\nYeah and not only has to be able to adjust but here's the the critical part your advisor has to have the skills to to adjust with the times in retirement as they changed the economic times the tax environment\nThe um different legislative actions that take place that had an impact on your retirement accounts on your dividends on your your stocks on your your interest\nYou need a combination of of of skills to successfully helped people retire in this environment\nSo you know when we started oh harvest financial group I share my story several times my grandfather who raised me became sick he had to ... when he retired\nI spent two years with him helping him go through this different nursing homes home health care my grandparents retired with two million dollars they spend a million dollars in the first couple of years of retirement\nSo I see how unforeseen incidences in retirement can impact somebody's life savings so when we started oak harvest Jess than I and my wife\nWe agreed that we wanted to assemble a team of people that\nGave us the best opportunity\nMost talent the most capability to help the most amount of people in this country retire with success in this environment that we're in extremely challenging and one thing that we've learned over time is that it is it the environment changes so rapidly\nAnd unexpectedly you know if you think back to twenty sixteen leading up to the presidential election this is just one example\nYou know retirement plans that we're putting in place twenty twelve twenty Thirteen twenty fourteen twenty Fifteen twenty sixteen we had no idea what was going to happen in twenty Seventeen or Eighteen we had no idea that President Trump was going to become President Trump you know he was apprentice Trump back then The Apprentice star Trump to President Trump\nAnd the tax laws were going to change and we were going to be gifted this tremendous opportunity to take money out of our IRAs it cheaper rates than ever before in history\nBut the plans that we put in place back in twenty ten and twenty twelve and twenty Fifteen and twenty Seventeen were able to do things today that are helping those people because one we assembled a team of highly talented and skilled and experienced people in retirement but the plants that we built for flexible back\nTo be able to take advantage of these tax law changes today\nSo it's not just the flexibility it takes a lot of skill to build flexible flexibility into a retirement plan but then also you need a team of people\nYou know not far off in some New York branch of far off in some Denver branch but right here in Houston in your backyard that you can come and sit down with a look at your retirement look at the income numbers and talked to a team of people and say hey you know this is what I'm thinking about doing what he what do you guys think\nAnd then you know you're going to get confident\nYou know reliable answers in direction from a team of investment advisers that have these different skills that can help you maintain this this plan we set forth one year ago five years ago ten years ago in with you through retirement and that's really the yoke harvest difference that's the big big difference between your brokerage firms\nThat are getting commission for buying and selling stocks and mutual funds versus the harvest away which is investment advisors fiduciary building plans working with you through retirement to\nKnow how do we take income from the IRA non I area counts all these different places how do we keep taxes down highway playing for long term care\nYou know that's the difference in in in what the harvest way means\nSo if you want to sit down and have a conversation about retirement I encourage you to come in and have a visit with us in our team\nThe phone number to do that is one eight hundred eight to two sixty four thirty four we have seven locations across Houston where you can sit down with an advisor and have this discussion about retirement if you want to see me if you want to see Chris you can come over to our headquarters up here on simply ban boss\nWe're only going to be here until December though 'cause we have a new office in memorial city come January one assuming all the permitting and everything goes through and we get the buildup completed which I'm praying for\n'em but give us a call come in the U.S let's sit down let's talk about retirement and let's get you on a better course than where you currently are give you more clarity more understanding and more flexibility", "show_name": "Retirement Rescue", "year": "2018", "city": "Houston", "day": "20"}
