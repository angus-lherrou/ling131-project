she's going to now like\nI'm not I'm gonna I'm gonna tell you the answer is ah when I was an organizer you know before you and I met I was a community organizer I used to organize protests like the scene of going to\nPeople's workplaces or you know not just the halls of Congress right which are that's where the people's business is supposedly down but we're talking people's lawns cetera\nUm you know look I support kind of free speech absolutist I support free speech on all sides so am I and the and these protests those sorts of protests now make me uncomfortable and look I did speak out\nA you know going up to you know and I are costing people in restaurants or you know what happened to Sarah Huckabee Sanders et cetera I Do think you are\nI I Love you say you're dancing on science

know that that if we talk about\nViolent rhetoric and we're going to look I think it's all bad\nBut like ...\nRhetoric is now the attack of the the hard the hard left you don't people don't like when when the president says you know fake news and they're not real news people and their phony journal is I think that's just that's the exercise of free speech and my hearing you write used to organize protests in front of people's houses\nYou didn't hear me correct yes why would you do that knowing that there could be kids women and children in the house because I kind of a rule leave the women and children alone\nWell I I I haven't met maybe maybe ... to ...

I wasn't there I only watched what when the fights that started the videos that that everybody's been putting on line\nAnd um\nI got to be honest I think Rand Paul and we saw what happened in the Brett Kavanaugh hearings during the hearings which is fine that was free speech I didn't have any problem with that at all I think we've gotten to the point where we're going to have to kick out citizens so that the men and women are now hunger is get to walk the halls\nWithout what's now becoming I think a dangerous confrontations own and I met her\nIn protest on the left and and the right in Congress including disrupting earrings and by the way all within the last ... or ...\nYeah but I say I don't have a problem with the with the speaking part but I Do have a problem if they're not letting these people walk there screaming at them they're in their face\nAnd if something's gonna happen Sally here's the praise my fear is just rhetoric is now crossed the line if you're talking about physical violence confronting members of the government you know you know one thing I and I pull the table and play it for you right now\nI always said about Obama that number one leaves kids alone that both he and Michelle seem like good parents they really did and I ... and I also said we've got to protect our presidents and I said it when Obama was president so many times I can play a loop of it if you like to hear\nWhat I don't need to but what I Would love you to play it again\nLook first of all you're ignoring the wishes of nonviolent protest the phone calls to petition the whatever those are the marching orders and\nSecond of all your your seem to be ignoring examples of Donald Trump really when people were stood up for him saying I've got to hurt and if you know I'll defend you in court don't worry about it and you talk marching orders for violent\nOkay I remember one nothing has happened no nothing so sort of like well what I was saying oh no no no no I mean if you want me to question\nI didn't take that as is the same intensity and messages I'm hearing regularly but this is an everyday thing that is now happening with the Democratic party and by the way I have the evidence of me saying about Obama only\nPlay with ... ... you're talking about protecting the president of the United states of America and it's just there's no room for error\nYou've got to protect the president that that represents the free world so they've got a very difficult job they've got to almost be perfect and any time any incident happens a lot lately is becoming pretty high profile and\nMr Speaker you're gonna have strong feelings about this we've now learned that this guy that broke into the White House not only did he get in the door\nBut he knocked down the secret service agent went into the three different rooms of the White House and pass the stairs that would have gone right up to the the residents of of the Obamas that is extraordinarily chilling to me huh yeah You're welcome\nSally called\n... ... ... here's what I think we agree on violence is that I Hope we both agree that the thing I Will and I have actually and written that\nUh you know Hillary
