was struck\nBy the way his new book is that why we fight or defeating America's enemies with no apologies thank you both for being here you know Bernie ...\n... you know I listen to Hillary yesterday compared to what you said a week ago I listen to you know Andrew Cuomo worst governor in New York history say conservatives he they're not New Yorkers they don't belong here I had every other governor in the country inviting me to move there which would be the smartest thing I can do because I wouldn't pay as much in taxes\nAnd and now yes they say no e pluribus own them and I'm like just so full of crap\nThey listen to what I saw yesterday you know them trying to put the blame on the president then baking vision or as you know Sean rush much I walked off for CNN uh they they stuck\nBranded in the middle of a broadcast they said that he was going to talk about the device that was ... which I thought was a good idea the general public some insight as to profiling\nPackaging whatever the case may be um and then he got on for a ten minute blast of the president I just think it's bizarre I think it's way over the top I said\nThey're going to get what happened in Bernie you if you're sitting on the set of CNN explaining and detailed and you left and they'd send cameras following you for ten minutes\nI ... what happened I was on the ... we were already introduced to do a segment on on the devices and the investigation and then they interrupted and said that run it was going to speak about specific device being sent that was sent to CNN and his name\nUm but then he got on and he went on this ten minute tirade against the president\nAnd you know I didn't have any objection to him being on I thought this was a guy that has credibility in the agency that can talk about profiling could talk about targeting could talk about packaging could talk about what to look for it give the general public some real insight as well but\nBrandon is referred to the president as a traitor and Britain is up to his eyeballs and all the corruption involved in the deep state\nAnd he went on a tirade against the president so I took the earpiece off I took the bike off and I walked off and the producers chase me down the block trying to get me to come back we're calling me\nBut you know what an office enough already ... listen this is a time you need to unify the country like Giuliani and I did in the aftermath of September eleventh\nThis is not a time for division\nAnd CNN and granted we're at the max dividing uh ... the audience that was watching the show\nThere is no conservative out their Sebastian Gorka ... nobody ever it's\nNot being conservatives that have been you know saying things I Dream an awful lot of blowing up the White House\nUm it's been Hollywood that wants to punch the president in the face and showing ... heads of the president\nAnd those that talked about a killing the president et cetera um that's been the rhetoric of the left the media's been virtually silent it's ... it's Republicans and conservatives and you know secretary Nielsen Pam Bondi and Sarah Sanders now Henry Kissinger Kevin McCarthy's office a Boulder is thrown through it\nUm and Ted Cruz and his wife and Mitch McConnell and his wife you know we've been saying that we better be really careful here it's I've been saying for weeks now\nGoing back to the Capitol hearing so I was saying we better clear the halls of Congress somebody's going to get hurt somebody's gonna get killed and no one will hold you know the rhetoric gets ratcheted up\nAnd then those people that were silent when it's a Republican\nNow or oh this is outrageous we can't have those kind of rhetoric this is this is horrible he can't fake news they are fake news\nThough they are and we need to keep using that phrase and I'd also like to congratulate the commission of just doing what he did yesterday that was a cabin or moment whether you stood up the truth I I just like one person on the list of who it is CNN anybody tell me which Republican which member of either the media\nAll the political leadership made political profit\nA Bernie saw this woman shooting Steve ... which Republican member of the\nThe pop the all the media profit to personally profit for his side of the rice and off the white powder was mailed to the Trump family members of the cabinet off the individuals were\nThat happened three weeks ago President Trump FBI Director re a defense secretary Mattis and and the CIA and the ... all all had rice and mailed to them by the way I've had white powder mailed to me\nA ... over the years I mean it's a horrible thing that anybody has to go through we all want to catch him several responsible here uh but whoever it is is not somebody that would be that we would do as a quote conservative and it's just some nut job or some lunatic on what it doesn't matter what their politics are\nWhy why is it OK\nWhy is it okay for CNN to Ron tyrants today blaming Donald Trump for not taking responsibility for these are tempted leather bums why is that okay when the ... Republican profited from congressmen actually getting shot that at a baseball field very close to where I Am\nSpending about by left wing activist\nThis is this is the double standards that the average American see through and this is why we're going to vote down ticket Republicans on November the sixth because they had enough of the lives of the double standards\nYou know it's the same thing burning and I agree with Sebastian that you know it showed a lot of courage what you did yesterday but I've known you so long I Know that's who you are\nAnd it comes so second nature to you you don't even think about it I got to take a quick break more with NYPD Commissioner Bernie Carrick more with Dr Sebastian Gorka and more of your calls and then later on\nCongresswoman hopefully soon to be senator from Tennessee Marsha Blackburn a very important race there hey listen I\nWill tell you that my pillow changed my life it just works I Love it I Can't be without it\nI fall asleep faster I I stay asleep longer now my pillow as out Dunn themselves they take in what they do for your head and your neck and sleeping and they've added to your entire asleep experience by creating the my pillow mattress topper you put it on top of your mattress\nAnd it is like you are sleeping on a cloud it's my pillow for your whole body it's amazing you get my pillow phone for support they need it as transitional phone to help relieve pressure points it's ultra saw\nPatented temperature regulating cover and it has a ten year warranty\nAnd a covered that's washable ... made in the U.S backed by Mike sixty they unconditional money back guarantee in other words my pillow for the whole body all the support and the better sleep you want and deserve right now if you go to my pillow dot com or call eight hundred nine one nine six zero nine zero\nGet the my pillow mattress popper mentioning my name Hannity you saved thirty percent and you get to standard my pillows absolutely free it's my pillow dot com promo code Hannity you will love sleeping on a cloud like I Do\nOSHA mainstream medium day\nThis is Sean Hannity show [noise]\n\nThinking about life insurance what if you could make one free phone call and learn your best price for nearly a dozen highly rated price competitive companies well that's exactly what happens when you call ... life for example Georgia's forty he was getting sky high\nWe still have this is actually the north and actually they point as it's lacking that left lane at that point from evergreen on the south I'm trying to mediate that did cleared up that accident at south more and what that means I construction and moved out there and I tend to feed her lane\nThat's not going to write lane is happening from del Dale getting London and the cuts window dot com twenty four hour traffic that are\nAbout what you're forced right or whether you're protects us all of the state kind of dry it out all that tropical moisture left is heading for the Atlantic coast now or temps tonight down to fifty four degree sunshine Seventy five for friday and in the eighties was sunshine this weekend I'm Scott worry more the weather channel\nWe've got a little sun peeking through sixty seven at the ... north said Lexus weather center ... by ... steam cleaning\nThree thirty one or top story the Dow fell more than six hundred points yesterday but today bounce back with a gain of four hundred one to finish it twenty four thousand Ninety five NASDAQ gained two hundred ten points that she'll be five hundred up forty nine oil at sixty seven oh for\nFrost bank says it'll nearly double edge bank branch presidents in Houston by opening twenty five additional branches in the next two years\nThe world's biggest balance house come into Houston this weekend Guinness world record says the big bounce America is forty times the size of the average balance house and four times bigger than the previous record holder\nHouston residents of donated more to president Donald Trump's reelection campaign and the people of any other Texas City data from the federal election committee says used donations are donated nearly Seventy five grand to Trump's campaign as of June thirtieth\nWho's on demand to Katie arrayed shot calmer next update at four o'clock breaking information as it happens now more the Sean Hannity show I'm Scott credited Houston's news weather and traffic station news where you're sitting forty Katie are rich\nThis report is Roger you by sterling McCall Toyota\nLeads to do twenty eight teams can't really automatic whatnot for thirty six foot\nCalled Toyota dot com shop uses favors Chevy dealer at Lone Star shoving a tech sixteen thousand dollars off him as our fear of a new two thousand a do over on Oprah kept going on today at Lone Star Chevrolet dot com part comes there's a tuna ...

general from the great state of West Virginia Patrick Morrisey sir congratulations seems to be a very big comeback\nI'm early polls didn't look good in the beginning but I guess maybe we're getting more accurate polling as we get closer to a election day\nWell Shawn thanks so much for having me on and I think what you're seeing in West Virginia is that voters are really focusing on the ...\nIt's just between the candidates as you can see from my ads I'm a conservative fighter will help advance the Trump jobs agenda and mansions or dishonest Washington liberal\nThe more and more people drilled down on mansions record he's starting to lose support so we feel very good and we're going to win on election day we just have to keep out working on the way we have\nYou know I was really worried during the Obama years about our friends in West Virginia because of the the burdensome regulation driving coal miners out of business and it was one of our our best resources and we have clean coal and we have\nYou know people brave enough to go in the minds I have great admiration for anybody that does that because frankly you know you go so deep into the ground and it's dangerous work\nBut it's but energy in the life a lot of our economy and once Donald Trump got elected which by the way would have never happened to Joe Manchin on his way 'cause he supported Hillary Clinton um you know look at what happened at the state of West Virginia all those coal mining jobs are coming back thank God\nFor well thank goodness for President Trump and I have to tell you I spent a lot of the last six years suing the Obama administration uh Shaun we were the office that took the lead nationally to go against the Obama power plant one that very big victory at the U.S Supreme Court\nAnd you look at Joe mansion Joe Manchin supported Hillary Clinton even after she said we're going to put a lot of coal miners in coal companies out of work so on the issue of coal on the issue of life on the second amendment there couldn't be a bigger contrast in America between two candidates and\nThe more people are hearing about that the better off we are\nAnd I basically have help serve as a bridge to President Trump's really strong policies that West Virginians really appreciate and so that's one of the president's coming very strongly behind me he knows I'm going to be a staunch advocate for his agenda because it's good for West Virginia\nYou would know better than I probably should have looked at before having you on today uh I meant to actually at one point what percentage of the time those
