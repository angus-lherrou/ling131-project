control group you know what our staff as saying well we'll wait till after the election to bring up Trump impeachment to voters get over it we can't do it now we got a line now\nWith you know three weeks Twenty one days election they why would we ever tell people the truth people just can't know McCaskill\nAnd Obama essentially the same views on everything wow now the people in Missouri I Hope you're paying close attention but it's bigger than that a project Vera tosses got this undercover video they got the undercover video the week before about former governor of Tennessee Bredesen Marsha Blackburn is now up by fourteen points\nBecause on that tape it's the same line he'll he'll do the right thing when he gets there of course we don't agree with everything Trump says no not at all do what ... what we're saying we vote for cabinet of course he wouldn't vote for Kavanaugh\nI mean this is all part of a light campaign propaganda campaign and it's all about power\nAnd it's being exposed at a very high level I mean this is really you know seeing people how they really are is should be so enlightening to the people a tendency in Missouri a James O'Keefe is with us She's the founder of project Vera toss\nExposing the senators I you know I watch this and I'm just like what a bunch of liars\nThat's all I think when I see those great job\nYeah Sean this is a pattern you know we really the Tennessee won the Tennessee Senate candidate bread is and you know responded by fondling and bumbling his words caught red handed these are all the staff or Sean inside Claire McCaskill's office they're all saying essentially the same thing when it comes to Obama\nGun control impeachment they're all saying that we have to do one thing before the election and do another thing afterwards some of that audio is a little hard to hear but\nOne of those powerful pieces was when the sky Glenn Winfrey wanna McCaskill staffers explains to our journalist when we asked so what do we tell the moderates what after we did the impeachment because we're going to have to mislead them\nAnd the guy goes will tell them get over it\nAnd that's the that's the ... it's that this is that the guy next arose field organizer tells us he says a quote people just can't know unquote than the cast on Obama had the same views now I confronted neck on the street yesterday with the microphone ethnic why don't you why don't you tell the truth\nAnd of course the reason is and this is true in Missouri it's true in Tennessee is true in North Dakota oh some of these red state Democrats they have to lie to the voters to get elected it it's a necessary condition so all we're doing is exposed\nAnd you know once you agree with that point they don't have the lie they have to lie if they want to win and ... it's a question of whether or not they will put aside any any sense of decency honor honesty\nAnd embrace any level of truth and they won't and that's the point and you know I think everybody on this showing on TV if you look the houses and play the senators and play if you vote for any Democrat in the house you're voting for polo see\nYou both for Claire McCaskill or Bredesen or a high camp or cinema or Donnelly or Bill Nelson you're voting for Schumer because that's who's going to own them in control them that's what they're going to vote to be their leader\nWell you know and and Sean and some of these states like Missouri in particular the pro life Democrats and pro gun Democrats used to be a thing decades ago misery with the stalwart when it came to those things but that's a shrinking\nGroup of people and and people like Claire McCaskill have to stay in order to when they have to or they think they have to mislead\nAnd again this is a Greek chorus of staffers these staffers are not necessarily villainous I suppose there is on us because they're going along with it but just telling the truth so tiny very interesting to see British and after we played those tapes on your radio last week\nCredits and talk to local media this is kind of the Senate candidate he told all the local media stations well you know these these young guys were caught and kind of misled staffers who while they don't work for me when in fact they did he apologized so it's going to be\nVery uh by the way and that was a lie to the first thing he said well they're they're just college kids no they weren't they actually work for him\nAnd the guy I Apologize this guy brown who is that the Democratic spokesperson for the British in campaign he actually apologize to the media can you believe that Sean apologized\nFor misleading people without our videos so it's very interesting to see how McCaskill's going to respond now this guy Josh Hawley the Senate candidate that's running against a McCaskill has responded he's tweeted out this video\nUm he's jumping all over it so the question is the really interesting thing is because\nWe're going to get him on the program a limited this week I mean we're basically following the work you're doing you know one of the question is going to ask but go ahead finish your thought\nWell I was going to say that McCaskill has in this video it's she says of course I'd vote on a ban some type of gun ban we asked her staff or what type of ban is that he's had semi automatic rifles now this is an issue that nobody wants to talk about Missouri particularly Claire McCaskill so we're\nHoping that she gives a clear unequivocal answer about what her positions are on the gun issue and that's going to be very interesting if we can somehow get her to speak on the record publicly about this now that we've caught her red handed\nWell I again I think that you're rocking the world of big state Senate candidates\nAnd exposing them for who they really are look I've been saying and explaining for a long time now what the agenda is what they want endless investigations although they'll stop the investigations that help them the ... they'll they'll protect their deep state buddies\nThat conspired to to first stop Donald Trump remember winning and then later to destroy him um and then they will have endless investigations impeachment if they can do it\nThey want their crumbs back they're even saying that openly they're hiding their positions on open borders and eliminating ice they're not talking about really wanting to keep Obamacare under any circumstances and that's what they want to do and stop the president's agenda that's been working so these tapes\nI think expose what's going on in every congressional and Senate district except you don't have the manpower to get every single one but you've gotten a couple of big people are already\nWe've got we've got and request to do it in every everywhere and we have to be a judicious about where we do it and when we pull people out because I could have gotten more missions if ice but there's you know it's people are already early voting and some of these states and they ... the bigger issue is like I said he last week or the few days ago\nAbout don't lie to the people I ask this guy next arose when I saw him on the street yesterday said why do you have to why do you feel the need to lie why why is our politics so broken that that becomes a condition to having to win the honest because voters aren't going to\nEnd in Tennessee this guy just lost there's a new poll out New York times poll and he's down fourteen points after video it doesn't help you when people find this stuff out but some of these senators Sean only going to run for one term so they say like Heidi Heitkamp\n... ... yeah they said well I mean that's the point\nForty Katie RA trafficking whether together\nHere to London [noise] always about

Christian cinema is imploding out in Arizona\nProject Vera toss with the tape that they release the Claire McCaskill is devastating that she's hiding what she's running on the same happened to governor governor Bredesen and Tennessee have Heidi Heitkamp was already down by double digits Joe Donnelly is in big trouble\nUh we now see Heller was very important to see it in Nevada he's now a by seven in the latest poll at least eight I'm really worried about right now is Florida and Rick Scott just has done an amazing job for the people of Florida\nWell yeah and then the hurricane obviously that that was devastating but but the response next to hurricanes and I remember that benefit there in the last year where we're Scott has really shown if you remember Shawn the two thousand twelve election\nRight here in Jersey uh that's where Hurricane Sandy hit and the President Obama had the advantage of\nActing like a commander in chief and going to the devastation while Mitt Romney has basically left helpless and they say that that hurricane may have tipped the scales back to Obama's member Romney at all the momentum in the world are going into that storm so yeah look a Jim Messina who was speaking of President Obama two thousand twelve he was the campaign manager\nA for a strobe I'm at that time and he said yesterday is why did Senator Warren have to do\nHer announcement with her DNA now he goes why can't Democrats ever stay focused and I think this Elizabeth Warren\nRevelation or lack there of will only hurt the party further because I don't see how you could ever say many media outlets by the way Shawn said that this was definitive proof right I'll give you literally the headlines\nA fence around her neck that she's Ninety six percent European I mean at that one one thousand twenty fourth she has perhaps maybe native ...\nAmerican ancestry of some type I mean but it is but her she literally personally changed herself to minority status when you pan and then at Harvard that she was billed as the first minority\nFemale professor there a Native American heritage that the Cherokee Nation has spoken out and said this is just outrageous they're out they're outraged by it\nDry it and that was a turning point right when they when they came out and said this is wrong this is inappropriate this is a mockery then where are you going to say is attacking was with Warren is it still conservatives or does it actually Cherokee Nation but I mean that that the headlines yesterday Associated Press Warren DNA shows I have Native American heritage\nA CNN Elizabeth Warren releases DNA tests with strong evidence of Native American ... ancestry ABC News Elizabeth Warren really reveals proof of Native American ancestry again what proof at this so backfired on her ...\nNation got involved in and all the mockery that that ensued from there this is going to follow her I Know people think that she is a front runner\nBut the fact that she lied about our heritage to advance her career I could see the signs are already at Trump rallies in twenty twenty with one one thousand twenty fourth just written and that's it because now this defines her and this is not something you shake very easily and suddenly she's kind of morphed into Hillary Clinton where\nYou can't really trust what she says and then on top of that she has no real economic message at outside of you didn't do that so\nYeah no no you turned to see who the Democrats settle on right away and and twenty twenty because I think the left wing of the party is taking over and that's not the way you'd be President Trump\nOne of the things that I've been pointing out I don't know if you had a chance to look at the center for American Progress and there was a group formed by none other than John Podesta but they're running their reelection now ...\nVery revealing the Maxine Waters says they keep telling me not to say it I keep saying I'm not a lot but I'm going to keep saying it anyway meaning impeach forty five\nSo they're hiding their agenda we learned that in this project very past tape with Claire McCaskill in her own words also\nBut now we know that they're being told directly not to talk about their immigration and all you know a sanctuary attacks pack a punch says the four page memorandum [laughter] I'm like yeah OK and anyway the New York times were obtained a copy of it\nAnd Democrats and strategies to prepare the memo said\nThe Democrat you spend as little time as possible ever talking about immigration itself pivot\nTo a more fruitful issues like health care and taxation it's very difficult to win on immigration so nobody's talking about what they really are going to do their part Democrats too when they have to pretty much lie misrepresent\nCon be quiet about what it is they want to do how they govern\nAnd and the types of agenda items they really have that's not an enviable position to be I mean ... all the criticism Donald Trump takes he's pretty authentic he made promises and he keeps them\nThat's the thing I mean when you look at the record right everybody focuses on the rhetoric of the president too much right you look at the results and it's a completely different ballgame any president would kill to have a GDP about four percent unemployment below\nFour percent right there's something like seven point six million job openings that was that was reporter by CNBC today I think in the country that's incredible we have Ninety eight percent of the ISIS caliphate\nEvaporated in Iraq and Syria when North Korea is no longer launching missiles over Japan threatening Guam and the United states\nThese are all very substantial victories the trade deal he just did with Canada and Mexico I'm not sure leading here I'm Talking about the pillars of the presidency in terms of accomplishments Trump is winning right now you want with capital as well even that CNN did a\nSegment last week John Avalon where he says the president is on a winning streak and the polls are showing it he's back around forty four percent forty five percent among registered voters member that\n... was the most accurate and twenty sixteen has them at fifty one\nRight fifty one percent everything is trending upwards at the wrong time for Democrats when you go into the selection because to your point\nThey have no message like they had no message and twenty sixteen I don't know what Hillary Clinton's platform was outside of that guy is bad for me so I can be the first woman president and I would say the same about Mitt Romney two thousand twelve I I think that I Can't remember what his platform was but I remember Joe Biden had bin Laden is dead and\nGM is alive a that's easy to remember and it's a it was good enough right who was it will make America great again or\nKeep America great again the Trump can run on his record and Democrats just go with personal attacks like they have a if it's going to be a long long
