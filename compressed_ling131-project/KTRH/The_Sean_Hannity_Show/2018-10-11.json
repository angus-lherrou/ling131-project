I Would like for comfort\nOr with the Republican Kemp up by two and so we're following that raised pretty closely um in some of the other races that were watching the president's approval rating now is doing very very well what fifty one percent and rats musician\nAnd so we'll watch that but I think if you look at Heidi Heitkamp I think she's going to be and should be defeated in North Dakota\nI Hope the people of Montana will pay attention and understand that you basically have Chuck Schumer junior because John tester always goes with Chuck Schumer\nAnd the people in Montana I can take back that state which is a red state then you've got other states like Indiana I think Joe Donnelly can be defeated in Indiana I think definitely\nClaire McCaskill she ought to be sent packing and I think

permanent if they passionately talk about ending the bureaucracy\nThe way the president has been doing it if they will sign on to building and fully funding the border wall if they will do the

the more prosperous country you you cannot deny the success\nOf this president and the fuel the pure force of personality I mean Donald Trump is a force of nature and I know that he breaks dishes I

it going\n[noise] yeah it's going good weren't went on a policy yet the healthcare immigration taxes are my opponent is a work you're liberal and so we're putting the word out but it's like you said they're pouring billions in because\nThey know they're going after you and ... big time in junior right\nRight now it's it's a it's a battle and that there there is is that my opponent the resist\nI should really doesn't have a platform it All right now and so she's just running on the resistance and um and do vote and that's it so why I think I think the people especially after the Supreme Court ... captain and Hillary yesterday and all the folks chime in and on the left\nI think the ah the voters in Virginia regard to the right thing\nLook I think we've been putting a pen specific raises a night um congressman Jordan you know I mean the California Arizona a Mayo loving Utah Colorado is a number of seats there there\nWas it and if people want the full list that we've identified the top Seventy seats we put it up on the Hannity dot com\nOh so that people can check and make sure that that if their congressmen or a woman who's in a tough race that they get out to the polls what do you think's going to happen in twenty six days Congressman John\nI think we're going to win I think we've got great candidates like Dave Brat who were fighting for the for the American people elected us to fight for so I think we're going to win and I think the way you phrase ups on his way you've been doing it\nHow radical the left is I'd like to say it this way there there is that the left today is that they apply capitalistic when he respects the flag they embrace Governor Cuomo when he says America was never a great material and Maxine Waters when she says go out and harassed anyone who support the president and we saw that double down on that whole mindset doubled down on yesterday with what Clinton in holder said about Republican\nWhat are you ... and ... they're going after terrorists Sanders I'm Pam Bondi and secretary Neely says\nYeah I it just it just how radical the leftist today's modern Democrat Party today's party of the lab has taken most extreme positions in history raise your taxes abolish ice never secure the border continue to socialized medicine and impeach the president and you contrast that with what the president under his leadership we've accomplished\nI mean the list is phenomenal did this the other day some but they could buy the taxes cut ... regulations reduce the economy going for quaint two percent lowest unemployment fifty years out of the Iran deal the embassies in Jerusalem we've got a new NAFTA deal the hostage the come open North Korea and we got to get guys\nOn the United States Supreme court that's an amazing record and if we've been up that way\nAnd twenty six days we will win and keep the majority and continue to be able to do those things\nCan make America why don't you know some of these candidates they can't string two sentences together there's no idea why they're running for office when you can't communicate\nThis is a nationalized election and we got to understand that and go out and get that kind of message Dave Brat understand that he's not campaigning on the good things that happen with conservative leadership and his leadership uh that's how we have to run these campaigns and if we do I think we keep the majority\nLet me ask you a question now Fox has confirmed that the deputy attorney general Rod Rosenstein enacting FBI directed his after the firing a coma Andrew McCabe and Robert Mueller all met on a weekend day after Mueller's investigation started up\nAnd in that meeting Rosenstein and ... and McCabe or or both detailing reasons why the other one needs to recuse themselves the Russia investigation as as a whole are sitting there watching all this go on and knowing that well I guess I'm In charge of the whole thing what do you make of that uh they brought\nYeah well I'll just go back to the way you framed it you on the ... dot com it's all like ... Iran over its like at the specifics but in your intro Rosenstein said we have to follow the constitution for the people\nBecause we need oversight to follow the evidence using reason and now he won't show up in front of the people right say he's not just saying no to Jim Jordan and members of oversight committee he's saying no to the American people\nAnd he when he just sat in your remarks that the job and the role of the constitution is to give the people oversight\nUsing evidence and reason so he he's thumbing his nose at the U.S Congress and if we don't hold strong that President is not good and I'll let him go on with\n... yeah it sounds so ... you're exactly right both of the cave and Rosenstein ... this is interesting that both actually right\nAndy McCabe should have been recused from any type of oversight over the Muller investigation because of his involvement with his wife with his his conflict when his wife was running for office and he was supporting her so that should disqualify him Rosenstein is right about that but the caves right about Rosenstein Rosenstein wrote the memo\nThat it actually now forty five minute with really I'm a Nineteen and\nHit the right length and they sold their blocked at it and go from air attacks plane for about an eight minute delay staff was freeway I commend him down at the university boulevard new territory and struggling area there ... there and I wonder if I had found the north will be serving ten and getting in London in the Gulf Coast when does dot com twenty four hour traffic than are\nReally nice looking forecast tonight got some fifties in the forecast northern suburbs tonight sixty in town and yes such\nA slightly below average for change sunshine tomorrow comfortable humidity eighty two degrees this weekend to have a little tropical feature coming in North Texas coming up from Mexico coming up from the southwest\nThat could bring some rainstorm neighbors to the north but not this weekend here will we will be in the mid to upper eighties this weekend we do see some thunderstorms Monday early next week low seventies Scott worry more the weather channel\nEighty two Katie Rachel west side north side Lexus weather center this news brought to you by oop steam cleaning\nThree thirty one our top story for a second consecutive day the Dow fell like CNN reporters tears on election night the Dow down five hundred forty six points than as a down Ninety three yeah some people have hundred lost fifty seven oil at Seventy eighty\nParts of North Carolina and south central Virginia are dealing with the flash flooding from now tropical storm Michael Michael is expected to move across central and eastern North Carolina today in through southeast Virginia this evening\nAirlines have been canceling hundreds of flights to and from both the Carolinas in Georgia today so check with your carrier before you hit the Bush or hobby\nNews on demand to Katie rates dot com next update at four o'clock breaking information as it happens now more Sean Hannity I'm Scott countering Houston's news weather and traffic station misery of sudden forty Katie our age\nThis report is sponsored by gallery furniture it's astro days here says the Astros battle for the championship and why did I get it out to a news hurry hurry by ...
