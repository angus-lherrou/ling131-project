and we've talked about this after school shootings and after other church shootings where the president said well maybe we need to have retired police and military it's a sad state of affairs\nBut um as a line of defense but that doesn't take away from the horror and the vicious evil\nThat took place here you look at the victims I mean it is heartbreaking to see the faces of those slain for their faith was the cover of the New York post today and as you read about the the lives of these people it is one heartbreaking story after another\nAre sadly too we watched the media do what they always do and that's rushed to blame and pulling out all the stops to blame Donald Trump for the Pittsburgh massacre when in fact the prime minister of Israel Ron dorm or the ambassador of all said that the president's comments were welcomed unappreciated\nOn every front um we'll get into all those as we continue rose ten and I'm the host of Clinton rows and rows um plugged in Pittsburgh, PA ugh long friend of the program and David shown civil liberties attorney criminal defense attorney thank you both for being here\nUh you know how much I Love butter friends in Pittsburgh rows of very very sorry your thoughts and prayers go to everybody or the fact that it's been so viciously politicized within minutes makes beat my stomach turn and those trying to cast blame against the president make this a campaign issue is just nauseating\nIt is sunny or so left in Pittsburgh as well as soon as I heard the story the news Saturday morning I mean my heart went out and I was almost afraid to hear that list of victims their names because\nThis community it's such a lovely place it's a very popular Pittsburgh neighborhood I go there to shop and to dying and done in fact my son told me just about a month ago that's one of the the neighborhood is considering moving too\nSo we we love that community it's a tight knit community they are very involved though in so many aspects and not just their community but the out if the surrounding communities and as it turned out you know of course I grew up with a girl who's ... and with the two brothers\nThat perished on Saturday but there were so many people that have done so many great things in this community and the Pittsburgh area and it just it's heartbreaking it really is to see that this happened but as soon as I thought those things\nAnd immediately I got sick thinking that this is going to become political and\nIt says you can count the seconds ... there's an interesting side no there's no throw those to David I'm how democratic candidates increasingly turn against Israel\nAnd our mutual friend Alan Dershowitz you know I had a pretty powerful column that he put out linking the the mass of good at the Democratic party's tolerance for anti Semitism most recently we saw Bill Clinton two seats down from Louis Farrakhan\nI'd never ever get in a room with a vicious racist anti Semite like Louis Farrakhan or picture that emerged to with Farrakhan and Obama that was hidden from the public for eight years while he was president that existed that they had had a relationship\nUm and if you look at some of the most pro Israeli president I think we've had since the the forty eight partition plan un partition plan is a is Donald Trump\nMore recently making Jerusalem the capital of Israel which so many other presidents have promised that never had the courage to do\nThat any person who would suggest for a moment Donald Trump as an anti Semitic bone in his body does that have their mind look at his family et cetera but you're absolutely right and what you pointed out ... ... if you believe that words matter then it goes much further than just a President Clinton sitting in a room\nWith Mr fabric on their pictures of President Clinton President Obama Cory Booker shaking hands and smiling with Farrakhan members of Congress doing the same Linda source or another hater\nOr get an honorary degree at City College an honorary doctorate\nBomb a nation what climate dizzy away just wrote a press release about some of these kinds of things and listen this is Linda ...\nPraises resume or day are terrorists to Palestinian terrorists who killed two American college students she has been praised by Christ in dealing with a friend she's it praised unfortunately by Stacey Abrams is running for Congress here in Georgia now um it's words matter and those things matter a great deal\nAs it should be expected when you're normalize Israel bashing and the hatred of Jews it should be expected\nAll the way that our average would put it I thought it was pretty powerful you said they can't be any tolerance for anti Semitism and I agree\nWe we have to have a zero tolerance policy President Obama meets with Farrakhan shame on him President Clinton sits on a platform with Farrakhan shame on him Keith Ellison joins Farrakhan was one of the greatest purveyor of anti Semitic have he's right\nI'm just because he's black doesn't give him in the past four is anti Semitism in any liberal\nWas any positive association with Farrakhan as as part of the problem not the solution and you know just last week Farrakhan was making anti Semitic statements and it was only two months ago that Al Sharpton Jesse Jackson and Bill Clinton were all sitting next to each other with Farrakhan at a wreath of Franklin's funeral\nI Would not go to any funeral that he was ... I'm Sorry I just you draw the line\nAnd sign if I may here too and there's something I like your listeners to know because I I noticed a couple of headlines today on Sunday there was a letter that was published in written by eleven members of a group called bend the ark and they have a Pittsburgh affiliate\nRight here and they sent a letter to the president is blaming hat and they said that you yourself called the murder evil that yesterday's violence is that direct combination of you were influence\nAnd they said you're in the past three years of your work and your policies have\nInviting that's involved in this\nAnd that you know what was interesting is I had so many messages and phone calls\nFrom listeners today they they pretty much agree first of all of that than they are just that your listeners now it's not representative of the Pittsburgh Jewish community they did not speak for that and that is what many of my listeners said these people are are there and obscure left wing group\nI'm a very progressive chase and and they don't speak to the Jewish community here in Pittsburgh I've been told by many this morning\nYou don't have a very ... David go Harry important\nVery important point by the way I Wish they were obscure\nPeter Beinart as a matter of that group that's an Israeli Vassar and hater from start to finish\nRecorded then George Soros his grandson is a member of the group that purport to speak to this ... for this wonderful Pittsburgh community I been to the tree of life shall I was a guest of the rabbi there for about ... it's a wonderful place they're not haters they're not people who want to politicize anything\nAnd the president by the way can't win for losing\nThe guy who says those pipe bombs around\nA claim he was a follower of President Trump this guy the shooter the killer in Pittsburgh it's president from it cost them a global is there's no longer insult in that war world\nConservatives by in large mainstream conservatives David are the biggest supporters of Israel in this country I've been friends with prime minister Netanyahu for twenty five years friends with a who Brock and Shimon Peres a and others\nThat fraud you broadcast from Israel you have been a great friend of Israel patrol hundred percent right and on foot look there been articles lately there's an entire stream of the Democratic party now\nThat is frankly Israel haters and not give a past the Alexandria Ocasio Cortez these new people on the scene Palestinians domestic or it's just not true they're peddling wise about Israel and that's very very dangerous if you believe words matter\nWhat words matter but this was the deadliest anti Semitic attacking us history the president also saying we will see their destruction which I agree with\nI got to take a break but we'll come back more with rose tenant and David shown on the other side\n[noise] and so now that are laying the Ninety nine relate inbound and

be good coverage of the president President now sending up to five thousand troops to the border\nOr a significant display of solidarity for our sovereignty our borders the rule of law as he should\nWe saw about a week ago when at the Guatemala and Mexican border that\nLet people got to the border knock down the fence charged over the police and walk right through Mexico and we now have estimates as high as fourteen thousand people maybe less somewhere in around that area that are trying\nTo make it to the southern border the United states and the president and the secretary of homeland security of made it perfectly clear the vice president made it perfectly clear\nThat that's not going to be allowed to happen and we're a nation of laws to turn around\nThat to do with the right way to do with the legal way and in spite of that the marchers keep coming although the president of Mexico did make an offer for some of the migrants if they wanted would be given special consideration to work in southern Mexico a but not many takers apparently according to what I read this weekend\nYou know a lot of people have been asking well okay how did they get so organized to organize them\nAnd who's financing all of this\nUm there's been a lot of conspiracy theories that I've never believed the the only one that made any and it's not a conspiracy I'd I'd when the vice presidents\nLast week that he felt that some of the leadership\nIn Honduras was responsible for promoting the caravan and some countries are from South America Venezuela particular we're we're helping to finance some of this\nThat's the only bit of information that I found that was somewhat viable as a potential truth um anyway Sam Faddis is with us Sam Faddis ... senior partner uh and former CIA operative with Thirty years of experience in conducting intelligence operations in the middle east South Asia Europe\nAnd he's worked against the most dangerous of terrorist organizations the planet has ever seen as extensive first hand experience with their methodology and tactics and a welcome to the program sir glad you're with us thanks for serving your country\nThank you for having me no pleasure\nWhat so you're you wrote a column and night but I haven't read the whole calling me up with my read of it is as you think that the vice president was probably right on the mark\nWithout question right on the Mark I'm in the ... actually there's actually a great mystery here I mean the guys that organized this are folks somebody party called ... which is a Honduran Marxist Party\nA number of years ago supportive of of of the president who basically tried to overthrow the constitution to make himself all presidents for life there and done with the Venezuelan\nAnd leave out in front of God and everybody all over the Internet that our world and organizing a posting videos and pictures from the mark\nSo again no great great mystery this is the work of guys allied with Venezuela Marxist and it is in effect a giant covert action campaign designed to make the American\nGovernment look bad and our allies look that well\nI mean look the America doesn't have much of a of a choice and and this has to be obvious to people ... and\nI'm listening and watching the comments and some people sort of associating this with which anti immigrant sentiment or Xena phobia or whatever the the charges it's not true all conservatives are saying we don't care where immigrants come from the president talked about a border\nWall with a big door and that people should respect our laws are constitutional republic\nAmerican sovereignty and come in and if you want to come in we just need to check out make sure that you don't come here with radical ideas that you have the ability to sustain yourself\nAnd don't need our help and then we can let you in and you could become a part of our family to the extent that you want to go through the process of maybe become a citizen I don't think that's too much to ask that's called the legal way\nWithout question this doesn't have anything to do with a Smith ethnicity does not seem to do with race this is yeah we're a nation of immigrants were also with nation of laws and according to legal immigration procedures period which don't simply ... to walk across the border I have always wondered\nBy the way those folks that are actively don't want to control the border why is it that only people who can walk here should be allowed to get him just added stuff if that's the principal\nWell when I'm not I don't want anybody to get hurt because America the president means what he said and if people rush across our border beat at a port of entry or along the border that is not fence and that our military is on the border\nThe military is going to be given the order to stop them now we don't want anybody hurt I don't want and I'm assuming Ninety nine point eight percent of the people coming here\nAre coming here because they come from impoverished countries and they want a better life for themselves and their family that's my guess\nBut nobody can vouch for every single person in that caravan\nAnd for the sake and safety of the American people we can't let that number of people rush across the border have no vetting of the people and sadly maybe amongst the fourteen thousand there's one or five people that come here with intentions to bring us harm\nI agree with you on a ... percent Sean we don't want anybody hurt and also it is undoubtedly true that most of these people are simply being utilized by folks hostile to the U.S stuff probably been lied to the gun I'm told that when they get to the border will be allowed to cross\nUm so they are being put in the in the middle of this I'm simply because we as human shields on on a harder on the behalf of folks hostile to the United states that is a horrible tragedy because these are mostly just average people will be used\nNow look I Will tell you that you know what I really feel sorry for people I've taken the time I think more than any other person and media in this country\nAnd I've been down to the border Thirteen times and horseback all terrain vehicle boats helicopters I've been there I've seen gang members arrested I've seen drug warehouses I've seen tunnels built um I've I've been on the border spot one place in particular did have a wall of an end fencing and I can look across the fence\nAnd on the other side of Mexico I saw nothing but poverty\nI saw ... what we would almost describe homes built surrounding

down to five races that they believe will be the tipping point is actually thirty races kind of like what we have but\nThey ... they have a five seat race they've got the Republicans locked in a two hundred seats they got the Democrats locked into two hundred and five seats and\nThe remaining seats are up for grabs in other words they're toss ups in other words it we win the seats and that means that Republicans will retain the house control of the house of representatives now that would be the super when that you want to go for the Senate is looking better but don't take anything for granted I think will pick up\nThe whole Tennessee with Marsha Blackburn I think we can beat Claire McCaskill Heidi Heitkamp I think Joe Donnelly can be beaten these down in the polls I Believe that Christians

motivation out there right now I think people are starting to pay attention they understand what's at stake and they went to the Democrats in November six\nWell look the issue to me are simple but we have is we know what the Democrats agenda is to impeach trumpet don't say it open borders sanctuary cities sanctuary states but don't say it keep Obamacare but don't say that either just say work for great health care for all of making some wonderful just like\nYou know keep your doctor your plan and pay less that's their agenda and they want their crumbs back\nBeyond that it's let's hide and not tell people what we really stand for because when we do we know we lose which is why all these we have now another Senate candidate will be exposing tonight\nWe've got Brett ascent in Tennessee we've got Claire McCaskill we've got Heidi Heitkamp\nWill unveil another senator tonight all caught on tape all three campaigns saying that they purposely running as moderates but they plan to govern as
