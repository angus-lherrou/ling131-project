and and obviously the Republicans taking over Congress for the first time in forty years with your contract\nAnd I'd argue Donald Trump is the fourth leg\nAnd that is a I everything he is doing in terms of governance is conservative even even threaten trade wars they're not\nThey're not materialized because that's never been as attention his intention to for better trade deals freer fairer deals\nYeah I think look I I think he is the fourth\nOf cycle if you will of moving back from a left wing America and we've been gaining momentum and gaining clarity and there's often tell people you know we didn't have Leonard Leo and the federalist society\nWith so many good solid conservative lawyers that we could fill up all these judicial appointments and that that's just a huge advantage\nAnd they're all grows out of what is now if you go back to Goldwater uh fifty four year movement um but I think it's also coming to a crisis because\nTrump so clearly articulate each a pro American pro work ethic pro patriotism policy that he drives the left crazy\nAnd I think as a result the left which has gotten more extreme they haven't modulated they haven't come back to the center they've decided that their job is to beat up and intimidate those of us who disagree with him and in the end I think that just further isolate some\nSo their agenda is pretty clear they get back the house they won in peach men they want the crumbs back the largest tax cutting history which is obviously having a big impact on the economy we you know all the record unemployment numbers the varying demographic groups that are doing better than they've ever done\nUm they also want open borders but John Podesta said don't talk about immigration they want to eliminate ice they want to keep Obamacare\nI'm an endless investigation I Would add to that I don't hear one positive thing that's going to create one job or make this country one bit safer not nothing that they're running on just that and we hate Trump that's it\nWell I think that's right and it's partly because I think if they tried to tell us honestly what they stand for there will be defeated so badly that they just they know that they can't afford to be honest but but I think I mentioned the send your TV show last night I think that we're about to be a magic moment\nIn American history and I think the two words that captured in my mind are Kavanaugh and caravan I think Kevin all the way they treated him of the viciousness the smears the character assassination to childish behavior by\nUS Senators incentive meetings I think all that came together to really really galvanized conservative and I think this caravan coming up from Guatemala\nShould be a major focus of Republicans for the next couple of weeks\nBecause it makes clear the argument about whether or not we have a right to be a sovereign country or whether in the Feinstein below sea San Francisco Democrat tradition we have an obligation to open up our border to anybody\nWho can get finance and remember these three thousand people I I agree with Laura Ingraham is asking the question who's paying for this these three thousand people probably cost Twenty one million dollars to move\nFrom Guatemala highly four thousand people now grown to metal spike among and us border crossings but you know Nancy Pelosi actually said we are not funding the border wall\nAnd that just as it seems to be an appendage that Donald Trump's manhood I mean you know imagine anything similar said about any woman by any Republican or conservative\nI mean it's outrageous the double standard and then so flagrant but\nYou know we're we're already have paid between health care education criminal justice we've already paid trillions of dollars for people that didn't respect our laws and sovereign states costs the American people a fortune and by the way the people of California and now we're going to be paying for their health care for free no questions asked\nBy the way we have in Georgia a democratic nominee for governor Stacey Abrams a who are clearly favors allowing illegal immigrants to vote a says that she has one draw any distinction between the people who are American citizens and people who came here illegally\nUm and that's that's sort of typical Gavin Newsom candidate for governor in California\nWho openly says he wants to have government run health care and make it available to every illegal immigrant who can get to California I mean the Democratic party is becoming the party of illegality the party of breaking go all the point you made earlier at a party which\nBelieves that can't win was legal American votes and so it's kind of try to find some way\nTo drowned the system and it's an amazing thing to watch develop\nOr we're going to get Newt Gingrich has predicted Nineteen days till election day I'll also his take on the show gave it looks like murder and who's responsible and how the president should

Rosenstein yeah he wanted to wear a wire on the president I'm James Baker is back on the hill today remember he was one of the four people\nThat was very clear about Rod Rosenstein and we're still awaiting the de classification\nOf let's see three oh choose gang of eight information Pfizer warrants\nOut we're also awaiting you know whether or not we're going to get an redacted Pfizer applications pages ten through twelve seventeenth ... thirty four remember the bulk of information for the size of warrants\nWas the pony never verified never corroborated rushing dot CA that Hillary paid for there's so much it stinks to high heaven John Solomon out with an article yesterday in his article\nWell he's talking about all these FBI pop the oj officials there on all these special interest junk kits\nAnd guess who is probably the most frequent user of the Robert Mueller's pit bull Andrew Weissmann yeah that Andrew Weissmann they went after Paul Manafort that Andrew Weissmann that of course was responsible for tens of thousands of Americans losing their jobs as it relates to Anderson accounting\nWhen you go back years in the Enron investigation\nThe same guy that was overturned nine zero in the U.S Supreme Court the same guy the center for Merrill executives to jail for a year and that got turned\nOver by the Fifth Circuit court of appeals it sounds complicated it really isn't it is the single biggest abuse of power corruption scandal in the history of the country and I haven't even mentioned\nThe abuse of the powerful tools of intelligence\nThat we give these people supposedly to protect us joining us now a civil liberties attorney criminal defense attorney David shown and Carter Page was banned at the center of all of this for the last year and a quarter I Know that you're moving forward with investigations lawsuits and I don't blame you one bit I mean\nFrom everything you've told me is that our FBI our CIA our intelligence community knew you well because as your work took you to foreign lands when you come back\nFrom places like Russia or you would willingly ... feet deep briefed at and and tell them everything you know to help your country out so uh I guess if you were really the bad guy that needed to be surveilled than\nThey needed to Hillary Clinton's on verified phony Russian ...\nAs the presentation to commit fraud on the rise of course I Would think you'd be indicted right now if you were as bad as they say\nShot it just it it just kept getting crazier and crazier every day I uh I think it just uh just this week we have the Saudis that are um owning up to various things that may have happened there and you know starting investigations\nAbout things that may have happened a couple of days or or he was within the last few weeks\nI mean this is something that is you know people I've been covering up here in the United states for over two years so I think as a a you know a symbol of democracy a symbol of\nGood government that hopefully uh hopefully the uh the car just starting to fall here and people will start phoning up to all the uh all the wrong doing that was done and I I think we're getting into that as you've been a\nA all over in terms of your reporting south\nSo bring David and David as an attorney and an an a really good attorney you know Congress has a constitutional roles called oversight their job they or their check we have a system of separation of powers and checks and balances part of their oversight is when they are investigating the investigators\nThey have been obstructed every step of the way\nRequest document requests we have found instance after instance where they cite national security is a reason for not turning something over only to be turned out to be having nothing to do with national security only an embarrassment to them now we see in in just the last two weeks\nOh Rod Rosenstein who gives an extensive interview to the wall Street Journal here's enough time to testify under oath Glenn Simpson is pleading\nThe fifth Nelly or doesn't want to appear and testify under oath James Baker is testifying today and James Baker and Lisa Page and Andrew McCabe one other person all saying Rod Rosenstein wanted to wear a wire\nTo go after the president of the United states\nOr if you are representing our friend Carter Page here I mean I Would think you'd have a multitude of lawsuits and the Carter page ought to be a pretty rich man by the end of all of us\nYeah quarter page has a very strong basis for sticking not only information but also damages and relief and he is now by the way of course\nConducting some litigation going after that doesn't Carter Page is very important to St example of how very wrong things have gone with the ... the court and otherwise and governments you hit the\nProbably the most important point going on here Congress's role in providing oversight um you know God willing congressmen Munoz is going to return after this election his work commission and good let's work\nAs a vital Congress can no longer bluff though anymore they've got to compel the testimony of these folks I think there's a real argument for a Fifth Amendment waiver from the public statements\nThat these folks make the American public demands transparency\nAnd they deserve nothing less than transparency and by the way these aren't simple mistakes that have gone on you know we talk about this\nNinety nine page report on fire the court a abuses that uh they director Rogers was talking about um these aren't just mistakes these are conscious efforts and engender by law enforcement officers to invade the law they there is by the way one author or as a new that no one really has exploited yet\nAnd that's a fight the quarter review\nThere is a court that just above the five to court it will also under their rule for considering procedural motions there are three judges to chief justice of when you are right now that that just ... telling talent for different circuits\nMaybe maybe that court should be the subject of the uh the ... the foreign promotion trees you what's going on in the ... the court also just remembering you have in the ... the court efforts\nBy the ... where are these buys a court judges\nA fraud was committed on every one of them they were that run verified uncorroborated information to spy on the guy you're also talking to on this on this line quarter page why haven't we heard from them yet\nYou're right they should do outreach collie or the judge and the fifth corps envious judges on the quarter review it violates their own rules rules Thirteen and\nIt violates the Constitution's and as you pointed out many times the most sensitive area of our government probably because that's the part they application for the most intrusive kind of eavesdropping that there is in the world\nYou know you know there was an article by John Solomon I Want to just read a little bit of it to both of you and carnival salt would do to get your reaction considering you were\nAs of now you appear to be the victim and all of this unless something changes ... Carter Page that I don't know about you are as of now\nHave you with this horrible person that needed to be surveilled and not just basically a I don't know chink in the armor to get a Trump and then you become the on winning victim in a witch hunt against him but you know because you were light about\nThey use phony information to obtain the warning against you but of all the agencies and the federal government Solomon points out that should be immune to special interest schmoozing the DEA OJ it's premier\nLaw enforcement agencies like the FBI the DEA the bureau of Alcohol Tobacco firearms and explosives topped the list their independence from influence and their integrity and meaning out the law fairly are essential\nTo their success in the trust the American public puts in them but\nThis week the D O D jays internal watchdog put a rare spotlight on the gratuities inside the department and then he goes on to explain to people and the FBI and the OJ accepting free sporting event tickets\nFrom a TV reporter they don't even give the names of recipients hundreds of pages of government ethics filings revealed that in the past three years the deal Jay on the Democrat Republican presidents has allowed hundreds of their employees to accept free travel\nLodging food from special interests across a blow globe and I'm looking at it this and I'm saying you know\nReally you got to be kidding me because if anybody else did this\nThat would be called influence peddling and on top of the list we got a guy by the name of Andrew Weissmann new accepted apparently more than a dozen free trips your reaction Carter\nSean you know this goes back to sort of the crux of the matter in terms of my case and all the abuses that happened around day it's not about me and it's not about\nAny ah any you know specifics in terms of myself it's really about our country and I think\nWhat you see in terms of some of these ah actions that they were doing I'm against the rules and potentially against the law that really reflects you know people just looking out for themselves and yeah it's like President Trump always said as a candidate a it's not about me it's about us and you know\nWhen they when they come after me they're they're just doing it to ah to get get him at the end of the day so that was it's really a a a huge problem\nWill pick it up with the Carter page David
