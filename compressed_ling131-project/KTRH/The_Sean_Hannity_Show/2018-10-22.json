are taking that seriously Claire McCaskill's husband being accused of some type of me to issue out there in Missouri and you notice the double standard it's everywhere\nI'm here's what is anecdotally something that I think should give you a lot of hope um and I don't make predictions I can only tell you this if you want to predict and it's simple Rick Scott is in a very very close tight race in Florida with\nBen Nelson you know but Rick Scott has done a great job for the economy down in Florida he'll do a great job as a senator but he's also run is you know notoriously close races down in Florida\nFlorida as important Florida I think he won his race is by one percentage point each time and and each time he keeps proven the people of Florida that maybe not the best politician with the best gift of gab or ... or but boy when it comes to getting the job done when the people of Florida need Rick Scott he's there for you\nAnd the same with ah we've got ... whatever reason\nMedia is falling in love with Andrew Gillum down in Florida\nAnd in Iran dissent this the butter the great debate last night and he's now fighting to to prevent Florida from getting a forty percent business tax that Gillum would support\nThe elements from use some of the most harsh rhetoric against police that I've ever heard before he's fairly radical in his views\nIs trying to hide it just like every other Democrat is hiding who they really are they can't be elected by being honest with their constituents in who they are what they believe in what they really want to fight for we saw that with Brett is said and the project ... tape and the great state of Tennessee\nAnyway you know run the Santa sees in a fight for his life down in Florida\nWe got Marsha Blackburn who's going to be a fantastic senator from Tennessee but\nYou know for whatever reason Brett is it is out there trying to convince the people tend to see that it's something that he is not that he's a moderate liberal and these tapes blew that out of the water\nAs they're calling the people of Tennessee ignorant people in his office and saying that his public position on Brett Kavanaugh is just for show and we saw the same thing in the tapes in Missouri Claire McCaskill\nYou know we've already found out she was a phony but now we really know she's a phony\nShe goes on to an RV tour of Missouri except she's taking private jets Phillips so Harvey tour\nWith with wings unbelievable\nBut some anecdotal evidence now there I think the Kavanaugh hearings I think this caravan is now becoming a massive campaign issue\nAnd just the fact that there's seven thousand people that are marching towards our southern border to create some type of confrontation oughta tell Americans what the party of sanctuary cities sanctuary states the party that wants to eliminate eyes open borders means\nWhen you look at the amount of money illegal immigration has cost the American taxpayers it is in the billions and billions and billions of dollars because if you're in this country illegally and you're arrested for something we paid the criminal justice costs\nIf you go to a hospital hospitals not going to not take care of you we pay the health care costs we pay the educational costs when your kids are in school nobody's against illegal immigration\n... nobody's against immigration everyone's against illegal immigration we're saying we have a process that we have sovereignty and we have borders and they deserve to be respected\nAnd what does it say about the people that do go through the process legally improperly that's now coming to the forefront\nOf the president's call for a wall is right sanctuary cities and states are wrong there's been so look at the crimes committed in Texas alone when I was down there for that security briefing with Rick Perry I mean the six hundred and forty two thousand Texans alone\nVictims of crimes some very serious including murder\nI mean it gets downright scary now we have more instances Mitch McConnell over the weekend confronted some guy banging on his table at a restaurant taking his leftovers and throwing them throwing those out the the door of the restaurant\nNow it's almost happening on a daily weekly basis we got a lot of new tape that we're going to play for you but I think the biggest thing that people need to know is Democrats want to stop all progress what do they want to take us back to what we know failed after eight years of Obama\nTheir signature legislation Obamacare their fundamental promises which was keep your doctor keep your plan pay less millions of Americans lost their doctors plans and are paying in some cases one hundred two hundred and three hundred percent more than they ever paid before for in theory of coverage\nWe have many states where you only have one option one the health care option that's it\nSo it has not worked out well for the American people it was from the beginning it redistribution scam where you're forcing the young and healthy to buy plans they never want needed or desired and forcing them by threat of a fine\nTo literally subsidize the sick the elderly and and the disabled or Americans when all they really need is a catastrophic plan and one office visit a year or and they catastrophic plan would be like fifty bucks a month and that's for God Forbid you have a bad accident get cancer and heart attack\nThe anecdotal hope that I'm Talking about is political even says looks like Chuck Schumer's dreams of becoming the Senate majority leader or a evaporating before his eyes\nEven his Democratic colleagues don't think it's going to happen anymore democratic hopes of winning the Senate have faded in the final weeks of the twenty eight to an election with a party now needing to win every one of the more than half a dozen\nCompetitive races to capture control the chamber it's a far cry from pretty much the last year and a half oh we're gonna we're gonna take control of the house in the Senate\nHeidi Heitkamp seat has slipped away it looks like it's going to be a Republican pickup Martha mix Sally is going to join us later I mean every day gets worse for Christ in cinema\nI mean there's just an unmitigated disaster for her I mean you know she thinks it's okay for Americans to join up and support it it's got Mitt treason against their country and support the Taliban we've got that\nWe've got her on tape saying that her state of Arizona the people are crazy and it's the ... lab of democracy and then of course you know attacking border patrol people inviting radicals like the lawyer for the blind shake into town\nAnd meanwhile Martha ... Sally twenty eight years of service serving our country six tours of duty in Iraq and Afghanistan what a comparison\nSo now we have ... Democrats are urging caution on the blue wave to temper expectations new Fox\nA poll has come out top Democrats now they're spending their time managing expectations about ... the blue wave\nAnd sweeping the party into power on Capitol Hill urging caution about those predictions amid fresh signs at the midterms are much closer than anticipated Democratic National committee chair Tom for as it was still hasn't condemn Keith Ellison\nSaid today that he doesn't use the term blue wave to talk about a possible victory for the party even though house minority leader Nancy Pelosi who has her eyes on the speaker's gavel said just days earlier that we're looking at a democratic tsunami\nLook I Can't look I don't have a crystal ball I all I Know is winning everything is possible\nI can see a scenario where Rick Scott wins in Florida Ron dissenters becomes the governor Marsha Blackburn wins in Tennessee Martha Black um ... Marshall mixed Martha McSally wins in Arizona\nWhere we have Dean Heller hold this seat in Nevada which is tough that's a tough state tough race a lot of money being poured against him\nWhere I can see Claire McCaskill getting the exit sign Jon Tester getting the exit sign and Heidi Heitkamp saying goodbye and even Joe Donnelly the problem for the Republican Braun in\nThe state of Indiana is well in his particular case he's got a libertarian in the race and that means that the libertarian siphoning votes away from the Republican wrong Mike Braun is now claiming that you know a Brett Kavanaugh surge citing internal polling is now as a leading will see in Fifteen days\nYou know if you look at all of this and add to all of this this is an opportunity one bit of anecdotal evidence\nWe have you know they say voter enthusiasm for the Democrats is at an all time high but you know crazy uncle Joe Biden was at a rally in Vegas on Saturday in an attempt to boost Democratic Senate candidates according to the a P he drew a pathetic five hundred people\nA hundred and thirty thousand people have signed up they want to go see the Trump cruise rally tonight\nMean amazing I was down in Houston in Beaumont, Texas this weekend and and doing a a town hall with Ted Cruz and then we have four thousand people or around there a moment at a huge crowd in Houston as well\nWe're doing better than crazy uncle Joe Bernie Sanders is warning his party that there's no blue wave coming and he also says that you can't win elections by alienating half the population and I hate to say it but I agree with Bernie you're absolutely right\nAnd you've got to force the hypocrisy so we've got the cabin on your shoe you got the caravan coming you've got more mobs over the weekend in front of me and and showing nothing but mean spirited hostility to people that are trying to serve their country you've gotten\nAbout two years of magnificent success record breaking jobs and opportunities for Americans were more safety and security are stronger president versus eight years of failure so we have a choice in this election\n[noise] I got the good news bad news for you I guess I'll start you off the good\nNews on northwest freeway inbound approaching Cyprus Roseville that'd be fired finally cleared out\nNow only causing maybe a two to three minutes late them both and finally ...

got\nFormer Secretary Clinton said oh yeah we'll get civil again once we have power\nThat's not supposed to be this great nation and like you said before it's sort of tough to avoid the immigration issue when you've got this caravan merging north thousands and thousands of people um I think the president's right when he's talking about you're not going to get your foreign aid if this if this is going to continue\nAnd talking about putting hooks on the border putting troops on the board reporting National Guard in order to make sure\nThat we saw what happened last friday in Mexico at their border and then the fence was busted and people come running across now it's almost like we're headed towards a major\nHuman confrontation here people that don't affect our laws and sovereignty and a president that are saying you must respect our laws and sovereignty um\nNo I I think Democrats ally go in the back of their heads hoping this happens southern all maybe something bad will happen in Trump will look bad and we can blame him as someone gets hurt\nYeah you you never know I Hope I Hope not I prayed not yeah\nSame here but I Will tell you want on Saturday I had a a person from Honduras\nWho came here legally and when that lady comment is that the Republican event Saturday morning in our home town in Urbana, Ohio she came up to me and she said\nI Am I'm sick of this kind of stop she gives it the right way she came here legally came here because she loves this great nation wanted to start her goals and dreams in this great nation that's the part that upsets me the most when you see this kind of thing happened and the and the possible political implications\nAnd and motivations behind these things\nThat's what bothers me the most and I think it is common sense Americans say look this is not how it's supposed to work you want to come to this country and you're a legitimate asylum seeker that's one thing but when eighty percent of the people who show up at our border claiming asylum aren't legitimate\nOr asylum seekers that's a problem and we know that's probably what this this group is is mostly about as well\nWe also have this issue of the mob that no Democrat seems willing to confront and either I mean you know we saw what we watched Ted Cruz and his wife get out of a restaurant by an angry left wing mob we watch that happen a Pam Bondi at a movie theater we watch that happen a secretary Nielsen we watch that happen to Sarah Sanders\nA we saw Mitch McConnell go through this at the airport and then this weekend that happened a again a let me play a little of the McConnell confrontation and then you have the liberal media you know literally and then we have now hearing Kissinger was shouted down and listen to some of this [noise]\n\n\n[noise]\n[laughter]\n[noise]\n\n\nI got a Ninety two year old man who served as countries you know it's unbelievable you know what the names of\nWhat's her name Maxine Waters you you clear the crowd you confront them you do you tell them they're not wanted anywhere anymore Mitch McConnell Leo country you know and then we have you know Eric Holder kick them Hillary you can't be civil with somebody you disagree with\nNo this is this is is wrong and they get this is not how on a decent people are supposed to behave and and it is you know with the part that bothers me the most Sean is Dennis could send it is a good friend of mine and he is as far left as I Am\nNow is actually a lovely guy\nHe's a wonderful guy he's a friend and he would never act that he will debate the idea that it will show up and have a robust debate like we're supposed to win this great nation but he would never this is the new left\nThis is a new cars finishes the way ... liberal and and and people who believe in their positions and their ideas and their their policy that's the way it's supposed to be but what is happening now is so dangerous for this country and so so wrong and just\nWomen's tennis when this great nation off or how\nDoes the president and this would be my goal the president obviously is is going to pull back aid to some of these countries that are allowing this this caravan to move forward\nUm nobody wants to anyone to get hurt at the at the border these you know I Would assume the vast majority are innocent people but you know getting where we don't know anybody I mean you could have people that nickname with the crowd to want to bring harm to our country but I Would assume most people come here because they want a better life\n... if they're hell bent on disobeying our laws and our sovereignty and the president then has to protect our borders how do we do it in the way that is safe is for the people that are there because I don't want to see people getting hurt at the border you don't see people the president doesn't want to see that\nBut I Can't you can't allow them to come in either\nNo I write and this is why we've had legislation that's been introduced the Democrats won support it because I think deep down they want the politics of this issue they don't want to solve the problem we need more judges on the border we need more ability to when people get there to hold them not this catch and release policy hold them\nHow they're have their case that due to cater to we can find out or they legitimate or they're really fling something or or are they coming here to do harm are they part of the Sims game what's their background each it takes some time to do that but and it takes resources it it takes people\nBut if the Democrats won't allow us to pass the legislation that would put all that in place so we can get a answers quickly are much much more in a in a much more quicker and better that we do today\nThat's the problem so quit playing politics let's solve problems and let's do it in a way that's consistent with the rule of law\nOr we'll talk more about the election Jim Jordan is with us from Ohio he'd like to be the next speaker of the house also\nUh we'll get to that we do have some deep state news we haven't touched on yet Martha ...

Story about Donald Trump it's called Trump the blue collar president\nAnd held billionaire living on Fifth Avenue identified the struggle of blue collar Americans that won the presidency and all those are the forgotten men and the forgotten women in this country and I don't think they're liking this mob mentality I don't think they liked the way judge Kavanaugh was treated ...\nAnd I don't think they like watching this caravan of thousands marching towards our border\nI mean they they literally are mishandling everything and so ... what's what's happening is uh the the president has almost like this light Sean like you know you and I were out on Long Island in the summer or parents would hang up that insect light\nWell the president has that the Trump Twitter insect light and they're all going towards the light in their vaporizing Senator Warren she's got to get a DNA test she's less of a Native American than you or me\nIt into the vapors Asian the caravan issue of the way they're handling the care of an issue it's the galvanizing his base that Kavanaugh's thing was absolutely ridiculous they were making up one story after the next they figured okay me too movement seems to work there is no due process in the meat you meant\nLet's take this guy that did very well credentialed judge\nHe's got an impeccable adult life let's try to destroy him\nGoing back to Nineteen eighty one in Nineteen eighty two and so again right into the Trump Twitter\nInsect vaporized or so so for me I'm enjoying this the polls are tightening of and the president's base is actually going to turn out in much higher percentages and people predicted in so once again he's going to defy logic here I think we are very good chance to possibly ah\nKeep the house we're certainly going to gain seats in the Senate\nAnd it couldn't happen without the energy and the for tutors for a President Trump\nWell if they do it when I'll say this he's carrying a lot of these people on his back but you know what I feel like Nancy Pelosi the dangers are well we're going to have endless investigation higher taxes keep Obamacare open borders\nNow the president is is battling back on all these ... and Guatemala Honduras El Salvador he says there we're not we're not able to do the job of\nStopping people from leaving their country and coming illegally to the U.S now we will begin cutting off substantially reducing the massive foreign aid we routinely give them and Trump tweeted out every time you see a caravan of people the illegally coming are attempting to come into our country illegally\nThinking blame the Democrats\nAre not giving us the votes to change our pathetic immigration laws\nRemembered the midterms it's so unfair to those who come in legally and he's right um well and and we don't know anything about the people that are coming here we don't know when when one thing about them and I know the media can be sympathetic because they want but you know who might mix in with the people that maybe just want a job is a big problem for us\nBut but it's but you but here's the other thing okay the American people intuitively notion that it's just all it is is he he's recognizing with the legendary Milton Friedman one set about any country\nIf you have a welfare state in the United states does have one you need to protect your order because free market forces dictate that people will cross over that border\nTo participate in your welfare state and so\nEvery country has a strong border and so should the United states so I don't get\nA you know ... on on on promoting my my uh my vote today in the last couple of days mom a lot a left leaning shows where they go they go nuts so crazy on the president's response oh\nYou want to illegal immigration you have democratic and Republican presidents and democratic and elected officials that have voted in the last I don't understand why just enforcing those laws\nHave everybody saw such a ... well could there answered by so\nWhy don't they well it's a lot of things are we better off economically than we were two years ago by\nEvery single objective measure the answer is yes the growth of the economy consumer confidence jobs created the number of people leaving food stamps or out of poverty eight million Americans so you know by every measure and more job out of\nThe bottom ... percent of the society Shaun the\nWages of five and a half percent according to the wall Street Journal over the last Eighteen months but as a direct result of the president's policies but also the fact that he cut the slack at the border and so it made it tightened up the labor supply and it's giving lower middle class families shot you know to have real living wages\nWell that's the story that you actually tell in the book by the way Anthony Scaramucci is with us author of the brand new book it's out today we put it up on Hannity dot com it's on Amazon dot com and bookstores everywhere it's called Trump the blue collar president I first heard that term from one of his sons of his either Erica Don I don't remember those Donnie\n... get on each call them the blue collar billionaire yeah and they said ... Don if you don't mind going to hijack the nickname and just switch out billionaire and put it in President because at the end of the day he resonates with these people for reasons\nYeah look I I I think it is and you talk a lot about his background you you talk a little bit about your family background it's similar to my background and and it's amazing because the only thing that I really care about what motivates me it's not politics itself it's not a game to me\nBecause the policies that we have in a country as we do now greatly impact whether or not people are on food stamps or whether or not there are jobs we now in two years\nHave us a scenario that has not unfolded in this country since Nineteen sixty nine and that is we have a million more jobs than we have people on unemployment you know that I identify with that that's what you identify with you you did not have any kids that are in your mouth\nAnd you know I saw it as a dishwasher at twelve and and look where you started I you know\nSean Sean listen I mean I think that's the message and I think that's the reason why you're so clearly popular at the end of the gay America is about aspiration in America is about passing the ... to\nThe baton to a next generation of Americans that can do better than ourselves and that's what our grandparents did for our parents and our parents did for you and I and and the cat that the right policy shift of white free market based motivating\nMarket incentive policies of because what we both know is that you cannot system the ties or through a political system created equal outcomes never happens black markets crop up and then there's a thin layer at the tippy top that are living better than everybody else and everyone else has devastated whether it's Cuba or Venezuela place like that\nYou know the real danger so I don't know how this is all going to play out but we we see all weekend long these mobs you know really making ... an unsafe environment for anybody to even go get a bite to eat if you're a public figure which was really sad I mean when you're doing it in front of people's wives\nIt's not only sad it's pathetic when you're going after Pam Bondi Sarah Sanders and our kids and\nSecretary Nielsen and all she still all they're doing is trying to sit in a restaurant and have something to eat telling you know one group of Americans they're not want it here in any way what are you doing here get out of this you know they're going after in uh Ninety year old guy Henry Kissinger now who served his country with honor in distinction is that it seems like there's no limits here but\nThere's no moderation left either ... and the Democratic party ... used to I used to think Democrats at least they on paper they said they cared about the American working men and women but apparently they don't\nIf you're losing the argument then you have to suppress the other side's argument in other words if you're wrong on the facts and your ideology is going to create\nUnequal outcome so you know bad society or even though it sounds great on paper all of your ideas when they make contact with reality or disaster for a country a person a citizen then you've got to suppress the voices of the other people it's happened to me it's happened to me on college campuses\nIt's happened to me I'm Around the country when I'm traveling\nI'm cool with it I'm up for the fight of it or you don't want you know what's great about the people just want you to think about Ninety five percent\nOf these professor Sean or liberal puts about forty five fifty percent of the kids are conservative so they're not buying into the ...\nAll right stay right there by the way the books phenomenal I read it cover to cover Anthony Scaramucci is with us Trump the blue collar president\nUh you know it's interesting you look at the jobs created who's benefitting when we create manufacturing jobs in factory jobs are and we bring an industry back to America and we incentivize businesses to invest here\nWell that's the forgotten men and women the Thirteen million under Obama\nThe additional Thirteen million that were on food stamps and after eight years
