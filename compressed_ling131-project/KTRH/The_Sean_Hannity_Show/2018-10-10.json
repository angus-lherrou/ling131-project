Carolina into North Carolina and then we expect at that point is probably going to go out to see a little bit but the bottom line is a this is a cat for borderline cap five hurricane\nAnd the strongest one ever to reach the Gulf Coast area there in the panhandle area and on top of it we got catastrophic storm surge\nThese destructive wind gusts hundred and Seventy five miles per hour and even higher um over a million power outages we expected occurring\nAnd not just near the coast but also inland after now this is hitting as we speak\nRainfall flooding is going to be a significant threat into the Carolinas so everybody\nIf you're in\nIf you're in Georgia if you're in South Carolina of you're in North Carolina you know you can make your preparation now and I would listen to local authorities if they're telling you to get out get out and uh you can come back take whatever important pictures valuables you need to take with you packed the car move inland and protect your family and\nYou know our thoughts and prayers are with everybody in in harm's way today this was this is the real deal this is you know Florida governor scared to death for those who said\nThis is why you know at times they make predictions they tell you to leave and it it's not as bad as they say it's going to pay this was one of those times it's as bad or worse than they predict that it's going to be the worst the worst hurricane ever for the panhandle in Florida\nThat's how dangerous this is as it goes inland we're talking about in Augusta, Georgia you're going to be having eighty to a hundred mile an hour winds tomorrow\nSame thing as you head up to Columbia South Carolina into the\nInto North Carolina so a lot of bad stuff happening our thoughts and prayers are with everybody and just no help will be on the way we live in the greatest country on earth with the most generous people on earth and whatever our friends in Florida Georgia\nThe Carolinas they're going to need I Know that people will be there to to help in any way imaginable a we have some breaking news on the deep state as it relates to Rod Rosenstein oh this is really outrageous\nRod Rosenstein I'll think of everything that he's involved to think of how conflicted he as bad as it relates to all things deep state that we have been telling you about now for a year and a half he is the person\nIn may have twenty Seventeen recommending the firing of Jim Cole me he is the guy that appointed special counsel Robert Mueller he is the guy that signed the third Pfizer renewal the fourth Pfizer application to spy on the Trump campaign associate Carter Page\nOr the bulk of the information in the ... of warrants as we all know now where the Hillary Clinton bought and paid for\nPhony Russian ... that even its author Christopher Steele doesn't stand by and of course that was funneled money it was made to look like a legal expense when in fact there was anything but a legal expense\nNow he was now are supposed to testify but those three people now Lisa Page Andrew McCabe the former deputy FBI Director\nAnd James Baker again we just learned this you know this week James Baker now the third person\nAre also saying that Rod Rosenstein talked at length about surreptitiously going into the oval office taping the president of the United states by the way that would be without a warrant\nAnd then hoping he can get some information something from the president that could then at night or ... or start the process of invoking the twenty Fifth Amendment to remove the president from office\nNow he's denying it said he was being sarcastic said it was he was joking about it but the testimony of Lisa Page Andrew McCabe and James Baker all contradict what Rod Rosenstein is now saying well\nRod Rosenstein was scheduled to testify tomorrow to the house Judiciary Committee but unfortunately this hour there at an impasse and the impasse over the terms of the testimony because lawmakers are calling for what is the standard congressional taskforce interview\nAnd insisting that Rod Rosenstein give a transcribed interview and that the interview be under oath\nHe's refusing to do so and those close to Rosenstein say they prefer a meeting and I'm sure they do or a briefing with the house Judiciary Committee chairman and other lawmakers they don't want any paper trail they don't want to be under oath at all\nNow the house Judiciary Committee aides said on Wednesday they left the door open for a possible resolution there should be no resolution the resolution is to subpoena Rod Rosenstein and have him testify under oath did he or did he not\nAs Lisa Page as McKay Andrew McCabe is James Baker all saying Diddy or did he not talked about wearing a wire against the president and the hope of getting something he says to help and both the twenty Fifth Amendment\nEither he did it or he didn't do it and then we can also talked about why he signed the the fourth and final buys a warrant application as it relates to Carter Page\nWhy why did he signed off on a document himself talked about well with regards to ... warrants you know that as an affidavit in career law enforcement swears to the validity of truthfulness and if they're wrong there's consequences\nWell we all know the bulk of the size of applications including the last one\nAnd there's one that shouldn't have been signed by that point they knew Hillary paid for it they knew the DNC paid for it\nThey knew it was full of uncorroborated on verified information we're now nine months in two surveilling Carter Page by then you think they would have figured out that the dusty a was phony and made up and even its own author\nOr couldn't prove any of its contents when questioned in in in Iraq a tour in Great Britain said I don't know if any of this is true it's just wrong intelligence and people just say and things like to hookers urinating in a bad in front of Donald Trump or in Moscow and the Ritz Carlton\nWell nobody ever verify that or corroborated that and it is if you're going to get an affidavit is is the law especially Pfizer application Pfizer warrant and protocol that you verify the contents and the information you're presenting to a ... court\nAnd you don't purposely withhold information\nPertinent information like the fact that Hillary Clinton\nBought and paid for that pony ... that you didn't take the time to verify or corroborate but there's obviously they all hate it Donald Trump because remember struck was the one that said well first he gets to smell the Trump voters in a Walmart but also said that Hillary should win them a hundred million to zero\nAnd then you're going to add to that the insurance policy comment that he made and what you really have here is I think now the validation or the cooperation of what the insurance policy was insurance policy is that your people conspiring not only remember Lisa Page testified\nAs we head into may nine months into the investigation into so called Trump Russia collusion by the very same people that gave Hillary Clinton a pass on the biggest obstruction of justice case in history\nThen they go into the Trump Russia so called investigation\nLisa Page confirms that they had no information Peters trucks tech confirmed that there is no there there\nBut anyway then they started ... media leaks strategy all coming from the same source which is Hillary's bought and paid for dot CA\nThey get their willing accomplices in the media to spread their lives and propaganda from the CIA and it creates an atmosphere where an impression is being created that whoa there really is something going on here\nAnd then it's used by the very same people the phony information that they spread to whip up hysteria so that they can go forward after the firing of called me on the ninth of may in twenty Seventeen and then they appoint\nRod Rod Rosenstein goes out in the points his buddy Robert Mueller\nBut there was no evidence at all according to Lisa paid that there was any reason to open a special counsel investigation the whole house of cards the corruption those sailing school is now exposed no wonder Rod Rosenstein doesn't want to speak to the Senate\nOr judiciary committee's Iowa sorry the house Judiciary Committee no wonder why Whitey especially under oath where then he could be charged with lying under oath\nYou know and people worry about that just ask Papadopoulos or General Flynn\nOr we have a lot of information we'll going to get to we have a rash musician a poll out today Republicans tied with the Democrats on the generic ballot that is huge we have more information specific information of just how\nRadical the Democratic party's agenda is if they ever get back power in twenty seven days we have in Arizona mix Sally thankfully has taken the lead in that close Senate race out there she was really an American war hero\nAnd ah anyway I think we're seeing a lot

uh right through middle Georgia or they're very close to making Warner robins about two am this morning near Augusta tomorrow morning and near and south and the track for instance uh looks like wind gusts\nAre going to be a hundred two hundred and twenty miles an hour in southwest Georgia\nProbably uh Seventy five a hundred miles an hour middle Georgia around the Augusta area the strongest winds are probably going to be between a sixty and eighty miles an hour near in southeast of Augusta and in Columbia say fifty five Seventy five year in southeast of there so the track of this

goes out\nSo that's how we're expecting this to move a over the next twenty four thirty six hours and so it's going to be moving pretty quickly or through a lot of these areas\nLet me go through there is a little bit more first of all I mean the governor saying I Hope to God that nobody said then people evacuated on the coast I'm not so sure that that's the case I mean I'm looking at some of these

structure\nI suspect you're not seeing any any uh video coming in from where this made landfall ... I mean it's one thing for instance at Pensacola is on the west side of this and mobile Pensacola has had a wins out the north forty ... sixty but it's blowing out\nSo it's at Panama City area a port saint Joe that's the area where it's ground zero and ... you know if you told me structures and I'm not just talking about the you know a small structure I'm Talking about a Camille took apartment buildings out along the beach show\nEither saying this storm Joe is the most powerful on record to ever hit the Florida Panhandle\nRight between mobile and Tampa this is the most powerful and record ... you know\nA ... that also goes ...

I Believe now firmly that you know all the people that have been claiming a blue wave a blue wave and blow away can be shocked again just like they weren't twenty sixteen and they were only a couple of us that believe that that was even possible\nAnd ah I think one indicator of just how far left the Democratic party has gone is out in California the sanctuary state of California you have gathered noticed there was a running up against this business guy by the name of what was his first name John Cox\nDon ... and and cuts is now in a five point almost within the margin race against Gavin Newsom and one of the biggest issues to emerge is not only the sanctuary cities status of the whole state but\nThe proposal of gab a nuisance to provide free health care to anybody does it matter is you know resident California citizen non citizen does it matter everybody gets free health care\nLook I look I Would ask everyone is is this just cause I can think of I don't do this and you're driving keep

warrant just like a search warrant\nIn order to get five or a search warrant you need an affidavit signed by a career federal law enforcement officer who swears\nThat the information the affidavit is true and correct to the best of his knowledge and belief and that's the way we operate and if that's wrong sometimes it is if you find out as anything incorrect in there that person is going to face consequences\nAnd if you find that anything's wrong in the air that person is going to face consequences you got to fix your signature to this you know it was signed up as David they get a ... a warrant signed by a career law enforcement person\nSwearing that what you are presenting to the court is true and that you know it to be true and affirmed it to be true well\nThat didn't work out what the third renewal buys the application in the case of Carter Page\nA which is the fourth buys a warrant issued but the fourth one that was signed was signed by Rod Rosenstein\nAnd we all know that the bulk of information that was put in the ... and ...\nWell that was based on the pony Clinton bought and paid for ... that not even Christopher Steele stands by to this day and that was never verified never corroborated and has turned out to be mostly debunked which is among the many other conflicts that Rod Rosenstein has of course\nHe's the one that recommended firing Jim call me he's the one that signed the visor warrants he's the one that appointed Mueller\nAnd now he was scheduled to appear tomorrow under oath and a two sources now telling Fox News at this hour\nThat Rod Rosenstein scheduled the parents before the house Judiciary Committee\nBut he is at an impasse over the terms of the testimony\nAnd he doesn't want to have a transcribed interview under oath which is the standard for congressional taskforce interviews\nAnd those close to Rosenstein say well he prefers a meeting or a briefing with the house Judiciary Committee chairman and other lawmakers where there's no paper trail where there's no under oath part well the question is why would he be afraid to go under oath\nWell here to weigh in on this and much more\nUh as as impasse continues Mark Meadows is the Freedom Caucus chairman and congressman Jim Jordan of Ohio also a Freedom Caucus member a and by the way would be in this House Judiciary committee\nInterview of Rod Rosenstein um we also have learned in the last three days Mark Meadows they'll start with you that\nWe now know that Lisa Page\nAndrew McCabe the deputy FBI directors under criminal investigation Lisa Page who is out at the FBI James Baker the top attorney the FBI they all are telling the same story that Rod Rosenstein said that he wanted to surreptitiously record the president of the United states\nIn the hopes of being able to get him to say something that would allow them to invoke the twenty Fifth Amendment so we there's a lot of questions for Rod Rosenstein at this moment\nWell there are a lot of questions I think probably the bigger question is why would Rod Rosenstein\nOr not be prepared to come to Congress tomorrow to clear his name\nAnd I think the reason for that is there there are credible witness as you know your lead in\nHad Rod Rosenstein voice saying well you know the needs to be facts and we have the rule of law well we're willing to to consider him innocent until proven guilty\nHim not coming tomorrow indicates that there is real credibility with these witnesses that suggested that he not only wanted to take the president but he wanted to use those tapes\nA to effectively have a de OJ who on the president of the United states\nWell he met with the president apparently earlier this week and blue on air force one does anyone know what the result of that meeting was\nWell I think the biggest thing is uh Shaun is is a let's don't read too much into a flight on air force one and I think it's the president trying to be reasonable and hear rod side of the story I think the

H. dot com\n\n[noise]\nWe can get you a congressman Jim Jordan\nAnd congressman Mark Meadows All right so the next step then is what that means to do I need to give out the numbers are Trey Gowdy office and chairman Goodlatte solvers in say call these men and demand that they subpoenaed under oath Rod Rosenstein ... well I don't know why they would be any hesitation\nConsidering that he is up to his eyeballs and everything the firing of combing the appointment of Robert Mueller the signing of the third buys a warrant and three people now saying that he's talking about taping the president of the United states and the context of possibly invoking the twenty Fifth Amendment what else do we need to get a subpoena for somebody\nWell uh hopefully I I Would I Would not encourage giving out anybody's phone number and you're great at holding people accountable but here's what I Would say is the fact that you're covering it your list interest and the people that the truly tune in on a regular basis\nThis and do you they need to make sure their member of Congress feels the heat and understands how important it is but the other part of that is is Gemini or are trying to work today uh to to stress the importance of why transparency and and the fact that the deputy attorney general must caught me at\nA bus raises right in and say this is what I did and this is what I didn't do anything shy of that uh really uh would would be an indictment on his credibility\nYeah what about the president now talked about the classifying and releasing the un redacted by the applications especially pages ten through twelve Seventeen through thirty for the final buys a warrant the one that Rod Rosenstein sign have either have you seen that particular buys their application\nI have not uh Shaun we need to see that we need to see it and don't take an after every time Bruce or goes in and talks with yeah yeah I remember Mr ... told us\nThat after each conversation he had with Glenn Simpson and Chris steel he would then contact person that the FBI and he would sit down with them and they would take notes we want to see all those notes of all those conversations we know they're at least twelve adult\nSo the so called real too as we need the those and remember when the president first talked about classifying what we all asking to do this three weeks ago he talked about any communications from Andy McCabe Lisa Page all those documents as well\nThat would include my number so we we need all that information\nAnd again if you're ... find that reading your debt talks about how our great system of justice works\nKey to that is transparency give us the information that we need to see and more importantly the American people need to see\nWell do you want to call chairman Gowdy it's too old to two to five six zero three zero be polite please too old to two to five six oh three oh\nA chairman Goodlatte is too old to two to five fifty four thirty one too old to two to five fifty four thirty one we'll put them up on Hannity dot com and again be respectful but I think with all that's going on and they should demand that he testify under oath\nOr thank you so much

o'clock news radio seven forty Katie our age with traffic and whether together here's Katie London [noise]\nYeah I'll listen to the old tactics of the past with the Republican Party mature intimately familiar with where\nDemocrats lobby political grenade right onto the field usually some kind of a you go through the list every night on Fox show you a racist beside you just you know the the phobic ... kind of stuff these identity politics can easily Republicans would scatter\nWell they tried a new one with Kavanaugh they try to really disgusting one this rapist line which is one of the most important things I've ever seen in politics and for the first time Sean in a long time\nWe had a president in the White House who said we're not going to back down a cabinet we're not going to let you back down we're going to back you up and we won one and that when I Believe is really just and this is not a scientific sample I don't want to oversell it\nBut based on me just driving around in my town which is a fifty fifty Republican Democrat county Martin County Florida\nRepublicans could not be more ecstatic that we finally have a war you are in a fight or in the White House who is not going to leave the battlefield when that identity politics or disgusting label or comes in from the Democratic party and I think it's really\nA spice up the Republican base and I think we may have a we may have a a decent the election day\nI'm not sure I Can't read the tea leaves um I think it all comes down in these midterm elections always comes down to turn out and if people are motivated like the Rasmussen poll says uh than it would happen to them and looking at the numbers that Republicans are more mad about the cabinet controversy\nAnd Democrats are and I'm more determined to vote in the upcoming elections this is a dramatic twenty five points shift in just the last six weeks Greg Garrett so that would give hope to me and hopefully the American people that\nSomehow the Republicans can bucked the trend in and maintain power in the house and maybe pick up some Senate seats which I think are a distinct possibility\nWell I think you're right the only question is with twenty seven days remaining or does this trend that Republicans are motivated and energized devote\nHave legs will it last over the course of the next four weeks [noise]\nUm and you know we just don't know that but you're right the polling data does show that and I you know I think that there is a general anger among both men and women across America that this was a process\nOf the confirmation hearing that was a massive amount of fairness and the presumption of innocence and due process and that absent some corroborating evidence from a thirty six year old claim\nYou really can't ruin somebody's career and their lives and you know the reputation or ... that they built up and the goodwill and their families reputation\nSure I mean I Do think that there is a feeling across America that a lot of this is unfair now there are liberals and the media which is ... and ah who are show rabbit that they don't care about fairness today just care about their own political agenda\nHowever misplaced in wrong it may be\nAnd so you're never going to change their minds there is no reasoning with on reasonable people so we'll just have to wait and see it's up to the Republican Party I think and and the candidates and indeed President Trump to maintain the momentum going forward over the next twenty seven days\nLook the hell out of great article today about what their agenda is and they the Democrats have big plans none of which will help the country or they want to shore up Obamacare which has been nothing short of a disaster for the American people\nThey want war Dodd Frank financial rules to protect quote dreamers and the integrity of elections in other words they want massive amnesty they want to aggressively probe any single thing they can they want this country locked down into endless investigation\nAnd likely the impeachment of Donald Trump\nThey you know Republicans celebrate the passage of the biggest tax cutting history they refer to as crumbs\nAnd they're saying it's time to take the crumbs back I guess the crumbs or the most delicious part of the meal um so all of this isn't the jeopardy dam bond you know I don't see a waning in people's enthusiasm now I think they have\nThey went so far in the cabin okay some frankly in the last two years what we have witnessed with the and you chronicled lives in your new book\nYou know the the attempted sabotage of the president I think they see the fundamental unfairness and nothing they stand for is going to help the average American to have a better life\nRight and so on the media and Greg just nailed it by the way that you know the media and the Democrats ... ... it's it's it's symbiotic I mean it it's a host\nAt a at a parasite at this point they're the same thing they have ginned up this rage not all of them but many of them against Donald Trump to such an intense for me think about the things showing that have come out I mean new lows in politics\nDonald Trump Supreme Court nominee called the rapist Donald Trump called the treat treat guilty of treason a crime literally punishable by death that's not hyperbolic he's been he's been called trees is they've jammed up the base so much on that here's the problem the Democrats have created for themselves in the election\nThat in order to seem like the more anti Trump candidate to get that money in those volunteers for your twenty twenty presidential campaign or to get that money in the midterms what do you have to do you have to oppose the trader you have to oppose the train rapist or whatever it's sick name they call the cabinet\nSo that that's what's leading to this a psycho pathology on the left\nAnd I agree I I don't see this waning and I do see Republican voters saying listen why does enough enough you attack this that this American patriot and cabinet or you try to take down the Trump Administration weaponize and the government when is enough enough and I think they're going to show up I Hope I pray they do\nWell what do you think about Hillary's endorsement of ah the incitement of getting in people's face and you can't be civil suit basically calling for instability you you can't really civil with the political party that wants to destroy what you stand for what you care about\nAnd then the other comments made by people like Maxine Waters and others getting their Hayes\nFollow him into a grocery store is following the gas stations confront them chase them out of restaurants which we have seen going on and on a on a regular basis\nFor Republicans it is absolutely wonderful you know they ought to send
