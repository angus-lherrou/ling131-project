eleven and every other bizarre thing she said about the people of Arizona which he calls the meth lab of democracy and the people are crazy\nI'm so I'm just hoping it happens that way and then on the outside you got tester on the bubble even I'm Joe Manchin on a bubble in West Virginia and Bob Menendez on a bubble\nYeah and it's interesting how what kinds of different levels yeah Menendez on a carry on state where the Democrats should be safe because his personal\nGuilt or with the Senate Ethics committee on a bipartisan unanimous majority find him guilty of a whole range of things I and some very very unsavory rumors were built around all of that now so he says he's now in such bad shape\nBoth having to pour millions of dollars that they'd like to go somewhere else then are pulling

working alternative to government run health care and um she didn't even have mayor well\nBetween his own bringing people out to vote and the campaign convincing Democrats are so sick of\nMenendez if they just stay home that many actually saved three or four house seats in New Jersey that's the kind of dynamic where I frankly I Can't figure out of my own head when you go from state to state to state\nOr how these things are involving right now 'cause they're they're very ... very much in the air and there are I think people know nobody listening should assume\nThat this was over or you can stay home and then they feel about run out and voted and if you end up not by election day you're not doing anything else go day to vote it's that serious\nLet me let me ask you this because it lets go with real clear politics than they have to wonder in for the number of house seats that they think are\nSafe for the Democrats and about one Ninety nine for the Republicans or work with the Republicans having the majority all of those top subs put them on defense than you did a forty five retirements for the Republicans that's a big number in any election year\nUm the house is what I'm most worried about and you know the thought of Nancy Pelosi being speaker elect and then speaker of the house once again is a pretty frightening thought um where do you see the house going\nWhy not functionally ah I I my personal range is between the bottom of about ... form which would mean policy where speaker and hiring them around to twenty thirty which would mean that Kevin McCarthy I think would end up with speaking [noise] um\nAnd I can't I've been in all honesty you know I've always been candid about these things I Can't give you a more accurate number I Can't say to you\nYeah I hadn't either when I really can't I mean and I think now and and look the conventional wisdom\nIs Republicans will hold the Senate pick up seats there and that the answer you blow see what when the house\nUm that's not a great case scenario but that would be sort of like a split decision by the American people also say one other thing is\nYou know some House Republicans have earned the wrath of their voters but it's really not about them it's about stopping an agenda that we know is going to be about impeachment endless investigation raising taxes they want their crumbs back\nSanctuary cities open borders eliminating ice and keeping Obamacare\nKenny one who does not bode has effectively voted for him and she should be no one should kids themselves if you do not want to have Nancy

in America studios this piece of news radio seven forty Katie our age Houston and I are the radio station some scary whether removing drawer area this Halloween I'm Corey Olson it's four o'clock on these radio seven forty Katie our age with traffic and whether together here's\nThe our ran for president did we had a Democrat nominee for president when Orange County and so the Democrats think we're vulnerable and that's why they hit zero zero in on us\nWell this is really interesting because most Republicans you don't think of California races being that important but\nNow it's become crucial in terms of you know we've identified all of these races on our website Hannity dot com um that they're really focused in and which means it could be a very late night or early morning before we eventually get to know who controls can or the house\nOr come next January and it could be Nancy Pelosi this is a real threat and I think a real possibility I Would say the fact that you have two hundred and four save democratic seats a hundred and Ninety nine safe Republican seats and all these thirty some odd toss ups\nAre are Republicans on defense that means they pretty much have to run the table and that's why they're spending all those money I'm can money at\nExactly yeah so tell us about you know what are the issues there do you think the people in your district the forty fifth district of California are paying attention and are are being influenced by the money and the negative ads\n[noise] yeah it's a real clear choice in this race I mean you have\nUm a a district where do people want to continue to this America forward I mean we had the lowest unemployment in forty nine years as you know and in orange county it's the lowest unemployment it in Nineteen years people have more money in their paycheck uh people are able to get jobs\nConsumer confidence is that I mean we're really moving this country in the right direction that the choices clear do you want to continue living uh America forward or do you want to go back to the Obama era too where are you at overregulation where you had high taxes where you had government in your life\nAnd I think it's a clear choice in what we're seeing right now on the early returns\nOr is that um the Republicans are just as energized as the Democrats are and in fact in my district we have over ... fourteen point advantage on the ... the return over the Democrats\nSo we aren't seeing this so called blue wave that you hear about we see that our voters are just as an energized\nWell I think it look if you look at the Senate Republicans have decided advantage and a lot of these races where they're red states that support Trump by big margins\nBut the houses just harder to figure and I don't know if people fully completely understand that there are a lot of headwinds history runs against the party in power they have forty five retirements that's the case for example Darrell ISIS eat\n'em and I you know I'm assuming with gerrymandering and and the legislature out there in California they do everything they could possibly do to maximize the number of democratic seats from the state\nAnd uh so it makes a particularly hard for people like yourself that have done a good job and want to do a good job with the people in your\nState and in your district but uh you know you're fighting against the state that has a Thirteen and a half percent income tax with a democratic governor of that or democratic lieutenant governor running for governor who wants free health care for anybody whether you're a California resident or not whether you're a citizen or not\n[noise] it's a very challenging environment and to be from California and representing California either or for reasons why we need to make sure our voters get out the so that we don't lose any Republican seats we have fourteen members of Congress right now and the Democrats have thirty nine\nAnd sell it is really really important that we hold our seats we got to turn the state around and you're absolutely right I mean the liberal policies that cannot Sacramento Jerry Brown and now possibly gather news that uh it is getting more and more affordable to live in the state and we need to have it\nGet to the point where that pendulum swing back and I'm going to continue to fight for my constituents that can can you to fight for Californians until we\nOne of the ... you will ever have swinging back is people are so fed up with the regulations on high taxation of states like California and New York Illinois and New Jersey is they are leaving and they're taking their money with them\nAnd you know my only fear is when they go to Texas or Florida or the Carolinas or maybe a lot of and a lot of cases Nevada or that they leave their liberal policies with them when they leave and and don't bring the failed policies that they voted for in their states\nBecause if you look at it it's become unsustainable for young people in California they can't afford to buy a first home they can't afford the high rate of taxes unless like you were in Silicon valley making crazy money\nYou're absolutely right and you know one one hope I have is that Supreme Court decision Janice versus asked me where you know if you're a member of the union you no longer have to pay your dues the union's control Sacramento and if we're allowed to have a couple of election cycles\nWe may start to see that money go out of the hands of the of the unions that may give us a fighting chance at some point in the future and the state of California\nWell I got to tell you something there is a fighting chance I Wish you the best out there I Hope people are paying attention Southern California you now have and this is the headline which I think is pretty scary Michael Bloomberg spending millions for California Democrats in in tight races\nAnd one other article came out said literally spending ... million dollars just on Southern

twenty five now till the top of the hour running for office Washington state's eighth district in\nWell he's kind of familiar with uh how dirty politics can be fighting for the people of Washington state which is you know fairly liberal and a lot of ways like oh California it's its neighbor and Oregon its neighbor\nAnyway he was a certified governor elect twice in two thousand and four than a King County literally discovered brand new balance that broke overwhelmingly for the Democrat and they counted him despite the fact that it was clear in that case\nAt least my reading of it that some felons ineligible people that actually voted in King County has a lecture and control systems have been sloppy\nBut you had you know groups like ... von and others you know paying for a recount other ballads and they found enough new votes\nThat were not counted to\nAh well not conducted the voters to swing the election is that pretty accurate what happened do you know\nI actually think county had more votes than voters and they've they've flipped it by a hundred and twenty nine votes at a to point millions eight million vote\nSlow down there how did you have more votes than voters and it'd be counted\nThat's what we questioned as well and the the the Democrat appoint a judge this year I'm a decided that we were gonna have to prove how those votes for extra cash\nWell why wouldn't you just use a calculator saying this number of voters and the number of votes and they don't add up and that that would be well election fraud\n[noise] yeah well he called a floppy is what he called it and then rope against us\nLet's talk about the eighth district out there in Washington state and uh you know how do you view the race that you're in because you're on our\nList of toss ups and that will tip the balance of power in six days\n[noise] well this is one of those twenty three seats that Hillary Clinton won in two thousand six teams that are Republican currently hold for Nancy Pelosi thinks that their pathway back to the speakership\nAnd this has been the most expensive house race in America at this point I think she spent more money against the than any other person in America\nAt Bloomberg weighing in with another two or three million dollars in this last week as well um you don't many cultures are known by your adversaries John and I'm proud of mine\nWell you know I mean the same thing we were talking earlier maybe water is a Walter season California's forty fifth district but I think there's that Michael Bloomberg the former mayor of New Yorkers spending some nine million dollars alone in Southern California and how much they poured into the race of negative ads against you\nIt's been it's been ... about two to one at this point now been outspent to to wander the good news people know me and so you know the lives that they tell really are putting the narrative but\nWe're all male in state every all ballots have been out for ... for a week and a half now and so every day's election day every day is election day I got the most left wing opponent I've ever had\nA you know she she woke up the day after Hillary law and decided that you need to be a member of Congress and this marched in more angry protests in Seattle and create in the district\nHating the president and somehow a qualification to be a member of Congress Sean I think we're all hoping for more than that aren't we\nDo you get it well of course we are we want to help the forgotten men and women and we have a trajectory of success or that I think has been unparalleled the as quick as any
