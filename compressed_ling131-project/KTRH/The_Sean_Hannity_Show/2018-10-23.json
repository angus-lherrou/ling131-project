nationwide Comcast bought a grand a year and text when to two hundred two hundred [noise]\nCome to west Chester showed is that they can Nassau County stand in the street foreigners in Brooklyn or the Bronx you're going to see people waiting to get picked up\nAnd go do yard work and construction work and domestic work you know this is not a problem that the people were coming into the country are solely responsible for the winter is coming if we in for them to work\nWell keep families\nAnd it will include a path\nTo citizenship number of immigrants added to labor force every year as a magnitude not seen in this country for over a century if this huge influx of mostly most co workers provides some ...\nFor the economy as a whole it also friends to the press further the wages of blue collar Americans and puts a strain on an already overburdened safety net immigrants\nAre the principal reason wages haven't gone up there are those immigrants' rights community\nWho have argued passionately that we should simply provide those were illegal we would legal status or\nAt least ignore the laws on the books and put an end to deportation until we have better loss but I Believe such an indiscriminate approach would be both on wives and unfair\nIt was Jeff too though was thinking about coming here legally that there will be no repercussions for such a decision and this could lead to a surge in more\nIllegal immigration alright amazing how they sound just like Donald Trump joining us now former speaker of the house author of the best seller Trump's America\nThe truth about our nation's great comeback us Newt Gingrich is with us or how are you\nI'm I'm doing great and I'm and Omaha today for the Republican Party of Nebraska and I you know I'm very very optimistic about how this election is shaping up\nWell I'm Glad you there do me a favor I think uh one of the biggest mistakes I made in my life in terms of supporting somebody disappoints is a guy by the name of Ben Sasse Ben Sasse had his way\nHillary Clinton would have been at the president the last two years she would have made the two Supreme Court appointments none of the bureau bureaucracy would have been removed we'd have open borders we would have Obamacare on steroids\nUm but he was never Trump or now is blasting made a new book trying to get me to talk about it so that he can sell copies when he hasn't passed a single piece of legislation with his own name on a loan that he sponsored\nSorry it's personal point\n[laughter] get that that's personal but you know the fact is\nThe never Trump or his are a fossilized group [noise] that are less and less relevant I mean it was every passing month the president's support from the Republican Party goes up or I Know this this extraordinary rally in Texas [noise] um [noise]\nI don't know anybody in American history who attracted as many people to as many different rallies as Trump has this year\nI was just an astonishing achievement and I think it bodes very well ah for the impact would that he's going to have on both this year's election and on two on two thousand twenty\nWell let's talk about what do we do about this caravan [noise] you know they're ... by foot they make it in what three\nWeeks three and a half weeks but\nOne thing that I think we both agree on is that I don't want a crisis precipitated at the border but goes Mexico is allowing this caravan to march through their entire country\nAnd we then have no choice\nBut to guard our borders because it's our sovereign land right we're a nation of laws and I do and in the process\nThe people on that side of the border that are not respecting our laws could they could precipitate a crisis where innocent people get hurt and I don't want that to happen right is that better\nSo so now you understand psychologically what Abraham Lincoln went through between Eighteen fifty eight\nAnd a the spring of Eighteen sixty one and he says again and again you know we do not have to fight this ... this was you know you aren't going to choose I said I'm not going to choose on I'm going to defend the constitution and do my duty but I'm not choosing to fight\nBut if you give me no choice I won't have no choice and I think this this is I think\nOne of the great chest that President Trump is going to face because he he when he talks about a person the other day he doesn't want anyone hurt he feels this very deeply\nOn the other hand he has sworn to protect the United states he has sworn to uphold our borders and and I tweeted this morning says it hit me this morning the president is serious\nThe Mexicans only have two choices then you can deal with the caravans now in southern Mexico for when the president blocks them from entering the United states\nThey can deal with them in northern Mexico and if you ask yourself with this simple question if they literally can't get across the border they're stuck in northern Mexico\nWell and I think our position ought to be\nThat Mexico this decide whether I Want us to deal with them now he wants to deal with them when they returned back the border but under no circumstances should we accept the I'm In a City College done some brilliant legal work on the fact that the president has the authority\nTo block aliens that he'd dean should the national threatened always got to say it doesn't have to defend his decision he just has to say I did this to be unacceptable for national security reasons and that block\nNow in all likelihood I don't think it's going to get to that point my guess is at some point because of the economic connection that Mexico needs with the United states that they're going to have to step in here somehow turn this caravan around how they do that I don't know\nBut the reality is either by the way and I do have compassion I understand people in\nIn Central America El Salvador Guatemala Nicaragua or that they want a better life but this is not the way to do what we have a process by which we have an immigration system and we're a sovereign country you don't get to ... you know create a crowd and rush the border\nAnd my fear is if they get to the border that we could be a potential outcome that's not going to be good for the people if we had the wall Mr Speaker built this wouldn't be an option for that if we had the wall we would have that would be no risk of anybody getting hurt on either side\nRight but but we remember in the near future the next few weeks\nOur policy should be to hope for the best foot plan for the worst I think the worst case is pretty simple the Mexicans ended up with their own political reasons doing nothing\nThey decide that they expect Donald Trump to cave and so there is going to let you know as many thousand people just want to enter the United states\nBut they haven't thought through is what if he doesn't have what if he does call out to the military what if we do in fact creator and effective human wall and block people from entering the United states\nNow and the Mexicans are going to have what what could be down as much as ten or Fifteen thousand people because of their ass keep growing\nWell there was one report yesterday from a newspaper in Mexico that said it's already ballooned up to fourteen thousand\nRight so so part of what I'm saying is at this at that point we we have a real decision to make and this is this is what Lincoln as saying over and over again yeah ah you\nKnow if you're going to preserve the union you're going to do whatever it takes to preserve the union he didn't say it happily he didn't say that excited we met many key early speeches 'cause this nostalgic sadness to the\nUh the we're bound together by the common core of mystique memory that we have no reason to fight each other a and he's almost pleading no don't do this well I Would say the same thing here this this is\nThe perfect crossroads to make the decision are we prepared to defend our sovereignty and to defend America for in the end and people blocking U.S forces to cave\nIn guilt us into allowing them to invade our country because we don't have the nerve to stop to\nAre we got to take a break or I Want you

Boulder through the window\nI'm at so they did the Henry Kissinger you saw what they did the Mitch McConnell this is just in the last two days and it's happening everywhere and I would also add that if Americans like what has happened over the last two years in spite of Obama laughing league claiming credit for it yesterday\nIf they want the success to continue the economic growth to continue the prosperity to continue I think this becomes a classical choice election but I think all of those things hopefully will factor into people's decisions\n[noise] while I think that's right um and I think that that in a sense\nOf the whole question of what kind of country do you want to become clear on the left to you now have\nSort of a brown shirt Nineteen thirties to total cherry an attitude a that they are willing to use force\nOr they openly said they're willing to use force to a former attorney general saying when the Republicans go low kick them or you have various democratic leaders saying

get control of the house so she never again people are saying these things are building on on a sense of a rage in a sense of\nLegitimacy of the modern American government which the left passionately believes are nice and I think that you're right that that's a factor\nThe reason I I pick Kavanaugh caravans as the as the central moment is\nThese historic events them into Kavanaugh fight wasn't just politics it was historic or are we going to get a solid conservative on the Supreme Court or what are we going to be mayor and character assassinated and lie\nAnd then manipulated and brown beaten into backing down so that was that was a historic moment so we'll have an effect for the next forty or fifty years a similarly this caravan whether uh seven thousand people for the Mexican

and then it will go by what my response would go by what but I think they pick and choose the targets that's exactly\nWell may be but you know I listen I train five days a week an hour and a half ... and they know this well it does it's it's not going to top crazy people but I got to tell you something I Will walk I Will do everything I can do to walk like\nI Do part of martial arts all the arts that I practice we ... we bow out if we're doing weapons training we show great respect if we're doing grappling or or outright full contact we do it with respect we respect the tap we were ... you know we're not there to kill each other we're there to make each other better\nI'm so there's a certain discipline David associated with that and but most people age don't know how to defend themselves and be they're going to react like past just caught then they're going to get past and somebody's gonna get hurt\nI couldn't agree more and it is a danger for people in the public square and especially people who hold themselves out as Christians whether you're a pastor or you have a Christian themed blackout you really gotta be careful at it but we do anyway we need to be civil and and when some people on Twitter ... and our other interactions\nBut I don't think that means we don't fight I don't think I mean we don't uh communicate our ideas as passionately and as intensely as the ... that it just means we don't have to get his dirty as they did\nWell I look I don't know I I we just had Newt Gingrich on and pass to what he was saying is between Cavanaugh I mean all these American\nValues that have have served us so well due process presumption of innocence and then you see that there was no core operation any of these charges\nIf the Democrats really cared about the issue they'd be going after Keith Ellison right now demanding an FBI investigation and Cory Booker will be having an FBI investigation and Claire McCaskill's husband would be having an FBI investigation\nAnd Bill Clinton would be in jail for the rest of his life\nBut they're obviously playing politics\nWith with very important issue so the hypocrisy is there but between Kavanaugh the mobs\nThe caravan that's happening and the fact that we've had on paralleled economic success\nFourteen state record for states record low unemployment record low unemployment for African Americans Hispanic Americans Asian Americans women in the workplace are vets record low unemployment youth unemployment lowest ever I I'm hoping that people factor that in in fourteen days when they vote or if they vote early\nI think the man on the street will factor it in I don't think the people on the street are stupid Democrat or Republican then that stupid the party leaders are stupid you know but the man on the street they're able to see this process that they know that Kavanaugh was that whole cabinet issue was a sham they see the hypocrisy of the left on full display\nThey know that this a caravan is not simply a random occurrence that you know a a all these unconnected people just randomly deciding to all walk downs of miles to America to look for better jobs they can see the orchestrated now some people are going to vote the party regarding this\nBut the others say listen I'm tired of this because all of the nonsense seems to be coming from the left\nAnd the very behavior that they pretended to criticize they've put it on steroids and I am the lady so you know they said well we don't like the some of the ... with the president during the campaign but you've got to say that I have it to another level and you're you're ...\nYou're you're out of Cleveland, Ohio okay you're a an African American conservative you took a lot of heat for supporting Donald Trump out at the results are in\nAnd we're seeing all of these jobs being created for the people look at a picture over there that's the forgotten men and women of America that's what that's what twenty six team was about for me the Thirteen million more Americans on food stamps the eight million more in poverty after Obama's eight years\nNow we've got four million jobs created eight million fewer people in poverty and on food stamps we have four hundred thousand manufacturing jobs that Obama sober never coming back\nWhile the president didn't get credit when you break down votes demographically with the black community because they're never doing better they've never done better\nThank God he's going to get the votes you know a ... in the Bible nicotine was came to Jesus button night and there are a lot of ... diem is and they say listen we see what Trump is doing we embrace with Trump is doing is not what they told us that waking up and you know if they say is thirty six percent approval rating\nAt twenty or thirty percent to the fifty six sixty six percent believe me his message just rent cream tell him his message was making the black community I\nCome from a traditional democratic family years voted party forever blacked it in my family and our sphere are now so ... to it that they're either going to not vote at all which is which is really good\nFor what we're doing with the conservative movement or\nThey're going to vote with us because they're starting to see that this was a charade here you know the media constantly but writing president from for no reason they've been doing it all day today CNN blacks used to go and get their news from CNN their politics from CNN and MSNBC they're starting to see\nWe got to get in the trenches we got to figure this out so we're getting a bunch of calls from people saying hey what's going on houses going how's Trump doing this how can we help on this particular side he's going to get off the black vote than any other
