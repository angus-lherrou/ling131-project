the Turkish foreign minister\nAfter ... rubber arriving from reality where he said the Saudis promised a thorough investigation\nMy palm pay on Wednesday refusing to blame Riyadh said he didn't want to talk about any of the facts the day after the president said there's got to be a presumption of innocence but he wants all the facts\nPopulist implement diplomat Wednesday refusing to blame Riyadh blah blah blah blah several of the members of the alleged hit team were found to have close ties to the crown prince Mohammed bin Salman\nSolomon according to a a photo by the New York times Turkish officials have shared an audio recording with the U.S in Saudi Arabia that they say ... was murdered by Saudi operatives of except the president saying they didn't get any tape but this time\nYou have a pro government newspaper reporting that ... apple watch recorded the interrogation torturing killing\nWell I Would assume that watch exist and this happened and what we believe that he might have been taken out and body pieces not sure that they wouldn't take the watch at that point but before leaving reality Pompeo told reporters at the Saudi leaders made no exception on who they would hold accountable\nAnyway so now according to the British newspapers are saying circus of fish or Turkish officials have a recording of blah blah blah and that had to pack up and down the apple watch and you have some of the other people saying it's highly unlikely that show that you could have broadcast the signal from his apple watches it was too far for Bluetooth connection\nYou know I think what's happened clearly as the Turks and the Saudi constantly had the ... wire damn transmitters and the Turks don't trust any diplomats that have been into most of the embassies most consulates in Turkey and they listen to what's going on\nAnd we'll find out in this case um my take I think it probably all happen but I don't think we should rush to judgment because the truth is going to come out probably sooner rather than later joining us now Dr Sebastian Gorka\nFormer White House advisor was brand new book is phenomenal by the way why we fight\nDefending the feeding rather not defending the feeding America's enemies with no apologies also Dan hop but Fox News contributors thirty or CIA up operations officer a doctor Gorka I assume you agree with me that all signs point to the Saudis\nAssassinating murdering this guy in a a far Paraguay that's what I'm thinking\nYou know the doesn't ruin in warfare or report from the battlefield must be questioned\nUh I think this man is that whether or not these audio tapes exist is another question but it's absolutely certain that this individual was caught between two nations that wants to dominate the Sunni Muslim world\nThat's the new often I'm an avid won regime of turkey and the birth place of Islam Saudi Arabia and this man was cork in the middle\nHowever however this isn't the fake news we've got to be accurate this man was a journalist wasn't on American soil that trying to spin it was a foreign national read them and it was a common type that you wrote commentary and he has a long decades long history\nOf ... the Muslim Brotherhood and there's also related to the figures Arab um see a lot of the twentieth century ... so all of these things are total statements of factual\nWhat do you think a missed the hop and it's been a while my uh my friend Dan is good to have you back I Know this has been your life and your business for so many years\nUm my gut is pretty clear on this uh I think this man was murdered and the most evil Ruth brutal way possible\nAnd I think that the president is wise knowing that we're going to get to the truth now there's no doubt we're going we're going to have the truth rushing to that point is not smart in my opinion\nI I agree with you uh look there's a lot of evidence that we have already we nailed it Fifteen Saudis\nTraveled on the Gulf Stream Arafat arrived if it costs to lift the day that Chris Yogi entered and we know he just show gay never exited the costs\nAre we do the makeup of those of the safety and Saudis for them apparently part of ... one of them the forensic doctor you referred to as listening to music well allegedly numbering ... body after he was killed\nOr what we don't know\nIt was with the orders that were given for these Fifteen Saudi and who gave them the orders and then to hold that they report posts for to those are all questions we need to answer\nThat President I think was a hundred percent right to just fashioned secretary state they gather the fact emphasize that they were issue of greatest concern to us we'll get the facts with accuracy and a lack of the that's what matters I Will remind the listeners that when Sergei Filin power was poisoned back in March\nBritish home secretary said they needed to avoid speculation while we allow the police to carry on their investigation I think that's what's going on here and\nThe last thing I Would just highlight is that Well Secretary if I was saying was meeting and doing it public diplomacy I'm quite sure that the FBI legal at Shea in Riyadh and the other in a central or in ... in ... probably meeting with their Turkish and Saudi counterparts to collect the evidence but it's to be a part of reviewing it shot\nYou know it's I Wish everything could fit in nicely neatly into a box assuming that I Believe that the Saudis are involved and whether it goes straight to the top I don't know the crown prince is denying it\nI'm kind of having a hard time buying that myself but knowing that there are very different country but\nNow it gets complicated because fall so the Saudis the Egyptians Jordanians the Israelis the United states the Emirates they're all fighting against the Iranian had Gemini and the region and their quest for nuclear weapons and the instability that would cause the entire world\nUm I Know everybody Dr Gorka would like to say that okay we're cutting off all ties with Saudi Arabia were done where this was that\nUm I think this will be consequences severe\nConsequences the president said um but it gets a little rougher what do you do if you're also trying to battle another enemy I mean the United states did partner with our arch enemy is the former Soviet Union to defeat or not the Islam in World War two\nYeah absolutely I mean you you don't make the perfect the enemy of the good\nGeopolitics is like politics or self domestically it is the author of the possible love the um over the perfect on on the truth is wrong we have a lot of leverage over Saudi Arabia or at the beginning of the Trump Administration we established very very\nGood ties through a and B as to bomb it's been found them in a very those relationships are not going to be tested\nBut this is a nation that survival depends upon our support militarily and I'm ... and training so there's a lot but reachable average against Saudi Arabia but you're absolutely right this is part of a\n... I Wish we were to leverage did in the last eight years when Obama was president we don't knowing that gays and lesbians were killed were routinely and Christians and Jews are persecuted and women are treated like fourth class citizens I mean you know that never seems to come up when there's a Democratic president\nShort guy can I give you one example of how bad it was so this guy who was a deep sea sympathize with the Muslim Brotherhood\nPresident Obama when he went on his global opponents tools and he started it in future who worked in the front row of that event sitting back\nTo show the environment find the Obama White house the Muslim Brotherhood's chief representatives that how big a difference with a lecture and make sure\nAre not cheaters Scott coverage three thirty on usually send forty K.

Seventy two cents of every dollar for defense mostly about Western European allies or\n... you know demanding better more fair trade deals with our Western European partners with Canada with Mexico people don't understand is if you don't threatened to pull out of a deal\nAnd you don't threaten terrorists you're never gonna get the deal and nobody ever thought in the past to ask for these things and the fact that he not only does it then wins then the American workers all across the country doing better and that that's what brings us to this election\nAnd I'm thinking I don't see any good ideas from the Democratic party that's going to improve the lives of Americans make us more prosperous so secure I don't care about it I Want I Want this country it'd be mouse burst\nHe also did something that the mainstream media is not reporting on the twenty fifth of July the declaration of a cease fire in Europe which absolutely brilliant Sean because he was able to\nGet pressure on China from Europe he's actively and people are really recording this\nHe joined forces with the Europeans the Europeans also had these trade issues and he's treated ... grievances with China and so what the president did is rather than fighting a war to directions you declare cease fire in Europe he knows he has to deal with them\nBut they're applying maximum pressure on China and I'm going to make a prediction right if you're on your radio show oh he'll bite me back I think you get to trade deals with China before to get a shot and if not by the end of the year it's yeah the very early in\nThe ... let me tell you why because when he did when he applied these sanctions and tariffs on China China what happened there economy took ... thirty five percent die\nSo that would tell me right now they're probably and I don't know for sure but I'm assuming they're banging on his door begging that they can get those back\nNo question yeah seven percent hit to the currency thirty five percent it to the stock market\nAnd their their economies grinding down and we know about China is they need to create twenty five million jobs you're just to break even shot and so uh if if if the locomotion of growth and progress is stalled uh it'll be cataclysmic\nFor that political system so I Believe they will be at the table or maybe they don't get it done at the G ... which is at the end of November but I bet you they get it starts shortly thereafter ah because we both know the president's personality he's hitting very very or\nA but he's a very fair guy and he'll hit the intersection of fairness

I mean I've talked to people on the left they you drive them nuts I mean you give them fit so fury that I thought only I could do\nIs try to see things just order this guy\nAnd I think one of the things that they're ceding most about that what they're most hating right now is the fact that both Claire McCaskill and Phil Bredesen neither Senate candidates one of them is the United states senator had been forced to respond to these videos all over the local media coverage I mean it's\nIt's it's critical mass in Tennessee in Missouri they're they're they're the local TV stations are calling me\nAnd the D.C journals do not want to talk about this in fact I just got to have like a Washington Post he's tweeting at me and he's and he's saying well you know she's been public about her somebody's position I said what about other things she's saying here but she hasn't been public about so they they very much hate me Sean for good reason\nWell listen I when you expose fraud what this is now what's supposed is something that I've been pointing out for a while we have Maxine Waters on tape saying they keep telling me not to say it and Everytime they tell me I'm going to say it anyway impeach forty five impeach forty five\nThen we see the center for American Progress warning every single Democrat running for office told talk about immigration we know we know we won't open borders and eliminate ice but don't tell the people the truth about what you're really gonna do don't tell them what you have is a massive\nFraud propaganda light campaigning being perpetrated by a party that has lost any sense of moderation that has no agenda that they're willing to talk about the ... that is a really scary\nScenario for the country and for people that ... that's the only way they can win is polite and the high who they are\nThat's what the stories about these red state Democrats have been on your show now uh this is the fourth or third third video between Tennessee in in Missouri and one of the staffers agrees McCaskill quote essentially has to lie to get elected and this is not just one staffer these are staffers throughout her office hiding\nHiding and masking the source of contributions one staffer says it's acting beautiful it's great when it works for us not against us\nTo take the money ... indirect means in order to I guess appeal to moderate through the front page New York times story today about how these\nPro life pro gun Democrats were shrinking constituency in Missouri the\nDemocratic Party have voted these people out but McCaskill still have to appear moderate so that she can get elected so it's it is a truism that\nIn order to get elected in a state of Missouri or Tennessee you basically have to mislead voters to get elected as a Democrat and that's what these stories and cover\nYou know the thing is to me um I think we ... the American people had it when\nThe Democratic party a band in any sense of due process under the law equal application under our laws you know immediately I Believe her but they also said the minute the cabin all was announced we are going to oppose them any way by any means necessary\nAnd then when all the the the allegations are getting more severe more severe and everyone's saying well I Believe her not even want to hear from judge Kavanaugh presumption of innocence at all and when corroborating so called corroborating stories fell apart they still didn't care\nAnd I think the American people are watching that we have a story out today where you've got these anarchist middle class of vendors attacking to Minnesota GOP candidates are assaulted one is a woman\nA name as state representative Sarah Anderson punch by an anarchist EPA trying to stop him from kicking her campaign site\nI mean this this is now the Democratic party and you're exposing it and the ... and yeah you're going to be hated but I think shining a light on truth I thought this was the stuff that sixty minutes used to do well\nUndercover McCaskill statement McCaskill Claire McCaskill issued a videotape state which is unbelievable I Know you play loaded on your show last night and she said the number of quoted she says well it started with Josh Hawley us to her opponent would be part of fraudulent embedding someone in my campaign first of all I categorically unequivocally deny\nThat he does not work for me he does not work with me I've never spoken to any of these candidates I stay away from candidates I investigate candidates but she just went on TV Sean Claire McCaskill just falsely stated that Josh was involved in is the attorney general Missouri was involved in this and then she says three times I committed fraud\nWill will vote by what were courting the people being honest that's brought\nIn their own were their own their own learn something\nMy words I'm not the one who said quote get over it this is a direct quote for staffers nixed a roast about how she's going to impeach Trump and she didn't tell the moderates to get over it after she gets elected that's their words and she's calling me a fraud stir for telling the truth to the American people it's the job of investigative reporting\nTo expose the truth and and I think she didn't have to respond to her response because it's filled with lies and innuendo an accusation\nI'm just glad that you were able to get\nAll of this out and before the election um why do I suspect that there's probably going to be more tape other candidates I have known you know what for a decade or more\nThat's right yeah I mean ... you know my M. O. a pun intended Missouri now you know my ... next to release a candidate of the time we have to United States senators\nAnd their candidates opposing them responding to our investigative work we're lying in their responses were sort of using the Lenski tactics against the ... the Lenski was to get the reaction and use the reaction in the reaction to the reaction we have two reactions now\nAnd we're going to the next state will be releasing another video early next week in a very very a battleground state [noise] same theme Sean ... they have to lie and then once they get elected to the old bait and switch through\nAnd do what they actually intend to do and it's it's just on videotape stopped my words thought my claims are not giving you unsubstantiated\nNot let people watch it to themselves and they can decide people pretty smart um\nOh James O'Keefe is with us founder and the c._e._o. project very tossed dot com and\nThe videos are up there and you can check 'em out your cell both Claire McCaskill and her staff and Bill Bryson and his staff and now he's telling us there's more to come we'll come back we'll take a quick break we'll come back and continue eight hundred nine four one showing a toll free telephone number will make a quick stop\nOr there is an opponent for Pocahontas Elizabeth Warren Jeffs deal and uh does that that that raised now need re evaluation by the people of Massachusetts will get to that\nAnd your calls a eight hundred number one shown as a number will continue [noise]\n\nPartying and investigating the stories that matter to you\nKnow [noise]\n...\n[noise] going to kill any reacted and now it's like if you write lanes on the east and south than it was hard drive\nThat's not to get some sort or is it the way that was really starting to stack up moving at a downtown ... planes approaching Kirby dry that can add about ten minutes and that there is a two Ninety out that market highly sticks being reported also is telling us that are really not that he's putting north town\nAt the port of Houston I can you let him in the Gulf gets windows dot com twenty four hour traffic center [noise]\nWe are looking at the possibility for some scattered showers as we wind down our Wednesday and my years of thunder in the late night will fall back to around sixty fifty percent chance for the rain mostly cloudy Thursday and maybe a stray shower low seventies slight chance for shower Thursday night low sixties cloudy friday slight chance for showers mid seventies to around eighty Jeff you know for the weather channel\nSixty four now under overcast guys at the gate T.
