I got the sense that he did it for all the right reasons as well as articulated by\nSenator Collins and what was the most riveting one hour speeches I think I've ever seen on the Senate floor that actually meant something\nAnd how she systematically went through every single not only allegation but the role of advice and consent the meaning of the constitution the interpretation of the federalist papers um what it means to the whole issue in process of\nOf a presumption of innocence and and how important it is to society or even issues where I disagree with their own like for example roe v Wade and precedence and and judge Kavanaugh is real record she she brought a level of the seriousness and sobriety to the entire debate\nI I just I I I don't know her and I frankly was blown away by this today and it give us some reaction to all this we have David shown civil liberties attorney criminal defense attorney Greg Jarrett\nFox News legal analysts author of the number one bestseller the Russian hoax Greg what was your reaction to that speech I don't know if you have the same reaction I did I was I was stunned I I don't know Susan Collins well but I Know a better today\nIt was nothing short of brilliant a week with uncommon eloquence and sound reasoning she delivered the finest speech on the floor of the U.S Senate that that I've ever witnessed in for a non lawyer\nIt was a compelling legal brief in support of Kavanaugh I thought it was important\nThat at the outset Holland's condemn the outrageous behavior the distortions by special interest groups activists protesters and some Democratic senators making it clear\nThat their shameful character assassination backfired on them as far as her vote is concerned and and I I the best part of what she said\nAh was re counting many of Kavanaugh's opinion to demonstrate they'd even Democrats and liberals should be satisfied if not pleased with Kavanaugh as a Supreme Court justice but you know she did something unique here\nUh she reported the sexual misconduct allegations\nAnd said in no uncertain terms that presumption of innocence and fairness is relevant in the Senate advise and consent\nDuty and she announced her own standard for considering accusation she said it should be more likely than not which lawyers no into civil cases is called a preponderance of the evidence or and she said it wasn't there\nThere were no witnesses to corroborate Christine forward including your closest friend nobody has any recollection of it all said so under penalty of perjury so she present ...\nThat was probably the most impressive by main her of a real obvious heartfelt caring for professor Ford\nAlso excoriated whoever it was and she doesn't believe it was Dianne Feinstein and she defended both ... and Senator Grassley in terms of the fairness\nWhich I said from the beginning I think the seriousness of the allegation deserved a serious response from the Republicans and often a critic of them and I think they did handle this perfectly on their side\nAnd but whoever did this did a grave disservice to this woman and there's no doubt about that David shown let me bring you in and get your initial thoughts on what we watch unfold you now with the announcement Jeff Flake Joe mansion\nAnd Susan Collins it would appear that tomorrow's vote expected to be around five in the afternoon eastern time on a Saturday or that the that\nJudge Kavanaugh has the votes to be confirmed to the United States Supreme court\nBut certainly looks that way I'd like to think that they're calling speech brought some dignity back to the process is certainly did for the moment when she was speaking she you know as a student at Senator Bill calling from Maine I was very close friend of mine with whom I disagreed on some issues but it was ... he thinks that same vein\nYou're absolutely right what she said was so critically important\nAgain it emphasized the language of article ... section two presidential have the power\nWith the advice and content that's what's been lost in all of this also critically important that she emphasized the presumption of innocence you have some legal scholars and commentators during the course of this debate all of a sudden this and one of the presumption of innocence doesn't really apply this isn't a trial it's not a trial based concept in American law that's in the fundamental\nAmerican principle that's the way we go about our business we don't assume based on allegations than a man or woman has built up a career is guilty it was important for that\nUm I worry still I have to say about where we go from here because we have seemed to have here by United States senators and has been beyond the pale that I never in my wildest perhaps naive dreams couldn't imagine with possible people who simply don't know anything about\nProfessor Ford or judge Kavanaugh ... carved out a physician you were a bad guy if you didn't wear black to Columbia Law school during the Kavanaugh hearing that meant you might believe judge Kavanaugh this is beyond the pale is the future lawyers I'm worried about where we go from here in the last one I Want to make on this is\nThe very same people who are land that the president for daring to criticize cooking FBI agents who have been proven to be ... et cetera those people from stroke was a hero\nOr now criticizing the FBI that this wasn't a fairer thorough investigation they moved the ball or with their criticism whatever it is for judge Kavanaugh was he was a sex offender now is not that they don't like his demeanor because he took it personally when\nIt comes I don't know they don't like his temperament was once opposed to respond to be a serial drug or ... and gay rapist of teenage girls I I don't know what the appropriate response except if you're innocent just outrage and anger at a level that I couldn't even begin to describe\nBut uh it looks like this goes forward it looks like

nothing short of spectacular now I Know a lot of people are spending a lot of money and it's probably only going to get worse for her because she clearly following her conscience on this issue

there's in every single state now Claire McCaskill is down significantly and the latest poll in Missouri\nJoe Donnelly is in trouble in Indiana Heidi Heitkamp is down and eleven in her state of North Dakota or I say that Rick Scott will be the next senator from Florida and then of course Martha ... has been surging lately ah where do you think it stands at this moment John McLaughlin\n... I I think you're seeing a a definitely a cabinet effect but it's really what it is it's a ... gauge whether Trump voters are showing you know you're done and I talked about two years ago how Trump had to bring new voters and to to win the election and we did\nDonald Trump ignited billions and their voters who came out and voted in twenty sixteen that didn't vote and twenty twelve that took a pass on Mitt Romney and\nUp until this time up until the hearing last Thursday a those voters were staying home or a good portion portion and weren't engaged and I think\nThey act it's got to see that the the actual hearing in the news coverage and the character assassination the ruthless politics I think the Democrats had looked ... Chuck Schumer is a really smart\nStrategic senator and he's the leader and he looked at that map and he said this thirty five seats up twenty six hours entering states that that Donald Trump won what can I Do to try to take back the majority\nAnd he probably made a calculation if we can embarrass cabinet or that the Republicans pull him it was suppressed the Trump voters so that a good number of those sixty three million would stay home\nBecause you only get Ninety million come out in the mid term elections so they they made the head the Republicans start from the president stuck with him and the Democrats were exposed these voters are now outraged that the Democrats would put such a late hit on\nAnd try to smear a good person who would remind them of their father their their their son their their their brother\nAnd said this was totally unfounded uncorroborated there's no evidence\nTo it and they're trying to destroy this man in this family and the Republicans ... ... the Republicans and independents who supported Trump or coming back out and you're seeing them in these polls that Missouri poet McCaskill behind was appalled that we did for a super back she's down ... points down or you're seeing this I'm seeing this impulse every day it's\nIt's not a big explosion but what it is is ... ... is coming back in and\nGalileo while ... Trump voters were dying well what\nWas a huge enthusiasm gap just a month ago a lot less than a month ago two weeks ago two and a half weeks ago\nUm has now totally and completely evaporated and conservatives have been awakened and and by the way Doug shown the party that we saw protesting and the party that Russia's to judgment the party that doesn't believe in due process the party that doesn't believe in the presumption of innocence\nOr the need for some corroboration and the party that defended Clinton and defense Keith Ellison a I don't think they're looking too good here to the American people right now and they they are being shown to be the radical party I've been describing for some time\nWhile shot I mean I don't quite know how to reply but al ...\nAnd you can say I actually agree with your characterization in their handling of all of this has been pretty stupid and detrimental um to you know any sense that they have have any sense of moderation in this day and age\nWell I don't think they have any sense of moderation but what they do have\nIs an ongoing lead in the house which I think you can lead to pick up the house and I think from what I see looking at the Senate races there are all very very close within the margin of her and I really think to get a definitive answer will have to come back and in a week or ten days after capital is as I think we all expect\nNarrowly confirmed to see whether the effect job than you are talking about Iran is actually going to hold over time I think it really has to play out and I think there's a good chance that the protests you've seen from the Democrats them from women like him or not we'll continue and will ultimately\nA benefit particularly in suburban congressional districts less so Senate races the Democrats\nHow's it going to play with the voter in the rest of the country not in New York D.C San Francisco and Los Angeles a or Illinois or Chicago how's it going to play with her I think of America I think it's going to play very differently\nI think the the real challenges the one John raises I think it's that's right will this re engage the Trump voter I think as of today probably some evidence that that\nIs gonna run into twenty point enthusiasm gap just the ... and in sixteen days\n[noise] let's let's let's wait a week Sean and we'll see where\nThey don't I think this leaves a bad taste in people's mouths what they did and said this man\n... disgusting and somebody Who Lied United ... marijuana Arlen than things that\nYou know what they did to this man and how they bludgeoned this man and his family as as vicious as they've been with no due process and for once you know how critical am of Republicans they took it with the seriousness the topic deserved they handled it properly\nThey looked into every crevice in corner and we still have no corroboration now do we believe in the presumption of innocence or not\nYou probably that how the Democrats handle this\n... ... ... if if I can voiced support for you perhaps he'll give me a chance to do that I Will have a I said this is somebody who has my own a judicial legal and philosophical differences\nWith a judge Kavanaugh so I Would not be voting for him but I Do think showing that you are correct\nThat the way this process has played out depresses me as an American first and a Democrat second\nUm I think the process is destroying\nA the independence of our judiciary destroying the presumption of innocence and basically what is destroying what makes our country great so we may disagree philosophically but I'd like to think we stand for the same enduring values\nWasn't Lindsey Graham who in many ways showed such a profile in courage in this\nUm and even and I think the deliberate seriousness of Susan Collins you know the Republican Party is made up of a varying factions that I don't see these factions really existing in the Democratic party John I mean you've got the extreme left and then you've got the super duper extreme left and\nNo room for a scoop Jackson even through Joe Lieberman of all people out of the party how do you throw a Joe Lieberman out of your party [noise] um I mean that's insanity to me\nOh absolutely and and I tell you what\nDoes it does make the point you have over four weeks ago\nAnd that's a lifetime in politics I mean I mean remember twenty sixteen the Derrick has
