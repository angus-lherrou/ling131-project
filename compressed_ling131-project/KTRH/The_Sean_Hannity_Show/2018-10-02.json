but they say they can and the lawyer keeps saying they can but she ... tracks on a story at what point does the man\nYou know how does Brett Kavanaugh to quote\nYou know infamously re Donovan one saying how do I get my good name back or famously saying you know how does this go off a civil discourse in this country\n... ... okay you know I find it particularly appalling that some of these never Trump hers and\nAre these questions and then the entire democratic leftist apparatus had the audacity to make all these charges and slander and and destroy a Kavanaugh and his family\nAnd had the audacity to suggest that he shouldn't stand that independence out and that his dealings with passion indicates\nThat he doesn't have the requisite judicial temperament this are on the United States Supreme court ... hair his righteous indignation his his to our a rant which was totally justifiable necessary in fact to preserve his position\nRight to they compare that to the twelve years on the vents when he had exemplary judicial temperament which is universally acclaimed I find their uh I find their analysis\nAbsurd on its face and shouldn't even be taken seriously this guy has grand judicial never I Would hate to have that kind of\nIntimate guy I how was somebody supposed how was somebody supposed to act if they're accused of being a serial gang rapists who drug drug young girls as a matter of course on weekends in high school how I mean what is the proper response you supposed to go there and the guys I just didn't do that\nYeah ... ...\nWho were falsely accused to react exactly the way that Brett Kavanaugh did\nAh when you're graciously wrong you're angry and he expressed the appropriate to righteous indignation of an innocent man uh but the most important thing he said was I don't question that ah\nChristine Blasey Ford was it some time and at some place sexually assaulted it just wasn't me so he's he's not calling her a liar or what is essentially doing is saying she is mistaken for a variety of reasons she may have conflated to different\nUh individuals or she may be projecting based on you know some uh for some reason that we don't understand a but this was a man who sounded like he was being falsely accused into can damn him for being angry is to ignore human emotion\nWell let's say you got a ... and contrast that with his response on the mark from a column interview\nAnd I was watching that very concerned I thought he was a flat out that he was very much to restrain and I said to myself\nAnd robotic if he doesn't quit holding himself that nobody's gonna blade and then I'm telling you nobody would've believed him if he had done that same thing but he finally somebody a coach them by ... somebody told him quit holding back or he called himself and he was masterful because no matter how many people said\nWhy she was ... she was initially believe well she was credible\nThey they believe that I can in multiples when he testified in he totally indicated itself and it was a mashable reporter because I think it was thought that it\n... what ... where does it go from here because um I have no I mean Jeff snowflake is Jeff snowflake who knows what he's running for president now and and headed up to Massachusetts New Hampshire I guess he thinks he's going to beat Donald Trump I I don't think this guy could get Fifteen votes at this point\nThen you have what Susan Collins we have no idea where she's coming down on this although she rightly said when Dianne Feinstein did is unfair to everybody in the process\nAnd then you've got Lisa Murkowski I mean she was a a no vote when she was needed on numerous occasions\nYou know I to me there's only one answer the answer is thirty five days from now and that's when the American people have an opportunity to add more senators from West Virginia from Indiana from North Dakota from Missouri from Florida\nI'm from Arizona Nevada and but until then you\nKnow I don't know what happens I have no faith that anybody really gives a rip that this man's life as been bludgeoned this family has been bludgeoned and there's there's no corroborating evidence for any of it\nBut I think we have to wait to see what happens or in the FBI's report if the investigation finds nope plausible evidence against Kavanaugh this will not only help to restore his reputation and solidify the integrity of the United States Supreme court at large\nBut it will also give a valid reason\nTo senators like Murkowski and Collins a and Jeff Flake and somebody like Joe mansion and and perhaps a couple of others are who are Democrats to vote in favor of Kavanaugh but I find it amazing to me\nOr that we're holding Kavanaugh to an unfair\nA standard of his behavior in high school and college as alleged I doubt very many Democrats in the United States Senate could could meet\nThat standard in some of these allegations Julie sweat Nick are preposterous on their faces you point out she's now backtracking NBC issued a statement saying that we can't confirm any of what she's saying and\nIn fact she's deviated now from her sworn affidavit a in her most recent interview with NBC News so you know that a claim\nWhat do you think of the view which again this statement only come out a week prior and multiple mold I mean she backtrack dramatically on very key points\nAnd when you think of the seriousness\nOf drug in girls and gang raping them and now she well he was near the punch bowl and while he wasn't lined up for the I saw him in the hall and nobody else\nI mean she was saying this was done as a matter of course on weekends at the time we believe that no girl that was raped no boys that saw the drug gang of girls ever told the teacher a parent a law enforcement officer\nNobody told them\nI find that go ahead Greg answer that you're still no no it's go ahead ...\nWell I I I find that again absurd on its face as you said this is I Do\nUh the the sweat Nick ... while the other sweating allegations that just doesn't hold true and I think following up on what you said and it doesn't comport with human nature just wouldn't have happened that way but it was truly right there would have been held up eight after one and it for sure after multiple times this doesn't hold true that in response to something you said earlier\nWhat we do taking this in the mid term hits the FBI I'm something really damning which I truly that nothing will change the fact that the Democrats have acted in bad thing\nEither way and the people to know what they've done is way except that uh and pernicious\nAnd I think that the public is is outraged and I think they're going to punish the Democrat and and in the mid term what I Do think though is we'd be much better off with a victory\nAnd and the Democrats had they acted the way they have than a loss in them having acted the way they have because what Trump stands for it's fighting and ultimately winning and we we always blame our losses in the Senate\nBringing you twenty four seven from the gallery are made in America studios\nVis vis news radio seven forty Katie our age used in news weather traffic command

quite a few girls during that time frame I saw him around the punch\nThat when the malls or the bunch container is I don't know why he did but I saw him by them or their friends who were never any

people that know about that part of\nThis morning sweating it provided for names of ... she says went to the parties with her one of them said he does not recall a Julie sweating it another of the French she named is deceased we've reached out to the other two it hasn't turned back\nBy twenty five now so the top of the hour there's NBC News going forward with\nNothing after all this was was absolute ... how\nDoes this task for news story when on top of everything they even admit there's massive inconsistencies from the statement she released just a week ago you would think she can stay consistent in a week and the people that she says what corroborate remember she's charging here that there was a a a systemic\nParty culture where almost every weekend that women girls young girls were being drugged\nWith ... and and ... forced to be an ... and young boys would then lined up outside the room waiting to gang rape\nWomen and girls and that this happened thirty six years ago and nobody ever ever ever told a parent told a teacher told law enforcement and she gives the names just like in the case the professor Ford of individuals that would quote\nCorroborate this story and it's not corroborated just the opposite well this guy is dead and on top of that than we've got oh this one doesn't even know who you are\nHow does this how do you where is the news handed in any capacity here\nTo put this on the air Byron York is joining us he's been running a lot of columns about this is not the least of which is how high the bar\nHas risen in the goalposts we've come a long way from oh it's going to be very limited in terms of the FBI investigation it's only going to be maximum a week and they'll get the job done and will move forward with a vote now you see that a Camille Harris she's now coming out with another allegation just today\nMyron hey Sean listen on this on this NBC thing I think everybody's got to be in two minds\nAbout a war on on the basis of the lack of evidence and\nUh there's no way the story should ever had been reported publicly just shouldn't have bad but it was given in part a but due to the news networks um thing about Michael I have an anti her lawyer\nSo once it was all out there the fact that NBC has reported this is probably a good corrective or at least we can see what I think was the parent to a lot of people\nAre ... there was nothing to this story [noise]\nUm and when she offered a witnesses who could corroborate the stories you just played a one had no idea who she was another was deceased and to others didn't answer the phone so I'm the story is already out there and has already gotten it's damage it is a good thing to knock it out\nAll right so let's go through all three cases that the the Democrats now want to expand the investigation they they never wanted a limited investigation they want to know fledged investigation is now being the seventh\nFrom every indication at all I'm reading though that the FBI is moving expeditiously and it seems like they're very close to probably completing their work but\nIf we start with professor Ford professor Ford claimed that these four people were at the party nobody remembers any such party that she describes and the one person that was supposedly was an eye witness\nTo the alleged abuse in her case was mark judge and he said absolutely it didn't happen and then if you look at the ... if you look at the ... case this was in the New Yorker\nWell the New York times couldn't print the story and and they actually brought up the fact that after calling dozens and dozens of people to corroborate they discovered that Mrs Ramirez was calling former yell classmates and asking them if they remembered and that she wasn't sure sure herself civil is Brett

I don't know yet but uh I think that's correct so here with the agreement or with our colleagues\nAnd Chris Coons was never part of the agreement he's a Democrat from Delaware like risk but he was never part of this agreement what compromise has been reached for Chris Coons he is voting no\nHe's asking for the investigation to continue our around whether or not he's been honest about his drinking habits so Chris Coons is a non factor here Lisa Murkowski Susan Collins and Jeff Flake expressed a desire for the FBI\nTo talk to the witnesses around the Ford allegation and ... and the fall and incredibly incredible lead within a week I think the FBI is about finished everybody can look that report for themselves and said this changed anything I Hope we don't move the goalpost Jeff voted yes in committee\nWith the understanding that he wanted to see what the FBI found about these accusations and hopefully get this done this week\nAll right let's talk about this agreement because it was supposed to be limited in scope and now it is expanded out further we now see the uh your your colleague on the Senate Judiciary committee the grapes\nSenator from the state of Hawaii he wants men by the way to sit down and shut up yeah which was a pretty outrageous statement but anyway a senator her own out now is saying she wants in an F. FBI investigation into the quote I throwing report yeah\nYeah that's where we're our so my dad owns a bar\nAnd so a throw in ice is like a good day in a bar so the bottom line is that solve a bunch of BS and she's not part of the agreement she voted and she's the one that said the goal was to delay\nThe hearing long enough to get into the mid term soon and I have a Democrat replace\nA Justice Kennedy in twenty twenty she said that not one media outlet fed ask her what did you mean but they're agreement I just outlined it was a the three witnesses that Dr Ford named mess for ... isn't there any a credible leads within that world of FBI will follow 'em and that's it and we're going to vote this week\nOkay let's talk a little bit about your on the program last night on on Hannity and I thought you dropped\nA huge bomb shell and I was asking you look I have no idea how Jeff Flake is going to end up voting in this I have no idea what Lisa Murkowski is going to do I have no idea what Susan Collins is going to do or they are your colleagues maybe you up some more insight than I have but\nTo me they're the ones that met privately with Joe Manchin and they decided on this course now that it's an FBI investigation but right close to be limited in scope is now\nOut into other allegations but if you fall one vote short you came up with a pretty interesting and thoughtful idea that I kind of like\n[noise] well I think we've got the votes and then some but here's the question does the Republican Party abandon Brett Kavanaugh delete legitimize\nThe way he was treated at the Senate is it forty nine what I Would like to see happen is to appeal the verdict of the Senate and the November election and take it to some of the states and see if the people in those states agree with senator about Brett Kavanaugh the swap\nWould abandon Kevin ... the traditional way of doing business is if he fell one vote short just pull the plug\nHe's never quit I don't want to quit on him so I think Trump might be different I think Trump would say listen this man's been abused are not given up on hand less having an election to see if the vote in the Senate really represented the Trump states where Democrats are saying\nWell I mean this is the thing I mean we have people like Joe Donnelly he's a no he said already Claire McCaskill's know already as a matter of fact yes most Democrats would know no matter who Donald Trump s\nRide they've already against Gorsuch\nYeah All right so now what's gonna happen to Bill Nelson of Florida and Joe Manchin and Heidi Heitkamp and Joe Donnelly and well I'm a smart question\nMartha ... a great candidate for the Republicans in Arizona most served their country with honor and distinction I Hope she wins um we certainly could use a win out in Nevada or do you think this impacts the race and do you actually think you're going to get the votes and why do you think you get the votes\nWell number one I think we're going to get the votes because Jeff voted in committee yes I don't believe the FBI is going to find anything a relevant to this limited investigation that would show that\nThat are ... force claims are more credible and that there's anything new about Brett Kavanaugh in terms of the investigation I Would hope they would stay consistent with this vote I think the other two Collins and Murkowski or friends they're warning death the to check the committee's homework I get that\nThat will be done here shortly but you're asking the hypothetical\nI Can't imagine how we would explain to the Republican Party that we gave up on Brett Kavanaugh because for one vote short when a lot of the states that led to that vote being short Trump won I Do not believe North Dakota once a highly had camp to vote no\nI agree with you\nI Am so this is why you have an election appeal the verdict of the Senate if we have to to the people of of the country in November\nLet me ask you if you've spoken to these red state Trump state Democrats that are up for reelection if you talk to any of\nThem doing it right now uh\nSo you mean you're you're communicating hand I don't I'm not sure if they're all Hannity listed as viewers beyond that\nI doubt if they're listening [laughter] I think we're fine but here's the dilemma that you that this process has put us in this is about the future of the judiciary\nThe stays couldn't be higher this about the reputation of one of the finest man I Know it's about who would come forward after this debacle is about sending a tone and the standard that will destroy the ...\nAnd eat the Senate alive\nSo I Know President Trump pretty well I think we've got the votes and then some but I think he's a different kind of politician that he wouldn't let the system get off the hook that if we had to as a last resort where one vote short let's say hypothetically we take this issue to the ballot box in about thirty something days\nThirty five we can I find that extra vote that way we would have a good nominee or have a light salvaged have a process uh fate and the people finally get to speak up here I think we're fine but you asked me a question and I thought about this yesterday\nAnd said if Brett Kavanaugh is on the ballot in some of the states I think it changes the election use in North Dakota there's a poll out today the number one issue in North Dakota is a Brett Kavanaugh's nomination is far ahead of anything else sixty to twenty eight people in North Dakota North Dakota support Brett Kavanaugh\nAll it's fascinating to me that the Democratic leadership is showing no support or comprehension or understanding of what their colleagues from states that are not New York and California have to go through in terms of reelection but the reality is\nThat I Would even argue that if they do vote for cabinet oh it's only an election year conversion and there were only doing it because if they don't the people in their state will throw him out but they'll probably go right back\nTo being a party line vote would Schumer at the end of the\nDay [laughter] well you know I'm I'm not a psychologist or a political scientist I don't care as like you know I'm a bad this I don't care how you find Jesus as long as you do you know if you can figure out that Brett Kavanaugh was highly qualified and these accusations have crumbled\nAre good for you and now here's the point\nThis has become the most despicable thing I've seen in Washington and that's saying a lot\nIt would change the face of the judiciary forever if we condone it so it's just not a complicated issue for me if we follow vote short a less take this to the ballot box and see what happens\nLet me ask you about this whole process now we've gone through and and I do think the Republicans and you know I'm pretty honest broker I'm pretty critical of Republicans when they're wrong I Do think that they\nThey have handled this with the seriousness the charge deserves a them ... [noise] yes no I think they handled properly because these are serious allegations but she identified and and look I won't go through the ... the entire\nWe don't need to we don't need to reach try this case I made I don't mind you've made up your mind there five accusations that have are are are not verified or just made up not true outrageous so it's not about Kevin\nIs this is the environment we live in senator and I warn those arguments on radio and TV every two and four years\nIf you're a Republican or a conservative and you're running for office you're going to be called a racist or sexist the point a massage it is the home of ...
