I mean in other words I talk about every election\nRepublicans raise the sexes massage in his homophobic Xena phobic Islamophobia they weren't dirty air water and they want to kill granny on roller over a cliff and they want to kill children well now with you know cold hangar is being said then\nAnd there it's it's just the same tactics as those\nTactics I think are backfiring on the Democrats and all of the activists in protesters and and these special interest groups the polling data Sean is very revealing there was some apathy among Republicans as is often the case in a midterm election\nAnd suddenly that changed and transformed GOP voters into energized and motivated voters to get out on\nElection day next month because they see what is going to happen if they lose the house and the Senate because Nancy Pelosi and Jerry Adler who would then become\nA chairman of the Judiciary Committee if Democrats win the house are vowing to a ... exact or van ... a ...\nInvestigation to remove calving off those from the Supreme Court by virtue of articles of impeachment and and there's nothing that will motivate of Republican voters more\nThan that kind of us what to undermine the Democratic process of confirmation and to try to stabilize the Supreme Court for partisan reasons\nWell going to be interesting to watch do you think politically John you watch a lot of campaigns is they're going to be as big as the American people are gonna be motivated in twenty nine days and are they going to remember this\nWell I Can't read the tea leaves\nBut what we just saw with the confirmation battle actually was a sample of our separation of powers in action where each branch exercise it's appropriate role and now in our democracy the people are going to decide and you know they're going to be irresponsible lawyers who are going to come\nGo on T. V. shows with more people who are claiming I should have been interviewed I could have told this town and I just hope that people can separate the wheat from the chaff\nHas a prosecutor looking at these three cases how would you handle them thirty six years later in each case no corroboration in each case\nUh well uh with I don't know anything beyond what's in the public record but without cooperation you might entertain a meeting for an hour or two and say thank you for coming by a there's nothing to talk about\nUm okay so when when professor board for example she can't remember a location\nYou cant remember an exact date or a place not he's struggling to know the year and the case of ms ... she's calling other fellow students from back in the day she's asking them if they remember because she's not sure she remembers\nA in the case of Julie sweat neck who who made the you know changed her story\nWell Brett Kavanaugh gave out red solo cups and he was near the punch bowl and I saw him in a whole maybe not lined up in a hall ... which is very different from the these worn out David that they had originally laid out a week before I mean you if you look at that but in the prosecutor's office what are they going to say\nWell are they going to say a these are all frivolous accusations but uh as far as we know regarding doctor for\nThat one nine or ten witnesses interviewed and people are going to say well there were so many more who didn't weren't interview it's not the number of interviews it's the what they have to say and if it's all cumulative you don't if you don't count the witnesses and but I think\nSome of those other people as I say now I'm going to want to have their twenty four hours in the sun or you know in the in the same and they're going to want to go to the national Enquirer or something like that but there are no criminal there no criminal cases are no civil cases a good man was confirmed is now a justice and we need to move on\nLet's talk about the news that we are pretty confident as coming out this week um let me just say this very up to ... if I can that if a top ranking FBI official war to confirm that\nThere was an orchestrated effort among the upper echelon within the the OJ and the FBI to\nGo after Donald Trump or retribution for the firing of James told me what would that mean Greg Jarrett\nIt would mean that this was all a hoax the Russia hopes and it wasn't Trump Russia collusion\nAnd that would mean Greg Garrett was right from the get go but yeah I\n... and and yes and the latest information only corroborate the thesis of the book\nThere there wasn't Trump Russia collusion but there was Hillary Clinton Russia collusion she had on her payroll British spy\nOr who is using Russian sources and now we've learned a through the interview behind closed doors of James Baker the top uh FBI lawyer\nThey documents were being passed him from Hillary Clinton lawyer and the DNC ... lawyer\nOr to you know this is astonishing information uh and in fact we've also learned that you know this was part of the vice a warrant to spy on the Trump campaign none of it\nWas corroborated and federal regulations are very clear you may not submit the Fisk\nInformation and evidence that is on corroborated in yet that is precisely what they did and so I agree with you when these documents are classified and the inspector general has it has had enough time to look at them and decide I think they will be explosive\nIs there any way that Rod Rosenstein who signed the fourth buys a warrant we know the basis of bulk of the information in the ... the application John was the\nUnverified are uncorroborated dot CA the political document that Hillary paid for I mean how is it possible that they passed for those that I mean that wasn't he has to be held accountable for that\nWell let's wait and see when the documents that declassified but the answer to your question does of course\nUh we talk about the president does not above the law and he's not but certainly knew there was the deputy attorney general but ah I see one thing a little bit differently and maybe we're going to segue into this and that is everything you're talking about should be thoroughly investigated\nBut I think it's separate from what the more people are doing and I think that the Mueller investigation can conclude by showing independently that the president was just not involved in any wrongdoing and it doesn't have to be one of the ... not necessarily linked\nWould they would he have an obligation see this is what frustrates me I think that the the mandate was so broad that we end up going into people's\nYou know main bank loan applications from years gone by to me is just ridiculous the considering where it was supposed to start and where it was supposed to go\nOr would it not lead to an important issue especially of Russian lives were paid for and disseminated to the American people to purposely lied to them before an election and worse than that used to\nUse them five five applications to spy on an opposition party candidate and then use later to destroy a presidential\nUh about president who was duly elected\nWell a hundred percent and if those things are verified the people involved should be held responsible criminally but I'm saying that the bowler investigation of itself\nCan conclude by showing the president didn't do anything wrong one of the dangers of a special counselor or a special\nLondon [noise] leaving it actually could outline that forty five and north freeway outside of

special counsel Robert Mueller and his team and Andrew Weissmann an Andrew Weissmann knew all about this a leaker themselves anyway here's Bob Goodlatte telling us two weeks ago what does it about\nA we have been very very concerned about the lack of production of some doctors we've gotten a lot of documents access to more than a million documents for the department of justice from but some key key documents including the so called McCabe memos which could very directly bear upon this question of\nA ... with Rod Rosenstein doing in that meeting\nA immediately prior to the appointment of Robert Mueller as special counsel and are these allegations that are in the New York times actually true\nAh I think that can be a lot of life can be shut on that if the documents we'd been requesting for quite some time are made public so as a result of that this week I if they're not produced by tomorrow or Tuesday and this week\nWe're going to issue a subpoena to the Justice Department that expands upon the subpoena we issued earlier this year and include McCain memos and some other documents that have been requested by us but that's far not produce including Peters trucks personnel file some of the struck page\nA tax ah the ah the the Bruce or three of one and some other things\nAll right so joining us now in Studio we welcome back\nThe man that's in the middle of all of this and I said do you know what the news is tomorrow you getting bits and pieces of information about what's happened\nThere ... there we have people that know that were there that understand that in fact I'm a lot of this was a plan and a scheme of not only a media strategy league strategy but uh to take out a duly elected president\nI'm hearing a lot of big hints coming Sean but similar to the situation where the DNC paid for a lot of lives about me I'm careful to not jump to any conclusions until the real facts are on the table so but I I agree and what I'm hearing is going to be really big\nYou know when all of this I mean to get for Pfizer warrants against you you would think that you must be a really bad guy and now that you've discovered how they obtain those ... obtain these warrants against you um you've never been indicted so I guess you're not a threat to the country\nUm I've since learned through previous interviews that when you go to Russia where your work brought you that you often would be debriefed by our intelligence community and you had a good relationship with them correct absolutely Sean yep yep and then by intelligence I mean CIA FBI gosh absolutely and other intel\nCommunity people for decades yes for decades and I assume they like you and trusted you\nAbsolutely you know and we would sometimes disagree on things in terms of our various assessments similar to any international relations or security discussions that I Would have back in the Pentagon et cetera but that's you know an honest debate\nRight but okay but they wanted it was never a time where you you met with anybody that wanted you to spy on your country that you love no but I again I'm happy\nTo share insights and ideas just like I Do you know used to at New York university when my students yeah that's what we're pretty open guy\nBut so anybody I guess that would regularly go to Russia because they are a hostile regime\nAt and they've been hostile to the United states um we do know that in fact that food does have a network of\nOf their own deep stayed operatives that are trying to create chaos in America by using social media and et cetera right that you don't doubt that\nWell in terms of creating chaos in America if you compare everything that the Russians did\nVersus what the what the DNC did with their lives and millions of dollars they spent on that you talk about election interference particularly their conspiracy with the deep state you know the OJ FBI CIA now that we're learning all these details much much worse than anything Russia dead at the DNC\nEver get away with never handing over their computers to the FBI [noise] um I don't think I'd get that consideration an option and no one's going to hire a room people what was it like when when did you first know that you were being spied on\nWell I started a I had some hints about it you know people I Know in Washington mentioned it in September of twenty sixteen right around the same time when I started getting phone calls from the New York times CNN Washington Post about these DNC funded lies\nAnd they mentioned to me that there were a Democrat hired operatives working in Washington who we're\nPaying for these ah these operations and you know soon thereafter at ... I found out about the you know the hacking of my emails and wiretapping of my uh and this is a first happened\nIn August so you found out pretty early\nYeah and actually I I first started getting the phone call so I didn't know about the intelligence operation I just got a call ...\nThat they had this buys a war against you in the media knew about it or you believe they knew about it\nWell the first news report ah I think came out with his a lady Louise mensch in October of twenty sixteen ... within a ... just a couple of days of when the uh first Pfizer weren't with I think\nFirst ran with the story in March of Seventy yes and that's what we said wait a minute there is a Pfizer Warren on the Trump campaign\nOr were you aware of our reporting at\nThe time ... it's funny Sean right a interesting story I haven't talked about it in the media before but in March twenty Seventeen that's what's been leaked in the Washington Post that I was having all these meetings with the FBI\nI remember you know in these long series of ten hours plus meetings one of the meetings I'm walking out I mentioned\nThat well I had a long interview in detail with Catherine heritage and it's going to be airing tonight on the on the evening shows on Fox and what they say they were quite a you know they they gave me a bit of luck let's just put it that way but they again because it's all about you know media perception what\nWere they asking you at the time what do they want to know their spying on you and then they're bringing un simultaneously you've never been charged with anything there's no indication you're ever going to be charged with anything at all you don't fear that that in any way you're going to be charged right\nAbsolutely well I Know I've never done anything wrong right and\nAgain the primary focus of those conversations was about the ... right at the same false allegations that the DNC paid for going back to ... you're right about that did they ask you specifics about that dossier absolutely yeah basically everything I've done and kind of all sort of\nRevolving around that also you know as you were alluding to I've been a source\nFor the intel community previously and you know I helped or the year prior there\nIs a an indictment of ... or ... you know if someone pleaded guilty in the southern district of New York and I was a witness on that case so you know we were talking a bit about that too\nAll right let's talk a little bit about what now now that your life had been up and that um you I I Know you're fighting to get your good name back\nI Know media organizations have pulled lies about you\nOr I Would say that the there was absolutely reckless disregard for the truth that a lot of these cases um what are your plans what are you going to do what are you going to do to the government that ends up you know using on verified information to literally take away all of your civil liberties has got to be some records for you\nWell I've definitely working on a few strategies Sean to me the biggest concern is just the damage that this has done to our country and the roads blocked that has created for the Trump Administration in the first couple of years in office so\nMy the biggest thing that goes back to the first thing you were talking about in your segment a with chairman Goodlatte is just getting the truth out there and so I'm doing everything possible to help facilitate that you should write a book\nWhat it's like to be spied on by your government you know something to that if I'm Serious that would be you know a at a movie certainly that could be put on the screen as as well but I mean what does it feel like ... I guess maybe there are some people because they took out the Warren on you\nDo you have you ... do you know what they did they ask you about everything that you were saying and doing it this time\nBasically yeah and I'm going back many years again at and we had talked\nAbout how many hours total do you think you've spoken to intel community FBI Muller all these people how many hours do you think you spent total over the last\nTwo years out of the last two decades two years last two years well I mean in terms of actual in person meetings you know forty eight hours or something like that but you know when you add in the hundreds and hundreds of hours I had to do in terms of documents production etcetera right now that's a whole different level\nWhen you went before a mall or what was that like\nYou know I don't I don't like to talk about that ... just because in general they have been a less leaky\nIn terms of getting the you know mentioning that fact but it was reported in December of twenty Seventeen December last year that I had a recently been in front of the grand jury and I won't I don't\nRemember that night but I Will I even I back at all absolutely not no you haven't you know and as the is it now they now stopped asking you questions one of the last time you got a call from anybody\n[noise] I haven't I haven't talked to anyone in twenty Eighteen oh at all the whole year and it's like a year's worth of freedom\n[noise]\nBreaking news twenty four seven from the gallery are made in America studios\nThis this youth Radio's seven forty Katie R.

J. last Thursday indicted a seven Russian hackers for hacking or any doping agencies and Westinghouse here in the United states as well as a bunch of places in Europe and I was wondering if you had any take on that because three of those guys were named ...\nOwners indictment so I'm Wondering how it is they could have been doing I don't\nThink there's any doubt there's no\nDoubt at all that the\n... and in the hospital regime of Russia be him being the hostile actor that he is that they are constantly trying to\nYou know create chaos in the United states and the constantly cite\nCyberwarfare now has been going on for many many years but I'm going to tell you something that very few people will tell you and that is at some point we've got to take responsibility for the fact that this is happening not only by the Russians by the Chinese and North Korea and the Iranians even some of our so called allies are hacking into stuff\nAnd how much intellectual property is stolen that's billions and billions of dollars from America's\nSame ... you know if you look And Julian Assange whose name is probably I guess the most known oh Julian Assange is wanted in his mid forties somewhere in there okay but he was sixteen years old and the guy hacked into NASA and the D O D that's how long this has been going on\nNow the the fact allegedly by the way\nThe fact that we have not created cyber defenses to prevent all hackers and we have and hire the best people to design the best systems to protect our intellectual property\nYou know at some point we can't blame others at some point we gotta look inward and say ah maybe we're the ones responsible that's what I'm thinking what do you think\n... I I think you're right about that one one question that I come up with with with this uh the OJ indictment is they weren't very specific these Russians were targeting things very very specifically I Want to know how come it is to follow her\nFind anything that specifically points to exactly what they were trying to do you know the the the OJ has very detailed information um I Hope somebody will get you the indictment if you if you have time to look at over it's pretty it's pretty\nIn depth it damning and you're right but you know understand another thing is that not one of these people the mother ever indicted from Russia especially the equivalent of their CIA agents are ever going to be brought to the United states and never pays the trial\nI I don't doubt this is happening as a matter of fact it was Devin Nunes is warned everybody what happened in twenty six team\nEvery other studies have shown that it has an impact the election in any way but that's not the point the fact that we continue to have this vulnerability\nIs at some point it becomes our problem in our fault the fact that Hillary you know we we don't have any doubt that foreign uh services hacked into her email system that was parked in a mom and pop shop bathroom closet nobody doubts any of that we'd better take it seriously", "year": "2018", "show_name": "The Sean Hannity Show", "city": "Houston", "day": "08"}
