Ramirez the New York times wouldn't even public publish it because they discovered nobody that corroborate her story number one\nNumber two or own words that she was ... they'd quickly had gaps in her memory and the fact that we now know that you know so many different things that we didn't know before and that Mrs Ramirez was actually out there soliciting information from her fellow your classmates the New York times reported that because she quote couldn't remember sitting\nIn the case of Julie sweat Nick we saw her backtrack dramatically from her original story and her claim that judge Kavanaugh was a serial\nDrug or and rapist of teenage girls would give me the evidence and cooperation to any of these women story that's what I Want from you Danielle and don't duck and don't dodging don't hem and haw that I'm asking a tough question give me any cooperation you have\nI don't hit the cooperation because I'm not do I and I'm not the one who was investigating that's right and we talked about this last week\nWait a minute but everybody's talking hunted\nWith a full and fair investigation getting married at twenty cooperating witnesses to the I think now and the FBI did\nNot use I mean why every main person that was mentioned in the case of professor Ford and the case of miss for me or as the New York times tried to corroborated they spent an entire week interviewed dozens of people\nAnd then she herself was calling around to other yell classmate saying I don't I don't remember do you remember I'm not sure if it was him that exposed himself\nAnd then we all watched Julie sweat Nick alter shift\nAnd backtrack from her original allegation which was gang raping and systematic drugging of women so could you have any crop rotation for any of these incidents at all\nI'm not getting any education that I don't expect that you would expect and I did\nI mean all you're following of the ... you can't find any cooperation either can you as a matter of fact we're getting just the opposite occur operation people are saying those they don't recall those stories at all that it or that happened that way at all\nSo the charges are college roommate and staying on at the last twenty four hours a keen about uh the judges drinking oughta honestly I I think this is horrendous for shy and the idea\nOf not answering my question I'm asking you if the people make serious claims allegations on a serious real topic because there are real evil horrible ... predators in this world\nAnd they mentioned that there are specific people have you interview them that they're going to tell you my story is true and it turns out to be the opposite don't you believe in the presumption of innocence Danielle McLaughlin yes or no\nOf course I Do short timeline get something\nOf course I Believe in the ... and the and the presumption of innocence but I also have to leave at the FBI should have been allowed to do a full and fair investigation and that is why you're going to see on the left a huge ... and I understand that this is energizing the G ... hey\nI'm not talking point what was on a second once you interview looking in the case of professor Ford\nBefore people she identified were at the party and none of the four have any recollection of the abandoned the one eye witness says it didn't happen\nWhat else are they supposed to do because we don't know where it happened we don't know when it happened we don't know the location she doesn't know how she got there got home from their what else is the FBI to do that already given sworn statements under the penalty of a felony\nAnd all they did is reiterate those statements that the FBI what else could they possibly do Danielle in that case\nAnd being on the opposite side of it ... at the FBI just\nTo see what else can they pass certainly do knowing the facts as we know that we don't know where we don't know when I don't know huh\nOK okay ... thanks the fact that she doesn't run into wearing out where and when exactly it's not necessarily\nDon't you are now now you're you're trying to what you're trying to change it look follow the bouncing ball of about ...\nIf there is for people that were eyewitnesses but we don't know where we don't know when we don't know how she got she got home\nWe don't even know the house but you mentioned for people with their ... for people
