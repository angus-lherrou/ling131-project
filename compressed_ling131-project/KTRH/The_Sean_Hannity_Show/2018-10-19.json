rock as a rock star it can be the twenty twenty nominate\nA yeah try and get through Ted Cruz first good luck with that but we're following all these races let me tell you where I think we are right now I think the Republicans\nI think between the caravan that we now have coming towards us four thousand people strong that want to get to the southern border or the United states from Central America I Know that the secretary of homeland security secretary Nielsen\nI I had an opportunity to call her office earlier today because I actually do real reporting on this show and get an update apparently as of now there's full cooperation with the Mexican government that that's not gonna happen\nBut four thousand people still four thousand people and what did Democrats what are they were just that they don't want a solution\nFor the border problem we have with the opioids crossover human trafficking is occurring you know we now are using these drug cartels\nYou can't say they're stupid they're evil but they're not stupid\nThey've been using and this is I Can't even believe this is true you know these drones that they fly with cameras above him so they'll fly from Mexico into the United states along our southern border they fly drones with cameras on them and what they do is they map out where the border patrol\nWhere agents aren't so then they give like the perfect entry way where it's most likely to succeed in bringing in their heroin and their fat and all and drugs that are really being targeted towards your kids your town your cities\nThat's how evil these drug cartels are and how desperate they are\nTo be successful or the president well he offered now we spent three and a half billion dollars so far that's the only amount of money that had been allocated towards the wall these pens every penny\nBut we need twenty five billion dollars total to get the whole job done that in part is what this election is about it's also about a party that has given up any sense of honor\nAnd any sense of constitutional or authority let the rule of law that is based on our constitution that would mean due process that would mean equal or access on there are laws equal application of our laws\nAnd we know that they gave that up any sense of due process with judge Kavanaugh they wouldn't even give him the honor of the presumption of innocence even after an FBI investigation the eighth one that he's had in his late well now they want a nine to one\nBut the way I see it Eighteen days out is that we've got the Senate is looking better Rick Scott has a slight lead now in Florida but it's not big enough\nDo you want if you want rex where Scott has killed himself and done such a great job for the state of Florida look at how this man is all hands on deck doesn't sleep every hurricane\nHe's prepared to help out those that are victims\nAmazing I'm maybe the most charisma in the world will be the first to tell you that but you don't want them a little sick of a lot of politicians with a lot of hot air and be yes that talk a good game and just a lion to us which is part of the whole democratic strategy\nThat's why project very tossed catching reticent on tape and his campaign saying oh yeah well he's just saying he'll support cow but he's not going to support cap and he's not going to\nBe jolly [laughter] so\nI just can't believe that he

story that just broken Claire McCaskill is going to be problematic go see it on Fox News dot com and the headline is her husband is accused of abuse by his ex wife\nAnyway was reportedly accused of domestic violence and Missouri candidates a Claire McCaskill's has been accused of domestic violence and as one company wants to victim blamed a woman who sued for sexual misconduct\nOh I Wonder if

Trump ... it's over but I still will be in Houston tomorrow Rick Perry's going to be with us\nOr we're doing a town hall and Ted Cruz's are going to be with us details on Hannity dot com that is what eleven o'clock tomorrow morning and used and that will be in Beaumont, Texas at three thirty tomorrow\nLooking forward to that and uh I'll be interviewing Ted Cruz and we'll be hearing a lot of this on a Monday obviously CNN as they made their decision or they're supporting which is pretty fascinating anyway we just Eighteen days away from these all important midterm elections\nAnd what do we see we see that Brett is and has now been exposed this week in Tennessee is somebody that is purposely lying to the people of Tennessee the same with Claire McCaskill we see that Christian cinema is falling apart\nI mean literally ... you know she she says oh it's fine to be a fine to join you know radicals um and the Taliban actually said oh and by the way this is the meth capital of the world Arizona or by the way you're crazy and she has anti war rallies while her opponent Republican Martha ... Sally\nIs that we're fighting for a country that's not playing well very very well right now in the state of Arizona and you see that Heidi Heitkamp totally out of touch with the people of North Dakota still seems a lot of pick up in the making there for the Senate for the Republicans\nTight race though in Florida vote for governor in for Rick Scott is always does an amazing job for the people of Florida are anyway joining us to analyze where we are Eighteen days out is our good friends welcome back to the program John McLaughlin Doug shown pollsters both of them\nJohn Eighteen days out what do you see happening\nOf well the the house is still in play and the Republicans are a without a doubt are fighting back to have gotten more aggressive but still it needs to do a lot more and and what's really amazing to me is the focus of\nYou know you're exposing the Democrats and what's your agenda is all the time but the focus of the Republicans really needs to be to expose Nancy Pelosi when she intends to do I think you played a clip earlier about Schumer in the Senate\nAnd he wasn't very specific about whether they're going up in the polls because the Republicans post Kavanaugh uh have have really done a lot better in a in a in the polls that have come up I mean when you're talking about uh Arizona ... now hit by a little in Tennessee Republicans leading now decisively a ... so the\n... the Democrat opportunities to pick on the Senate look like they're going off the table and on the other hand it looks like the Republicans are ahead in Missouri they're they're they're running close races and in Montana Indiana\nA West Virginia I mean even in New Jersey uh it's it's turning into a competitor\nWas really looking like New Jersey might be a dog fight for Bob Menendez and the people of New Jersey of had it with him and you know now that his association with the chili and I've seen guy uh that has now become an absolute verbal war between\n... and his Republican opponent of opponent and now showing up at the polls\nAre dug show where do you stand Eighteen days out\nWell hey where America's fans in St John and you are right on fortunately I might add is that the Senate has moved pretty decisively\nRepublican I don't think the New Jersey will go all the way because it is a operationally democratic state but\nThe other states you cite showing I think are moving in what I think are the wrong direction I still have a chance to pull out in Nevada and Arizona but both of those at the terrier rated above it from my perspective as a last\nWeek I think Arizona in particular but Dean Heller was in a very tight race for reelection the Republican\nWas ... it was a to point raised a week ago Donald Trump goes in and now he's up by seven and I saw the crowds when I was out there was massive but the crowd outside was even bigger than the one inside\nWell look okay yeah I was gonna say I I've seen the same numbers John please go ahead\nAnd absolutely I mean the president is motivating his base and and the Republicans need to embrace up because a nationally when he won he had sixty three million voters\nAnd when the the uh uh uh when the midterms occur we only get Ninety million people usually out might be a little more this time but it won't be as big as the hundred and thirty nine million who showed up in a twenty sixteen\nSo if you can get to sixty three million Trump voters motivated that they're coming out again which the Kavanaugh hearings did and it appears to have backfired\nParticularly on Senator Schumer and the and the Democrats in the Senate or if you can motivate those Republicans to come out those Trump voters those independents and Democrats that supported them they have a very good shot at getting Senate seats and it's probably the only shot they have of winning the house that van and going after Nancy Pelosi the idea of stopping\nNancy Pelosi the most popular\nLet me tell you what I'm saying I Am radio and TV if you vote I don't care what congressional district here and there were four hundred and thirty five congressional districts in this country in any of those districts\nIf
