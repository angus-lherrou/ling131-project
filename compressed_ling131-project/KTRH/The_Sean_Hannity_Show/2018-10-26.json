with his arrest by the way it means one lunatic one maniac is off the streets thank God\nAnd um we uh we have to just credit law enforcement for the good work that they do and it's amazing the DNA

electric\nSome type of electrical connection device director re described it here's a little bit of what he had to say\n\nTo that effort in getting those devices to our lab from around the country if

known as energetic material which is essentially potential explosives in material they give off sheet and energy through a reaction to heat shock were friction\nThough we're still analyzing the devices in our laboratory these are not hoax devices [noise] I Want to focus for a moment on the amazing work of our folks at the FBI law\nBased on their initial analysis they uncovered relating fingerprint from one of the envelope containing ... that had been sent to congresswoman Maxine Waters\nWe have confirmed this fingerprint is at ... or say\nThere is also a possible DNA connection between samples collected from pieces of two different high eighties mailed in separate envelopes and a sample previously collected from ... in connection with an earlier arrest down in Florida [noise]\nThis is phenomenal work with the greatest pressure\nUnder an incredibly tight timeframe\nWe see unbelievable work like this on TV and Ali would but just see it up close in reality is something to behold and we are so proud of our team at the lab for their work and keeping people safe helping us find the individual responsible\nLate last night we also turns to our partners in the Florida department of law enforcement for confirmation of this DNA connection and we want to thank them in particular for they're very quick work [noise]\nI also want to thank the men and women of the FBI's counterterrorism division who remain on high alert\nEvery to try to keep the American people safe from harm\nAnd who moved quickly and efficiently into action [noise] every single time

commissioner O'Neill from\nIraq to re are confirming that they believe they have the main suspect they're worried that there might still be some that have been recently mailed there on the lookout for that but it looks like they have DNA evidence now that ties to this one guy\nAnd uh they have analyzed they confirmed it and you know these guys are amazing what they do every day\nYou know the sad thing about all of this you know I Want to remind you\nBecause you know I've lived through some of this myself at all explained that the minute but\nYou know Marilyn Bernie Sanders it one of his supporters shot Steve ... shut up all these Republicans at a ball field a nearly killed Steve ... says the fact is he's a walking miracle and I know because I knew what was what he was really going through at the time was far worse than was reported\nAnd people wanted to blame Bernie Sanders says you can't blame Bernie Sanders for what one does listen\nNow I Am I'm not going to do what the left does here Bernie Sanders is not responsible for what one of his stupid supporters have to say but this most Bernie Sanders supporters are not violent and not out there trying to kill Republicans\nAnd Bernie said he was sick and by the entire you know anti GOP massacre here All right and I believe him and I said that\nAnd just like I said in the years gone by remember when the one guy broke into the White House\nWhen Obama was president and is it do they came up a number of times I have a number of tape saying that we've got to protect our politicians I'm no fan of Obama's policies but\nProtecting our elected president is is job one for all of us as Americans he is our elected leader whether you like it or not and here's what I said Mr Speaker you're gonna have strong feelings about this we've now learned\nThat this guy that broke into the White House\nNot only did he get in the door but he knocked down the secret service agent went into the three different rooms of the White House and pass the stairs that would have gone right up to the the residents of of the Obamas\nThat is extraordinarily chilling to me huh yeah I mean what ... ... you're talking about protecting the president of the United states of America and it's just there's no room for error\nYou've got to protect our president that that represents the free world so they've got a very difficult job they've got to almost be perfect and anytime any incident happens ah lately is becoming pretty high profile and if we're not protecting our president we're not protecting our leaders we've got a big problem the rest of the world is watching this\nSo I said that many many times you know and I say this only because\nUm there's this idiot on fake news CNN is named my ... what's his name John ... somebody who's taken cheap shots of me a number of times over the years\nAnd I want to play for you what he said because he basically links the bombs sent to De Niro to me let's just played that part ... ... ... ... basically blaming me listen to this\nLike Shon had and he said had a direct language man we don't we don't know who it is we don't know the motive but what was fascinating is you see a direct patterns between the president's attacks on Twitter and and the stage and being echoed an amplified by Fox News and other folks in the conservative judge here which is not like the others right why Robert De Niro\nWell one of things I found was that October Fifteen Sean Hannity was doing a whole segment blessings in Europe for things he said on the Alec Baldwin show of all things which you said that Trump allies will regret it because they made a deal with the devil so that all of a sudden it becomes ... or the Robert De Niro calling the president devil and us devil worshippers it affect you know\nI'm used to playing the victim card but at the top of mind ten days ago and it's interesting to see what is that when we find out who this is um because some of these figures are are more prominent on the on the campaign has been ...\nMe because the Niro got one of these packages well let's listen to De Niro and the things that I've been critical of De Niro about let's listen to what maybe I was talking about\nI mean he's so blatantly stupid he's a punk his dog he's a pig he's a con bowl\nOh there's a mutt who doesn't know what he's talking about doesn't do his homework doesn't care thinks he's gaming society doesn't pay his taxes he's an idiot Colin Powell said it best he's a national disaster he's an embarrassment to this country\nIt makes me so angry that this

seeded the Senate than in other words they're putting all their money into house races just to get the one chamber absolutely so let's say that that that what you're saying is true if the Democrats flows Z become speaker and the Republicans hold on to the Senate and they pick up seats in the Senate so that would sort of be a split decision by it I guess any measure right\nOr just split decision except that the Democrats will have a focused they will control the house think of the committees that are going to change\n[laughter] think of think of the intelligence committee and set of newness running it you'll have Adam Schiff gets what's gonna happen with the with the ah with all these investigations et cetera\nGuess what's going to happen with the Judiciary Committee and their their there'll be relentless investigations of President Trump that he won't get anything done in the last two years and you know that talk about they'll go they'll go check his taxes illegal this stuff and it'll drive economy down one of the things that that you know us\nPollsters we get calls before the elections from hedge fund guys in for major Wall Street guys what are you seeing in the in the election well you want to know why the market's been going down the last month because they're seen that the Democrats could take the house and they know what that means to the economy the economy will stall out\nWhat do you think Doug shown to you in the same area you said is getting very tight also\nI think John's analysis is exactly right I think the Democrats I actually wouldn't might even be a little bit more cautious I see it between twenty five and thirty see I think that um\nAnd if they get twenty three seats that means they win the house that that is correct time could jak thing very young when they are saying the Democrats could win by little as two seats\nI Am saying that I said on your air or the other night it would be two to four I'm In the same range I think John's analysis is very very rare and\nI think he is right to say that the Democrats are mobilized and\nFocus on the um on the house the exclusion of the Senate but the amount of money that's being spent on really the thirty races I think Sean butter on your website cannot be underestimated and\nYou know mid term elections tend to be referenda on the president and the incumbent party and there's one with a dirty secret it's not so much Donald Trump is at risk if the Republicans in the house and Senate will have much lower ratings than the president and it is that is the soft underbelly of the Republican Party\nBut if I had one of the weaknesses as it relates to also to the Republican House is there's so many retirements what other forty five separate retirements incumbents and name recognition for a lot of people in a lot of these races is negligible zero it takes years to build up name recognition in a district John\nAbsolutely and by the way that that top thirty most important races that you put on your website\nThose are critical to set the Republicans really need to win and and Doug is it is I mean granted the Democrats should be listening to them but fortunately for us they don't listen to him too much for one Democrat that does listen to them is former Mayor Bloomberg in New York City\nWas a big superPAC and it's putting the resources into electing Democrats in the house now that he's gone back to being a registered Democrat and the Democrats really\nDug understands that they they\nThey're very smart they really understand how to how to win races and how to take power and the Republicans need to wake up I mean those of us who are older I remembered delivering a survey that Haley Barbour helped pay for Nineteen Ninety\nFour and September that had we had the generic Republicans up seven and that was to the house leadership and there was a soon to be Speaker Gingrich with Bob Michael I was presenting the numbers to him saying you're going to be the next speaker and\nWe just need to not compromise on Clinton care well Haley Barbour\nFar ten million dollars to help when more seats him win that election the Republicans are raising record some say the orange she has out raised a has out raise the uh uh uh Democrats their National Committee two to one of the ... that money needs to find his way into the\nInto these top thirty races that you've outlined where the Democrats are and spending has virtually two to one and all those races this week\nAnd you've got to be able to put money into those races where there's digital LEDs a TV ads even nationally and saying stop pillows see\nWe've got to have an equal voice with the Democrats and uh uh ... they've really they really are focused in on trying to take over the house and it's and it's their their shot at power\nWell fish out of power but remember you know those that have been saying the investigations into the deep state and I don't believe that's true because we have Senate committees that are just as capable of doing that as well and similarly if the Republicans were able to build their majority in the Senate any legislation that Nancy Pelosi and company want to pass\nThat is going to be against what the Republicans want in the Senate is never going to get through it'll die there and we'll have divided government but I think you're most right and the fact that it's going to be\nBasically two more years like we've had and that is endless you know ridiculous absurd obscene investigations show trials by Adam Schiff Maxine Waters you know Gerald Gerald Nadler and company and\nIn other words the progress will will slow down dramatically now there is also the hope that Republicans in the lame duck session could actually get in there and pass the funding for the border wall and maybe repeal and replace Obamacare in the meantime\nLuck I think Sean that if as John and I think folks that are suggesting that more likely than not the Democrats win the house what we are looking at with almost great certainty is ... come critic luck for two years\nI make a slightly different on a book on the ... first before I'm a Democrat I Know John is certainly knew Shaun I just hope we stopped demonizing of doing what Maxine Waters and say\nTrump's responsible for this to rent a set of uh uh sending that ten or twelve arms around or vice versa blame the Democrats\nCan we focus on our national or our borders and our future\nIf we had that I Know you've got to admit that we had the wall we didn't have to worry about the the ... ...\n... building the wall and having a pathway to ...\nOkay so that I Am sort of old trucker offered that deal to the Democrats that even had a dream it\nIn a heartbeat why didn't I was ... because I was

that never detonated you know I call them I guess a spacious devices 'cause we don't really know if they were actually bombs but it got\nMe going to make sure that that's been confirmed 'cause they when they said they had powder I'm assuming there was some type of gun powder\nOr some type of explosive powder and then had shrapnel in it like a lot of charter a glass and you know we've got to get to know a little bit more about this guy short of the van that had a CNN sucks picture on it in a picture of Donald Trump it doesn't mean a thing and\nYou know by the way I remember when I when Bernie Sanders when one of his supporters shot up that baseball field I said at the time boy if this I'm not blaming Bernie nobody should blame Bernie Sanders he's not responsible for what one does and I said but boy if it was some supporter of Trump or any Republican oh they'd blame everybody\nWe know what I mean I'm not going to do what the left does here Bernie Sanders is not responsible for what one of his stupid supporters have to say but this most Bernie Sanders supporters are not violent and not out there trying to kill Republicans and\nBernie said he was sick and by the entire you know anti GOP massacre here All right and I believe him\nWell it's a different tact than you hearing from the media today right\nRight and you know what what concerns me and thank you for correcting me about the update on the um that bomb threats what concerned about is\nAs he mentioned the van with all this stickers okay perhaps it is somebody from the far right but I'm noticing what I'm hearing is the the stick to the jury as far as how they were placed how they with no\nYou know issue with the ... south but the other thing I thought about was William Clyde Arlen who\nThreaten people with rice
