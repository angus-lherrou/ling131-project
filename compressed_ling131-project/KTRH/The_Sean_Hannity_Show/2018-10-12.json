I think without a doubt by the way one of the things you got a notice this week you noticed the market went down its up a little today but went down in the past couple of days and it was triggered by interest rates stuffed but in the meantime I had some analysts telling me\nAre afraid of the Democrats taking the house of representatives and\nThey would want to raise taxes again they would stop Trump from doing all the good things that he's done a regulation to visit with the economy and they would want to raise taxes again\nAnd that would cost jobs that was slowed down the American economy and you've got an economy now that's really growing at about four percent higher than any of the expectations\nAnd what they're really afraid of is that Nancy Pelosi could become speaker again I agree with you showing that the Republicans are going to pick up Senate seats in the Senate seats looking really good because of what happened with the backlash\nOf about the whole cabinet hearing it how unfair it was and you can see we had a poll this was this week where I'm McCaskill was losing to Hawley the Republicans for the U.S Senate\nAnd the way that I also Joe Donnelly is now down right and and Heidi Heitkamp is finished she's down by double digits\nRight we have polls there because of the the energy sector is so important to the state that you're seeing that you're seeing these these polls um you know people want shops\nAnd what's scary is in the last three weeks where you're going to decide is\nDo you want the economy to keep growing or do you want do you want it to slow down your policy to raise taxes take what you've got and take away the job to take away the pay raises and the vast majority of Americans\nDon't want to go back to that I mean we had holes in September with were Nancy Pelosi has fifty five unfavorable among all voters she has she has the fifty three percent\nUnfavorable among independent women that the independent women are going to decide this election and and they don't want to go back to the way things work before Donald Trump took over and started to drain the swamp and get things moving again for the country to these house races you're talking about\nMost of the ones in play a Republicans those Republican incumbents or the or the Republican or a candidates in the in those open seats they're the ones who are going to vote to keep lowering taxes to keep the economy growing and basically to stop what you saw the last couple of days where\nYou know the smart money on Wall street saying hold it if she's if she's going to be speaker\nAnd they're going to oppose the president's ah ah agenda they started selling off\nI mean it'd be a disaster for the country\nDoes shown 'em I honestly don't have a feel yet for the house but I think the Senate you have to admit is looking very good for Republican pickups\nI think when you have thirty three races now that will that will actually tipped the balance one way or the other in the house of representatives a little too close for comfort because as somebody that knows Nancy Pelosi I think that would be a worst case scenario and we'd have endless investigations and impeachment and higher taxes and\nAnd you know it then they want to get rid of ice they won't fund the border wall et cetera it's gonna be the same nonsense all over again with them\nWell I my sense is that the house is still a in democratic hands where the election today so it's getting closer or the real clear average has gone from a thirty one or thirty two seats for the Democrats to twenty six twenty seven so it's moved the same direction as the Senate races but not quite\nAs far and I would have to concede much as I Would like not to that the Senate races have moved decisively andme interaction\nKavanaugh had a lot to do with it\nYeah I Do I think they are really two realities there's the reality of the world that we live in on the east coast and west coast and the reality of the rest of the country who thought that a lot of what happened to him\nYeah I Would kind of like an island in the middle of that east coast I'm not the rest of the east coast I don't represent the value of the New York\nI have noticed yeah which is a pretty hard core left wing said even in a Governor Cuomo doesn't even want me in the state did you know that I didn't know but if I got I got taken it no he actually said those conservative\nThat hip hop and it's not me at the end of it stems cells are the streaming service right to life\nMay try that they are because they are they the conservatives knows that it's not a\nSimple no one has tons within a rifle no need\nUh um right to life I'm pro Second Amendment uh and uh although I Know I'm libertarian on people's personal lives I think we ought to lead people to hell alone\nUm so but there's no place for me in the state of New York you said it himself when that happened I had a bunch of governors Florida Texas North Carolina South Carolina all calling and inviting me to move to the states I Want to take them up on Mr shown that would be a governor and everything you love and vote for one's me out of town\nSo am I speaking for myself and wanted you to run as an independent for president I think had you run an Alabama one of your old stomping grounds Doug Jones would not be a senator and I would be happy to be part of the bipartisan committee to keep Hannon in New York or to promote Hannity\nWhen I have an office you have it like\nTo run for I think my friend John and I can\nI ... well you disabuse our friend Doug the very notion that I can win any office I don't even think I could win dog catcher\nNo I I I think look you're still the kid for Franklin square you're still you're still in hand with your working class roots and Andrew Cuomo is trying to make you move out to join ...
