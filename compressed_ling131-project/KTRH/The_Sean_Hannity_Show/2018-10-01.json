weather together here's Katie London [noise]\nLet accident that cleared up from the freeway amounted\nAgainst judge Brett Kavanaugh and that would be by the way I read the FBI is already looking into allegation number two which was\nThe New Yorker piece this was by Mr Ramirez and remember even the New York times couldn't go with that story they had reported that they interviewed several dozen people in an attempt to corroborate her story they couldn't find one person with first hand knowledge and then they reported that Mrs Ramirez herself was contacting\nFormer your classmates asking if they were called the incident told them pull some of them that she could not be certain Mr cabin all was the one who exposed himself\nAnd that's what they're saying and remember she admitted she quickly became a ... you had gaps in her memory foggy slurring words\nSo that's what the Democrats are said this is a credible allegation well if it was so incredible why didn't they ask judge Kavanaugh when he sat in front of the last week 'cause they they they all had the opportunity to delve into anything they wanted to delve into and they chose not to\nThen we've got the the third incident which is the ... case where a woman claims\nThat routinely almost on a weekend basis and she had been the Kennedys parties herself personally that there was Brecht cabin on and a bunch of ... kids that were drug ...\nGirls and then lining up in the hall waiting their turn to rape innocent girls\nAnd a whole series of allegations he looked at as as Byron York said the gold polls have moved very very far away very very quickly and all the people that but not just going to be a week limited scope no big deal just an FBI investigate you want to clear your name right you'd want to clear your name right judge\nIt's not about clearing his name it's about giving them more time so they can come up with more allegations and it doesn't matter at the end of the day Democrats do not even want a vote on judge Kavanaugh\nAnd they want to continue the ... the slander the lies the mismanagement character assassination frankly the political blood joining of judge Kavanaugh and his family now as evidenced by now remember\nDianne Feinstein had this first six long weeks she had this back in July\nThere was a California state or California congressman that had it early July and then they went to Dianne Feinstein Dianne Feinstein on two separate occasions was meeting with judge Kavanaugh then of course we had the original hearings\nAnd not at one point that Dianne Feinstein ever mentioned professor Ford\nBut while she was meeting with him privately she was simultaneously recommending lawyers to professor Ford and one that was eventually chosen was Deborah cats\nAnd she is a lawyer that represents professor Ford but which is fine but she has a history of oh challenging Paula Jones and supporting Al Franken so in other words she's\nRadical left political the attorney is\nAnd so anyway they were emails sent out we just found out late last week of a friend of this attorney for professor for this Deborah cats woman and she was in the hearing she was sitting to the right a professor Ford or to the left on your screen if you were watching the hearings\nAnyway it goes on to say that friends emails were sent by a friend of Deborah cats the lawyer representing professor Ford recommended by Dianne Feinstein\nAnd they were soliciting women to accused judge Brett Kavanaugh of impropriety and this is what they were sending out last week where we just need an FBI Barry expeditious very quick very limited in scope\nThey were they have been and continue to be on a fishing expedition\nNow the emails were obtained by the Washington Free beacon seeking corroboration from classmates of cabin all about your book and trees and gang rape and one email sent\nA late last week delivered to roughly fifty alumni of stone rich school of the Sacred Heart\nAn all girls school near Georgetown Prep with the subject line corroboration needed Deborah cats need to find people who are familiar with what the slang terms were used by Brett Kavanaugh on his yearbook page meant\nAnd the devil's triangle and the F F F F F\nA warnings in there if you can speak to any of these are willing to sign an affidavit pleased contact us that's a fishing expedition and that is ... this is what the Democrats wanted the delay for\nNow if it was truly limited in scope and we know that in the case or professor poured that there were four people she mentioned we're at this party\nSome don't remember ever being even her best friend don't remember ever being at a party where Brett Kavanaugh was at the end of the you know that when the perjury I mean ... under the penalty of a felony here so they all signed these affidavits they all agreed that the that they didn't have any recollection\nAnd the the most difficult part of it is is professor Ford identified an eye witness to the event\nThat eye witness has said under penalty of a felony that it never happened what professor Ford is claiming and this is professor Ford who put\nMark judge in the room at the time of the alleged incident so I'm not sure what the FBI really can do in this case beyond see whether any of these people are going to admit that they committed perjury and gave false statements ... there's nothing else really left for them to do\nPlease use your voice you will not get a second chance this letter goes on to say I mean well this point you're you're pretty much just soliciting\nYou know randomly anybody to come for please please come forward and then the hope is that it'll be delayed again and again and again and you know on top of that than we've got you know what was supposed to be limited in scope what we're supposed to be done expeditiously in a week\nNow is turning into because they can't get anything else at least not that we know of yeah who knows what Dianne Feinstein knows\nThen the only thing they've got is well did he commit perjury about the amount of alcohol that he drank you know could did he really black how would anybody know if he blacked out\nThat's the only he would be able to tell you if he blacked out now he admitted to drinking to liking beer liking beer a lot still liking beer drinking too much beer you know being intoxicated he admitted to all of that\nWhen he was in high school and college which not all that uncommon let's be honest about it and so they're trying to say well he didn't he do we know we had to a blackout as an I worked as a bartender for a number of years I Know a lot about alcohol I watched it up close and personal\nYou know everybody's got a number for some people the number two and after two they lose it for some people I there were people that every single night I work could sit there from six PM till four thirty when I close the doors and other throw him out and they'd be walking straight\nHaving been drinking all night I mean the tolerance level from individual individual is just it's an enormous\nYou know you see some people that go beyond their numbers they become aggressive or flirtation I saw it all I learned a life lesson and it wasn't good if you go beyond whatever your individual number is it's never going to be good for you or or anybody else for that matter\nUm anyway so we got that and so it's not about limited in scope there's a lot of news or no time many of which I don't know where the clock is I'm Mark Penn and wrote an interesting piece which I I found today and he said that he was a poster was the Clintons pollster\nAnd he noted today that in the immediate aftermath of last Thursday's testimony by professor Ford and Brett Kavanaugh slim majority of those surveyed sided with her but\nThey found he found is the support for professor Ford collapsed when voters were told that none of the three ... a witness to she cited to corroborate her allegation have any idea\nAs to what she's talking about and that fact was barely mentioned during Thursday's questioning and it was only mentioned if you remember at the end of the questioning of one of the things that were saying that we see a new poll out by Remington research group because the election is thirty six days away\nI Want you to think about thirty six days from now when you turn on your TV on election night and do you want to hear the words Nancy Pelosi has just been elected speaker of the house and Chuck Schumer is the new majority leader\nOf the United States Senate because that's what the Democrats want now if this doesn't\nIf this does not show you this is not a party that wants to make America better that has a plan to help the working men and women forgotten men and women of America\nAs a matter of fact with every bit of six tests the president has it it it diminishes any chance they have it getting back their power\nAnd after two years of trying to destroy the president you know they want to Christian do their way back into power just forgetting the eight years of Obama which would disastrous\nAnyway so we've got this election you're going to tune in at night and

right let's go to our busy bones Eric is in Florida Eric Hi how are you and welcome to the Sean Hannity show from the swamp the sewer that is Washington DC\nHi Shaun thanks for having me on and I'm a I'm a legit talk around there earlier um I grew up watching ... you cannot cross by reminding me and my dad who were just he just died a few weeks ago and so I think you'd be happy recalling him getting on to your show so\nI appreciate it you know cross fire was a defining show in the history of political debate in the country and and Pat Buchanan and breathing in all those original guys there there was an amazing show and it's time\nYeah so I can empathize with I'm Brett Kavanaugh was one of those middle school nerds that you know it was probably watching those types of shows and the doing of things that people want him are now but I'm\nIn any event I think there's a silver lining potentially till the FBI investigation number one for so where conservatives we have a moral compass if we if we do detect that there's something wrong that he should be thrown overboard that's number one is that without being said but I don't that's not going to be found that being said\nIt's an opportunity for the Republicans to investigate further in turn the lands on the Democrats and some of their dirty tricks and use the power not than anybody should be abusing that power but the FBI should use that power to investigate everything that's going on here\nAnd potentially witnesses being coaxed ally people being put forward assigned false affidavits there's obviously a lot of that funny business going on I don't think Democrats ever thought that the Republicans were going to allow such an investigation\nWell I don't think it look if we're going to be fair if they really cared about the issue then they'd be asking ah what about Keith Ellison and why would they supportive of Bill Clinton where's Juanita broader it's FBI investigation they don't want\nAny of these things because it's not the issue with politics the greatest evidence that his politics\nAnyway appreciate the call of the latest on Brett Kavanaugh Carrie Severino is going to join us next we're going to

I'm sure they were it was either find people because they already had been interviewed\nBy the Senate Judiciary committee look the the the goalpost are moving faster than the speed of light here it's it's very difficult to that to believe that any of these people\nUm it it can take themselves seriously they said it's going to be four days a week and now they're going to have an artificial that time you know they were saying the FBI the gold standard there impartial\nThere you know she said that every Democrat that's now they're going up the Trump is evil puppet master controlling the FBI they're actually going to be as horrible part is an organization\nIt out it it it is and it would be laughable if it wasn't a man's life long reputation here on the line\nTo your job kind that are doing two weeks ago as far as everybody else knew Brett Kavanaugh had an impeccable reputation that is now that's gone forever you know ... you know re Donovan famously one said after being investigated for a year and a half where do I go to get my good name back mhm well in this case\nI don't think ... ever gets back in many many ways\nI mean Clarence Thomas will ever be remembered because of the last minute accusations of Anita Hill\nYeah it it it's very discouraging although I have to say I I Do get some on there is someone who clerk for Justice Thomas and knows the why he he you know there are certain ... ... people who are going to just simply use that as their excuse is counted the name of discounts them because they disagree with in any way\nAnd he is someone who does ... incredible amount of perspective on the bench\nKavanaugh is a kind of person where even when he was on the DC circuit as the lower court judge the Supreme Court said it saw him as someone to really take seriously you know more than a dozen times they walk to fourteen different times they've found now they've vindicated his opinion they had a huge amount of respect for him I don't think that's going to change I think\nUm they are not going to be watching this with the same knee jerk a part is in response as I Hope that that that we're seeing some some of these people are ... but but it\nYou know the parents who brought her reputation now\nIf you read James Comey's New York times piece that he came out with the ... to me it's absolutely sunny\nAnd the things that he's saying because while the guys back in the middle of it when we handled the Hillary Clinton email investigation while he was running an exoneration himself prior to the real investigation which didn't happen until three days before he publicly exonerated her um\nBut then he goes on to trash the president at length and then he talks about FBI agents are experts which they are interviewing people and quickly dispatching leads to their colleagues around the world to follow up with additional interviews\nAnd they will confront people with testimony and other towns and you know yes the alleged incident occurred thirty six years ago but at the age is no time has little to do with memory um which I found a little strange um and then you know for example everybody remembers if it rained on their wedding day\nUh I don't think that's a political in that particular sense maybe to somebody who is traumatized by could see that but for somebody that's not traumatized maybe not\nUm once they start interviewing every witness knows the consequences he says is one thing to have your lawyer submitted statement on your behalf it's very different thing to sit across from two FBI special agents and answer their relentless questions\nOf course the bureau won't have subpoena power only the ability to knock on doors and ask questions most people will speak to them but there is what he says refusal to do so\nIs its own kind of statement now I Want to just address that because my FBI friends my friends in the in the bureau special agents have all said to me never ever talk to the FBI unless you have a lawyer\nEver and I'm like why I'm somebody who loves the FBI I don't love the upper brass on their Khomeini and the cave and struck and page but\nThe FBI is is ... the FBI people I Know the fault of the earth people and I sort of course I'd want to help him he goes no\nAnd then they say look what happened to General Flynn General Flynn is accused of lying to the FBI and the up here I didn't think he was willing to them\nAnd you just it's dumb to ever talk to any law enforcement without a lawyer that's what all my law enforcement people friends say\nBecause it's a crime if you lie to the FBI let's say you said something in the Senate Judiciary investigation and it doesn't exactly match up you could be charged with a crime of lying to the FBI it's ridiculous\nAnd you know the irony that says if you look it hit companies coming MO right now is just to try to destroy Trump with everything he can and it's just another another section in that play book but the irony is the exact same federal law provision\nThat says it's a crime to to lie the FBI is the one that says it's a crime to lie to the Senate as their ... with their ... it's not just you know a similar penalty it's exactly the same statutory violation so that's just not they've been kind of pretending there's that that I guess playing a little bit on people's images maybe from the movies\nOf what the FBI guys to say that this is somehow it's going to be a separate different thing what they're really doing here is there going down the same list to people the Senate Judiciary committee has already talks to\nThey're getting the same statements in some cases they might get exactly the same thing because the FBI can't as ... as\nWell make that can't force them to talk to them especially if all you know as\nI don't remember that I wasn't there they they could be dealing with taking the same\nExact statement from the same lawyers for the same the same individuals that that's ... that that is all we can no ... just because of the nature of this old investigation so the FBI isn't going to find anything new to hear that there there's my protection\nUnder them around the IRA and that they don't have any other thing\nThey've already moved on I guess the ... and and that's the one that came out in the New Yorker piece and you know ... that's the one we're even the New York times that said they attempted\nTo interview over the course of a week several dozen people they couldn't find a link a one to corroborate a story and then saying the mist Ramirez\nContacted former yo classmates asking them if they were called the incident and told some of them that she could not be certain Mr cabinet was the one who exposed themselves which at that point tells me you know what are they investigating here if she's asking other ... she telling other people she doesn't know what do they investigating\nThe more shocking thing is even right and it's you know right before\nThis whole um ... most recent face exploded I think it was the morning on of the vote she actually her lawyer telling people she's not even still share it with him she said why puppet he was in the room\n[laughter] I'm positive he adjusted his hands but everything that so but I but I Can't say for certain get hit it and so it's even after talking to her lawyers for six days to kind of work up\nA her memory that she didn't have when she initially talked to the to the New York New York or because they also said she couldn't say for sure he was there when they initially talked to her I I I'm impressed there even count as a credible allegations but you know what go for the FBI could talk to her\nUm they'll they'll get their statement and I think if you look at the people if they're\nOnly going holy wins and they don't make any recommendations they'll just going to give very hand over the information\nThat's it the the three ... and and maybe we'll get those thrilled to we've been waiting for thrilled
