otherwise if you don't vote that's pretty much a vote for Nancy Pelosi and if you have a Senate race going on in your state that's a vote for Chuck Schumer\nThe second potential outcome is a split decision split decision would be Republicans hang on to the Senate gain a couple of seats and Nancy Pelosi them become speaker and Maxine Waters is a chairwoman\nAdam Schiff is a chairwoman and let's say Gerald ... chairman analyze your coming the chairman and it's endless investigations into one of the most unbelievable things that we're watching unfold here is what we got this desperate\nShouldn't factor of the Democrats I mean even when I think anyone I warn you of what they do every two and four years racist or sexist besides you know just seeing a phobic Islamic phobic homophobic you know dirty air dirty water kill children throw granny over the cliff\nJust one you think it can't get worse it gets worse\nAnd the echo chamber if you've ever doubted ever doubted who the media in this country of pulling for just just watch any so called cable news channel besides Fox\nFor thirty seconds because every second every minute of every day hate Trump destroy Trump help the Democrats and if it means falsely accusing the president of being responsible\nFor the synagogue shooting over the weekend and not even tell the people there viewers that well the shooter this mad man power hated Trump because of Trump being so allied and good partners with our closest ally Israel\nAnd the same people you know saying Trump cause this Trump's responsible for this you know it's a it's it's a sense of madness but it also does show\nA desperation that has now kicked in for the Democratic party they are desperate\nYou know one thing I I think I'm going to talk about pose a little bit in the course of the program today but I'm also on the other hand seems like I'm Talking to both sides of my face I'm really not\nI'm I'm gonna tell you to just ignore the polls at this point doesn't matter you still have a job to do and if you want to ... to keep the progress that we've had you want to prevent hearing the night of one week from tonight\nAnd one day after one week from tomorrow when we talk about the results if you don't want to hear the words speaker elect Pelosi Senate majority elects sure then you're going to have to do something about it\nThe worst case scenario is they can win at all and the only way that's going to happen is if you stay home\nAnd the reason I'll tell you not to pay attention to the polls is because they get it wrong so often\nJust two years ago the exit polls showed that Trump lost Florida he won it last North Carolina he won it that he had lost Ohio he won Ohio that he lost Pennsylvania He won Pennsylvania that he lost Michigan and Wisconsin anyone both of them\nAnd the media nobody they weren't candy because they read these results as I was on the air at five Fifteen I had it before everybody else\nI remember my first break at at the about twenty after the hour I called then candidate Donald Trump and I said somebody's going to come in in about a minute with bad news and tell you that you lost everything don't believe it\nI said I don't believe these polls I said there's no way these polls are accurate\nAnd he goes why do you believe that and then I told them the story about two thousand and four\nWhere the media again the polls came back and George Bush and Dick Cheney and lost Florida Ohio Pennsylvania and it was over\nAnd Dick Cheney called the radio program this radio program at you know on election day two thousand and four or five thirty five and reminded people they still had time to vote because he read the same information that I just read that John Kerry was going to be the next president\nYou know if you go back in you know other polls would they'd been wrong twenty fourteen you know let's go back with the election one week away it's coming down to the wire conventional wisdom is Republicans will pick up a few seats in the house or in the Senate but lose the house by a painfully slim margin\nOne of the reasons is look if you look at real clear politics that's based on polling polling is not totally inaccurate information there's some things you can glean from polling that are\nAnecdotal maybe the way to put it helpful in other ways right now real clear politics has the Democrats are two hundred and five seats locked solid\nOr leaning Democrat and it has leaning Republican lock solid Republican two hundred that's a five seed difference but because Republicans have\nThe majority of ah right now that means that they have more seats they have to defend is like thirty seats that they called toss ups that can swing one way or the other we've identified these we put them up on Hannity dot com you can check it out for yourself\nAnd the only thing that can make a difference is if you want the progress of the last two years to continue you get to decide how you're going to feel a week from tonight I mean when the if you watch called back the media in twenty sixteen this five Fifteen they were guinea\nWell it's pretty clear Hillary I think there's going to bring on our presidents Frank Luntz who's reporting from Times Square at six Fifteen and I'm watching him it's over Trump lost it ain't happening turned out not to be true it turned out the polls were wrong and I'm not criticizing Frank he was reading the polling data I had read the same data\nSo if you don't have the sense of urgency I don't know what I can say or do to give it to you but the media is all in on helping the Democrats get back the house and the Senate and they're doing everything within their power to make that happen\nBecause they've handed Trump since the day walk down the escalator with millennia\nI think it's worth noting now that conventional wisdom does not exactly have a stellar\nTrack record this is where I urge you to be cautious about the polls and don't let the polls influence your motivation here\nBut it's not only were they wrong and twenty sixteen they also wrong in two thousand and four they were way off in the last midterm election remember Republicans were even saying oh because Ted Cruz's fellow buster oh we're going to get cleaned out in the Senate that didn't happen\nOne year before the twenty fourteen midterms the media insisted the GOP hopes to recapture the Senate were dead on arrival because in October Ted Cruz had filibustered Obamacare and shut the government down for sixteen days good for him makes me like Ted Cruz more\nExperts such a short us a hundred percent certainty in twenty four team Republicans are going to pay huge price when the twenty fourteen midterms rolled around Thirteen months later\nThe geo ... not only won back the Senate they did it with a nine the Senate landslide\nHow remembers the night went on in twenty sixteen media was kinda Getty but then that getting this began to give away to a little bit of a little bit of nervousness I think we got it still but ah yeah to get a little tighter than we thought isn't it\nAnd then I turned into what all out melt down depression collectively by the media and they couldn't believe it because you we the people shocked the world all that but in all four it's happened in fourteen and it happened in sixteen no reason it can happen in a tea you\nShouldn't do it for no other reason because you want to keep America on the great growth growth trajectory we're on and maybe for another reason to watch these idiots in the mainstream media these sanctimonious\nA self righteous they're not news people advocates that they are the extension of the Democratic party they're going to lose it\nIf the house remains in Republican hands and Republicans picked up a number of Senate seats they will lose it just like they did in twenty six he this is a this is all white latch CNN was reporting that night\nAnyway the so called experts saw the Republican landslide coming that none of them thought in twenty fourteen no very few of us saw that we could wait I'll give you\nLet's go to twenty fourteen final Wall Street journal NBC News survey before balloting and twenty fourteen had forty six percent of likely voters favor Congress led by Republicans forty five prefer democratic control kind of similar where they are now the G O P claimed they similar one point advanced\nIn the lead in ten states where Senate races where the most competitive with a balance of power in the chamber would be decided those results suggest a narrower advantage for Republicans in in the latest mid term and you know still\nThey claimed oh Republicans pick up nine seats that's a hell of a field goal they were saying they might they might well twenty ten was kind of a two touchdown embarrassing laws but Democrats this is more Republicans went on a field goal\nWe've got to get used to live by north found actually now turning\nThe Senate's blocking three in the

that too is that a tight race\nLet's talk about the FBI investigator buying what thousand dollar Hamilton tickets for Andrew Gillum and you're saying that there was a quid pro quo involved\nWell this guy was posing as a developer or he went and he paid for Andrew at least a thousand dollars for that ticket that an illegal gift ended up itself Andrew never ordered it\nThis developed her one at a zoning change in Tallahassee and sure enough later he got that there were text messages release were that an FBI agent is a tax thing that the main lobby its body of Android\nSaying really appreciated mayor coming through ah why\nWasn't he got arrested isn't that buying influencing corruption\nWell there is an ongoing investigation I mean that's the thing I think that um uh we don't know what's going to happen because this has been going on for quite some time they've been gathering a lot of evidence\nAndrew also the same lobbyists that arrange that New York John get paid for a for a night stay in a luxury Costa Rica villa for Andrew Gillum\nAndrew didn't pay a dime of that and then Andrew turned around and gave that lobby is a two million dollar contract to do a restaurant in the city of Tallahassee now we know in addition to that thousand dollar ticket\nThat the agent gave to go on the FBI agent also under rode a forty three hundred dollar dinner for Andrews campaign nine twenty sixteen I was never reported which it needs to be and so the question is\nAnd you have reported that after the fact that just basically cover in your tracks CYA so interesting that report\nIt at all the only reason we know about it\nIs because there's an ethics commission investigation of Gillum and and and a response to those subpoenas uh one of the lobbyist attorneys release that for the public so forty three hundred dollars and then at least a thousand dollars for Hamilton Andrew says he's not under investigation\nBut Sean you tell me what other reads and what an undercover agent have to do those things if he wasn't investigating mayor Andrew Gillum\nWell let me ask you to two days ago\nIt was the political reported that apparently his running mate\nYou know claimed that quote Jews nailed him to the cross and read the text message to you know apparently it's now out there many you know people in in South Florida apparently are pretty angry at this remark and er which seems pretty anti Semitic to me as he's standing by this\nBook I think it's reprehensible Andrew Gillum pick this guy knowing that he had done that but here's the thing about Andrew Gillum\nHe is aligned himself with some of the most anti Israel and anti Semitic groups in Florida including this radical group called the dream defenders\nWhich is a leader and the boycott divest and sanctioned movement targeting Israel they actually say Israel's a genocidal apartheid state and so that's one of the Andrew strongest supporters Andrew to this day\nOpposes having our embassy in Jerusalem he opposes recognizing Jerusalem as Israel's capital and when a Israel\nFought back against the Moffett fats and may ah Gillum blamed Israel he said oh they just use those attacks as a pre tax to be able to do a disproportionate response to\nWhat what is in a relief endurance organization that he won't disavow\nThey're one of the most radical organizations in Florida ah they they believe that the police and prisons have no place in justice\nAnd that the police needs to be defined did they say they say to us is the biggest bully in the history of the world that our military needs to be caught\nThey if they favor or replacing what they consider disaster capitalism is their word with socialists principles that are so radical make Nicolas Maduro flush so he signed their candidate alleged gang that he would support a this radical manifesto so that's just who he is he believes and what they're doing\nIs endorse them personally and uh it would\nLose a tape of him I guess that was discovered in June saying that he's pleased I'm proud to sneak food to dream defender activists during a thirty day sleep in protest that the Florida State Capitol\nReferring to the twenty Thirteen month long anti gun protest or after the Trayvon Martin George Zimmerman case and I hope you keep at it and he supported them but you're saying that there are radical group\nWithout question I mean they they are anti law enforcement they're anti free enterprise they're anti military um they're anti Israel uh I don't know I mean like that may be a group you would want to be aligned with if you are running for the mayor of the Gaza Strip but not for governor of Florida\nWow well let's go over a little bit of his his background and the proposals that he's making but he's I think it's fairly extreme a number one he was endorsed by Bernie Sanders that speaks volumes to me\nThere's a lot of outside money uh reports that he's getting money from the left wing billionaires like George Soros the George Soros really spend one point two million in this race in Florida to help him\nOh yeah I'm probably much more than that at this point now\nHe says that he supports Medicare for all I Am a champion of treating health care and as a right not a privilege so he wants what nationalized healthcare\n... is the bill he supports what abolish Medicare and Medicare Advantage for seniors enforce them on a single payer\nGovernment plan it would eliminate everybody's employer based coverage and force them on a government single plan so it's really a fan the arrangements have millions and millions of Floridian that he thinks it's appropriate for government to take away health benefits that people have burned and the force them to be\nOn the single payer plan I think that'd be a disaster\nHe wants to raise the corporate tax rate forty percent of forty percent increase ... what's that going to what's the impact that's going to have on Florida businesses and Florida workers if the businesses pack up and leave\nWe will lose jobs we will lose business says and we're also I mean you know shock because everyone who works and high tax states they're always thinking about relocating to Florida and we have a historic opportunity\nTo really capitalize on that when I'm governor buddy Andrew has his way he'll stop the flow of investment coming in to Florida because people are going to invest if you have the highest tax rate in the south east and actually he would raise it to be higher than New York\nYeah and he also was the first democratic candidate Nash nationwide I read to call for the abolish meant a vice is that true\nHe supports abolishing ice and impeaching President Trump\nAnd he wants to eliminate Florida's Stand your ground law\nYes he wants to impose on law abiding Floridians a duty to retreat so somebody for criminal is attacking you you have to run and try to hide rather than fight back\nYou also support legalizing drugs in Florida like marijuana and others yes he does\nWell I mean it you're just looks like he is Bernie Sanders on steroids down there I mean I've got to believe with this controversial background like it looks like a almost a phenomenon that the media's just pushing for him and pushing for him\nAnd you know his record I only spent about a half hour and I was able to dig it up it wasn't that hard to find and it seems like most of the media is ignoring who he really is\nOh without question I mean the day he won the primary particularly the national media you know they've tried to elevate him and try to make him into this great candidate a they do not like the scrutinize his record uh the fact that those documents God relief effort he lied in the debate last Sunday\nOr the media is kind of had to cover that buy at the end of the day\nHe has been given very kid glove treatment so really falls to me and other folks to go out and make the case and let people know and the good news is just weren't Floridians figure that out or they definitely don't want him as their governor and so we're going to keep making the case for the next week\nI'm worried about our friends not only the recovery uh uh thoughts and prayers go to all our friends in the panhandle\nUm uh but the pan handle so many people whose lives have been up ended and disrupted and some people losing pretty much everything they own and they now moved out the panhandle happens to be one of the most conservative areas of Florida are you concerned that people\nFrom the panhandle of going to be able to get their hands on a ballad maps and tea or otherwise would maybe be part of early voting is Florida doing anything to assist in and help those people that have been displaced would want a vote in this election but this loners they're home\nThey're doing a lot ah everything from mobile voting sites to\nAccommodations for absentee ballots you know the bad news as you said it was a terrific stormed the good news is I think all but about Fifteen thousand homes are going to have power by the weekend a which we weren't sure could happen that quickly um and I know the rest of the folks there is a combination is being made so\nAre they are resilient people in the Panama City area um and I know a lot of them do want to vote and so they'll have the opportunity to do it\nYeah um I Know the devastation once again to the people there how long do you look at rebuilding not part of Florida and some people I looked like a tornado would wiped it out\nYeah lugging I mean it it's going to take time obviously with me coming in as governor I'm going to have to deal with it and take off were
