{"month": "10", "state": "TX", "station": "KTRH", "content": "Those if you listen to show I Hope you tune in every week at this time because we talk about stuff that if you're over fifty retired or retiring soon is important and uh so we we talk about a state planning which we are going to do here in just a moment\nBut we also talked about investments we talk about Social Security we talk about income taxes are diversification for one case we talk about the whole the whole gamut of stuff right and I hope you benefit from it\n[noise] now this is the part of shall we talk about how to pass onto your greedy and washed undeserving airs the fruits of your labor and normally we do that but this week we're going to talk about a very deserving and very washed and clean\nOr Arab yours and that would be your spouse [laughter] there you go and so this week I Want to talk with you about a special kind\nOf trust it's called a Q tip trust like the thing sticking your ear and a Q tip stands for qualified terminal interest property but do we call it a Q tip for short and it's basically a trust that is designed to benefit your spouse\nSo if you're married you have a spouse or we'll have a spouse soon then you want to listen up okay but before we do that ... can you play it\nI Know I\n\nWould say\nMy log in may and medium\n\n[noise]\nOf course that is Tony Bennett with rags to riches and we use that because the estate taxes\nAnd probate and all that kind of stuff it's actually designed to do the exact opposite design to take it from riches to rags and we do not want that to happen to you so every week at this time we have our state tip of the week now this week we're going to talk about trust for your spouse now the field of our show this week\nUm has been our vision one hundred as a firm for money matters\nAnd as I mentioned a little bit ago ... we will we not work with a thousand families and the responsibility that comes with that is one that we did not take lightly it's not just taking care of them that is important in guiding them and helping them to have financial security but it's also their families\nAnd one of the things that you know I've often said as you don't want your financial advisory firm to die before you do so we created in our firm will be called vision one hundred billion one hundred means that a hundred years from now we want money matters to be as strong or stronger than it is today\nNot only fascinating Mr Spock but also very logical and so that's kind of ties in with this segment of the show which is on his state planning and passing\nOn to the next generations and we have a a core value that we live by which is core value number eight which is that everyone deserves love\nAnd what I mean by that is that no matter who you come into contact with including that person to cut you off on the freeway and then flipped you off as they were going by they deserve love you give love always okay\nIt's not you don't get love because you think you're going to get it back you give love because it's the right thing to do you give love unconditionally with no expectations coming back at you\nIf you do that I think you'll live a very happy life\nBecause then your happiness is not dependent on other people coming back\nTo you and saying I Love you back or doing stuff for you or whatever it doesn't matter you don't need that if you're if you're the giver of love then somehow and you know in in different religions are different names for it but it comes back to you the more love you put out into the universe to more love will come back to you\nAnd you don't have to force it you don't have to expect it it will come to our core value number eight is everyone deserves love everyone that comes into contact with us as a from as a person and our family everywhere we want to make sure that we give them all the love that we had to get and if we do that they'll be better for it and in in some magical way so we'll wait\nAnd so estate planning which is the topic of this segment is that so let's talk about someone that I Hope you love a lot which is your spouse okay\nSo the Q tip trust that is a kind of trust that upon your death you leave the money for your spouse in it\nLast now people tend to freak out about the word trust they don't like that word but you know what\nTrust are are are not black boxes that you put money in cannot come out no in fact it's the opposite ... trust is there for your spouse to be able to have access to the ... for whatever they need it for pretty much I mean there are some limitations but not many and but what it does do is to protect them\nFrom if they get divorced if they remarried and get divorced which maybe you don't care much about at this point but could happen or if they get into a lawsuit or if they have a a you know if they if they go bankrupt than all the money that's in the Q tip into trust for them is is protected from all that\nAnd then you may have a spouse that isn't so good with managing money and you want to have a trustee that helps them with that so that again is the value of the cutest trust\nOkay so think about your spouse protecting the money that you want to have them have for the rest of their lives in the event that you died first and if you want to put it in trust a Q tip will do that for you get something for you to think about so this show we've talked a lot about all of our core values I Hope that uh you got some ah some of it if you didn't hear the entire show\nOur website is money matters dot net money matters dot net and you can podcast didn't listen to the whole thing and uh you know I feel sort of like maybe I surmise today somewhat but uh I Believe in these things and I think if you live your life that way you have success you'll find happiness I think they're just core values that apply in all walks of life\n\nWell Dorothy it is do wonderful to be true because\nI Want to do some business with you right
