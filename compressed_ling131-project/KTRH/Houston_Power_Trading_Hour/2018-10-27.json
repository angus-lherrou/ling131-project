{"month": "10", "state": "TX", "station": "KTRH", "content": "And a ... a recently named the more you're faithful host one of the top one hundred independent financial advisors now for the seven year in a row\nAnd without our clients I Would be no aware and so I put that one on them I gave it to my clients well this is the part of the show where we talk about how to pass onto your greedy and washed undeserving airs the fruits of your labor now this week we're actually going to talk about paying for college\nAnd the gift tax laws so if you were not aware a gift taxes come do if you give anybody more than Fifteen thousand dollars in one year\nOkay and so that's the gift tax and college in many cases is more than fifty thousand dollars a year I Know I have one in college right now and so you could end up having to do a gift tax if you don't do it properly so we're going to talk about that now but\nFirst jak and you play it [noise] I Know I\n\nYou\nDog and may be and\n\nI Am\n[noise]\nAnd of course that is Tony Bennett with rags to riches and you know the estate taxes and probate and all that kind of stuff it's actually designed to do the exact opposite is designed to take you from riches to rags\nAnd we do not want that to happen to use every week at this time we have our state tip of the week so this week we're going to talk about a college education paying for that okay so as I mentioned the gift tax exemption\nA is a Fifteen thousand dollars this year so let me give you some history on that one okay so that when when the IRS\n[noise] [laughter] ah almost cut you off guard on that one when the IRS came up with the notion of estate taxes this is a tax upon your death then it goes to whoever um\nAnd they wanted attacks that so they created the estate tax but the IRS is a lot of things but it's not stupid and they figured out that if you have a tax that happens upon death\nThan what people are going to do is if they know they're going to die they're going to get it all away first and then when they died as no tax so we can't have that that would be downright on American not to have some taxes paid so they came up with the gift tax which means that if you try to give it all the way we're going to tax it anyway so you can't get away with that\nBut they also realized that if you tax every single gift you know if I take you out if I pay for dinner with with friends or something that's a gift\nAnd so do I have to file a tax return for that so we get kind of onerous and they'd probably be thrown out of office for it so they made a gift tax exemption and to give tax exemption is Fifteen thousand dollars\nPer person that you can give to\nAnd as a married couple you can get thirty thousand dollars to as many people as us so the gift tax exempt amount that Fifteen thousand as you can get that as many people as you wish um and and that's how that works so college is part of that\nSo one of the things that you want to do so there are additional exemptions too that gift tax\nAnd then by the way if you exceed that fifty thousand a gift tax is the same as the estate tax and it can get all the way up to almost fifty percent okay so you give a big gift and you may oh half of that in taxes think about that one [noise] so\nHow do you not to pay gift taxes on college uh on on a college education costs the answer is you don't give the money to the child or to the student\nAnd then had them pay it you pay the institution directly so if you buy all the books you pay for the tuition and all that kind of stuff if you do all of that directly\nAnd you don't have it goes through the child then that is an exemption to the gift tax so therefore it doesn't count so my advice to you is don't give the child the money now\nGive you that I'll give you that advice because when I was in college I'm In my fraternity there was this guy called scotch\nAnd his parents were giving him the money to ostensibly pay for the tuition guess what Scott was doing it wasn't paying the tuition [laughter] he was keeping the money and he used to come down every day and like he had this Chinese ...\nYou know this this that and ... and he'd come down in that and he looked like getting swept all night he'd wake up in time to watch the gong show remember bury the was that guys they bury something who did the gong show\nHe would wake up in time to watch the dog show on television and then you know he'd have lunch and he lays around all day spending his tuition money\nSo if you needed another reason not to your child the tuition money it's that [laughter] anyway\nAs I mentioned we are from that uh we uh we special we specialize in retirement planning that's what we do so we we work primarily with people who are over fifty who are retired or

I mean all these nonprofits come together to create\nYou know you call it a kind of a college campus yeah there for transforming alive it is it's an amazing partnership between three large nonprofits and the idea is to provide a continuum of care for people that are home live\nTo be able to have self sustainability and an apartment complex and in Butner is here to provide all of the resources and social services that the family need in order to really ...\nOur campus is located near the corner of highway two eighty eighth out and read a road in Houston, Texas just south of energy stadium were just on the south\nA big tent are so you know you talked about the combination of these ministries nonprofits now you're you are able to offer and really used kind of a college campus we're a family could come and get a kind of like a total make over\n... I mean is that is that a good way to look at is a great way to say that's a great way to represent because family sometimes need a makeover\nAnd so what happens is often low income people are very very limited to those resources into the availability of programs and services and so if you pass by here you would never know that this is actually a homeless shelter this beautiful campus looks like somewhere you would send your children off to college and be\nProud of it and to and so we want people to know that they are valued and that they deserve quality care quality programming\nRegardless of how much money they have in their pockets or their circumstances at this time\nBreak down what each of the ministries is doing so we've got new hope housing that's pretty pretty self explanatory so the the housing is being managed by new hope is that is that accurate\nYeah that that accurate so people that are completely homeless they may be living in their car or living with relatives they would start on this campus at\nThe star of hope that is a fool homeless shelter but they have all inclusive services so they have child care for the families and GED classes and all of the things that people need\nTo be able to just get a stable a little bit once those families are stable then they can move over across the way to new hope housing which is an apartment complex with one hundred and eighty seven units where they have low income apartments available for those families that now may have work or have some income coming in\nWe will be providing the services such as childcare parenting classes a we have a resource center will be doing case management\nTeam program all of those things that those families in that one hundred and eighty seven unit apartment complex need so that at some point they don't even need our services are prayer is that they outgrow our services and that they are so self sufficient that they are able to move on and do live in the\nRye example of

wants to get trained for a vocation sushi sushi can provide for a family\nMight be coming out of an abusive situation needs help needs needs an environment so is this an example of somebody who could be helped by this\nProgress has said this is probably the best example of someone like that there's often so many people who are in you know what you were called negative situations and they may not be because they always made the wrong choices sometimes things in life just happen\nAnd people can come here and they can know that they are going to be able to go to school and get their GED finished their education\nGet counseling sometimes people have come with a lot of trauma and things that have happened to them that they just don't know how to overcome and move forward button or also provides a program called family pathways where we have twenty families that we provide the full educational support\nAnd we pay most of their housing voucher so that all those families have to do is focused

M. F.\nAnd so they just put it met with itching and called its mission kind and basically that's where you're receiving fishing messages over your over your mobile phone or your telephone as a text message\nNow isn't a I'm asking an obvious question why are we getting all these things if we're supposed to be protected from the status\nQuo what's happening is it's becoming easier and easier to write automated software that can slam out text messages or to just random phone numbers and so the the bad actors are building the software systems that just send out a broadcast large numbers of um\nMalicious text messages trying to get people to click on the links are in their information\nAnd what's so typical topic I mean would it be a free this free that is at a discount what kind of an offer they coming at us with\nWell what's what's interesting is it you do see some offers but but most of the time you're seeing set for financial institutions where they're trying to say hey where are you know where your your banking and you should be alerted to you know someone just tried to withdraw two thousand dollars you need to click here and enter your information so we can\nPrevent it ah prevent that from occurring\nSide so it's the same deal as the fishing we would get to an email\nIt in the same deal but because it's coming on your phone and that's a lot more of a personal device you how you feel a lot closer to it so your thought is if I'm getting this tax it must be real nobody's gonna randomly send me a text message\nYeah so what do we do when we start seeing this a suspicious stop what are the uh what are you recommending ad Web route secure anywhere as far as our response\nSo the number one thing to do is never respond to your bank or something like that if they send you a text message always always always\nIf it's a credit card call the phone number on the back of your credit card and say you got this message if it's your bank\nGo to the local branch call the local branch tell them that you got this message and they will tell you based on your account information if there was a problem or not I really do that if you want to initiate the communication you don't want to let someone else initiate that communication to you\nOkay is it good to block the number so if you're getting something from a number I I've heard\nI've heard two lines of thought on that on that one is the you know the minute you do anything to let them know that they got your attention then they're going to come back after you uh maybe with a different number so I mean to block or not to block that is a question\nThat is in this case I Would do is if it's a one off and you're not getting more than one or maybe two I I wouldn't block it for the reading your guy said but if you're getting me over and over and over in our new sense go ahead and block it because there aren't you sent\nThis crazy stuff it's getting worse every week isn't it although it's it's kind of like a it reminds me of a you know caddy shack where he's chasing the\nThe Gulf or you don't like whack a mole you you know you you get at one place and it pops up and another is is is this just what we're going to be dealing with or is this the new reality of the Web is is is this the way it's going to be from now on\nI truly do believe it is it you know as soon as we figure out a really good way to prevent these type of\nYou know scams someone will come up with something new and I I'm pretty sure if we look back in history people used to use the mail than they used telephones now they're using you know they would eat out now to using the math it's just it's I hate to admit it's human nature and and and the fraudsters are always going to find new mechanisms to try to trick people will be vigilant\nYeah amen I you guys do a great job I you know we have Web route secure anywhere on every one of our computers for consumer team I give our listeners it may not be aware of where brood and everything you do and give them up to me about a thirty forty five seconds or ...
