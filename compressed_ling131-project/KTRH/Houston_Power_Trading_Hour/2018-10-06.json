[noise] and we are wallowing in champagne sonics rang and rang during the private lending man\nWhat's up with a notch or a man he just keeps saying and you can't get them to stop any way we are back this is money matters with Ken rape but of course I Am your host Kendall rights\n[noise]\nThank you Jack I've been a certified financial planner professional for the last twenty marvelous wonderful and very exciting years\nAnd uh you know are for money matters is that we are a retirement planning specialist and so we worked with people that are over the age of fifty primarily and who are retired or retiring soon and we are so so very thankful we not work with over eight thousand four hundred families in forty three states\nAnd I recently barons named more your paypal host one of the top one hundred independent financial advisors a and actually for the sixth year in a row\n[noise] a flyby thank you but you know what without our clients so we would be absolutely nowhere so all the things go to them\nNow one of the topics that we do talk about with our clients are very frequently is estate planning which we call how to pass onto your greedy and washed undeserving airs the fruits of your labor\nAnd the reason why you do this is because money isn't everything but it sure keeps the kids in touch does it not\nBaton Rouge sports happy\n[laughter] and you weren't happy squirts okay let me tell you something unhappy\nSquare it's not good don't want that you weren't happy squirts anyway so this is the time we normally we talk about that but this week we're going to deviate from our normal appointed task and we're gonna talk instead about you're giving\nThe opposite of greedy I think a very clean not and washed\nAnd I'm very deserving spouse okay and so we're gonna talk about how to uh protect your spouse in the event of your dad how to create a trust for your spouse and it's called a Q tip trust just like the thing you stick in your ear and a Q tip stands for qualified tour mental interest property and so we're gonna go over that but jak can play it\nI Know I\n\nWould always say you\nKnow my ... may be in\nThe\nAnd\nOf course that is Tony Bennett with rags to riches and you know the estate taxes and probate and all that kind of stuff it's actually designed to do the exact opposite is designed to take you from riches to rags and we do not want that to happen to you\nSo every week at this time we have our state tip of the week so but this week as I said we're deviating we are going to talk about your love it and most valued spouse okay so we're gonna talk about a Q tip trust so\nWhat is a huge trust will basically\nYour if you live in a community property state or if you have divided up your state for a state tax purposes and all that you're half of the estate is what would normally go into the Q tip trust or some portion there up okay now the ... trust is designed\nTo benefit your spouse so therefore the rules of distrust are set up for their benefit\nSo what does that mean it means that they can your spouse can get to the money that first of all your spouse can be the trustee which means you're your spouse decides where the money's invested your spouse decides on distributions from the trust so there there's very little lack of control that has now happened for for your spouse\nThat's number one there is a little bit of control and that is because the trust has some rules and the rules are that the money can be distributed for what's called hams H. E. M. S. health education maintenance and support\nSo what the heck does that mean I mean how do you find those and that's the point okay health education maintenance as well so anything that your spouse needs for their health for their education their maintenance\nAnd their support they can take money out of the trust for that for their benefit and they're the decider as a trustee if it fits that definition\nSo essentially what it means is that the trust has to keep them in the lifestyle that they become accustomed to okay so that if they are accustomed to a a Toyota lifestyle\nThey can't suddenly have a Ferrari lifestyle [laughter] okay [laughter] so they have to have to live within what they were living before but you know most spouses I think would be okay with that so what are other advantages well suppose your spouse is not good with money\nYou can name a different trustee to help with that also if you had the Brady Bunch family you know if if you have different children\nAnd you want your spouse to be taken care of while they're alive but upon their debt you want it to go back to your kids you can do that with a with a Q tip trust\nSo there are lots of advantages to the Q tip trust and it can protect your spouse from lawsuits and if they get remarried than the new husband or wife that that is in the picture and have no access to this money so\nThere's all kinds of benefits that distress can provide okay so it's one for your spouse and it's called a Q tip trusts qualified tour mental interest property but good tips easier to say\nAny way hum if you'd like to talk to one of our financial advisors about your estate planning about how to pass onto the aforementioned greedy and washed undeserving airs a than what you can do is you can go to our website is money matters dot net money matters dot net\nAnd you can click on meat with an advisor\nAnd what we'll do is scheduled time to visit\nNow when we visit this is for those of you are over fifty who are retired are retiring soon okay so that's you when we visit we want to talk about your entire financial life not just your estate planning so we want to help you with Social Security decisions we want to help you with that retirement planning decisions\nOr income tax decisions you know all those kinds of things that impact someone who's retired are retiring soon we want to help you to make those decisions\nAnd if we can help you that's fantastic will do it at no charge obligation\nAnd if we can I help you that's fine too okay so either way we will part French\n[noise]\nWell Dorothy is not too wonderful to be true because it is true\nSo do that okay now if you don't want to go directly to an advisor than what I Would recommend is that you go to one of our seminars okay and we have seminars near you if you can hear my voice there was a seminar near you pretty much\nAnd uh you can find those again on our website money matters dot net at the semi we're going to talk about the several things were going to talk about you know a Social Security decisions were going to talk about how to protect yourself and the next market crash which we think will happen in two thousand and twenty\nA we'll talk about ah do you have enough money to retire on all those kinds of things we will talk about at the center or some money matters dot net for all of the above well you know what Jack\nI cannot believe that the show's over already well ladies and gentlemen I Hope you've enjoyed it as much as I have enjoyed doing it for you will see you next week same time same channel by by everybody [noise]\n[noise] [noise] [noise] [noise]\nInformation presented should not be regarded as\nA complete analysis on the subject was not an end to not be construed as an offer to buy or sell any of the security has mentioned none of these shows contention viewed as personalized investment by a professional\nAdvisor Cindy consulted been more implementing any of the strategies presented different type of an investment in malls varying degrees of written and therefore given no insurance at any specific investment strategy will be suitable profitable for a client portfolio tax\nDay planning information offered on this program is general in nature always insolvent attorney or tax rational regarding years that they make legal more taxes ... founded ... should not be construed as\nAn endorsement of ... or ...
