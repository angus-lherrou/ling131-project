this\nSo stop altering your life as if you're going to be in the crosshairs of one of these were wacko left wing women\nIt's a very small percentage of true left these I'm not talking about how many people vote Democrat 'cause most blacks\nOver Ninety percent of blacks vote Democrat but in their personal lives they act much more like conservatives\nTheir views on social issues are much more like conservatives and they'd vote as a Republican if they could ever figure that out but that that's a much harder thing to accomplish than one might think at heart so I guess what I'm trying to tell you\nIs\nTurn that TV I'll stop watching all that nonsense about some outraged woman some Hillary Clinton supporter who says that you know men are awful I mean\nYou don't you don't develop your your

ten Obamacare was passed\nAnd that November\nYou and I and a lot of good people around this country who don't sell goods or services to the government people that aren't looking for a job from the government people that don't want more benefits from the government contracts lobbying\nWe worked hard to put Republicans in the house and take control of the Senate so that we could repeal Obamacare\nAnd folks let's not forget in two thousand ten the number\nOne issue in the country for Republicans was sitting still Washington I Will read\nObamacare\nWhere we got the majority in the house we got the majority of the Senate and they started passing bills repealing Obamacare oh dozens of them and then I'll vote for him and they tell their just did send messages out\nThere that were voted to repeal Obamacare and people back home and they say we got we got it oh bummer vetoed it oh well we'll try it again next month\nAnd they keep trying to pass a bill repeal Obamacare we're calling on the president to repeal Obamacare\nAnd Obama would say no I'm not doing it all we get so close and banner would cry he smoked cigarettes you'd get drunk and that's just before two o'clock and we were working so hard you know we're going to repeal Obamacare and then two thousand twelve can we got to win\nThe White House [noise] because it's going to take the White House to repeal Obamacare\nExcept that was never going to happen because if you remember it was Romney's top advisors who took what Romney did in Massachusetts Republicans and advised\nObama on Obamacare nationally so Romney was never going to repeal Romneycare Romneycare was called Obamacare and he was never going to do that\n[noise] so he ran and he lost but we owe\nGot still got Obama but we'll struggled through and the house would keep doing it every two thousand fourteen elections did say we're going to repeal Obamacare if you send us back we're going to repeal Obamacare OK we'll go walk without sophomore car\nBut they never quite could get it done but that dead burned ...\nHe was ... when\nWe got a Republican in the White House we got a Republican majority in the house we got a Republican majority of the Senate and we can't seem to get Obamacare repealed and it turns out it's because the Republicans have been working against us all they were glad to vote to repeal Obamacare when there was no chance of Obamacare was going to be repealed\nAnd he lied of that Marco Rubio's in the news today not related to Obamacare but related to the fact that rather than focus on the single most important issue which is repealing Obamacare\nHe's talking about calling ... not only are you talking about going cabernet he's saying stupid stuff Marco Rubio added again\nSenator known for like you know what rights but I just came up with things that they were calling Catholic saying that the owners\nThat most of them said that he was the star\nWas like they kind of glue voted against him

the idea the absurdity of Marco Rubio even talking about quarterbacks\nThen less move into his home as if he is somehow an expert on who is and isn't a quarterback\nI think before Marco Rubio said that he should have been required to throw a football Fifteen yards\nWith the bulls eye on the wall tell you what Marco here's the bowls are we don't exactly expect you to thread the needle but let's let's do some concentric circles how big do we could you throw a football fifty yards\nAnd if you did throw at Fifteen yards could could could you even hit the wall at fifty new arch All right so you hit the wall you brought side of a barn may be\nIf you had a poll today but could you throw it touched by how would you have a clue how to hold\nAnd if you did possibly throw a spiral for Fifteen yards I don't think you would that then how close would you get I mean just imagine from oh so there's Marco\nRubio holding forth on how many quarterbacks we have and God didn't make enough quarterbacks\nAre you kidding me there aren't sixty three better quarterbacks in the world what are their sixty four quarterbacks currently an unofficial rosters is it is that what he's saying\nHow would he know how would mark over this is what's wrong with people liked it off is what makes you think you know better than\nTeam owners what they want on there the [noise] what's that's Marco Rubio
