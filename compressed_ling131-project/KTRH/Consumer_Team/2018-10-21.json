births in the United states\nNow occur outside of wedlock forty percent of all the baby was born in America are born moms who are not married to the dads by\nThe way that number forty percent in Nineteen Seventy it was ten percent this is a massive change in American society\nAnd I want to ask you about the implications on estate planning\nOne of the legal rights and responsibilities what are you doing about properly naming airs because when you are married you have certain automatic rights under tax law and other federal statutes but when there is no marriage certificate and many of those rights\nDon't exist so you need to make sure if you were giving birth to a child to lose other parent you are not married\nYou need to make sure you're talking within the state attorney\nFor the protection of yourself\nYour partner and most importantly the child\nOr taking telephone calls here on the record on the show had not the Dana Point California Bob you're on the air how you doing\nHi Rick I'm a I'm my question is actually a market neutral funds um my wife and I\nAre retired we're in a her sixties or\nYou know I'm a little I Would say I would say not nervous but\nUh uh just concerned about preserving by uh uh what I've accumulated and I started researching these so called market neutral funds for up you know a portion of my portfolio I Would say\nAnd I guess I just wanted to know what your take is on them\nYeah yeah I appreciate the question Bob the whole name is ... ... of a sales pitch\nIt clearly is titled in a way to appeal to someone who is afraid of losing money in the market and therefore they pronounced themselves as market drill but one of the earth is not supposed to mean in the first place\nA market neutral fund is by its sales pitch suggesting that they're going to generate\nA neutrality meaning that if the market goes down they're not going to suffer losses it's going to be neutral\nThat's the ... that the sales pitch no one has ever been able to really deliver on that kind of a promise a and there's no reason to expect that they're going to be able to deliver on it in the future so rather than trying to choose a sales pitch but his so called market neutral well we would simply out for instead\nIs diversification in other words don't put all of your money into stocks have some of your money there to give you some opportunity to keep pace with the cost of living but don't put all of your money there instead have some of your money in bonds and you have some of your money under the mattress having some of your money in cash\nDoes make perfect sense we don't have all of our money in any one place but having a little bit of our money and lots of places makes sense so not just stocks but also bombs and foreign securities and government security is an oil and gas and real estate in exponential technologies and on and on and on so\nThat is what we have found to be the best approach or effectively phrase in another way it's not the best approach\nIt's the least worst approach um because what we have really found it's kinda like democracy right the worst political system ever devised except for all the others and it's similar to the same thing we don't know what is the best way to invest so we choose the least worst\nWhich is not making big bats so if you'll simply place a little bit of your money in a large array of investment opportunities you can help insulate yourself\nFrom losing a lot of money at any one time in any one after class because you don't have all of their money in any one after class so that makes sense for it\nBut yet totally makes and uh you know thank you for talking the out of it uh because it didn't make sense to be\nAny time you come upon other similar kinds of questions us give us

obligated to act as a fiduciary to our clients stockbrokers do not have this obligation insurance agents do not have this obligation\nWell hero comes along the New Jersey bureau of securities that the state regulator in New Jersey\nThey've now issued a notice that they're going to release a proposal that will in fact require everybody brokers as well as investment advisors to adhere to a fiduciary standard when providing investment recommendations to clients New Jersey's asking they said because federal regulators meaning the SEC\nHaven't done enough to raise the standards and so New Jersey is doing it by themselves does this mean we're going to suddenly the fifty states doing this individually with fifty sets of regulations\nI Hope not I hope we have one over all encompassing regulation at

Andrew\nThanks very much appreciate it get give us a quick story on how and why purity coffee came to be\nUm I'll give you the shortened version of the story um it was a a few years ago just over three years ago with my wife was having some health issues um low energy we couldn't figure out what it was at the time uh Bush is doing is she was drinking a lot of coffee like most of us do I'm going to need a bit of energy\nAnd as you could probably felt my actions I'm a tea drinker I filled\nThat Michael was doing was was back\nSo I thought you know maybe one foot on the civil rights of why put on the brake can drink just watch coffee comedy good so um I was introduced to two professors at the Institute of coffee studies and found that bill university\nAnd what they told me was just amazing which is that there's a huge gap between what science knows and the general public knows about the health benefits of coffee\nSo that sort of started me down upon initially trying to find the very best coffee for my wife and then afterwards realizing what he was focusing every decision based on health and so we started working with\nThe University of Brazil and some of the leading cause I'm just looking at every step of the production chain saying what can we do differently if we would just making a decision based on how\nSo the the low hanging fruit on copies benefit is is it the caffeine helps us get our brains into gear right but is there is there such a a thing as you found out now as too much coffee in the morning\nWell the interesting thing what you said there is that the caffeine is\nOnly a small part of what coffee is made up of this person's a constituency and coffee\nAnd the biggest constituent off from caffeine is a thing called courage and the gas is ... and what that is a horrible sounding name but it's a it's an antioxidant and that's the reason why most of the health benefits are coming from the antioxidants and coffee\nAnd not from the caffeine caffeine gives you that short term joke we'll we'll like hum among some health benefits come from the ...\nWell it's good to have all of that in there then what about a ... back to that question I'm trying to pinpoint here how much is too much coffee or is there such a thing\nThere is a there is such a thing but it's really watching your body goes down to the ...\nI seen parts of it is that we we we metabolize caffeine in different ways I'm a foster metabolize caffeine and I could have doubled expressive before we go to sleep when I'm fine other people have a coffee at twelve o'clock and staying up all night so\nUm it's really watching your body and it's all about the caffeine that you'll sensitive to but but when it comes to a daycare or just a coffee there's very low in capping\nHum the more the better it is actually dose dependent so if you're drinking a caffeinated coffee you know you you have to watch your body\nHow much caffeine content is there in at eight ounce cups and I'm guessing it varies widely from Brando Brandon right\nIt doesn't actually surprised home they have all the things about things like the opposite ends will vary widely from from ... but apart from this one\nType of coffee coffee called ... which is a lower end of the coffee chain um that's higher in in uh in caffeine but apart from that but we're in a sort of ten to Fifteen Percent range\nOkay and that's why a cup of coffee may taste different but as far as the the jolt you're going to get from is probably going to be about the same unless you're again going to like a double espresso or something\nYeah a lot of this as well what people say especially the churches and uh I'm sort of nervousness and that's the thing is not necessarily being over cap and they do is go in the case of just the fact those poor quality coffee with some of those those problems\nYeah that's a that's a very interesting take on that because everybody always assumes it's the caffeine now I read in the material Andrew that the coffee also can reduce the risk of some pretty serious disease is talking about that for a minute\nAbsolutely and that's that's sort of um but most people are not aware of is the companies that number one source of antioxidants and the American diet I Want to not jokes to the dogs to reduce inflammation and the body so there's been some very very large studies done on coffee and help and then one in particular which is one million one hundred nine thousand people\nFollowed with Thirty years and it showing the benefits school reduction of type two diabetes by around forty to forty five percent wandering three to five cups of coffee a day which is\nYou know which is shocking given the fact that those you know eight to one million people pre diabetic and the U.S should be something more people are aware of\nYou know you you mentioned that you and your wife amber had gone to this Vanderbilt University Institute of coffee studies I wouldn't even believe that was a real thing if I well I I ... I Want to hear more about that how long has it been around and what what did they study there\nSo that they they study the cultural effects of coffee primarily but they've done some work on the health benefits as well and that's where I was introduced to round up from from from Brazil\nUm what they're really trying to do is understand the cultural impacts a coffee production I'm particularly in Latin America as they do a lot of work with smoke from those hum in Latin America to understand how a middle man it's really affecting the ability for those small farmers to get a living wage", "year": "2018", "show_name": "Consumer Team", "city": "Houston", "day": "21"}
