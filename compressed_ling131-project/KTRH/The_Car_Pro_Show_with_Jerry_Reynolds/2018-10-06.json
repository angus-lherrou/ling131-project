{"month": "10", "state": "TX", "station": "KTRH", "content": "Telling you that interest rates were too low right and it was causing excess credit creation and which leaves excess money creation which leads to be too much to flight ... which is ...\nSo you probably ought to raise the interest rate uh so if you were to get an inflation move like that\nAnd you then raise the interest rate would you be tight or we just be responding to conditions for him\nThat's the of two percent inflation and a two percent fed funds rate let's just say that's normal well if you're a three percent inflation shouldn't you have a three percent for the fed funds rate does that mean anything's actually any tire oh\nRight does a rate hike now and do continued rate hikes through the rest of the year the water the politics of that especially here in a in a midterm election cycle defined I think\nWhatever politics are are done uh there's not going to be I think there's not another meeting until after the term circa ... maybe just a day or two before but uh I think the fed has made it clear that they're only going to rate hikes at alternating meeting okay\nI'm\nEven if they surprised by doing a rate hike just before the midterms a\n... and then even if that rate hike was a mistake that was slow the economy there's no way that it would have the slightest pick on anybody or anything for months and so the idea that that would make anybody\nYou know less satisfied with Republican leadership I'm In for a vote or you know that kind of narrative there are many different narrative a it is just absurd it's just that whatever affect the fed will have it it's\nIt's gonna habits are they habits so if it's going to the election it already has\nWell let's talk about in terms I mean you have you've gone out there and said that you know midterms are basically a referendum on whether America is glad I got what I Want to talk about that talk about how you are looking at the at the midterms right now and what you're tracking versus maybe what we see you know in in in other in other outlets\n[noise] um typically in the terms and you can go back many many many many years and look at the historical record on this it's quite clear it seems that with the economy is strong or weak whether the president was popular or unpopular what tends to happen\nIs whatever party does not control the White House makes big gains in the house is set up okay\nAnd that appears to be a pattern that is just part of the American soul and or maybe it's part of the human soul except the American system so little unique but the [noise] so we see it here but for most people politics is like the Olympics were were you get interested in sports once every four years right\nOr at least you get interested in things like gymnastics once every four years so the uh the people who will get interested in it just two years later yeah or the people who are really angry about the way it turned out two years ago okay and this time around is immigrants four years ago it was a Republican\nYou know one of the things that that were asked a lot about is what we're kind of seeing what we are tracking um especially on the trade side you know as the as the U.S China story kind of continues to move forward or in some\nRespects metastasize as we see the additional tariffs um you know they they've taken effect after their announcement\nAfter promises of you know the Chinese retaliation and you and I talked about this in the past in terms of then kind of coming out and saying you know we're not going to devalue\nWhat happened right after the recent move or the the recent announcement on the tariffs I especially as it relates to us equities and Chinese equities where you know you were tracking that but what happened after this announcement\nLoaded question because what's been happening all during this trade war which really started in March is us stocks of basically crawled straight straight up and Chinese stocks of curled straight straight down there to downright gr market and their currencies\nDone the same thing so if you're a non Chinese investor who had to buy the Chinese currency to buy Chinese stocked you got hit both ways on the stocks and the currency like ... thirty five percent\nThis year [noise] so what happened after sort of the worst of all tariff announces came out a week ago if the u._s. stock market went up the Chinese stock market went up twice as much so that wasn't supposed\nTo have [laughter] yeah ... and\nOne of the things that was driving those things are in early conclusion was the financial pressure being put on the Chinese by their stock market by their currency market by their bond market and all of which are in great distress and we're sending a useful signal to the Chinese that as painful as it is going to be for you to capitulate to Trump\nIt's can be even more painful that you have your economy imploded have what would really be the first

for a new car for her and she's currently driving a few thousand eight Mercedes three hundred she really likes Mercedes now she watch 'em I think we're looking at a certified ... owns a Mercedes\nAnd either the the class or the each class she really likes the class but there's like a newer models that twenty Seventeen\nUm versus maybe something older twenty six keen and\nYou know ultimately what my question is how can we\nSave the most money and now I get the best deal because I Know there's Kelley Blue book and others that men's and um and I know the dealers are going to want to make the most but we want to save the most of just kind of looking for some guidance\nYeah back in those cars and I I prefer\nPersonally if I'm looking for something used I'm going to get on a hot a traitor and I'm going to use their search engine which is very very good you can be very specific with their search engine a number of miles and miles from your home to where the cars located\nA certain options your models or arrange\nUm you know ... when the body style changes own a car like the ... did a few years ago than the old body style cars become really good values\nBut you're driving a car that's you know not current uh but if you're if you're looking for the best by then that's where it's going to be of course a lot of mileage the better but if you if you use the search engine at all or trader\nIn real short order you're going to get a real feel for values and I'll tell you when a fundamental change\nIn just in the past few years has been dealers price in their cars on line at rock bottom especially used cars\nThere are some exceptions some directors used a different method uprising where they start high and then every week they lower the price until the car sales because most of us have a rule that sixty days after spending inventory for sixty days it goes to the auction and they know they're going to lose money there\nSo but most tears today drop their prize right off the bat the day that they get the car and they put it on line their best prize is on line and the reason they have to do that now is because so many people are shopping on the Internet\nAnd if you're not down there with everybody else\nThen you're not going to get any traffic nobody's going to buy anything from you you're not going to get emails and your phone's not going to rain\nAnd so this this is a big change for the auto industry ... and I'm not trying I'm just trying to explain to you\nThat if you go to our trade her dot com you're going to get a real feel for pricing so that's what I Would recommend so you you kinda know what you're looking at and then how that fits into your budget and then make a decision on your model", "year": "2018", "show_name": "The Car Pro Show with
