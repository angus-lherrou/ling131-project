the air [noise]\nIt's an area where President Trump is the best\nHe's better than any Republican\nAnd he's actually better than any Democrat\nI have to give the man credit he's really really good so today he had lunch with Kanye West\nWrote did you see any of the footage of it or in in our haven't either I I've been out\nBut I Know he did and I know that afterward CNN lost their mind part of why they lose their mind\nIs because the\nCulture is wherever they beat Republicans culture is where they went over minorities\nAnd women and us especially young people they have a practically a lock on young people through culture\nSaturday Night live has become basically an ad campaign against\nDonald Trump comedians are all liberals Hollywood actors are liberals rappers or oh well they're not really liberals but they're black Democrats\nOr they'll stop for black Democrats and they're not truly liberal in the classic sense the\nWay white liberals are ... they can be brought in they can be ... they can be used to corral black voters and they do\nSo Kanye West has lunch with Donald Trump\nToday and CNN has a panel and\nDuring that paying all the things they say a about a black man Kanye West I don't\nWant to say well you know if it conservative said the database called him a racist because we already know that\nBut just on its face these are some pretty awful things\nHow what is what happens when they grow don't read 'em and and we have this now and now Donald Trump is going to use it in perverted and he's going to have somebody who can stand with you know that\nThat's funny say that they do you hear the other panelists the white panelist laughing 'cause black person just attacked a black person Kanye West is what happens when negroes don't read that's what he said\nWell that's nice isn't it say they won't have a white person said that they'll have the black person say that and that's what blacks to that sale crab in a bucket [noise]\nIf you don't know what the crab in a bucket theory is or phenomena it's not just a theory it's a phenomenon\nBecause it's a fact it happens\nBlack people know what it is 'cause black people who witnessed the crab in a bucket phenomena is that black people are like crabs in a bucket if one of them\nStart climbing to where he is getting to the edge of the bucket to get hold of it and get out the other crabs beneath him will grab him with their pinchers pull him back down\nSo you know a Isaac Newton famously said if I have seen further it is only by standing on the shoulders of giants\nAt\nNo Ramon not one set of footprints let me promote pleased about interest when I'm trying to uh say smart stuff\nIsaac Newton was referencing the fact that science builds on what comes before it\nEverything is in one way or another derivative of what happens before it and that's what Newton was recognizing and\nWhether it's Kanye West or Jay Z or anybody else we're products of the art if we're artist that came before us if we're scientists we're products of the science that came before us\nScientists today don't have to devote their careers to figuring out Archimedes principle\nThey don't need to spend their time understanding gravity and the gravitational pull pi has already been established\nThey have a scientific method a rigorous means by which things are tested the global warming crowd out to try this\nAnd so you start having all these things already I mean if you're a writer you start with the fact that language has already been established the use of language to language turns of language turns of phrase all of these things\nBut there is in black pop culture there is the inability to add to what was before because of the tearing down so many black artists have to spend their time re establishing their bona fides\nAnd there's a reason for that\nAnd if you want to use slave analogies here's where you can use them here's where you get into references of house negroes here's where you get into references that I Do think go back a long time\nThey go back over ... over a century ago century and a half some cases more\nThis idea of a black man daring to have an opinion outside that of other black people\n\nAnd the reason is because if blacks start having their own opinions than the white liberals won't be able to count on a hundred percent of them and the white liberals have built their coalition\nOn needing disarmed me and when the army desserts\nSee that's why that's why they they put somebody behind the army and shoot the disorder\nAnd that's why you would spare three men per hundred to shoot the disorders because if one starts peeling off ill encourage the others and before you know it you've lost all hundred of your infantry\nWell that's the way it is where blacks and that's why the white liberals are very careful do let black folks think for themselves if black folks start thinking independently look I don't expect a hundred percent of black people to vote Republican\nBut you can't tell me it's healthy for a hundred or Ninety nine percent of blacks to vote Democrat you can't tell me that wouldn't be anybody black that would like Donald Trump and I guess that would be okay if they weren't popular in pop culture and Conyers has been so here's CNN's panel", "show_name": "The Car Pro Show with Jerry Reynolds", "year": "2018", "city": "Houston",
