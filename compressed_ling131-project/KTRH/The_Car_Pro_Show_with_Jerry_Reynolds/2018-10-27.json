here on the Rick Adelman show we're heading off to pleasant ridge Michigan Kirk you're on the air how are you\nHi Rick thanks for taking the call and very good happy to how can I help I have a\nQuestion regarding financial literacy\nI have a twelve year old son and a ten year old girl who I talked to a lot regarding the importance of managing debt saving money and investing for the future they both shown some interest but more so my son\nI got a book from the library which my son read the entire thing and one's very excited when he read something about how to invest you know three thousand dollars from a summer job into a rough IRA in forty years later it's worth a you know big number\nIt was all excited and told me dad I'm going to be a millionaire someday so I'd like to continue um you know that thirst for knowledge but ah didn't find anything more at the local library for him to read however I Would\nAlso like him to learn more about lives general financial realities things such as various bank account savings checking credit unions how to balance a checkbook\nOr various kinds of insurance credit card in credit card debt and then just also investing for the future so I'm Wondering what books are digital media would be available for his you know that would be age appropriate for him yeah\nI don't like a a workbook or software to go along with it so it can provide like hypothetical examples for him to work through their anything out there like that\nA law clerk I'm going to give you the applause\nSo engaged in so focused on financial education for your kids you know we lament\nIn this country that there is a substantial amount of financial illiteracy\nUh parents seem to be talking to their kids about everything these days religion politics

literacy when it was first published\nAnd it covers everything about personal finance from getting out of debt and dealing with credit all the way to multimillion dollar states and everything in between\nUh and the first three parts of that book are really aimed perfectly for your children understanding what his money held his money work of understanding compound gross\nA and the very basics of money so I Would encourage your kids to read the truth about money second\nI'm going to direct you to a website called jumpstart dot org\nThe jumpstart coalition for personal financial literacy is a nonprofit organization that serves as a clerk\nIn house they collect uh information and resources from dozens maybe even hundreds of organizations academic organizations nonprofits government agencies as well as corporations that produce financial education materials\nBut jumpstart coalitions materials are almost all free all of it's available on line that jumpstart dot org it's designed for teachers and parents of kids K. through twelve\nSo if you go there you'll find a wealth of data information articles videos work books quizzes all kinds of information that you can use to help foster your children's educations\nI Will definitely do that right thank you very much\nYou're very welcome Kirk thank you so much for the phone call you can do with Kirk did and call us the triple a plant wreck that's triple eight seven five to sixty seven forty to whatever your personal finance question we're ready to help you and you know Jim and I are\nSo focused on financial education financial literacy that's why we spend so much of our effort it's why I've written nine books and gene has written one of her own\nAnd why we do some of these seminars this year I think we'll be doing eight hundred seminars by the time of year is out across the country and why do this radio show every week for you and why we do television specials for public TV around the country\nWe are really focused on financial literacy because we know what a problem it is and how so many Americans are just illiterate when it comes to the subject and it's why I'm very happy to tell you one gene that I have written together a first book ... and it's for children\nThe book is called the squirrel manifesto it's being published by Simon Schuster and is being released November twenty about a month from now and it's our first kids' book it's aimed at children ages four to eight\nAnd it teaches children the most important fundamental lessons about money so I encourage you to go to Amazon dot com Barnes and noble dot com your favorite book seller and pre order the book right now\nSo I encourage you to pick up a copy of the squirrel manifesto available to you or your favorite book seller hope
