particular trade and the goal is to be successful to make money support your family\nOr even just support yourself\nThat plan can be blown out of the water if you get sick and so I have seen unfortunately over the last Thirty years people in that position all walks of life if they get sick\nBeing able to run a company becomes nearly impossible even if you've got\nGood people underneath you if you're Mr Big you're the boss you're the guy at the top you're going to have a tremendous amount of pressure\nPlaced on everybody else\nIf you are sick now what what does it mean to get sick

hip replacement\nI'm Talking about serious medical complications\nYou are stricken with cancer and you have to go for surgery and then there's a significant convalescent period and then you have to

thousands of patients that I've seen and I listen to them and it is heartbreaking it is heartbreaking to hear their story on how much their medical condition disease or syndrome has cost them\nAnd so my message here is what is the cost of wellness\nIs eating right it is exercising it is making sure that your blood pressure is on the control that you are not doing things that are in ... your risk of cancer or diabetes or bone disease or neurologic injury\nGetting asleep on time not doing risky behavior type things so that is it that is I I think you all have to look at this the cost of

is checking to see what is in these products and there's all sorts of crap that's in these products\n[noise] and while these dietary supplements are promising money back guaranteed to make you skinnier to look better more energy make your muscles bigger\nThe one thing they're not saying is that they're not safe\nNow many of these products contain unapproved on regulated pharmaceutical the active ingredient other drugs so these over the counter\nSupplements that you buy may have pharmaceutical grade drugs in them that is not listed on the bottle\nWe have grown accustomed jak the labels lip read the labels and you'll know when you're getting well yeah you read the label is say look there's nothing in here to organic it's natural\nBut what we are saying what the FDA is saying is that there are a lot of funny things in these products that\nAre not listed so this past\nFriday John\nMy network open Journal of the American Medical Association published an off an article that basically says there are serious public health concerns out there so for all of you listening to you yourself you use these supplements or do you have somebody in your family or friend or a coworker\nNow in
