I was doing a little research on this myself and the pressure becomes an issue as well and not only does it make us a little colder we we ended up getting less oxygen on that in like a day like Tuesday or Wednesday when it was real cloudy and the pressure was real low\nRight cool breeze blowing around about two or three in the afternoon I feel like somebody sprinkled about ... milligrams a

use radio seven forty Katie our age when traffic and whether we gather here you see so many accidents to record this evening\nOne thing I told you about is the cost of wellness now what do you mean the cost of wellness ... you know have you put a price tag on that well I look at it and to say regardless of where you are in your station in life\nIf you are at one end a small business owner you're an entrepreneur you are running a family business ... mom and pop operation where it's you and your wife or family or your kids or you are\nAn employee of a company big or small it doesn't matter\nOr if you're young you're in your early twenties you are on that hopefully\nA positive trajectory of success you've gone to college maybe you've gone to graduate school you've gone for additional training in a particular trade and the goal is to be successful to make money\nYou support your family or even just support yourself\nThat plan can be blown out of the water if you get sick and so I have seen unfortunately over the last Thirty years people in that position all walks of life if they get sick\nBeing able to run a company that comes nearly impossible even if you've got good people underneath you if you're Mr Big you're the boss you're the guy at the top you're going to have a tremendous amount of pressure\nPlaced on everybody else\nIf you are sick now what what does it mean to get sick I'm not talking about having the flu and you're out for maybe a week or you have a case of appendicitis and you're you have to go for some minor surgery you have your gall bladder taken out you need a hip replacement\nI'm Talking about serious medical complications\nYou are stricken with cancer and you have to go for surgery and then there's a significant convalescent period and then you have to start chemotherapy or radiation therapy\nAnd you're going to be off line for weeks to months\nOr if you have some sort of serious heart condition that develops or you developed kidney failure from your diabetes and obesity and hypertension\nAnd you're in and out of the hospital you're on started on dialysis you're on medications that give you side effects you are not going to be at the top of your game running a company and so what happens\nWhat actually happens is that you're going to be at risk from maybe losing your company or are you going to lose your job\nOr you're not going to be able to perform you're going to take you going to use your vacation days then you're going to take your PTO time then you're going to get leave without absence or leave without pay I should say\nAnd financially it's going to be not only a problem for you it's going to be all that added stress on you and your family and your people that you're close to but it's going to significantly impact on your employees and your success\nOverall and that is what I mean the cost of wellness\nAt all times you need to be thinking everything I Do how is that going to affect my health you cannot take your health for granted\nWhat you're eating for breakfast\nHow does that reflect on your health what you're doing for lunch how does that affect my health not only today or tomorrow but next month next year five years from now because you have to think that way you can not think that you can\nGo along scot free\nAnd then all of a sudden not expect that you're going to be stricken by some sort of medical malady now I Am not here I Am I'm very optimistic person very optimistic the glass\nIs always half full but the reality check which you cannot take away from me is my experience\nIn the thousands of patients that I've seen and I listen to them and it is heartbreaking it is heartbreaking to hear their story on how much their medical condition disease or syndrome has cost them\nAnd so my message here is what is the cost of wellness\nIs eating right it is exercising it is making sure that your blood pressure is on the control that you are not doing things that are in ... your risk of cancer or diabetes or bone disease or neurologic injury\nGetting him to sleep on time not doing risky behavior type things so that is it that is I I think you all have to look at this the cost of wellness and see how that\nFits in with you All right we're going to take a break right now\n\nWhen we come back more information in the news more about wellness\nDon't forget to go to Dr Joe ... dot
