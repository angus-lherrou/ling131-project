working or if you want some sort of a change in your job [noise] All right um you know one one little thing that I I like to talk about this time of the year is with it being fall\nAnd the days are getting a little longer and the temperature is reducing just a little bit though this past week it was still well into the nineties [noise]\nIt's a perfect excuse to start thinking about strategies for your health\nNow a lot of people say well the beginning of January New Years I'm going to take a little bit better care of myself some people say with the beginning of spring I say the beginning of fall as we sort of ease into the fall and there are just a few things to think about which\nWhich we will start off here number one\nEverybody's been talking about it get the flu shots All right and the next week or so make a plan when you get home tonight or if you're at home put a sticky note on the refrigerator and say we are getting the flu shot as a family now unless you were allergic to egg\nThere really is no reason not to get the flu shot the flu vaccination now everybody for as long as I've been practicing medicine Thirty years people have been saying oh but you know two years ago I got the flu after I got the flu vaccine\nThat is absolutely baloney because this is not an active virus you cannot get the flu from a dead virus\nWhat this does is this stimulate your immune system to make antibodies against\nThe influenza virus now will you or could you or might you get a little reaction at your arm yes you can\nMight you get a little aches and pains little low grade fever you may feel a little fatigue for a few days yes you may but that is not\nThe flu and so that should not be an excuse or reason or rationale or a defense mechanism not to get the flu vaccine thousands upon thousands of people die each year\nFrom influenza if you have heart disease if you've got lung disease if you have diabetes have we have a weakened immune system if you've got liver disease\nIf you are obese you need to get the flu vaccine\nAnd that is a very very important and your children need to get the flu vaccine okay the other thing is start mapping out a strategy for cooking at home this is one of the central pillars\nOf wellness that I talk about I talk about it in the book eating yourself sick and we need to get back to a very simple task\nOf meal's cooked at home getting everyone in the family involved in the process that means besides yourself your husband your wife boyfriend girlfriend\nYour children all the relatives that may be living with you everybody needs to get involved in the process now what's involved in the process well it's sitting on a Sunday evening like after eight o'clock tonight when the programs over and sitting down and saying okay what are we going to eat this week\nAnd let's talk about Monday are we going to have some a grilled fish what vegetables do we want what do we have in the refrigerator already what we need to buy and so you build this week long laundry list not laundry list shopping list\nOf vegetables and fruits and different types of protein that you need for the week and then everybody has to participate now if you were working in your kids are at home or your husband or wife gets home earlier\nMake a plan to say OK on Tuesday I'm going to come home a little late you're going to be home at the regular time why don't you start cooking the vegetables for for us chopped them up saute them whatever needs to be done or maybe get your kids involved\nIt really is important and for kids to learn how to cook now these are skills that will serve them throughout their entire life trust me I've seen it the other the other sort of deal you have to make yourself\nIs getting to bed earlier there is so much research on the benefit of going to bed early as well as the detriment of going to bed late chronically\nYou have to cut down on evening TV screen time on your computer handheld devices etc sleeping encourages weight loss a drop in blood pressure and it makes for a more productive next day these are all really great things so\nGet your flu shot start mapping out strategy for home cooking and get to bed

about how you are cooking and preparing meals for your family\nMore and more data continue to come out on childhood obesity it's very very sad the key fact that I tell everybody that the children of today are not going to live as long as their parents\nBecause of obesity related complications in the form of diabetes heart disease liver disease long orthopedic and kidney problems it's not it's not a pretty scene at all [noise]\nAll right well the month of October is hepatitis awareness mountain as you all know I Am a liver specialist they hepatitis adjust\nAt Houston Methodist Hospital taking care of patients with all facets of liver disease now in the hepatitis awareness month\nThe organizers tend to focus on hepatitis a B and C\nAnd as I always tell everybody either in person or when I speak to a community groups or on the radio here it's it's a ... an excuse to talk about liver disease in general\nBecause really hepatitis is inflammation of the liver that's all that it means that is not tell you the underlying root cause of the appetite is now if it's hepatitis B\nWe know why delivers inflamed it's that the tightest B virus\nBut you can have something called non alcoholic Seattle hepatitis which is a big long fancy name for a fatty liver that is causing hepatitis and so whenever I Am\nTalking with patients and I tell them that I Believe they have hepatitis\nThere is that initial freak out moment because they think they're contagious they think their husband may have been fooling around on them or their wife and it's a no no no hepatitis is inflammation of the liver that's the one thing I Want you all to leave tonight with realizing what that means\nAnd sell very briefly I'll go through the different types of hepatitis\nAnd certainly hepatitis a B and C\nAre the most common viral causes or eighty allergies and know hepatitis aid is not turning to hepatitis B and EPA dies be turns into hepatitis C or hepatitis a as the best and hepatitis C is the worst\nIt doesn't go that way they would just identified in alphabetical order\nWe could have easily just said hepatitis one or ...\nTitus two or three or four so hepatitis a is spread through what we call the fecal oral transmission route so a person that has hepatitis a they may not know they have it yet yet they are shedding\nThe virus in their stool\nAnd they're bound movement now this is why hand washing\nIs so important and as disgusting and as gross and sickening as this sounds a small amount of store material fecal material will get on that person's hand or fingers\nAnd then you either through eating the food that they are preparing or you're in close contact with the person you then in jest typically through your mouth\nThe stool that has the virus as part of it you then go you're merry way maybe you ate a salad or some other food that was prepared and then days or weeks later you come down with acute hepatitis a\nAlright so hand washing is a clear clearly important now they're all vaccines for hepatitis hay\nAnd there are those of us that feel there should be universal vaccination against hepatitis hey you don't have to worry about it hepatitis B. is more of a sexually transmitted disease through blood and body fluids\n[noise] uh once you are exposed you may get sick you may turn yellow your liver enzymes may become elevated your liver may become a bit swollen\nBought eighty five percent of the people will recover Fifteen Percent will go into this chronic hepatitis B state that can then put you at risk for other complications including cirrhosis and liver cancer\nAnd then hepatitis C which has received so much notoriety or in in the press and attention or in the lay public typically blood transfusions history of needle use tattoos Bonnie piercing
