dedicated to my mom who passed away in January of two thousand sixteen she was a regular contributor to the program\nBut when I spoke at her funeral to try to talk about mom I talked about family based and food and a lot of people have picked up on\nAnnette family faith and food concept where mom absolutely loved her family her children my dad and anybody that was at the house\nSaid we were very very faithful growing up in New York We're Catholic and that really served as the underpinning for our character and then food\nAnd we we did not eat food for the sense of Gore judging ourselves and getting obese and developing diabetes but my mother firmly believe and this is what she talked about when she came on the radio with me that the role of the mother and father\nWas to nurture the children\nTo care for them have a safe environment but to provide the nutrition to make these kids healthy successful and happy and so she loved to cook she was a marvelous cooked of the people all of
