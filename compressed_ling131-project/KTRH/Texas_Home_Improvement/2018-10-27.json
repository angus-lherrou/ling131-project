the ... thing with the manifold in the garage and it takes a long time for the water to go from the you know from the cold water from the coming into the water heater\nOr actually the hot water\nTo get out of show right on the air and then go out and wrote were my water heater is the master bass and I was thinking is that a hitter in to the\nEnd of the land go in the mail so I just come out with say a couple alliance similar laboratory and baby but it's still the laboratories and then they'd be one to the kitchen sink\nLately if it's going to shorten the run you ... can do that I mean the only thing that you're going to lose is being able to go over to the manifold and shut the water off but you can put a valve in it where you cut it in if you want\nOkay should I just go ahead and and uh this put it in it or\nShould I just uh the vow or or just cut the land from the metal\n... um the lady you\nKnow you can just a shutdown valve office could because the whole purpose of the manifold is there's one line going out to each ah right fixture so you can shut that with our boss if you want okay go up and at the main line tee off of it\nI Would put another vowels there then so you ... or shut that fixture off if you want but you know whether you have a tank or a tank the water has to travel the same distance and that's one of the complaints with these manifold does it takes too long for the hot water to get there because it's traveling further\nRight yeah that's what I can get by with it you know I can actually in the shower because it was a little bit more ... there and also is a tough it's it's okay it's just the two laboratories I'd like to have at least\nWarm water up pretty quick so yeah All right well that's a good deal well thank you for a shared it every day you too thank you and and\nJust very by listening there is a second option I mean you can put a small on demand under the sink so you've got instant hot water there\nUm you know you can also put you say small hang tight under the sink if a person wants and what happens then is you know you got like a two gallon or a five gallon small tank there\nThat gives you hot water right away then as it's filling up and you're using water pretty soon the hot water from the\nWater heater main water heater gets to it and it just keeps on going so you never you don't notice the difference at all but you got instant hot water there and that's\nIf you don't have access to the pipes if you've got access to the pipes and you can shorten a run like we were just talking about by all means do it you're not hurting I

moisture getting into the concrete but if you've got enough moisture coming up that it's also getting carpets wet and things like that\nUh you've got something\nPutting moisture under the foundation whether it's groundwater standing water outside when it rains a or you know leaks in in a sewer pipes under the home something is adding to the moisture to allow that much moisture come up through the concrete\nA concrete is porous and some moisture will travel through it when it gets to be too much static pressure and yes you can put a sealer on it but that static pressure will start pushing on it and make it peel off and that's where it becomes a problem later\nYes when we were modeled the bathroom and found it we\nDid have the White House cleaned it all up up painted it with a fever uh-huh

the\nNation so what are other reasons that I could have water you know\n[noise] well I cook quite that it's been a ... one in here used\n... honestly I just was outlook in a minute\nIt's MORNING because I've got one area where the water has come down so hard that at the levels came up I actually got a a little bit of a a damn spot in one corner of my house from it I got to\nWatch them some drainage so that's one thing that could be doing it but the other thing that can be doing it and it is actually probably more likely doing it is a shower pan leaking\nOh it's an it's an old ... you're right it could be so easy to shower could be like on the back side of it\nWell the shower itself could but the shower pan the bottom of the shower or is it a tile floor or is it a a one of those single piece man made\nIt is single based\nSo ... if it is a single piece\nMan made that way where the drain itself is there's a big rubber dome that ah that is the seal around an a for a nut the titans up on the bottom of the showerhead showerhead on the bottom of that shower pan and\nThat can dry out and start cracking and you start getting the kind of leaks that you're having\nOkay cool in my final thing is what confidence can you give me I'm terrified but I have to do my plumbing can I I cannot afford to get a commercially that I'm gonna have to do it myself\nOkay just if if if you lift if you take the shower drain screen off the top there there's typically there's two types one has two screws you just take the two screws and it pops right off the other is just clips down in their airway removed that screen look down in there\nAnd you ... you'll probably be able to see if if it looks like it's leaking there but to test it\nJust drop a test ball in their right and see lit up fill the shower pan with water and let it sit for a few hours and see if you start getting linkage\nRight and it's the whole ... it's the whole to the the drainage and the bottom of the whole top so the older age I'm ... I'm Sorry I thought that the tub and shower was separate is is a no no no I'm Sharon combination could they could you tell where the showerhead\nOkay if that's the case then more than likely it's either going to be from the outside or the overflow on the tub\nGotcha gotcha oh those are notorious for doing it\nGot it and the confidence that I was looking for is ... ...\n... it's not hot but is it it can't be as easy to say\nTruthfully it is [laughter] okay it is it is look here's the hardest part that you can have you're gonna have to have the right tools but as you go to a Ferguson more plumbing supply of Morrison plumbing supply one of those stores\nThey a lot of times even have tools you can rent to do it right and it's the the pipe itself is just it's just like a a big plastic role light and you roll it out you nip it to the links you need to use the tool to attach the ... is that simple\nSo my my question is I heard that I had to knock a bunch of holding my walls to my feeling is that correct or is that just in certain spots\nIt's only in certain spots depending on how your plumbing is run the the thing about the the uh packs is a lot of times you're able to\nYou know teed off drop it down and and hook it up but on the backside of each fixture you've got to have access to it in order I hook it up that's where you end up knocking holes\nSure if I just huge it's a two story house so I any linkage immature my floors can I can I see that often rented a different direction\nYou can do whatever you want with it [laughter]\nI I mean literally like that guy was talking about where the hot water was going to the manifold an extra long to get their tea at off cut that links often I mean it it's ... it's an easy product to work with\nAll right thank you so much I enjoy your show\nThank you sir take care\nAnd granted it is not for everybody and mess with and you do have to have some skill was using tools if if you're going to do the packs on 'cause I Know there's a lot of plumbers right now so you know you can't do that\nYes you can it it is not difficult\nThe big question did you have to answer is to make sure that you get the right size pipes for the different areas you know not all the pipes in your house are always the exact same size and it has to do with the hydraulic pressures of of getting the water to where it needs to be\nBut frankly you're just replacing what's already there and so if the water flow was right at one point in the you got the size of the pipes right there you know what size to go with let's not over complicate this [noise] uh let's see here Carl you having a good day today\nI'm having to do they how you doing today\nI'm having a great day\nI'm sitting in the parking lot over there in front of a Lowe's and I'm just listening to show and I had a couple a couple of different subjects so one has to do with a few years back when my daughter my daughter's out in LA right now but when she was a kid um\nI bought a one of these little school had a contest between the different schools and M. U. T. whatever to build these little schoolhouse right you know and they had to put them up for auction and one of the real estate's conventions\nAnd I I ended up buying one of them just on a whim but for like a thousand dollars and they were kind of upset because they claim that had about four or five thousand dollars and materials at it but you know had windows and anyway long story short is that it it didn't come wasn't a hearty\nLike on the side\nAnd over the years being outside one side you know just kind of term I got in and shoot it up and and I had someone come and fix it about ten twelve years ago and now the other side I have no idea who I call before but I was wondering if is is doing hearty\nA hearty back stuff yourself difficult to do because I I thought about actually just tearing the thing down because she's an only child but at least something nice on my wife I Do eventually sell the house as someone with a family because I've got a hundred and fifty hundred Seventy feet joined\nBack my house and the fat in the in the back parents being there for another family to have something like that but ah that that was the first thing the other thing is about ...\nAnd all that and let's start with the siding first you have you have you ever done any signing no you don't\nGet it they did siding I I call somebody might have been a handyman I don't remember a long long time ago and he didn't want to the side\nRight but you were asking something easy for you to do it yeah it's actually fairly easy to do if you've done any type of citing work before you working with already Ryan is no harder than anything else have you done any woodworking before\nVery little to be honest with you\nYeah well if if you didn't have problems working with it I mean it's really nothing more than cutting the boards to the right length and mailing right into place that's it\nBack because really just one side of it is what it is or is there any kind of backing behind that like a black\nBecause I I it looks like a part of it looks like an eyesore because I started happening out part of the the rotted out yeah and it just looks part of it looks terrible right now and that sort of like that looks ghetto in the backyard\nIs this is it a lap siding on it or or for by sheets\nAre well when I measure them they were they they overlap\nOkay so they're ... ...\nAnd they're like Seventy five inches long\nYeah OK ... what'd you would normally do is take the old siding off\nA you're probably gonna find felt paper behind it I ... I Would take the ... paper off because you're going to have to inspect the the two by four studs uh the fact that you had termites you gotta make sure that that would not rotted out if it is replaced those pieces of bored\nI personally you don't have to but I personally prefer to put plywood on first and then I install my lap siding or is it\nTrying to think in weather together fears you are

inches on either side that looks like it's\nA weather damaged and so I'm Wondering what are the ... or ... or prefer to have that record store or\nYou liked the door is it and still good shape Fisher\nOkay ... ... ... the the door jam which is what you're dealing with route that is a typically all the doors are pre Hong so it's tipped into place but you can literally cut the bottom off\nAnd replace it with another piece if you go into a lumber yard or one of the box stores they'll actually have the ... door jammed material for sale\nAnd as long as you can make a clean cut across there you can actually put a new piece in a seal up or the joint is you'll make it smooth and then painted and nobody will know the difference that it's all in the skill set of putting it in um the hardest part of the whole thing\nIs the uh [noise]\nThreshold across the base of the door\nBut it's typically a screw down into the concrete if it's not you can always change out the threshold to a different one but uh usually it's not that difficult to\nTo clean them up that way you're going to have to remove the trim boards on both inside and out and is it on break or is it on siding right in that area okay Rick you'll have a a piece of ... that is for matching up to brick\nAnd that's typically going to be like an inch and a half thicken two inches wide and usually that's going to rot at the same time that the bar the door jammed does\nIt than it did Fisher\nOkay so honestly with that just take it off throw it away and buy new material to put all the way around the door because it's really not not if it'll cost you ten bucks and it'll be all nice new and really blend in nice then with replacing bottom of that or jam\nOr so I don't want me to\nThird are saying that would be better than a record here men are order them\nIt'll be a whole lot easier than replacing the entire door jammed 'cause if you go to replace the entire George him now you're going to have to line up in recess the door hinges and all that stuff and trying to get those into alignment is tough\nRight is it something that I could um if if I chose not to do that my health is something that a contractor could there\nYou have probably a little trouble finding one who's willing to do uh just that you'd have to have some other things for him to do or they have to charge you quite a bit to do just one thing like that but it it's actually done all the time\nOK accepted is on both sides of the door and it's because I'm\nThere in the gutters in the back\nYeah over ... over doors patios garage doors things like that that's where a person needs got her ...\n... okay thanks so much you bet take your mind\nAnd let's see we're just keep going on a call here so well another one in Cyprus Brian how are you\n[laughter] I'm doing fine how are you now\nI'm doing wonderful how can I help\nYou well well I I called was one question and I've heard some other callers in on you know it's added a couple of questions but the the reason for calling is about a month ago I had the Na'vi on a tight was here installed uh-huh and the common site is going outside\nAnd it's a you know I haven't you know it's been in for about a month and I've not been able to walk between the Yard's not with the with the condom fight drip and then also the amount of rain that we've had right\nSo I was my question is can the Congress and say the tight end to the same a drain that the AC uses that goes to think\n... need\nTo get a French string good and I thought\nWell you can't and say from the heat or shouldn't be putting that much moisture out a more than likely what you're dealing with this more from the rain but to answer the question it can be put into a drain it does not have to go outside\nBut you cannot typically tied into the a C drink [noise] learn\nNot to the to the drain that I used to use as that goes to you know typically one of the the ... the dream house\nWell what I'm saying is you can't tied into that same pipe coming off the ac system\nOr black or you you can definitely run a line to drain like that yes\nBut you know you say it's not I mean after I've used the hot water it sometimes it's just a steady you know kind of poor and you know I live in the house by myself so it's not even a a full family here [noise]\nYeah it shouldn't blown shouldn't be dumping out that much day okay maybe need to have it checked to make sure that uh all the settings or right Donna\nOkay well you know what I'll do is up with a five gallon bucket and kind of watch to see how much is actually going
