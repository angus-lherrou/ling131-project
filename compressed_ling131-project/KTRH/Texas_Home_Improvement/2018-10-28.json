{"month": "10", "state": "TX", "station": "KTRH", "content": "And a ... a recently named the more you're faithful host one of the top one hundred independent financial advisors now for the seven\nYear in a row\nAnd without our clients I Would be no aware and so I put that one on them I give it to my client well this is a part of the show where we talk about how to pass onto your greedy and washed undeserving airs the fruits of your labor now this week we're actually going to talk about paying for college\nAnd the gift tax laws so if you were not aware a gift taxes come do if you give anybody more than Fifteen thousand dollars in one year\nOkay and so that's the gift tax and college in many cases more than fifty thousand dollars a year I Know I have one in college right now and so you could end up having to do a gift tax if you don't do it\nProperly so we're going to talk about that now but first jak and you play it I Know I\n\nWould say\nMy dog and may be and\n\nAm\n[noise]\nAnd of course that is Tony Bennett with rags to riches and you know the estate taxes and probate and all that kind of stuff it's actually designed to do the exact opposite it's designed to take you from riches to rags\nAnd we do not want that to happen to use every week at this time we have our state tip of the week so this week we're going to talk about a college education paying for that okay so as I mentioned the gift tax exemption\nA is Fifteen thousand dollars this year so let me give you some history on that one okay so that when when the IRS\n[noise] [laughter] ah almost cut you off guard on that one when the IRS came up with the notion of estate taxes this is a tax upon\nYour death then it goes to whoever um and they want it attacks that so they created the estate tax but the IRS is a lot of things but it's not stupid and they figured out that if you have a tax that happens upon death\nThan what people are going to do is if they know they're going to die they're going to give it all away first and then when they died as no tax so we can't have that that would be downright on American not to have some taxes paid so they came up with the gift tax which means that if you try to give it all the way we're going to tax it anyway so you can't get away with that\nBut they also realized that if you tax\nEvery single gift you know if I take you out if I pay for dinner with with friends or something that's a gift\nAnd so do I have to file a tax return for that so we get kind of onerous and they'd probably be thrown out of office for it so they made a gift tax exemption and to give tax exemption is Fifteen thousand dollars per person that you can give to\nAnd as a married couple you can get thirty thousand dollars to as many people as us so the gift tax exempt amount that fifty thousand is you can get that as many people as you wish um and and that's how that works so college is part of that\nSo one of the things that you want to do so there are additional exemptions too that gift tax\nAnd then by the way if you exceed that Fifteen thousand a gift tax is the same as the estate tax and it can get all the way up to almost fifty percent okay so you give a big gift and you may oh half of that in taxes think about that one [noise] so\nHow do you not pay gift taxes on college uh on on a college education costs the answer is you don't give the money to the child or to the student\nAnd then have them pay it you pay the institution directly so if you buy all the books you pay for the tuition and all that kind of stuff if you do all of that directly\nAnd you don't have it goes through the child then that is an exemption to the gift tax so therefore doesn't count so my advice to you is don't give the child the money now I'll give you that I'll give you that advice because when I was in college\nI'm In my fraternity there was this guy called Scott and his parents were giving him the money to ostensibly pay for the tuition guess what Scott was doing he wasn't paying the tuition [laughter] he was keeping\nThe money and he used to come down every day in like you had this Chinese ...\nYou know what this does sat in ... and he'd come down in that and he looked like and slept all night he'd wake up in time to watch the gong show remember the bury the was that guys they bury something who did the gong show\nHe would wake up in time to watch the show on television and then you know he'd have lunch and he lays around all day spending his tuition money\nSo if you needed another reason not to your child the tuition money\nIt's that [laughter] anyway [noise] as I mentioned\nWe are from that uh we uh we ... we specialize in retirement planning that's what we do so we we work primarily with people who are over fifty who are retired or retiring soon

start looking at things as far as the market's going there's multiple directions in the market the up down on the sideways\nIt's critical to make sure that we have strategies kind of like that hedged mentality that can make money if the markets are going up down or sideways and you're one of the things I talked about in one of my classes a long time ago was or wasn't managing if you went to work then they said hey you know what\nWe really like you you're a great candidate we think you'd be a great fit for the company\nBut you can expect to be laid off one third of the time one third of the time we're not going to pay a\nYou know and that's really what happens if we're only trading any bullish direction anytime the markets are going sideways our retirement account or income account is laid off\nAnytime the markets are going down a retirement account or income account is is laid off not to not to even bring up the fact that maybe it's it's deteriorating a little bit especially as the markets are going down\nBut one of the things that we can do is always okay with you Larry when things that we can do is we have a big stack of tickets right here we are just kicking the show off we've got a bunch of tickets we can give away and we can help a few people out there get started becoming more consistent in the market by by doing a quick little give away for these passes that are too are half the class is what do you say let's do it All right\nYou know got a half day class coming up in your area they\nHave to classes while you'll see exactly what it takes to be more consistent in the market making money generate more income as the market's going up down or sideways now the happy classes about three hours long and if you would have set a passes\nTo these half day classes that is going to be your investment just a little bit of time spent three hours of your time in a financial education scenario rather than maybe on social media or watching TV sounds like a good investment to me well just a second you're gonna have a chance to win a set of these passes or one of the happy classes to get your bones ready and if you are driving now is a good time to pull over\nIncluded with your passes is going to be a professional insiders kitten other kids packed with lessons from some of our top instructors\nLessons on topics like enhancing your retirement strategy how to make money when the market goes down income generation capital preservation crypto currency is much much more the professional inside of it makes it so you can get started right now\n... we need you to call now and reserved those seats the number is eight eight six one to eight seven to three that's eight eight eight six one to eight seven to three if you end up being colors nine or Twenty one sorry about that hit us up to Houston oh TA dot com ... scores and passes there\nThere is we stay on kind of this consistency track because of this this consistency conversation as you say you know you talked a little bit of a a little bit about shorting and that is a great opportunity make to make money as the markets are going down\nWhat are some of the other ways that people can diverse into different directions you know we hear diversification as far as I Do have a little commodities have little stocks have little bombs but how 'bout diversification as far as different directional vehicles go\nWell you can always sit here and say we know that when the markets go down there's usually people pulling out of the market's going somewhere either could go into gold\nIt can go into bonds the cool thing that our students learn here as it doesn't matter your background your age what you've done before we teach them how to read a chart so it's a stock short bond chart gold shark\nThey're able to start learning how to trade in the beauty of learning what shorting is is that again a lot of people have been told their whole lives when the markets go down it's a bad thing will last February\nGoldman Sachs may two hundred million dollars in one day by simply Shorty in the market now that day imagined that we had a little piece of it I'm not going to be greedy you know but if you start to learn how to treat like the banks do then it's amazing\nThat all of a sudden you can start learning a skill that can make money and not have to sit there and think about a second job or to get into a little bit later\nBut one of the ways I look at this and I get this analogy all the time when people are just simply trading one direction or they're waiting for the market to always go up it's like a car imagine that you were told you can get in a car tomorrow and you can drive somewhere but you can't put the car and reverse\nYou got to go in a lot of circles eventually going to get there but you can always a lot of time energy and money getting to the same place if you simply had all the tools to get you there faster\nSo a lot of what I'm seeing our students learning the first time is it they're becoming\nDirection ... they don't care if it goes up down or sideways as long as the markets are moving they can learn how to make money and what a lot of them are seeing right now is they could create more freedom for themselves because they're able to make money no matter where the markets go\nYeah absolutely and I love I Love the analogy of the car there's so many so many other analogy that we could pull into this that in in I Would say in real life you know outside of the are investing life\nIn our normal everyday life we there's no way we buy a car that didn't go in reverse right but so many times we find ourselves in investments that only have one direction or one avenue where they can profit you know it's it's the same thing you go back to our you know go back to high school education and where was your stock picking class where it was how to balance a checkbook class right the law to\nCheck but after I said I just dated myself victory over there\nBut it is it is true though I mean we we really didn't have that stuff and so we're left to to rely on the quote unquote professionals really guide us through this process where unfortunately they make a commission off of these transactions and I say unfortunately kinda tongue in cheek there because that's okay with me that they make a commission that's\nThat's what they do for a living your real estate brokers make a commission when they sell real estate so stockbrokers should naturally make a commission when they sell stocks\nBut when we buy a home it is up to it was up to the individual to make sure that they are buying the right home for them in the right market place in the right area that the right payment the right everything it's up to the person to do it\nThe broker just completes the transaction and unfortunately it's up to the person to also make sure that they're making the appropriate decision when it comes to their investing but when it really boils down to about Ninety nine percent of the world hasn't ... they spend more time analyzing the menu when they go out to dinner than they do analyzing what investments to to select\nAnd it it just puts his behind the eight ball and it's something that I think if we did a quick give away with a few more of these passes we could probably make a dent in and help people start making better investment decision I think it's a great idea let's do it All right well right now we've got a half day class coming up in your area that have take classes where you'll see exactly what it takes to generate more consistent income in the market\nUnderstand how the market works understand\nWhat the risks are involved with a lot of different investments out there and how to Capitol capitalize on the upside not happy classes about three hours long\nAnd so you'll be investing three hours of your time to really raise that financial IQ and start getting better and returns on your investments now

Howard trading radio now back to the show [noise]\nIf you're just tuning in you miss Larry Jacobs director of instructor development and haven't structure it online trading really shed some light on multiple streams of in a little bit about half of income we talked a little bit about active income\nAnd then specifically spend a lot of time on that multiple streams of income side of things in the financial freedom that that can really generated I Love the the the the conversation about the the average millionaire having five plus dreams of income\nAnd you can break that down into different directions but but even the whole conversation we're having a few minutes ago leery about about building the skill first the skill comes first the income comes later and so many times we want the income\nWe want the income now without the skill right how many how many times have you talked to a a a surgeon and they said oh you know what I'm going to do a little bit of surgery here I'm In a practice heart surgery so that I can pay for medical school and then develop the skill just doesn't really work that way we've got to have the skill first otherwise that operating table can be dangerous spot to be laying\nNow unfortunately it ends up being that same\nBut that same conversation when it comes to our money and I had somebody say oh well this isn't life or death\nBut really when we're talking about our finances it is our financial life or death so we really want to take this just as seriously we work too hard for this money\nTo have it not heading in the right direction on a consistent basis and this retirement money that we want to talk about in this segment is exactly that it's in a situation where we're usually just buying every other friday\nRight just because it's paid and we've been told every other friday we're just supposed to put some money in our retirement accounts\nAnd it will just slowly growing and well that's true in a polish marketing it bearish market which was what you were just touching on his right as we are going to break that kind of detrimental side of things we can continue to buy into assets that are deteriorating and it's a lot like lighting our retirement accounts on fire or at least a little portion of our paycheck\nWhen we're throwing it into a deteriorating asset so just a few of the things that we want to want to keep in mind and one of the things I really love to have you Larry shed some light on in here because we do have a lot of our students\nWho are really out there trading they do have their retirement accounts and and when I talked to her students I'm hearing a lot of people say you know number one they either don't have enough money to retire on you know we're number to those that do they're not quite sure really how to continue the growth\nAnd to protect the downside right and that's really that point you were getting at a before we took the break and so I'd love to give you kind of give you the floor here to take that back over border some of the things you and your instructor team are doing with investors to help make sure they have income for retirement\nRight and the number one mistake that most people may cause they think they can do this on their own then they wind up coming back and realizing they need the education so we start talking to our students about is how they can start creating a strategy for success when it comes to the retirement\nRight now you know it's funny when the market started to go down this week a lot of my friends call me and they started going what does this mean they started getting all nervous now one student emailed me and said Larry do you see this is a bad thing in fact\nMost people who know what they're doing they're elated that this is starting to happen most people waiting ten years for another market correction why because\nHistorically the markets always tend to correct about every ten years or so last major when we had was obviously in two thousand eight here we are in two thousand Eighteen so what's now becoming more important than ever is it took people about six years to recover from the last correction\nPeople out there listening if you don't have six years right now or you're planning to retire\nYou don't have anything saved right now you need to figure out how to create a plan to help protect you and a lot of our students come in the door\nReally nervous about I don't have enough money to start well you know what they're doing right it's pretty fascinating they're starting to learn how to trade other asset types like futures in St Louis and they're saving that money from trading and they're starting to fund their retirement accounts\nSo again a lot of people first thing they always say is like the mortgage I got the kids' college ...\nTheir retirement always comes last so we start to teach her students read out of the gate\nThat they can come up with a plan they understand most importantly what you need is because a lot of people the one size fits all does not work when it comes to retirement\nYou can't just do this you first have to figure out what your needs are learn how to manage that need most importantly how to learn some really important risk management how to protect that money\nAnd then at the end of the day you'll have enough to retire on based on what you need not someone else who's telling you what you need\nAnd you're talking about the kind of the cycles that the markets go through the big us in the big downs and we do generally have a crash about every and we call them crashes but we do generally have a nice big drop in the markets about every ten years\nAnd one of the things about that as you go back and look at um how often they're forty fifty sixty percent drops and so kind of that average uh that we can expect is about a fifty percent if you go back into two thousand and eight and you\nKind of measure that you've got about a fifty percent drop Becky fifty eight percent about fifty eight percent you go back into their early two thousand fifty say the same thing and so if we come to here and we say okay here's your that's kind of what we can expect again that's kind of the new normal\nBut the thing that I went through with my father about ah we we had a conversation about this you know back in about two thousand and eight\nOr you know we're talking about drops in the market we're talking about drops and accounts and and one of the things that we're we're kind of walking through was\nIf somebody had a fifty dollar if somebody had a hundred thousand dollar account\nAnd they lost fifty thousand in the last fifty percent will they lost fifty thousand so now they're account value of that fifty thousand that happened in one year here that drop happened I think it was fourteen months total rights that happened in pretty much just a year it went down when they take the average rate of return on the way up and let's just be very very generous let's say somebody is averaging ten percent on the Web\nThat ten years just to get back to break even 'cause when you take a hundred and you turn it into fifty\nTo take fifty and turn it into a one hundred requires a one hundred percent return on our money and so one of the conversation we were talking about was how long does it take the average person to really even get back to break even after going through a big catastrophic drop like that\nSo one of the scariest things right now is that people just don't have a plan that don't know what to do they haven't been educated and so unless you're really sitting there thinking about this and say to yourself\nFool me once shame on you fool me twice shame on me and\nAlbert Einstein had one of the greatest quotes was the definition of insanity is doing the same thing over and over again it's amazing how many people are not willing to spend a little bit of money to get themselves educated to invest in themselves", "year": "2018",
