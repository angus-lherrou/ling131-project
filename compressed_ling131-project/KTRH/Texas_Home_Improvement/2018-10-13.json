Louis is eleven bucks\nAnd the cruise used to go on that was three thousand dollars is thirty five hundred you're buying power is going down your overall amount of money is not\nBut this is monetary policy one on one since everybody else has more buying power as everybody else is making more money you only have a hundred seats on the cruise\nThey're selling out every cruise doesn't take long 'til they start increasing the Christ the prices on the on the cruise\nAs they increase the price on the cruise you say wait a minute I used to take this crews were three thousand yeah well we're not offering into three thousand more we can get thirty one hundred and four\nAnd then once it sells out at thirty one hundred and goes up to thirty two and thirty three and thirty four thirty five before you know what your three thousand dollars doesn't go as far as it used to\nAnd you start seeing that in everything you do folks start seeing the price of things going up but they're not seeing a corresponding increase in income because they're not in the market anymore\nThey're not they're not in the game but\nThey're seeing the cost of being around the game going up\nAnd so the fed looks at things like that and they start wanting to pump the brakes and when they pump the brakes in an economy that is based on growth that tends to have\nMore than just say All right we were doing Seventy five now with two Seventy it tends to have a reverse ripple effect\nFor all the confidence so much of our economy is built on the confidence of if it's at ten bucks today it will be Fifteen tomorrow in twenty the next\n... now the fears start creeping in and then people start acting on those fears they start selling what they have as they sell and dump that means that the price starts coming back now\nAnd our economy is in order to understand our economy you have to watch it in terms of trends\nNow instead of seeing that steady consistent price increase you see a price decrease and with the the falling market today you see that or you'll see that some people are going to get scared they're going to dump\nThey're going to get rid of it ... the end is coming there's been a lot of it ... a\nRon Paul\nThat earlier in the week and he was saying late last week that we're due for\nLetting some air out of this economy it's it's overheated right now and I'm ... I think what you're watching is a lot of folks acting on the fears that we've had a lot of growth\nConsistently over a period of time\nI don't like to see this right before an election because it makes people think things are going wrong when they're not necessarily\nI don't like the term market correction and a lot of people don't because that suggest that there is a point at which we're supposed to be\nAnd if we get above that you have to come back to that so I don't use the term market correction because I don't think it's necessarily accurate you'd have to know what the proper market level is to say that this is a correction rather than simply\nA decrease\nBut I Will say I'm President Trump's administration has ushered in incredible wealth accumulation and no not just for rich people it has ushered in incredible wealth creation\nFor working class people for entrepreneurs for a lot of Americans across the board and you would think if people were voting they're back pocket which in Nineteen Ninety to\nJames carnivals message for Bill Clinton supporters are for for middle Americans\nWas it's the economy stupid wasn't the worst economy but they convinced people that was now how how in the world is he going to fix the economy what exactly was he going to do to make the economy any better for anyone else\nHe talked about the fact that people weren't making 'em up enough at their job the president doesn't affect the\nThe president the best thing the president can do is get out of the process\nAnd let companies succeed and then they'll have more money you know they have more money to recruit people from companies to come to work for them and as they recruit\nOne guy away the next guy gets recruited by the company that the job that he ...\nAnd that that creates an increase in wages [noise] but we shall see Trump should be a lot more popular than he is given this economy [noise]\nThe Michael very shoulder to use [noise]\nNews radio seven forty Katie our age\nFor news radio seven forty Katie our age I'm Sally Adams our top story she said yes and here's the latest about the Brett Kavanaugh hearing from ABC News\nAnd Leno grow I always said that's not true because she didn't cook dinner for us um but I I find it ironic that Leno growing his wife was the first woman to clerk for the Supreme Court\nAnd Leno grow your himself was nominated at the same time that Antonin Scalia was nominated to the Supreme Court\nIn eighty six eighty seven\n[noise] um ... was the first professor what was the first nominee\nThat the A. B. A. the first nominee a BA issued a\nNon approval for the abs doesn't get a vote as to whether somebody gets to be a Supreme Court nominee or not but the ... the American bar association ... will will ... has historically a done their own review and asked some lawyers and they'll say yes dispersed will make a great judge\nThe very first time that they did not do that was in the case of ... billion and they did not like his conservative\nWell you may know that the a BA came out against Brett Kavanaugh as well [noise]\nIt's very important to do the autopsy on what happened to deconstruct what happened over the last month because it happened so fast that it's easy to forget all the things that the left pulled\nFirst of all ah and and and what we're not talking about things we forget the league of women voters came out against Brett Kavanaugh\nI've got to tell you the league of women voters reaches out to me every year\nOr has in the past asking if we will promote their voters guys and promote people voting and informed I Will never ever knew a single thing for the league of women voters ever again number one\nAnd number two I Hope that they lose their nonprofits uh status\nTheir charter requires that they not get involved with politics that they not get involved on a side they're supposed to be\nIn favor of voter registration but they are left leaning organization and coming out against a candidate coming out against the nominee like this first of all the fact that they even took a side no matter what the side is\nIs offensive but even more offensive is the fact that they joined in as if Brett Kavanaugh is some rapist and I got to tell you something\nYou don't just get to call somebody a rapist and then when you lose the vote we all go are are different directions by the way ms forward the original accuser\nHer lawyer who was a handed to her by Dianne Feinstein we still don't know who's paying them they've decided that they're going to drop the matter they don't they don't want to uh ... they don't want to bother with it anymore\nI asked Sandy Peterson our research director I said could you just make a list of some of the topics that we discussed over the last month\nBecause you'll remember the left was coming at us fast and furious they were they were making a different claim per day do you remember when the hearing started judge Kavanaugh's law clerk was\nSitting over his shoulder sitting beside ... behind him and she was holding her hand on her on the uh the bend in her elbow\nAnd she had her three fingers her middle finger her ring finger in her pinky out the kind of grasping the elbow itself\nThe index finger was in the Wii of her arm and the thumb was resting on top of the forearm along with the index finger and it was kind of class being there so that she could put those two together maybe apply pressure low low relief that she probably didn't even know\nShe was doing they saw that video that picture and the left made that out that she was flashing a white power symbol on national TV\n[noise] that was a dog whistle to the white power community you remember that that poor woman was caught up in all of that nonsense\nThat's where we started before they started the rape accusations and all and I just want to go through a few things that they pulled to kind of reminds you of what they did [noise]\nThis is Michael Bay show\n\n\n\nWrote a good piece in the federalist headlined what does it mean to take the gloves off when\nThe left is already screaming at people in public and\nDucks ing them and staking out their homes what does it look like for them to fight all the harder\nThis is in reference to the fact\nSeveral liberal left the commentators over the weekend declared that having lost the ... the the Kavanaugh battle\nDemocrats and the left rather than learning their lesson rather than respecting the institutions and allowing them to work made references to taking the gloves off\nRuthless that they need to be more ruthless was a word that was used several times\nSo Ben's piece goes there is a dangerous an irresponsible strain of opinion telling the Democrat Party today that when they lose it's because they are fighting hard enough\nHere's one outline of the of this opinion from political editor John Harris and ... there's a link to it so I won't be able to read it to you know here's another way of state in the opinion from a writer at wired the the Cisco something like this the left test total dominance of the culture\nIn total dominance of the popular vote so the answer to why they lose not infrequently is that the system is rigged against them and they must fight all the harder and take the gloves off\nOr something like that to achieve their ends the gloves have been off for a very long time in American politics\nHow quickly we forget the attempted murder of multiple Republican politicians including Steve ... who may never walk normally again\nJust this past week we saw Democrats staffer who ducks to multiple Republican senators on the ... on the Judiciary Committee indicted facing nearly fifty years in federal prison for his crimes\nWe saw Cory Gardner revealing his wife had received graphic text of a beheading\nAfter his vote for Kevin ... along with their home address on the text that to let you know they know where you live\nAnd in Washington we saw even more and this is not new of course it stretches back a long time the gloves were off for the American left in the late sixties when campus an activist violence became normalized\nThere were off in the seventies when the outgrowth of that spirit a protest led to the sequence of weathermen bombings that Chris across the nation\nPolitically the gloves were off during Robert Bork and judicial filibusters and extreme procedural measures to pass Obamacare and the pen and phone mode of governance that came after under Obama\nAnd of course they were off as a matter of communication to Democrats turned a nice fellow like Mitt Romney into a scheming massaging is who wanted poor people to die from cancer and never paid his taxes\nHarry Reid's reaction when confronted with lying about that point which the media had covered excessively was quote Romney didn't land daddy were the gloves on then\nSo when are you already so when you are already screaming at people in public and doc seeing them in staking out their homes what is taking the gloves off me\nAnd what do you ever realized that this tactic of charging full speed at the doors of the Supreme Court and beating at it with your fist really really doesn't work because it won't no matter how well organized\nIt is\nAs for the systemic bias point more on that as it relates to article five and the disturbing turned against the existence of the Senate as we know it tomorrow because I suspect that sweat taking the gloves off really means\n[noise] should we pretend this hasn't happened before I give you the answer from Harry Reid to the question quote aren't you worried Republicans will get rid of the filibuster on the Supreme Court\nAnd so if he's feeling an urge he's more likely to act on it without fear of rejection\nOr he's less likely are willing to take no for an answer but it also releases reduces the inhibitions of the woman as well\nAnd I think that there are probably some cases where women the next day say I didn't really like him I Wish I hadn't done that\nI Wish I had a wish I hadn't engaged in that activity or I Wish I had an allow him to do what he did\nAnd I think that what happens in these situations sometimes is there is a sense of regret there's a sense of regret over having consented\nAt least not rejected or objected\nA woman can consent or a woman can not reject but not consent and that could be perceived right\nBut the bigger issue is this there's no way to say that every awkward sexual encounter is sexual assault there is no way to say that what happened to you even if it was true and awful\nIs what happened to this woman who claims that happened\nAnd that's the bigger issue we struggle with here in much the same way that when we try to talk about race\nThere is a continuum but there is one extreme of people who are physically harmed by someone because of their race all the way to the other extreme of someone who claimed racism\nOnly because they want to win a lawsuit or they want to get back at someone or they want to make up but they want to create a distraction from what's happened they want to get their job back that they were fired from\nYou simply can't say that just because this happened to me that's where [noise]\nAnyway that's been on my mind I don't know if we added anything to it but let's move on and then I got a lot of your listening do Michael shell\n\nThere's good lottery News I'm Sally Adams on news radio seven forty T.

I wanted to make a good impression and so you know I scurried around do you think that the house at night instructed David to scurry around and do a few things inside as bubbles that we could make a good impression [laughter]\nAnd I'm not here came in he and I didn't know it at the time but he he's a very humble man\nAnd so he walked in ... we had a living room dining room combination and that's how we were able to how the multiple bubble plus it's huge play room that NASA has designed for David and I'm sure Dr share walked a quietly into um the area where David wife and I followed\nAnd I introduce Dr share to David and David looked at him I'm not sure what if you're looking at any photos and rainy photos\nYear ... you can you tell me which one it was on\nThe CBS did a forty years retrospective and there's a picture of Dr Shearer with he's up against the the isolate are they looking for to teach the doctors would kind of looking loving with him\nYes they're ... it's my favorite picture it's a profile picture of both of them and yet Dr share has his hand\nHe reached up and and and Christian band against the bubble and instinctively David metrics hands so for a few seconds that was their first contact and the other hand the David I might add what's on his ...\nIt was almost as he was you know a interviewing doctors share [laughter] but um they had a wonderful relationship and I have to say you know\nThat doctors shares passing out you know I was at a a great loss and I only have a family\nBut for the entire primary Indian community\nHe um he learned a lot from everything that you know there was no protocol to follow\nA there was no books too you know to reach you understand how science handled the last bubble boy David Was at first and only\nSo you know there are many things that he had to decide in advance of the next step that David Was coming at you and all of his decisions were correct and I know he he didn't make them alone I Know he um you know inquired from other position\nAnd it's like a dentist you know and education and uh you know went to enlarge the bubble because the you know the high which only so that was David\nThe Bible had to grow enticed in waves and numbers\nYou've lived it but it's overwhelming as a father to an ... year old and a twelve year old right it is overwhelming\nYes I'm to imagine the life you lived in\nWith your first son with yeah with your first David and then and then this David and [noise] you know I was I was just imagining you know you kinda made reference to when I when my kids are sick or sometimes\nTo remember in retrospect\nIs how important it was not that she hit a home run but that she not strike out she did not end up making miss for necessarily more likeable\nShe presented at good counterpoint I mean the strategy for all the criticism of the strategy we did get Kevin off for [noise]\nDang it Ramon I wasn't even through with Arizona I still got to get\nTo Tennessee in Nevada [noise] time got away from me All right I'll move fast [noise]\n\nYou've got Michael berry show [noise]\n[noise]\n[noise] screaming through the valley where of the nation above and below through the mud drugstore unveils where the merits you wanna grow the railroad tracks Persians down hills enough ...

you're just blowing up his life and it's I don't lie under\nMy apple or really transcends politics\nI think that's true I think that's that's absolutely true her husband I'm James Carville\nBefore Donald Trump when when Ted Cruz first went in the Senate when Ted Cruz shut down the government fighting against Obamacare James Carville had this to say about him\nI think is the most talented himself Republican politicians I've seen in the last Thirty years after the fact that he's going to run for president and he is going to create something I'm not saying is that he's got to win and I think that matters right I\nListen to excerpts of the states and South Carolina he touches every button and this guy has no fear\nIn just since ... and he is going to be something to watching and a lot of Republicans feel this way going and you hear this a lot if we only got someone who was our ... and was for what we will fall we went elections and we get these John McCain's nice Mitt Romney's and these guys in handyman thing well the one thing this guy's not his way\nAnd that's true one thing Romney is he is squishy and McCain was ... and that's why they lost to Obama and I said this morning I'll say it again\nWhat Donald Trump has taught Republicans to do is to fight what he's taught them to do is to play to win\nDon't just show up and keep your uniform clean don't be proud of what a nice team picture you can take after the game because you have no dirt on your leg ins because you look like you didn't you\nNever slid into the base leave it all on the field what Trump has talked Republicans to do is what the left has been doing for a long time and that is played a win win\nThere was a moment when Kavanaugh look like his candidacy his nomination was in peril\nIt looked like it would just be easier for him to step back and there were a number of folks Bill Kristol editor of the Weekly Standard there were a lot of those folks a lot of the Georgetown salon Republicans who said\nThis just pulled his back is it that this has gotten to ugly there's got to admit to nasty\nAnd I'm a it let's just let's just pull this thing back\nWe don't we don't need to ah we don't need to win this\nUh this much it's a ... it's\nBad for the court bad for the Trump presidency is bad for the Republican brand you know I Will say this and it it deserves to be said\nI have\nAn absolutely profound respect\nFor the way that Mitch McConnell handled this process\nI have an in during ... marine amount\nOf respect for the way Mitch McConnell handled this process but I Will tell you\nIt required that he and Lindsey Graham and Ted Cruz stay the course\nBut the left so miss played their hand I remember when the ... uh Julie sweat the\nDetails lurid details came out\nAnd people that are normally pretty resolute said to me is just too much there's too many that to me this is the third person coming out against him now this is bad and these are really bad I said what is it these are so bad as to stretch credibility I don't believe these are true\nAnd now the Democrats are blaming ... they're blaming the fact that ... at that point his details were so over the top so ridiculous that it became clear\nOh no they're now that they're just absolutely making stuff up and not even trying to cover it we may have if they might be able to go out and find fifty more women and then of course miss sweat Nick\nAnd her her whole life story started getting out there and her ex boyfriend and and the threat she made against him and then her employer and and the thing she did there and then she had her own problems and remember we never heard from Mr Mir as again either [noise]\nThose were the things what's going to be fascinating what I Hope will be the case is that Republicans will remember what happened and not soon\nForget 'cause we're twenty nine days from the mid term [noise]\n\n\n[noise] I orange radio is the easy to use that for music and radio download the free I arch radiolab today\nFace to begins tonight I'm Sally Adams on news radio seven forty Katie our age and traffic to Ninety gets closed eastbound it hurts my sister and west bound west wrote text out is doing bridge work and here's the weather with Jeff Maher\nBrett Kavanaugh to be an associate justice to the Supreme Court at the White House and of course that Hillary still wishes she was president and so his response I thought was priceless\nWhat's your response saying where\nI guess that's where she lost [noise] she doesn't get it [noise] she never did I knew that a long time ago\n[laughter]\nAnd that was probably the most ... reported statement of the press conference and so with less than a month to go before the midterms President Trump owned the media cycle Hillary Clinton\nIn an interview made some statements that are not being received very well\nYour cannot be hitting all with a political party that wants to destroy\nWhat you found for what you care about that is why I Believe if we are fortunate enough to win back\nHouse ... that's when ... he can start down but until then the only thing that the Republican whom to\nRecognize and respect its strength and you heard how the Republican numbers led by Mitch McConnell\nWill get back to Hillary Clinton's comments in the next segment because they could not be better timed\nI think that that just that it's just one more element that will fire up the base as we go into the election season today is the last day in the state of Texas to have registered on is to have registered to vote in the mid term elections\nTexas does not have a an online registration that's available now is also the last day to register in Georgia Kentucky and Tennessee for those of you in Louisiana\nYour last day to register in person was today but you can register online for one more week until the sixteenth in New York you can register up to twenty five days before the election which is October twelve\nUm but it must be ... you can also register by mail but it must be received\nBy October seventeenth in Alabama the rule is Fifteen days before the vote and so you can register up till October twenty second that is also the case in California\nAnd through our Oregon affiliate uh by the way Oregon and Louisiana or a through October sixteenth so one more week\nAnd for our listeners to K. E. X. eleven Ninety out of Portland, Oregon who live in Washington state your last day to register was yesterday your rule is twenty two days\nBefore the election but you can vote in person until October twenty night I'm not actually sure how that works\nUm I was going through in looking at the various dates of registration and I saw that\nSold for our state of Washington residents\nI'm because that is unclear to me if you are not yet registered or your registration may have lapsed checked that on line there will be resources to each of you depending on your states um\nStarts to scare people the cost of borrowing money which means the cost of research and development\nThe cost of opening new locations the cost of investing in capital those sorts of things increase which slows that economic activity now for some reason\nAmericans have not been as willing to reward Trump for the economy that he ushered in as they should be\nI think that's probably partly due to this very divisive media strategy I think it's it's partly due to a very aggressive ah anti Trump movement and so he's not getting the bump that I think you you probably should have\nExpected him to get I mean look we're seeing historic numbers\nUnemployment claims down first time unemployment claims down which means layoffs or reduce the number of people are seeking work they can't find it or or down expansion in in the job force the stock market hitting historic highs\nI think the stock market has now hit a hundred highs record highs during his presidency\nNow think about that that's like hitting a a a four hundred foot homerun or five hundred foot home run it's not just that you hit a home run the next day in order to out do that you got to hit five oh five and then five ten and then five Fifteen and this economy has done that\nSo people have had this overnight increase in in wealth\nAnd that is due to a stock market that's up that I think reflects a lot of aspects that Trump is responsible for a president can never claim all the success or failure of the stock market during their presidency there's no doubt\nAnd when you factor in futures and and the bonds and and a monetary policy there's a lot that goes into it but you cannot underestimate what happened just as we went into Christmas as this Republican or a Congress\nEnacted those tax cuts and the beauty was I loved that they did it\nThe only thing I hate is that they didn't do it closer to an election because Americans tend to forget they tend to forget how bad Obama was they tend to forget how good things were immediately after that the best\nAspect of that was that they saw an immediate results they saw in their next paycheck or in some cases two paychecks later people could see I've got more money in my paycheck without my company given me a pay raise\nPeople that actually look at what gets deposited her that look at their paychecks saw an immediate results\nFor one of the few times what Congress did what the president did that policy brought them an overnight change in their lives\nAnd there was no way around that the left couldn't say that it didn't because people could see the money themselves they could see it in their account\nAnd that was the moment if you'll remember polo seeing Schumer they had to discount it they had to in some way say that it wasn't a good thing to remember what happened to remember what they said they said those are just crumbs\nCrumbs a thousand two thousand dollars for a working family those are not crumbs that's real money that's a significant amount of money to working class Americans it is I don't know anybody to turn it down but but that that is a significant amount of money to families\nAnd and you saw that overnight but\nThen when you compounded that with the fact that a lot of companies immediately ran their tables and they said based on these projections we're going to slough off X amount of profitability billions of dollars\nWe're going to immediately give our employees a thousand Fifteen hundred two thousand dollar\nOne time bonus\nPeople feel that so now you've compounded the the the the lower taxes\nWhich you see in fifty sixty a hundred dollars per paycheck plus your company gives you a thousands of two\nThousand but if that had happened right before the election like right now [noise] people would be saying well I don't know what they say they're still not gonna give Trump credit and\nLed to the library of everyone listens Michael very show\n\nWell why we've been hearing about moving the devil's triangle the congressional investigation into the whole\nTrump Russia thing still been going on\nIt seems though that some of the Democrats doing the investigation have outsourced those responsibilities to a former Senate staffer with links to George Soros and fusion GPS\nOur friends at the Daily Caller I have gotten very thorough in their investigations of fusion GPS Christopher Steele the former British spy\nAnd the roads gallery of assorted hangers on that they seemed to boast the New Yorker reports that some identified sorry some other than a fad senator\nHired a man named Doug Jones a ... not the senator from Alabama a former Senate intelligence committee staffer who also worked for Dianne Feinstein\nIn March of two thousand seven team that's when this Doug Jones was hired to review data regarding a possible link between the computer servers of the Trump Organization and a Russian Bank called alpha\nBank when he left the service of the Senate Jones founded a left wing group called the democracy integrity project\nThis group worked closely with fusion GPS and former British spy Christopher Steele the tag team duo that produce the Democrat funded Ducey a accusing the Trump campaign of colluding with the Kremlin\nJones's operation was also funded by a small group of billionaires including left wing philanthropist George Soros\nJones told the ap yeah in March of Seventeen so that's a few months after Trump is warn him\nThat between seven and ten billionaires had put up fifty million dollars five zero to continue an investigation into Russian meddling in elections\nThe goal was to provide information to the press the FBI and the Senate goal in other words was to try to harm the Trump regime\nSo George Soros was putting up some big money to ensure that the Russian collusion story stayed alive or why would he want to do that\nThe alpha bank allegations first saw the light of day\nOctober thirty first two thousand sixteen it's a week before the election\nWhen Franklin for of slate magazine suggested that the communications between a server in Trump Tower and alpha bank was part of a back door communication apparatus to coordinate Russian interference\nIn the article received heavy criticism from cyber security experts and tech reporters who said the server communications appeared to have an innocent explanation such as either spam or mass marketing email traffic\nAccording to the New Yorker a handful of Democrats pursued the alpha bank theory one was Virginia Senator Mark Warner the top Democrat on the Senate intelligence panel\nA second Democrat Senator was also exploring the ankle and approached Jones\nNow Sandy Peterson our research director who's been doing the work researching this story has a theory that this is Dianne Feinstein the other senator which would make her a busy it'll it'll be\nA mind you during this time she had a Chinese spy on her payroll who was driving her around and had been for years\nAccording to the New Yorker Jones the former staffer who also runs a consulting firm called the Penn Quarter group he's a busy little fella too it's it's hard work trying to bring down the president\nSo Mr Jones hired two teams of computer scientists to analyze Web traffic from the alpha bank the Russian Bank and the Trump Organization servers\nThe experts who've held top cyber security jobs in the White House Pentagon and intelligence services were unable to definitively say that the server communications were part of a back channel communications system with the Trump campaign\nBut according to the New Yorker they believe the server communications could still been have been part of a nefarious operation as they a niche initially described in these slate article", "show_name": "Texas Home Improvement", "year":
