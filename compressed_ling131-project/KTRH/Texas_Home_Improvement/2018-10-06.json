H. abusive and I are radio stations everywhere\nYou go today it's all about the Astros I'm Sally Adam's two o'clock on these radio station ...\nWere trafficking whether together here's my thought is a very slow go as you\nTry to travel and I tend to the freeway and down and that is because the construction that has all lanes block between magnolia and Sheldon\nIt's a continuous projects scheduled until five o'clock Monday morning right now we're seeing stopping traffic from Thompson wrote about twenty to twenty five minute delay brand new crash on a fixed in the north will be found before sixty nine these text freeway that\nI Do not have a do it yourself video for that but typically if it's going down real slow like that or it's either going to be in the pie trap which is just right there under that screen\nAnd you can take a a coat hanger pull it apart band just a little hook and\nFishing down through there and start hooking all the hair and gunk and all that stuff that's built up on their that's usually what causes the problem [noise] um\nSo give that to try and see\nIf you can get it to work that way I'm usually that's all it is and then what I Would recommend\nIs you spray some I'm screaming bubbles down in their lead at work it's magic and if you fit a toothbrush in their clean it out with a toothbrush otherwise\nUh at the a box stores they sell these plastic strips that kind of looked like an upside down Christmas tree it's got these little ... sticking out you can stick it down in there to clean stuff out and\nThat will usually get it going and also you when you spray describing bubble in there it kind of access scrub brush to clean it out in there and gets it all flowing for you again so hopefully that will take care of the problem for you uh you know it's one of those things that\nUnfortunately it builds up\nTime or it starts getting slower and slower and everybody wants to just try to dump a chemical down in there to get it going [noise] and it just doesn't work\nChemicals all they do is start burning pipes and stuff like that if it's not in the pie trap where that doesn't get it going well then what I Would recommend is you take the tub overflow off\nAnd end up running a snake unless you can get the bottom done but that's what the overflow is actually for so hopefully that will help you out and get that going for you [noise]\nAgain he got a question seven one three two one two five eight seven four we're going to head the deer park and Paul welcome to Texas on broom and how can I help you\nAre you sir I'm\nReally room at shuttle lights richer there's low outliving metropolis shaving\nAnd it's a house where he bought about seven years ago and I've checked every our living room there's nothing but it attracts Shuster how would I go about finding out I think it's been covered up by the sheet rock and how would I go about finding out how to find that a\nChart wires ... has heart or the the switches hawk gummy bears ears\nYou know older homes a lot of times they had an in an outlet like you were checking 'em but did you check both top and bottom on the plugs\n[noise] yeah sure\nOkay and the reason I asked that I I have found it in some cases where they would tie power from the switch to just half of the outlet and then the other half would stay on all the time so you have to check both top and bottom\n... if if your tracing down the wire they do make tracer is that you can hook up around the wire where it's coming out and literally use of want to follow where the wire goes\nAli typically it's going to be an electrician that's going to have to do that 'cause to to buy that equipment for one time use just wouldn't make sense\nRight I've heard of like turning it out or during the ... for the phone company ... years ago and we did things like that but I had to have a commission wherever the trapped in other words the large couldn't just be open\nWell you'd you'd have to be if you can open up the\nEnd where the switches you could actually hung onto the while you're there and be able to follow it and you're you're Donald you thought you had to have a closed loop port\nYes sir yes but if it's if it's hooked up anywhere you should be able to trace it that way I'm at the very least the ground probably is\nCan I ask one other lately okay I'm In the kitchen [laughter] or whenever you go to use these little sprayer uh-huh\nI'm it those are on a ... wants to switch back and forth between the actual a faucet and whatever it takes a little while and middle ... it sounds almost like a water hammer yep but what's what's usually the cause of that\nThey're a tip a when you squeeze the trigger on these sprayer there is a\n\nEasy terms to use it as there's basically a flapper that moves to divert water\nOkay and so when you let the trigger off the flapper moves back if it doesn't get used very often you know it can start building up deposits on it where it doesn't work properly and it sounds like yours is sticking a little bit to where it's taking some pretty good pressure before it slips over okay\nOr is there and all you can do and what you're hearing is literally a water hammer ... because when the slap slap or moves and and I know that's not the right term but when the flapper moves a it is slamming the water\nOK okay is there a way to replace shattered to you or\nA ship it fully my experience has been you just replace the faucet now there may be something different to it but I've never I've never bother checking into it when I run into stuff like that I just replace the faucet\nOkay All right thank you very much been very helpful\nYou bet take care Bye bye and again seven one three two one two five eight seven four let's head to Texas City Hello John\nJim how are you

times and I'm thinking that it's got something to do with that but I just wanted to ask you if it is coming in between a shingles director why is that I hear a lot of people saying insurance got laid off\nCover that roof because it's not a single ... ripped off or corn off of it so they don't want to consider that as needing to replace\nThe route because there is a minimum pitch shingles they're supposed to be put on you don't meet that minimum pitch it means the contractor did it wrong any insurance doesn't cover stuff that was done wrong to begin with [noise]\nWell how do they they came out

happening\nWell caffeine is if you got concrete did you want it's too low or you don't like the surface of it or something like that you can pour another layer of concrete as long as it's at least two inches thick on top of it\nI said okay well I actually we had a neighbor that had a a patio much ... than ... now I really don't know if they had tears under or not but they tend to lean\nOn a concrete I guess they have to do that\nFor shots thinking we'd have to do that yeah\nThey call it with a kind of a robbery\nYeah and it was called or do you can pick up color you know and that would be suitable wouldn't it\nYeah that's just a floor finishing yeah it does that does very well nice to walk onto\nThat yes it sounds like it uh the only problem I have is uh\nThe the patio concrete is at least four inches lower than a half lab what would I Do to um\nKeep the water from getting in there\nWell see that's where the caffeine comes and you've got four inches were you know 'cause it's lower than the house labs so you could fill it with four inches of concrete and then have that rubber floor on top of it\nAll by if I don't have the peers I find I couldn't do that\nI I'm not sure why you why you would need peers um when I was talking about and I think I remember your call if I remember right\nYou were asking about taking the patio and turning it into a room and what I said was you can't do that with a patio because if it ever moves you cannot put appears in it to level it\nIt wasn't designed to have a room on it a concrete ... is designed to have a room on it [noise]\nAh the
