E. N. S.\nAnd you know hams is basically covers I mean what what does that not cover health education maintenance what sport is pretty much everything right so\nIt is a very powerful document I think it's one that uh anyone who has let's say over a million dollars in assets\nThat they want to leave behind do they're greedy and watched undeserving air should be thinking about but even if you have less than that it might be of interest to you if they're real estate or something like that so talk to your ah financial people talk to your attorneys before you do any of this stuff but I think it's something for you to consider\n\nWell Dorothy I've got something else that's two wonderful to be true and that is that if anyone listening to the show right now would like to talk to on a farm or financial advisors about their estate planning their retirement planning then you know what go to our website at his money matters dot net\nAnd on that website you'll have a link there and you can click on it which says I Want to sign up for the next seminar and you can do that and when you're there\nDorothy guess what people will get they will get are now world famous oatmeal raisin and chocolate chunks cookies\nAnd folks did you notice I said chocolate chunks I did not say chip you don't want chocolate chip tips made with paraffin they form and they formed the chocolate with wax it's gross you weren't real chocolate chocolate chunks\nYou want chocolate that melts all over your face gets on your clothes on your notes and everybody's looking at you like what the heck's wrong with you don't you know how to eat a cookie and you're like no or do because I Love chocolate trunk\nAnd while you're at it you're learning about your finances men to deal you can find nowhere else to go to our website money matters a net now on the off chance that maybe cookies or not what you want to go to us that are for although I Would highly recommend it or at the semi we could talk about three of the worst enemies you have to your financial well being talked about inflation going to talk about income taxes\nBear markets we'll also talk about how to calculate your magic number which is a if you have enough money to retire on we're going to talk about your cash flow and maximizing cash flow junior retirement we'll talk about what you should be doing with your ...\nKay right now we'll talk about when you should take Social Security when you're sixty two sixty six when you're Seventy we're going to talk about the fact that the IRS [noise]\nYeah those guys they want to tax eighty five percent of your Social Security benefits and we know show you how to beat that if it's at all possible we have so much information at the center I Can't even tell you all about it right now but go to our website money matters dot net sign up for the seminar and we'll look forward to seeing you there you know what I can not believe how fast\nThe show has gone it's over already I Hope you guys enjoyed it as much as I enjoy doing it for you will see you next week same time same channel by by everybody [noise]\n[noise] [noise] [noise]\nInformation presented should not be regarded as a complete analysis on the subject to discuss and not be construed as an offer to buy or sell any of the security is mentioned none of the show's content viewed as personalized investment by a professional advisor Cindy consulted been more implementing any of the strategies presented\nNumerous times other methods involve varying degrees of rent and therefore can be no insurance any specific investment strategy will be suitable profitable for a client for Mali tax\nPlanning information offered on this program is general in nature always insolvent attorney or tax professional regarding years the legal more taxes\n... founded ... should not be construed as\nAn endorsement of ... or ...

H. trafficking whether together here's the thing I\nGet asked it in on the freeway South Bend in ... and we've got an accident or watch out for this is causing some shopping at a traffic from the woodland park Wayne it's going to be adding about five to ten minutes to your commute forget we do have to pay ... repaired going on in the south and we can to what you found at\nExactly well in just I always say you know heat kills motors it's hard on equipment so if you're if you're an engineer I Love them engineers and stuff called and they understand that the more the heat are surrounding a motor or the hotter the berries get that kind of thing the less life you're going to get out of those components\nWhen you can lower temperatures your air conditioning system actually will actually last longer exists for one thing that's running less so if it's run at twenty percent less that's like running your car twenty percent less miles as you're going to get more out of it\nBut then you're also going to get the heat load down so when you have let's see the the the motors and capacitors and stuff are going to be less likely to actually just had a great or break down overtime so that's why you take care of the addict\nLet alone I mean we're talking about comfort that's the main reason people really do it and it gets to keep the house\nComfortable but also help lower the energy bills those two things kind of go together as some people call I Want to lower my energy bills for all we can do that when we can add insulation maybe we'll look at the ventilation but we're also going to make the house more comfortable at the same time they go hand in hand we can't we can't do one without the other they go together\nSure comfort is so important here in Houston, Texas um we have a lot of humidity here and one of the comforts that we're looking for is less humidity cooler temperatures in the house does having proper insulation in ventilation in your attic help with humidity [noise]\nYes so the editor temperature is is kind of critical for the humidity because I'm the hotter the ... the addict is and then you have the cold air going through your duct work there so you have a bigger temperature differential ... the bigger the differential is the more conversation can be had in the in the duct work and things will start sweating and and really causing a problem\nYou want the temperature to be as close to the inside temperature of the houses you can't but we try to do is get within ten to Fifteen degrees of the ambient temperature so if it's a hundred degrees outside\nWe don't want the temperature being all say over a hundred and ten hundred and Fifteen degrees if it is hotter than that that will look at doing solar ventilation may be some soft investigate air into the addict or we have to get the temperature down\nAnd there's different ways to do that and that would come out with an addict analysis will come on look at the addict\nAnd you don't charge for that do you when you come out you know so that kind of our first stage so people you know listen to the show today you can call 'em will throw it up you know we got some deals on some insulation as well\nBut call us will come out and look at the attic and see what it actually needs 'cause it's it's hard to even just say you know old just in general over well installations what you need well not necessarily people will say American her she was not working anymore ...\nWell that may be the case could be but maybe not so you know what are you gonna do best thing is is have somebody come look at it so call us up we've been doing this for Thirteen Years\nWe know what we're doing and we don't oversell people would just see what they need to come out and we take care of it\nI'm going to give out Tom's numbers to eight one nine three six\nReal five five nine to eight one nine three six zero five five nine Tom is the owner of ... he has actually come out to my home put insulation in put a solar addict fan in and you also put the draft master and that's what you call it don't you\nYeah the ... the ... for the poll downstairs and it just keeps the heat in cold\nIt really works great in the summer and it works just as well in the winter so if your heating the house heat rises so you don't want it that heat to just go right up to that addict or ... votes in insulator that will insulate then it's part of like when we do insulation it's actually insulating the door so it's really part of the insulation package and as he calls today will do will throw one of those in with ... with the purchase of insulation\nAbsolutely fantastic to eight one nine three six zero five five nine on the today show top medic innovations is going to be talking about attic insulation are going to be talking about solar addict fans and radium\nBarrier radiant barrier also is actually good for the winter a lot of people think that must be a summer thing because there isn't that bounce the the sun's energy back out again so we'll be talking about that here on the show before the break\nLet's talk about a deal you brought you always come to the show with a deal because you know that I check approach Joe require it so I hang upside down by his ankles I shake him the problem with that is times a couple of inches taller\nYeah you always begging my head and if you can visualize that's a good time on my ankle and bang bang bang [laughter] okay\nSo uh you bought a deal ordinarily it's a dollar Ninety per square foot for eight inch add a blown in certain seat installation the white stuff right yeah um and and so that's a that's deep eight inches and that's generally what people need to get up to the our values and our ... year\nSo not most houses are going to have five to six inches in there that hasn't been upgraded so will come in and that's what we find that's all you're on that special on eight inches that normally we'll bring you to Thirteen fourteen inches when that'll be a really nice job uh we used at Thirteen insulation doesn't itch it costs a fire rated uh\nIt doesn't absorb moisture mold doesn't grow on it it's a great insulator and we can add that to the existing insulation so you don't have to pull the old inflation out\nNow we do remove all if it's you know something that you've had squirrels and it's nasty\nBut normally we don't need to do that Ninety five percent of the time we're just going to add in solution to what you have\nBut that is something that we do um but we don't encourage that and push that on people some some places will say like every house that they got what we were we pull everything out every town now he's like you're spending your charging their customers so much money you might have been a job that was maybe a Fifteen hundred dollar job and they're like oh we got twelve thousand that John lick\nYou put that customer didn't need that that if you need it you need it but in most cases you know that's crazy we don't operate like that when you're painting a room you don't scrape the paint off you don't ... rocket you did you actually\nYou just go over it too late one nine three six zero five five nine one dollar Ninety cents a square foot for an eighth inch at age fifty percent off today everybody half price only Ninety five cents is that correct\nYou're Ninety five cents a square foot but they didn't shed and there were also thrown into free Sarah Wayne Slater of the draft ... I've got one I Love it yeah and those are normally two Ninety nine installed and she made right here in Colorado, Texas so it's really a nice ... ... people so we kinda use the local you know products and try to support our local community with by doing that and it's a great product\nThat is huge two hundred and nine nine dollar value for the addict stairway until later the draft master I loved that product because I'm ... and we talked about this before time here on the show\nIf you don't have anything on your stairway door and you pull it down for instance and you look up that is just there but when you close it it has put a quarter inch\nApply would there that's less than an arwen value they're very very low our values so you you're going to throw that in for free is if you want a free addicts their way into later in fifty percent off addict insulation\nFrom attic innovations calm out or how many callers today can we can do six six deals today to wait one nine three six zero five five nine if you don't need this now don't clog up the phone lines because we've got people listening who want it [noise]\nCall now six people need to wait one nine three six zero five five nine if you didn't get the number we're going to repeat it during the break in time when we come after the break down would remind me I Will after the break [noise] okay to eight one nine three six zero five five nine six colors only we come back talking more of an addict insulation ready and barrier and solar addict fan [noise]\nHello Hi honey I Love our new home but it didn't work\nProblem just go to check it for a look at what you need a category three qualifies service we qualify chicken projects references on all its members\nOkay let's stay home remodeling refers garage door repair and landscapers I can eat all the companies right from the profile [noise] that must be chapter proud from\nA sea repair to window replacement checkout procedure source for pre qualified service providers\nYou want to win a one hundred dollar Home Depot shopping spree chicken pro draws a lucky winner each month\nTo enter the one hundred dollar Home Depot shopping spree contest just emailed jak approach Joe Joe jak or pro dot com please includes your full name that whole mailing address email checker pro Joe now at Joe at jak abroad job\nThis is the ... radio show or your electric bills too high if you answered yes cold Tom decker from etiquette patients for free at a construction cold time now to a one nine three six zero five five died\nThat Stewart one nine three six zero five five not\nDo you have a question for ... ... email Joe Joe at checkout pro dot com\nHas used to if you own a home you need to check out the check a pro VIP club card from checker productive job\nFor the past twelve years ... has been the choice of your study adds to find a local professionals from DC repair handyman electricians rivers and more and if you become a check or pro VIP club member you'll get the VIP treatment from every check or pro service provider\nWas over one hundred a local pre qualified on service provider serving you a check or pro dot com you have access to Houston's best contractors and you're home improvement project will be their number one priority\nAs a VIP club or you move right to the top of their list and received a VIP treatment you deserve plus club members say twenty five dollars on services provided by ... vendors what'd you show them you're VIP card just go to check a pro dot com to sign up for a limited time your lifetime membership is free that's right free\nAbacus plumbing air conditioner got electrical or paying your lifetime VIP club card membership\nLog on to ... to get your free VIP card now that's jak or pro dot com\nDon't have your new twenty five dollar VIP gift card yet now free at checker pro dot com [noise] ah\n[noise] ah\nThey were back here on the check a radio show they call me check approach Joe [noise] my mommy and daddy ...

friend Tom decker traumatic innovations here on the checker pro radio show I was listening to one of those motivational speakers\nOn you to the other day Tom I Know that you do some of that too oh I get a kick out of those guys yeah yeah they they kind of jazz me up every once in a while when I'm On blue but gets you thinking him and someone was talking about having a purpose\nOkay and my purpose is to serve the homeowner so what I Do every day as I wake up and I say how can I make sure the homeowner finds the best possible contractor so I'm checker pro dot com we've checked their licenses insurance in references all one hundred plus contractors\nAnd is also free for the homeowner and you know I have a number of purposes in life I mean you know I'm a husband and I'm a father and I'm a good citizen not in prison I pay my taxes and so forth\nBut as far as work goes that's my purpose your purpose I think is also helping the homeowner\nI'm you're not out there to steal anything from them you're not out there to put in an extra eight inches of insulation when they don't need it you're not going to cut a hole in the roof and put ten fans in because you have to make a number that month um ... it's actually you're kind of like a doctor I go to the doctor before\nYou diagnose the problem and then you say what do we have to do as far as an operation pacemaker\nShut of ours is [laughter] then and and so then you might recommend\nYou know you need to fans and this is why and you have a rationale for it but um you need eight inches of insulation or maybe you only need six or maybe you need ten and this is why\nI'm you need a radium barrier because you were in the primaries of Katy, Texas and you're getting beaten on in the month of June July and August and um but you must feel good when you leave the house\nAnd you know that you've made it more efficient and you're saving the money\nYeah the nice things too is what we do that it's a lifetime energy savings and comfort so everything that we do is to have some you have to do over and over again so if you do the rainy a barrier that's a one time deal of do solar fans are fans have a lifetime or two so is there anything goes wrong we are going to come replaced the fan\nThe insulation is guaranteed to subtle less than two percent over Twenty years so once you put that on what we do it's a one time deal some people will say well I'm In a remodel my kitchen first I'm like well the ten years that's great but in ten years maybe the kitchen aid remodeled again 'cause it's out of date\nIt goes out of style or insulation in what we do never goes out of style nobody ever says boy you know I Wish my house was less efficient\nBecause they want to know what I'm saying it's like you want to be as efficient as you can be done it you don't ever want to go back once you have an efficient attic you don't want to go back you realize what a difference it's really make because I get calls all the times like what you really think\nYou know if I had eight inches or ten inches of inflation is going to make it a big difference and like we may have you only have two inches of in oh wow is going to be huge now if you already had Fifteen inches of inflation as somebody trying to tell you you need to eat more and then asking you're asking them as they can make a big difference no it's not to make a big difference because you're already you're already there\nBut if if you're low and insulation you bring it up to where it needs to be yeah it is going to make a big difference in the lower temperature it does make a big difference in the house\nLike I said it makes it more comfortable air conditioners going to run less lower energy bills\nThe house can be quieter what's more insulation it's good pizza mine just knowing that everything is the way it's supposed to be I'm kind of into that people say what do you mean peace of mind is like well you just know that it's it's correct you go to sell the house\nYou're not with the doping somebody in in saying well here's the house was great and you know when my gosh the wiring shot the addicts horrible the air conditioners on its last legs you don't want to sell somebody that's something like\nThat it depends on your desperate situation you might need\nI guess maybe rent but see that's why you get stuff taken care of as you go in and do it right like I was in the house yesterday and we were doing a removal and they were so happy and they're like you know what we were just going to add some insulation and there but the old stuff smelled so bad there that are like you know what let's just do it right I see what happens if we come here and put ten inches inflation in here\nAnd it still smells because you didn't pull the old stuff out and we have to take everything back out all that installations junk\nSo you spent all that money and now we're gonna have to go ahead do it right so let's do it right the first time\nIn eighth grade we did the job they were ecstatic I mean so that's that's how we do things and we just won't do it right the first time were very reasonable and we'll make and we always say will make it work so really no no matter what people's budgets are bulwark something it doesn't have to be because we can do it changes we can do insulation out maybe a solar fan later\nUm if you want to do them all together maybe we'll give you a little bit bumbling I'll deal but we try to make things work so that's that's how we do it\nTom and his team will come out for free do a free addict can Alice this here's this number to wait one nine three six zero five five nine\nWait one nine three six zero five five nine\nOnly six people were able to get the addict insulation deal that we talked about earlier in the show when my circle back later and maybe tunnel throw in a few more of those deals but for now that's done but if you're interested in having a free addict analysis and radiant barracks that want to go into that next\nTime has a deal to eight one nine three six zero five five nine radium barrier it's a great product to have\nWhen you don't have protection on your roof if you've a dark roof like I Do\nIt's getting beaten all day long and it is absorbing heat you want that heat to be reflected back out radiant barrier can do that [noise]\nTom brought a deal and I'm going to talk about the deal now than have Tom go into reading a barrier more depth [noise]\nThis is a great deal it's a low two dollars per square foot\nBut Tom is offering fifty percent off and it's only a dollar a foot that's crazy ... square foot\nSo you know I like the map this out for people who have done this before if someone has a two thousand square foot house and it's two stories\nTheir attic is probably a thousand square feet because each floor is about a thousand square feet or so people can you know do the math now they can also go up in the radicals that can measure it for insulation or for radium barrier right now if they wish or you guys will do it for free when you come out\nYeah will measure it because most people have kind of an idea I think it's about twelve hundred feet or or whatever is okay and will measure it and it's like yeah sure enough it's right on that's kind of the normal will just come out with a quick measure make sure everybody's on the same page\nAnd we'll get them the exact price would give them the quote right on the spot", "year": "2018", "show_name": "Texas Home Improvement", "city": "Houston", "day": "14"}
