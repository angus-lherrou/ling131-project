{"month": "10", "state": "TX", "station": "KTRH", "content": "But we also talked about investments we talk about Social Security we talk about income taxes are diversification for one case we talk about the whole ... a whole gamut of stuff right and I hope you benefit from it\n[noise] now this is the probably shall we talk about how to pass onto your greedy and washed undeserving airs the fruits of your labor and normally we do that but this week we're going to talk about a very deserving and very washed and clean\nOr Arab yours and that would be your spouse [laughter] there you go\nAnd so this week I Want to talk with you about a special kind of trust it's called a Q tip trust like the thing sticking your ear and a Q tip stands for qualified terminal interest property but do we call it a Q tip for short and it's basically a trust that is designed to benefit your spouse\nSo if you're married you have a spouse or we'll have a spouse soon then you want to listen up okay but before we do that ... can you play it\nI Know I\n\nWould always say you\nLog in may be and\n\n[noise]\nOf course that is Tony Bennett with rags to riches and we use that because the estate taxes and probate and all that kind of stuff it's actually designed to do the exact opposite\nDesign to take you from riches to rags and we do not want that to happen to you so every week at this time we have our state tip of the week now this week we're going to talk about trust for your spouse now the theme of our show this week\nUm has been our vision one hundred as a firm for money matters and as I mentioned a little bit ago we ... we're not work with a thousand families and the responsibility that comes with that is one that we did not take lightly\nIt's not just taking care of them that is important in guiding them and helping them to have financial security but it's also their families\nAnd one of the things that you know I've often said as you don't want your financial advisory firm to die before you do so we created in our firm called vision one hundred billion one hundred means that a hundred years from now we want money matters to be as strong or stronger than it is today\nNot only fascinating Mr Spock but also very logical and so that's kind of ties in with this segment of the show which is on his state planning and passing on to the next generations and we have a a core value that we live by which is core value number eight which is that everyone deserves love\nAnd what I mean by that is that no matter who you come into contact with including that person to cut you off on the freeway and then flipped you off as they were going by they deserved love you give love always okay\n... if not you don't get love because you think you're going to get it back you give love because it's the right thing to do you give love unconditionally with no expectations coming back at you if you do that I think you'll live a very happy life because then your happiness\nIs not dependent on other people coming back to you and saying I Love you back or doing stuff for you or whatever it doesn't matter you don't need that\nIf you're if you're the giver of love then somehow and you know in in different religions are different names for it but it comes back to you the more love you put out into the universe the more love will come back to you and you don't have to force it you don't have\nTo expect it it will come to you so our core value number eight is everyone deserves love everyone that comes into contact with us as a from as a person in our family everywhere we want to make sure that we give them all to love that we had to get and if we do that they'll be better for it and in in in some magical way so we'll wait\nAnd so estate planning which is the topic of this segment is that so let's talk about someone that I Hope you love a lot which is your spouse okay so the Q tip trust that is a kind of trust that upon your death you leave the money for your spouse in a trust\nNow people tend to freak out about the word trust they don't like that word but you know what trust are are are not black boxes that you put money in cannot come out no in fact it's the opposite the cutest trust is there for your spouse to be able to have access to the ... for whatever they need it for pretty much I mean there are some limitations but not many and\nBut what it does do is to protect them\nFrom if they get divorced if they remarried and get divorced which maybe you don't care much about at this point but could happen or if they get into a lawsuit or if they have a a you know if they if they go bankrupt than all the money that's in the Q tip into trust for them is is protected from all of that\nAnd then you may have a spouse that isn't so good with managing money and you want to have a trustee that helps them with that so that again is the value of the cutest trust\nOkay so think about your spouse protecting the money that you want to have them have for the rest of their lives in the event that you diapers and if you want to put it in trust a Q tip will do that for you okay something for you to think about so this shall we talk a lot about all of our core values I Hope that uh you got some ah some of it if you didn't hear the entire show\nOur website is money matters dot net money matters dot net and you can podcast didn't listen to the whole thing and uh you know I I feel sort of like maybe I surmise today somewhat but uh I Believe in these things and I think if you live your life that way you have success you'll find happiness I

o'clock on news radio seven forty Katie R. H. with traffic and where they're together usually starts [noise] we have a voice of an accident on the freeway\nBut then you're also going to get the heat load down so when you have less heat the heat the motors and capacitors and stuff are going to be less likely dicey disintegrate or break down overtime so that's why you take care of the addict\nLet alone I mean we're talking about comfort and it's the main reason people really do it addict has to keep the house\nComfortable but also help lower the energy bills those two things kind of go together sometimes people will call I Want to lower my energy bills like all we can do that when we can add insulation maybe we'll look at the ventilation but we're also going to make the house more comfortable at the same time they go hand in hand we can't we can't do one without the other they go together\nSure comfort is so important here in Houston, Texas um we have a lot of humidity here and one of the comforts um that we're looking for is less humidity cooler temperatures in the house does having proper insulation in ventilation in your attic\nWith the humidity [noise] yes so the editor temperature is is kind of critical for the humidity\nBecause I'm the hotter the ... the addict is and then you have the cold air going through your duct work there so you have a bigger temperature differential but the bigger that differential is the more conversation can be had in the in the duct work and things will start sweating and and really causing a problem so you want the editor temperature to be as close to the inside temperature of the house that you can't but we tried to do is get it\nWithin ten to Fifteen degrees of the ambient temperature so if it's a hundred degrees outside\nWe don't want the temperature being all say over a hundred and ten hundred and Fifteen degrees if it is hotter than that then we'll look at doing solar ventilation may be some soft investigate air into the addict or we have to get the temperature down\nAnd there's different ways to do that and that would come out and do an addict analysis will come on look at the addict\nAnd you know the argument that do you when you come out you know so that kind of our first stage so people you know listen to the show today you can call 'em will throw it up you know we got some deals on some insulation as well\nBut call us will come out and look at the attic and see what it actually needs 'cause it's it's hard to even just say you know just in general over well installations what you need well not necessarily people will say American her she was not working anymore for ya\nWell that may be the case could be but maybe not so you know what are you gonna do best thing is is have somebody come look at it so call us up we've been doing this for Thirteen Years\nWe know what we're doing and we don't oversell people would just see what they need to come out and we would take care of it\nI'm going to give out Tom's number is to wait one nine three six zero five five nine to eight one nine three six zero five five nine Tom is the owner of ... he has actually come out to my home put insulation in point to a solar addict fan in and you also put the draft master and that's what you\nCall it don't you yeah the ... the ... for the pull downstairs\nAnd it just keeps the heat in cold\nIt really works great in the summer and it works just as well and the winter so if your heating the house heat rises so you don't want it that he could just go right up to that addict or ... votes in insulator that will insulate then it's part of like when we do insulation it's actually inflating the door so it's really part of the insulation package and if it costs today will do will throw one of those in which is what the purchase of insulation\nAbsolutely fantastic to eight one nine three six zero five five nine on today's show top medic innovations is going to be talking about\nAdding insulation are going to be talking about solar addict fans and radium barrier radiant barrier also is actually good for the winter a lot of people think that must be a summer thing because there isn't that bounce the the sun's energy back out again right so we'll be talking about that here on the show before the break\nLet's talk about a deal you brought you always come to the show with a deal because you know that I check approach Joe require it so I hang upside down by his ankles I shake him the problem with that as Tom's a couple inches\nTaller yeah you always begging my head and if you can visualize it so that grants them on my ankle and bang bang [laughter] okay\nSo um you brought a deal ordinarily it's a dollar Ninety per square foot for eight inch ad of blown in certain seat installation the white stuff right yeah um and and so that's a that's deep eight inches and that's generally what people need to get up to the our values and our ...\nYear so not most houses are going to have five to six inches in there that hasn't been upgraded so will come in and that's what we find that's all you're on that special and eight inches that normally we'll bring you to Thirteen fourteen inches when that'll be a really nice job uh we used at Thirteen insulation doesn't itch it costs a fire rated uh\nIt doesn't absorb moisture mold doesn't grow on it it's a great insulator and we can add that to the existing inflation so you don't have to pull the old inflation out\nNow we do remove all if it's you know something that you've had squirrels and it's nasty but normally we don't need to do that Ninety five percent of the time we're just going to add in solution to what you have but that is something that we do\nUm but we don't encourage that and push that on people some some places will say every house that they got what we were we pull everything out every town now he's like you're spending your charging their customers so much money you might have been a job that was maybe a Fifteen hundred dollar job and they're like oh we got twelve thousand are that John like\nHe put that customer didn't need that that if you need it you need it but in most cases you know that's crazy we don't operate like that\nWhen you're painting a room you scrape the paint\nOff you don't ... did you actually\nYou just go over it too late one nine three six zero five five nine one dollar Ninety cents a square foot for an eighty and chat it's fifty percent off today everybody half price only Ninety five cents is that correct\nYou're Ninety five cents a square foot but they didn't shed and there were also thrown into free stairway insulator oh the draft ... I've got one I Love it and those are normally two Ninety nine installed and she made right here in Colorado, Texas so it's really a nice products IPO yet people so we kinda use a local you know products and tried to support our local community with by doing that and it's a great product\nThat is huge two hundred and nine nine dollar value for the addict stairway until later the draft master I loved that product because I'm ... and we talked about this before time here on the show\nIf you don't have anything on your stairway door and you pull it down for instance and you look up that does just there but when you close it it has\nPut a quarter inch of plywood there that's less than an arwen value they're\nVery very low our values you're going to throw that in for free is if you want a free addicts their way into later in fifty percent off addict insulation\nFrom attic innovations call now or how many callers today can we can do six six deals today to wait one nine three six zero five five nine if you don't need this now don't clog up the phone lines because we've got people listening who want it [noise]\nCall now six people need to wait one nine three six zero five five nine if you didn't get the number we're going to repeat it during the break in time when we come after the break or who to remind me I Will after the okay to wait one nine three six zero five five Ninety six colors only when we come back talking more of an addict insulation ready and barrier and solar addict than [noise]\nHoney I Love our new home but it didn't work\nProblem just go to check it for a look at what you mean by category this I qualify service we qualify chicken wrote checks wherever insist on all its\nOkay let's say home remodeling refers garage door repair and landscapers I can eat all the companies right from the profile\nThat must be check the crowd from\nA sea repair to window replacement checkup pro is your source for pre qualified service providers\nDo you want to win a one hundred dollar Home Depot shopping spree jak approach draws a lucky what a response\nTo enter the one hundred dollar Home Depot shopping spree contest just email checker pro Joe\nJoe that jak or pro dot com pleas include your full name that whole mailing address email checker pro Joe now at Joe at jak abroad job this is the ... radio show or your electric bills too high if you answered yes cold Tom decker from advocate of Asians for a free out of construction\nCoal time now to a one nine three six zero five five died\nThat's too late one nine three six zero five five not\nDo you have a question for ... ... email Joe ...

[noise]\nApproach Joe here it's great to have you all listening to me and my friend Tom decker traumatic innovations here on the check a pro radio show I was listening to one of those motivational speakers\nOn you to the other day Tom I Know that you do some of that too oh I get a kick out of those guys yeah yeah they're going to jazz me up every once in a while when I'm feeling blue but it gets you thinking him and someone was talking about having a purpose okay\nAnd my purpose is to serve the homeowner so what I Do every day as I wake up and I say how can I make sure the homeowner finds the best possible contractor so I'm checker pro dot com we've checked their licenses insurance some references all one hundred plus contractors\nAnd is also free for the homeowner and you know I have a number of purposes in life I mean you know I'm a husband and I'm a father and I'm a good citizen not in prison I pay my taxes and so forth\nBut as far as work goes that's my purpose your purpose I think is also helping the homeowner\nI'm you're not out there to steal anything from them you're not out there to put in an extra eight inches of insulation when they don't need you you're not going to cut a hole in the roof and put ten fans in because you have to make a number that mom I'm right actually it's actually you're kind of like a doctor I go to the doctor before\nYou diagnose the problem and then you say what do we have to do as far as an operation\nPacemaker ratio of ours has them and and so then you might recommend you know you need to fans and this is why and you have a rationale for it but um you need eight inches of insulation or maybe you only need six or maybe you need ten and this is why\nI'm you need a radium barrier because you're in the primaries of Katy, Texas and you're getting beaten on in the month of June July and August and um but you must feel good when you leave the house\nAnd you know that you've made it more efficient and you're saving the money\nThe nice things too is what we do that it's a lifetime energy savings and comfort so everything that we do is not some you have to do over and over again so if you do the rainy barrier that's the one time deal of do solar fans are fans have a lifetime or two so is there anything goes wrong we are going to come replaced the fan\nThe insulation is guaranteed to settle less than two percent over Twenty years so once you put that on what we do it's a one time deal some people will say well I'm going to remodel my kitchen for like ten years that's great but in ten years maybe the kitchen remodeled again because it's out of date\nIt goes out of style or insulation in what we do never goes out of style nobody ever said boy you know I Wish my house was less efficient\nThey wanted to know what I'm saying it's like you want to be as efficient as you can eat ... you don't ever want to go back once you have an efficient attic you don't want to go back you realize what a difference it really make because I get calls all the times like would you really think\nYou know if I had eight inches or ten inches of inflation's gonna make it a big difference and like we may have you only have two inches of in oh wow is going to be huge now if you already had Fifteen inches of inflation as somebody trying to tell you you need to eat more and then asking you're asking them as they can make a big difference now is up and make a big difference because you're already you're already there\nBut if if you're low and insulation you bring it up to where it needs to be yeah it is going to make a big difference in the lower temperature it does make a big difference in the house like I said it makes it more comfortable\nAir conditioners going around less lower energy bills\nThe house can be quieter what's more insulation it's good pizza mind just knowing that everything is the way it's supposed to be I'm kind of into that people say what do you mean peace of mind like well you just know that it's it's correct you go to sell the house\nYou're not what they do putting somebody in and saying well here's the house is great and you know on my gosh the wiring shot the addicts horrible the air conditioners on its last legs you don't want to sell somebody that something like that it depends\nOn your desperate situation you might need\nI guess maybe that's see that's why you get stuff taken care of as you go in and do it right like I was in the house yesterday and we were doing a removal and they were so happy and they're like you know what we were just going to add some insulation and there\nBut the old stuff smelled so bad there that are like you know what let's just do it right I see what happens if we coming here and put ten inches of inflation in here and it still smells because you didn't pull the old stuff out now we have to take everything back out all that installations junk\nSo you spend all that money and now we're gonna have to go and do it right so let's just do it right the first time\nIn eighth grade we get the job and they were ecstatic I mean so that's that's how we do things and we just won't do it right the first time were very reasonable and we'll make and we always say will make it work so really no no matter what people's budgets are will work something or it doesn't have to be because we can do in stages we can do inflation now maybe a solar fan later\nUm if you want to do 'em all together and maybe we'll give you a little bit bundle ordeal but we try to make things work so that's that's how we do it\nTom and his team will come out for free do a free attic analysis here's this number to wait one nine three six zero five five nine\nTo wait one nine three six zero five five nine\nOnly six people were able to get the addict insulation deal that we talked about earlier in the show we might circle back later and maybe tunnel through and a few more of those deals but for now that's done but if you're interested in having a free addict analysis and radiant barracks that want to go into that next\nAnd Tom has a deal to eight one nine three six zero five five nine radium barrier it's a great product to have\nWhen you don't have protection on your roof if you've a dark roof like I Do\nIt's getting beaten all day long and it is absorbing heat you want that hate to be reflected back out radiant barrier can do that [noise]\nTom brought a deal and I'm going to talk about the deal now then you have Tom go into reading a barrier more depth [noise]\nThis is a great deal it's a low two dollars per square foot\nBut Tom is offering fifty percent off it was only a dollar a foot that's crazy ... square foot\nSo you know I like the map this out for people who have done this before someone as a two thousand square foot house and it's two stories\nTheir attic is probably a thousand square feet because each floor is about a thousand square feet or so people can you know do the math now they can also go up in the rabbit can they can measure it for insulation or for radium barrier right now if they wish or you guys will do it for free when you come out\nYeah will measure it because most people have kind of an idea I think it's about twelve hundred feet or or whatever is in like OK and will measure it and it's like yeah sure enough it's right on that's kind of the normal will just come out with a quick measure make sure everybody's on the same page\nAnd the will get them the exact price would give them the quote right on the spot\nA so we don't say whoa email to you and then in two weeks you finally get it and all that kinda stuff will give you the price right there in about so you know right where you stand\nAnd that way you can say you know while the radio was say say the radio was twelve hundred and the inflation was a thousand and you you could say well I could I could do one or the other which one do you think would be best", "show_name": "Texas Home Improvement", "year": "2018", "city": "Houston",
