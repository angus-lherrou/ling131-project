{"month": "10", "state": "TX", "station": "KTRH", "content": "[noise]\nThank you Jack I've been a certified financial planner professional for the last twenty marvelous wonderful and very exciting years and ah you know are for money matters is we are a retirement planning specialist and so we worked with people that are over the age of fifty primarily and who are retired are retiring soon\nAnd we are so so very thankful we not work with over eight thousand four hundred families in forty three states\nAnd recently barons named more you're faithful host one of the top one hundred independent financial advisors a and actually for the sixth year in a row\n[noise] a flyby thank you but you know what without our clients so we would be absolutely nowhere so all the thanks go to them\nNow one of the topics that we do talk about with our clients are very frequently is estate planning which we call how to pass onto your greedy and washed undeserving airs the fruits of your labor\nAnd the reason why you do this is because money isn't everything but it sure keeps the kids in touch does it not\nThat out of the sports happy\n[laughter] and you weren't happy squirts okay let me tell you something unhappy square it's not good don't want that you weren't happy squirts anyway so this is the time we normally we talk about that but this week we're going to deviate from our normal appointed task and we're gonna talk instead about you're giving\nThe opposite of greedy I think a very clean not on washed\nAnd I'm very deserving spouse okay and so we're gonna talk about how to ah protect your spouse in the event of your dad how to create a trust for your spouse and it's called a Q tip trust just like the thing you stick in your ear and a Q tip stands for qualified terminal interest property and so we're going to go over that but jak can play it\n[noise] I Know I\n\nWould say\nMy saga may be and\n\n[noise] and\nOf course that is Tony Bennett with rags to riches and you know the estate taxes and probate and all that kind of stuff it's actually designed to do the exact opposite is designed to take you from riches to rags and we do not want that to happen to you so every week at this time we have our estate tip of the week\nSo but this week as I said we're deviating we're going to talk about your love it and most valued\nSpouse okay so we're going to talk about a Q tip trust so what is a Q tip trust will basically\nYour if you live in a community property state or if you have divided up your state for a state tax purposes and all that you're half of the state is what would normally go into the Q tip trust or some portion there up okay now the ... trust is designed\nTo benefit your spouse so therefore the rules of this trust are set up for their benefit\nSo what does that mean it means that they can your spouse can get to the money that first of all your spouse can be the trustee which means you're your spouse decides where the money's invested your spouse decides on distributions from the trust so there there's very little lack of control that has now happened for for your spouse\nThat's number one there is a little bit of control and that is because the trust has some rules and the rules are that the money can be distributed for what's\nCalled hams H. E. M. S. health education maintenance and support\nSo what the heck does that mean I mean how do you find those and that's the point okay health education maintenance as well so anything that your spouse needs for their health for their education their maintenance and their support they can take money out of the trust for that\nFor their benefit and they're the decider as a trustee if it fits that definition so essentially what it means is that the trust has to keep them in the lifestyle that they become accustomed to okay so that if they are accustomed to a a Toyota lifestyle they can't suddenly have a Ferrari lifestyle [laughter]\nOkay [laughter] so they have to have to live within what they were living before but you know most spouses I think would be okay with that so what are other advantages well suppose your spouse is not good with money\nYou can name a different trustee to help with that\nAlso if you had the Brady Bunch family you know if if you have different children\nAnd you want your spouse to be taken care of while they're alive but upon their debt you want it to go back to your kids you can do that with a with a Q tip trust so there are lots of advantages to the cutest trust\nAnd it can protect your spouse from lawsuits and if they get remarried than the new husband or wife that that is in the picture can have no access to this money so there's all kinds of benefits that distress can provide okay so it's one for your spouse and it's called de Q tip trust qualified tour mental interest property but cue tips easier to say [noise]\nAnyway um if you would like to talk to one of our financial advisors about your estate planning about how to pass onto the aforementioned greedy and washed undeserving airs a than what you can do is you can go to our website is money matters dot net money matters dot net\nAnd you can click on meat with an advisor\nAnd what we'll do is scheduled time to visit\nNow when we visit this is for those of you are over fifty who are retired are retiring soon okay so that's you when we visit we want to talk about your entire financial life not just your estate planning so we want to help you with Social Security decisions\nWe want to help you with a retirement planning decisions or income tax decisions you know all those kinds of things that impact someone who is retired are retiring soon we want to help you to make those decisions\nAnd if we can help you that's fantastic will do it at no charge obligation\nAnd if we cannot help you that's fine too okay so either way we will part French\n\nWell Dorothy is not too wonderful to be true because it is true\nSo do that okay now if you don't want to go directly to an advisor than what I Would recommend is that you go to one of our seminars okay and we have seminars near you if you can hear my voice there was a seminar near you pretty much\nAnd uh you can find those again on our website money matters dot net at the semi we're going to talk about the several things were going to talk about you know a Social Security decisions were going to talk about how to protect yourself from the next market crash which we think will happen in two thousand and twenty\nA we'll talk about ah do you have enough money to retire on all those kinds of things that we will talk about at the center or some money matters dot net for all of the above well you know what Jack\nI cannot believe that the show's over already well ladies and gentlemen I Hope you've enjoyed it as much as I have enjoyed doing it for you will see you next week same time same channel by by everybody [noise]\n[noise] [noise] [noise]\nInformation presented should not be regarded as a complete analysis on the subject to discuss and not being construed as an offer to buy or sell any of the security has mentioned none of this show's content should be viewed as personalized investment by a professional\nAdvisor Cindy consulted been more implementing any of the strategies presented numerous times I've been involved with varying degrees of written and therefore given no he's earned that any of the investment strategy will be suitable profitable where I find more slowly tax\nDay planning information offered on this program is general in nature always insolvent attorney or tax\nRational regarding years that they make legal ... founded ... should not be construed as\nAn endorsement of ... or ...

or the stadium knew I our radio ... collection that come out\n[noise]\nAnd it's expensive to get effects of what you're saying is the ...\nThe easier it is for the ac system to run less wear and tear it kind of like having the wind behind you when you're driving down the freeway Riley use less energy\nExactly well and just I always say you don't heat kills motors it's hard on equipment so\nIf you're if you're an engineer I Love them engineers and stuff call and they understand that the more in the heat are surrounding a motor or the hotter the berries get that kind of thing the less life you're going to get out of those components so when you can lower temperatures your air conditioning system actually will actually last longer exists for one thing is running less\nSo if it's run at twenty percent less that's like running your car twenty percent less miles as you're going to get more out of it\nBut then you're also going to get the heat load down so when you have less he ... the the motors and capacitors and stuff are going to be less likely dicey disintegrate or break down overtime so that's why you take care of the addict\nLet alone I mean we're talking about comfort that's the main reason people really do it and it gets to keep the house\nComfortable but also help lower the energy bills those two things kind of go together as some people call I Want to lower my energy bills it's like oh we can do that when we can add inflation we will look at the ventilation but we're also going to make the house more comfortable at the same time they go hand in hand we can't we can't do one without the other they go together sure\nIs so important here in Houston, Texas um we have a lot of humidity here and one of the comforts um that we're looking for is less humidity cooler temperatures in the house does having\nProper insulation in ventilation in your attic help\nWith humidity [noise] yes so the editor temperature is is kind of critical for the humidity\nBecause I'm the hotter the ... the addict is and then you have the cold air going through your duct work there so you have a bigger temperature differential ... the bigger that differential is the more conversation can be had in the in the duck work and things will start sweating and and really causing a problem so you want the temperature to be as close to the inside temperature of the house is you can't\nBut we try to do is get within ten to Fifteen degrees of the ambient temperature so if it's a hundred degrees outside\nWe don't want the temperature being all say over a hundred and ten hundred and Fifteen degrees if it is hotter than that that will look at doing solar ventilation maybe some soft investigate air into the addict or we have to get the temperature down\nAnd there's different ways to do that and that would come out and do an addict analysis will come on look at the addict\nAnd you know the argument that do you when you come out no so that kind of our first stage so people you know listen to the show today you can call 'em will throw it up you know we got some deals on some insulation as well\nBut call us will come out and look at the attic and see what it actually needs 'cause it's it's hard to even just take you know old just in general over well installations which any well not necessarily people will say American her she was not working anymore ...\nWell that may be the case could be but maybe not so you know what are you gonna do best thing is is have somebody come look at it so call us up we've been doing this for Thirteen Years\nWe know what we're doing and we don't oversell people would just see what they need to come out and we would take care of it\nI'm going to give out Tom's number is to wait one nine three six zero five five nine to eight one nine three six zero five five nine Tom is the owner of ... he has actually come out to my home put insulation in point to a solar addict fan in and you also put the draft master and that's what you call it don't you\nYeah the ... the ... for the pull downstairs and it just keeps the heat in cold\nIt really works great in the summer and it works just as well and the winter so if you're hitting the house and heat rises so you don't want it that heat to just go right up to that addict or militant insulator that will insulate then it's part of like when we do insulation it's actually insulating the door so it's really part of the insulation package and if it costs today will do will throw one of those in which is what the purchase of insulation\nAbsolutely fantastic to eight one nine three six zero five five nine on today's show top medic innovations is going to be talking about\nAddict insulation we're going to be talking about solar addict fans and radium barrier radiant barrier also is actually good for the winter a lot of people think I must be a summer thing because there isn't that bounce the the sun's energy back out again right so we'll be talking about that here on the show before the break\nLet's talk about a deal you brought you always come to the show with a deal because you know that I check approach Joe require it so I hang upside down by his ankles I shake him the problem with that is Tom's a couple\nOf inches tall and yeah you always begging my head and if you can visualize that so I guess I'm On my ankle and bang bang bang\n[laughter] okay so are you bought a deal ordinarily it's a dollar Ninety per square foot for an eight inch add a blown in certain seat installation the white stuff right yeah um and and so that's a that's deep eight inches and that's generally what people need to get up to the our values and our ... year\nSo not most houses are going to have five to six inches in there that hasn't been upgraded so will come in and that's what we find that's all you're on that special and eight inches that normally we'll bring you to Thirteen fourteen inches when that'll be really nice job uh we used it certain heat insulation doesn't itch it costs a fire rated uh\nIt doesn't absorb moisture mold doesn't grow on it it's a great insulator and we can add that to the existing inflation so you don't have to pull the old insulation out\nNow we do remove all if it's you know something that you've had squirrels and it's nasty\nBut normally we don't need to do that Ninety five percent of the time we're just going to add insulation to what you have\nBut that is something that we do um but we don't encourage that and push that on people some some places will say every house that they got what we were we pull everything out every town now he's like you're spending your charging their customers so much money you might have been a job that was maybe a Fifteen hundred dollar job and they're like oh we got twelve thousand are that John lick\nYou put that customer didn't need that that if you need it you need it but in most cases you know that's crazy we don't operate like that\nWhen you're painting a room you scrape the paint off you don't ... did you do anything else [laughter] exactly you just go over it too late one nine three six zero five five nine one dollar Ninety cents a square foot for an eighty and chat it's fifty percent off today everybody half price only Ninety five cents is that correct\nOn Ninety five cents a square foot but they didn't shed and there were also thrown into free stairway insulator oh the draft ... I've got one I Love it and those are normally two Ninety nine installed and she made right here in Cairo Texas so it's really a nice products IPO yet people so we kind of use a local\nYou know products and tried to support our local community with by doing that and it's a great product\nThat is huge two hundred and nine nine dollar value for the addict stairway until later the draft master I loved that product because I'm ... and we talked about this before time here on the show\nIf you don't have anything on your stairway door and you pull it down for instance and you look up that is just there but when you close it it has\nPut a quarter inch of plywood there that's less than an arwen value they're very very low our values so you you're going to throw that in for free is if you want a free addicts their way into later in fifty percent off addict insulation\nFrom attic innovations call now ah how many callers today can we can do six six deals today to wait one nine three six zero five five nine if you don't need this now don't clog up the phone lines because we've got people listening who want it [noise]\nCall now six people only to wait one nine three six zero five five nine if you didn't get the number who are going to repeat it during the break in time when we come after the break a would remind me I Will after the break [noise] okay to eight one nine three six zero five five Ninety six colors only when we come back talking more of an addict insulation ready and barrier and solar addict than [noise]\nHello Hi honey I Love our new home but it means work\nProblems just go to check it for a look at what you mean by category three qualifies service providers we qualify checkup wrote checks references on all its members\nOkay let's say home remodeling refers garage door repair and landscapers I can eat the company's raising the profile\nThat must be checking ... from\nA sea repair to window replacement checkup pro is your source for pre qualified service providers\nDo you want to win a one hundred dollar Home Depot shopping spree ... each month\nTo enter the one hundred dollar Home Depot shopping spree contest just emailed jak approach Joe ...

it's great to have you all listening to me and my friend Tom decker traumatic innovations here on the checker pro radio show I was listening to one of those motivational speakers\nOn you to the other day Tom I Know that you do some of that too oh I get a kick out of those guys yeah yeah they kind of jazz me up every once in a while when I'm On blue but gets you thinking him and someone was talking about having a purpose okay\nAnd my purpose is to serve the homeowner so what I Do every day I wake up and I say how can I make sure the homeowner finds the best possible contractor so I'm checker pro dot com we've checked their licenses insurance some references all one hundred plus contractors\nAnd is also free for the homeowner and you know I have a number of purposes in life I mean you know I'm a husband and I'm a father and I'm a good citizen not in prison I pay my taxes and so forth\nBut as far as work goes that's my purpose your purpose I think is also helping the homeowner\nI'm you're not out there to steal anything from them you're not out there to put in an extra eight inches of insulation when they don't need it you you're not going to cut a hole in the roof and put ten fans in because you have to make a number that month um ... it's actually you're kind of like a doctor I go to the doctor before\nYou diagnose the problem and then you say what do we have to do as far as an operation\nPacemaker ratio of ours is then and and so then you might recommend you know you need to fans and this is why and you have a rationale for it right um you need eight inches of insulation or maybe you only need six or maybe you need ten and this is why I'm\nYou need a radium barrier because you were in the primaries of Katy, Texas and you're getting\nBeaten on in the month of June July and August and um but you must feel good when you leave the house and you know that you've made it more efficient and you're saving the money\nThe nice thing too is what we do that it's a lifetime energy savings and comfort so\nEverything that we do is nothing to do over and over again so if you do the rainy a barrier that's a one time deal of do solar fans are fans have a lifetime or two so is there anything goes wrong we are going to come replaced a fan\nThe insulation is guaranteed to settle less than two percent over Twenty years so once you put that on what we do it's a one time deal some people will say well I'm going to remodel my kitchen first I'm like well the ten years that's great but in ten years maybe the kitchen aid remodeled again because it's out of date\nIt goes out of style or insulation in what we do never goes out of style nobody ever says boy you know I Wish my house was less efficient\nThey want us you know what I'm saying it's like you want to be as efficient as you can eat ... you don't ever want to go back once you have an efficient attic you don't want to go back you realize what a difference it really make because I get calls all the times like would you really think\nYou know if I had eight inches or ten inches of inflation going to make it a big difference and like we may have you only have two inches of in oh wow is going to be huge now if you already had Fifteen inches of inflation is somebody trying to tell you you need to eat more\nAnd then asking you're asking them as they can make a big difference now is not to make a big difference because you're already you're already there but if if you're low and insulation you bring it up to where it needs to be yeah it is going to make a big difference in the lower temperature it's it does make a big difference in the house\nLike I said it makes it more comfortable air conditioners going to run less lower energy bills\nThe house can be quieter what's more insulation it's good peace of mind just knowing that everything is the way it's supposed to be I'm kind of into that people say what do you mean peace of mind like well you just know that it's it's correct you go to sell the house\nYou're not would like to pick somebody in in saying well here's the house is great and you know oh my gosh the wiring shot the addicts horrible the air conditioners on its last legs you don't want to sell somebody that's something like that it\nDepends on your desperate situation you might need I guess maybe a wreck but see that's why you get stopped taking\nCare of as you go in and do it right like I was in the house yesterday and we were doing a removal and they were so happy and they're like you know what we were just going to add some insulation and there but the old stuff smelled so bad there that are like you know what let's just do it right I see what happens if we come here and put ten inches of inflation in here\nAnd it still smells because you didn't pull the old stuff out now we have to take everything back out all that installations junk so you spend all that money and now we're going to go ahead do it right so let's just do it right the first time\nIn eighth grade we did the job and they were ecstatic I mean so that's that's how we do things and we just won't do it right the first time were very reasonable and we'll make and we always say will make it work so really no matter what people's budgets are will work something of it doesn't have to be because we can do it stages we can do insulation out maybe a solar fan later\nUm if you want to do them all together maybe we'll give you a little bit bumbling I'll deal but we try to make things work so that's that's how we do it\nTom and his team will come out for free do a free attic analysis here's this number to wait one nine three six zero five five nine\nTo wait one nine three six zero five five nine only six people were able to get the addict insulation deal that we talked about earlier in the show we might circle back later and maybe tunnel throw in a few more of those deals but for now that's done but if you're interested in having a free addict analysis and radiant barrier 'cause I Want to go into that next\nAnd Tom has a deal to eight one nine three six zero five five nine radium barrier it's a great product to have when you don't have protection on your roof if you've a dark roof like I Do it's getting beaten all day long and it is absorbing heat you want that heat to be reflected back out radiant barrier can do that [noise]\nTom brought a deal and I'm going to talk about the deal now then you have Tom go into reading a barrier more depth [noise] this is a great deal it's a low two dollars per square foot but Tom is offering fifty percent off and it's only a dollar a foot that's\nCrazy ... square foot\nSo you know I like the map this out for people who have done this before someone has a two thousand square foot house and it's two stories\nTheir attic is probably a thousand square feet because each floor is about a thousand square feet or so people can you know do the math now they can also go up in the radical can measure it for insulation or for radium barrier right now if they wish or you guys will do it for free when you come out", "show_name": "Texas Home Improvement", "year": "2018", "city": "Houston", "day": "07"}
