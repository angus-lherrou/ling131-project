better answer when you call in so again the number seven on three two one two five eight seven four seven one three two one two\nFive eight seven four anyhow improvement question have feel free to pick up the phone give me a call and\nI I Will see what I can do to help you out here on Texas home brewing where to start off with an email question a tank was water heater question\nAnd a ... this one starts Jim first let me thank you for your great show we always enjoy listening and have learned so much from you I was\nOpening to call in this past Saturday to this or opening hoping I guess I should say Saturday to discuss this issue we are having but unfortunately had to go out of town and will be gone this weekend as well so that is why I'm emailing you\nInstead we have a Hank less gas water heater we installed in two thousand seven on the rich model in zero\nSeven five one and we have spent around a thousand dollars on maintenance issues because we would not have hot water you could turn on the faucet and let it run forever and never get hot water when that\nWhat happened the temperature panel on the tank list would say code number the plumbing companies would come out and do such repairs\nAs cleaning ignition due to carbon build up cleaning flame rods and screens be scaling blowing out fan and exhaust gas manifold obviously we're tired of this and my husband is ready to go back to a tank water heater\nTankers gas hot water heater is located about forty five degrees from the kitchen utility or forty five feet rather from the kitchen utility room\nAll the bathrooms are two and ten foot\nFrom the rich we live in a one story home two thousand square foot first have you heard of these issues with an ... gas tank was hot water heater and secondly what do you recommend I Want to hear your opinion before my husband purchases a tank water here by the way they're only\nTwo of us that live in our home but we do have guessed often thank you Katrina well first of all it's not limited to just know rich your tank was water heater is made in two thousand seven or that's when you had to put in\nAll ankles water heaters from that era\nHad to have maintenance done on them once a year you're supposed to flush the system which cleans all the lines out um and and just blow out the fans and all these issues that you've been having with it if you do the annual maintenance it avoids having those issues\nAnd that was with all tank was water heaters not just with the rich\nNow a lot of the new tank tank was water heaters that are coming out or have automatic systems in them to avoid some of these problems um but again back\nWhen this one was done that stuff wasn't just it wasn't part of it you had to do maintenance on um\nSo have I heard of this issue absolutely and again it's typically when the ... the maintenance issues have not been kept up and and you kind of mentioned that\nIn your email and and you know a lot of times people think of water here you put it in and you can just totally forget about it even a tank type water heater\nIs supposed to be flushed out every six to twelve months\nAnd if you wait more than\nSay two years you know when you when you first put one in before you start flushing out the tank every six to twelve months what you'll find is you can no longer flush the tank and shorten the life of it\nAnd that's still even on most of the new ones so even if you go back to a tank if you're having issues with the water in your home\nYour still going to have issues with the water heater\nIt won't solve the issue one thing you will find with just two of you in the home if you go back to a tank was your water heater expense will go up and a lot of people don't realize this but the water heater accounts for twenty percent\nOf your energy bills whether it's gas or electric doesn't matter it accounts for about twenty percent and\n... by going with a tank lists\nThat is only kicking in whenever you need hot water you save a ton on your energy bills if you go back to the tank type you're going to see your energy bills go up so\nYou know I I Would simply say I would have the system flushed I Would get a hold of the un owner's manual and you can find them online\nAnd see how you can keep the system flushed and avoid these expenses because flushing the system and blowing it out and stuff you can do it yourself if you want or plumbers will come in and it's usually not a huge charge in order to do that\nSo hopefully that helps you out with it but I honestly I Would not make the switch back to a tank less water heater I have tank was in my house uh mine was about ten years old and I actually\nReplaced it only because our mind was all electric and I had a different issue with it and\nYou know I ... I still went back with a tank was type water heater because it is easier on the pocket book as far as your monthly bills but you got that endless hot water supply\nAgain our number seven won three two one two five eight seven four that seven won three two one two five eight seven four and a I'll see what I can do to help you out here on Texas home improvement hey Josh can you make it where I can bring up the calls\nAnd again if you're outside the Houston area eight six six nine three seven zero zero zero three that's eight six six nine three seven zero zero zero three uh let's see\nWell we don't get it they Josh you there\n\nI'm afraid he's tied up on something so room okay or not still dark and where I Can't bring them up or lightened rather\nUh hey Gary how are you doing today what I'm\nDoing wonderful this is a Gary boat and with a do west air conditioning and Gary how things looking out there at the home show today\nOh it's great that people want to talk about ... foundation repair and everything else you're looking for for like\nWell you know with the way the weather is right now not uh I I Know a lot of people aren't really is interested in air conditioning as they should be a we're kind of starting to head into that heating season although we're still run in the air conditioners but\nAh you know everybody's thinking okay I made it through the hot part or the the summer so I\nI should be okay this year but they're still maintenance we need to take care of and when we come back I Want to talk to you about some of those maintenance issues that need to be addressed on a regular basis on our air conditioning systems and because it is fall\nOn our heating systems will be back in just a minute with more ... home improvement [noise]\nVictors remodeling construction you know if you're thinking about doing some hearty siding on your home really any type of citing I Want you to call victors remodeling construction and the reason I Do these guys are specialist in James hardy site and I've been recommending victors for\nAt least twenty five years probably more like Thirty years and they have always done an excellent job\nThey really do a great job they've they've done work for my parents they've done work for actually\nMy partner here on Texas home improvement or is\nThat the the detail that they do when they're doing a James hardy citing job is just remarkable so if you're thinking about new siding for your home and new ... boards deciding trim boards the whole nine yards it's victors remodeling construction eight three two\nThree four three Ninety nine Ninety seven that's eight three two three four three Ninety nine Ninety seven or victors are C. dot com\nWhen it comes to windows were your home gym no taxes on improving will not here you are welcome to Texas on broom if\nI Want to stop that you have a way that I Would sell my boy lingo man had ...

plumbing\nAnd the whole cast iron pipes they're not going to if they're not leaking now they're not going to last that much longer anyways so I talk to them about you know why not use those same tunnels replaced the plumbing now and save in the long run and when we sat down and looked at the numbers it made all the sense in the world\nYou really got to look at everything the overall cost not

H. which trafficking whether together you see them all the lazy as you move on the south\nIt's always debatable whether to go with the heat bumper just go with strip heat now I personally have\nA heat pump in my home and I highly recommend it and I'll tell you the biggest reason is when I the the few times where I have had to turn on the strip ... because I needed more heat than what was coming from the heat bomb you know because it got down below twenty\nOr that he is just not as comfortable as what I get from the heat pop\nNo you know what I like to read or the the way I like to refer up is that it's soft heat\n'em you know we got gas the which is the ... and put the ... so they come they come in a little slower than I used to but we got gas which was a pretty big bang or the uh\nThat electric which also does kind of a sigh and you know the elements seat up and you get a you get a pretty good buying of heat but that heat pump to such a saw\nWires slow process and and they really are not um eighty hours in the Houston area you know the heat pump sometimes becomes a little bit about it all because of the calls\nBut one you weigh everything involved including that solved the and and the humidifier cash in all the other things that go along with it I think I think that's a good investment I think the little more money for that heat pump as it was worth it and\nIt's in my opinion it is I mean ... ... and here's how I look at it if you set your thermostat at like Seventy three Seventy two degrees or anything lower than that during the summer or summer months when you're trying to keep\nIt real cool and you're running your electric bill up by doing that why would you not use the comfort settings\nIn the winter months and that's what the heat pump actually does for you is it just makes it more comfortable and makes it where you can afford to raise the temperature in the home let's face it in the winter months we always want to set it at Seventy six Seventy eight\nEven though they tell you I'll keep it love a cooler and save money but with the heat pumps you actually save enough money that you can have it comfortable like that\nYou can and and you know electric heat is one for one so whoever your provider is you're going to purchase one walk of electricity for\nEvery one watch of heat that you get off that resist defeat package so\nIt's not it's not a fish and and you know the all the goldfish and so the heat pumps and and and the performance factors you know it's not that way and then with verbal street equipment you know then you get to talk about that it's even a softer approach coming into the heating mode so\nThere are a lot of benefits on and he comes over electric heat and um\nYou know I like them a lot of contractors run from 'em and sadly because they scare some consumers off but yeah I think Trump is is really a ... it's a nice brought up\nWell and and then I Will I tell everybody you're not\nWhen you're shopping for heating and air conditioning systems [noise]\nYou're not buying just a unit that anybody can plug in you're buying a service and there is a service that goes with uh to to keep in your home comfortable to keeping your home energy efficient and all those things\nAnd a ...

like here's zoomed in on his home improvement\nHated more sexism proven is made possible by Texas remodeled let's jump back\nInto our calls here we're going to head out to Haiti and Patrick welcome to Texas home improvement\nHow you doing today wonderful\nFor real simple question I bought a property that has a in the kitchen has granted I'm\nA I'm sure or\nI don't want an area has a certain type of granite than the main area has no granted at all but my question would be do I have to match that granted or can I put a different kind of granted that\nYou can do whatever you want to do now if you are I mean I mean I'm ... yeah\nYeah if you're if you're going to try to sell the house or something right or you're going to want to do something it's either going to somewhat match it or be totally contrast seen just\nBecause of the looks of it uh you know and and that's done all the time it doesn't all have to be the exact same [noise]\nOkay\nYeah I mean the owners pretty pretty ... it has a black girl and that's readily available right I I just I heard from different topics about\n... ... in matching or doing different things as large as well are you from the prospective owner of that uh I probably wouldn't be too crazy about it if it were different colors and\nRight and again it's it's all based on somebody's personal preference I Will tell you with the black hurl on the center island it's not that unusual to have a a light colored like a a white or some you know\nOr a very light color on the rest of the countertops okay but I'm like no you I like it all to match [laughter]\nYeah and the ... the one last question uh I'm replacing windows or is it a good\nTime on the first one of the house also where the new new new front and also\nWell doors you you can a lotta times paint them and and it looks like a brand new door so it's going to depend on the architect of the door\nYeah and the reason I certainly places 'cause right above the door or there's a there's got on those up so um and I was just like us you know gosh I finally started it was kind of money when goes a long pass by the house up a great job on the glass window nothing with the door\nYeah well if it's a nice wouldn't door that can be re finished or painted that's great but if if it's got like a you know back in the early seventies everything had the uh Spanish look well not in style anymore and at that you'd be better off to replace it [noise]\nOkay I appreciate all righty take care thank you sir back\nAgain at sea here we're gonna we're gonna head back out to the home showing we're actually going to talk with any my brother Kenny hey Jim how's it going\nHow's the home show doing\nWell we've been answer and a lot of questions and actually a talking with people about doing some structure raising in areas that are flooded and\nPeople are trying to get up and out of that and and air conditioning replacements and plumbing repairs and replacements in homes with him pretty busy\nYeah and you know talking about house races I just actually had a call about house racing and\nWe have a video playing down there at the home show on house racing and you know what people can expect to see when a house raising being done and and we can't answer questions down there at the home show as well\nYeah in fact one of the videos we got playing down there right now is one we just got up in the air um right off of praise by you and we're still fish finishing up the stairways going up into it but uh [noise] you know that's the most current project structure raising we did and I want to say it was about five feet we lifted it\nYeah now a lotta times\nAh people don't realize there is a ... and that was kind of discussion I was just having with the the lady who called\nThere is a difference on how structures are being finished out when they're being lifted I mean as an example the one that we're doing right now we have nice uh [noise]\nA concrete walkways or steps going up into the home with with a nice blocks cut stone finishes and things like that\nAnd there's other people who are beginning to just put wooden steps and that's a night and day difference in the finish yes\nYeah and in total different look we we've done woods stairs or ramps a concrete stare stone stairs steel stairs a there's a lot of different choices just on stairs let alone how you handle the rest of the project\nYeah so ... and I say this to people all the time you're you're buying a service and you have to be careful about what you're buying because not everybody selling you the same thing even if you're buying an air conditioning unit\nYes the unit may be the same but how it's installs can make a huge difference on how energy efficient that it's going to be and on these ... house racing's how it's finished out is a lifetime difference on that structure yeah\nAnd there's a lot of differences in the area of the home is located on on how you finish it out how you sometimes raise it and uh", "show_name": "Texas Home Improvement", "year": "2018", "city": "Houston", "day": "20"}
