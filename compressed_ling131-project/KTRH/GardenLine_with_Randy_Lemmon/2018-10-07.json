Neal based uh eagle tour fungicides they actually not false has a PC and B not every store has it\nSo if you can find the ... say opt for that time to time because I Know how good that works but it's

in Hempstead get things started this hour morning read\nGood morning how you doing I'm good what can we help you in\nA called a couple of weeks ago uh I'm telling you about a tree on my property and have\nVirtually died over it I Believe started turning brown peripheral leave and then forty eight hours later just death like light struck it [noise] so you you would recommend that a Arbor is come out and take a look at it rather than just you know some guy\nSo I I did I had a a recommended a tree guy come look at it his son is actually a certified Arbor as to what a concrete trees and deep we're creating all that stuff so he recognized that it was white and\n... are you sure did not called oh quilt well he called it a blight okay and\nAnd you know it's one of the country guy he's been there for probably twenty five years on you know when I think and they haven't got certified various disciplines and in a tree [noise] anyway so\nHe suggested that obviously take down that tree because they go on to the next and so we did that\nAnd then he treated the rest of the tree is with a bathing with the suggestion following it up in the spring with a an additional treat 'em and of course you don't know how many trees have got to count them but the bottom line\nSo we have twenty eight trees we created all of them and my question\nWas is first of all thanks for recommending a professional out there and my question is is how how important is it a follow up with the treatment in the spring and then another one next fall\nThat's pretty expensive\n[noise] okay well the separate two things I don't know whether to say You're welcome on the recommendation because it if it's open wilt the fungal disease\nThen they should be doing fungicides injections on the trees that you want to say\nThey're not it's not just about the pre feeding the tree\nIn addition to the ... the wind around I Am a\nFan of deep repeating trees period forget the question about ... blight whenever you want to call it\nWe we are proponents of deep root feeding trees here and it's something technical you could do yourself if you've ever read are tips sheets on you'd want to invest in you know a soil longer and you want to invest in some uh\nContraption on the back of attract recon ah [noise]\nJust to apply some fertilizer after you poke the holes around each one um I don't know what they're charging on I don't really want to know what they're charging for you on that but I Need you to know that we are proponents of deep roots feeding do it yourself style [noise]\nAnd you shouldn't want to read those tips sheets we've written about so that you can figure out whether it's worth doing yourself or hiring a company to do it for you\nThe more established an oak tree is the more I'm going to hire somebody to do it because they're they've got a tool unless you want to invest in that kind of equipment\nThat would I don't know what the PSI is but uh it's incredible pressure coming out of that ... a injectable tool that goes down you know Eighteen twenty four inches into the soil are you and me and Ross rude feeder probably only going to go down six or eight inches\nRight [noise] well um he he did inject the the trees are better immediately around the house that he suggested you know it's a\nBy his experience that this tree was probably a hundred twenty eight hundred and forty five hundred years old so and that that and it was one of the bigger trees on my property but they're all about saying\nThough he said that the uh the disease or killed the tree is something that attacks trees that are not the greatest shapes that are unhealthy\nCorrect and that's where the deep repeating makes it healthier\nExactly as which what he says like a like pick nearby to for him it and then the injection did was for the uh what is it called the blood painted the trade\nBroadly calls it you know what you know what that is\nWell just basically getting into the can be layers of the the fungicides is working its way through the vascular system of the tree for lack of a better way of describing it\nRight or he did that with say it was it looked like a really big hype but Dharma and said\nAll right so yeah in that I of course again that that treatment\nAbout [noise] a bargain I not suggest that you call the extension service up there to [noise]\nUm no you did okay let's pretend like you're just calling for the first time I think you need to get a hold the extension services well the county extension of that is going to be what Grimes\nWaller long parents aren't

Rob every bit of nitrogen from the area around it and then they'll make it impossible for grass to grow\nReally well\nSo the thing that I recommend people do is do a ... if you still have something of a stump before ground out actually drill holes just inside the campaign layer so that you can pour on diluted brush killer herbicide and those like one inch round hole\nAnd I don't know how big the stump is but you know the bigger the more polls we can\nFill and then fill that and then cover it with a tarp put a big bungee quarter round that tarps of all it's doing is absorbent absorbing
