any data\nSo it can be ace hardware stores feed stores for sure I saw the ... when I was sitting in for ... this past week uh everybody's got access to it now so if they've got an X. files they have access to it and they can have it and that can be not just the ace hardware stores and the feeds stores but all these independent nurseries and garden centers that we talk about and brag about\nA real quickly to the one last message just check the letter on ladybugs\nBrand dot com leaning [laughter]\nI was sitting in for set this past week I saw some\nA great lady but products still at the ... and since they're not manufacturing more if you find it like I did yesterday pick it up by but read the letter and lady bug brand dot com the reevaluating company sad to say and that means they stopped\nThe production of the great lady but products up at their facility or outside of Colorado and cutting shoot\nAnd are we still have not gotten word what they're going to do with that re evaluation but the letter says it all at lady bugs brand dot com Hector in spring thanks for waiting during the news\nTheir traffic break we'll start with you this hour what's up\nI'm Jay area in my yard that morning and I got a garage but a product\nUm I gave you the history on my yard back in the spring I ... and our compost drafts with the top of the ads on the ground up and I did that age group feeding on all my trees and\nAll summer long they said lime green they never darkened up\nAt all and um I got in the garage sitting there right now at the micro live a brown bag for the ball got one that they recommended on yeah the microbe grow them\nYeah I got a bag of iron night\nI got much bon I brought it to concentrate I got the main views or copper\nStop right there stop right there you're trying to overkill this\nUm if you did their ration compost top dressing and you will see a lot of lime green it's because the the ... the compost is doing its job it's extracting\nThe bad elements that were in the soil and it's bringing it to the surface so we just keep on with an organic treatment All right so in this case you would do the microwave brown patch and then the micro life\nA microbe grow the nonviolent that's going to help with the yellow into a you don't need to if you've done all this you don't need to do ... you don't need to do infuse you don't need to do any of the fungicides because if you're trying to do an organic treatment like that you don't want to put in a synthetic fungicides treatment\nOkay right so this is not going to fix itself overnight but this is a gradual process if you keep adding the ride organic matter to the soil after they're rationing compost top dressing you'll get there and then sometime in the spring April May June you need to do another ... compost top dressing\nOkay what can I Do about my trade because I have a board that train back there I got a red maple ... on I think more and eat fruit tree\nAnd those are all in line green\nWell you've the fruit tree we need to use citrus fruit tree food okay specific\nI some of that my I got\nAll the other ... you can use just a regular micro life if you have at the six to four in all cases poke some holes than scatter the Michael I from the microwave citrus food and let that go to town and you can owner that in with something like Medina selective later a Medina has\nTo grow liquid plant food and I\nDo have a joke out at the end of the oil activated having a cat\nI'm already die learn this a little technique from our friends and affordable tree service probably\nFifteen sixteen years ago when they do deep root feeding it's not just about the food but it's about a company that with the soil activated it really activates really kicks in into gear so whatever you're going to feed these trees with use the soil activate or to water it in\nOkay do I use that activate around the yard as well as\nYou can absolutely after you get everything down and once the micro grow goes down after the brown patch than water it in lightly with Medina selective manner\nBy that question I have a barricade in there as well and I haven't but any day now yet so I Do it a day with the brown\nYeah did you follow the schedule you know we talked about that on our hopefully your subscribe to our weekly email blasts hopefully follow us on Facebook but we're been
