front and let people see all the old feeders that have been brought in so I Want you to take good advantage of this feeder swap today last day of it here courtesy of information on guard ... let's go to George any Yoakam\nUrge\nMorning uh bought an old house and the yard is completely shaded we remove struggled traced to bring it home supply and we want to bring about twenty five dollars I think what a way to the ground troops prepare for that when they scrape off the grass or\nOh yeah you're supposed to kill off the old grass until it all out of there and we have a tip she should read I'll give you the highlights of it it's called ...\n... and that's what you did you kill everything out you till everything up you should bring in something like enrich topsoil to improve the organic matter of the soil so that when you lay the new saw it on top of that it will take cold right away we call it kill to fill in ... and\n... with it you can kill with anything seriously or in the glide said herbicides are still ... go to think for that because\nTwo weeks later everything's going to be dead you till everything up and there's usually no residual in the soil for that plus you're going to bring in filled or not feel dirt but I Am organic still to help improve and enrich the soil there and that'll help break down if there's any\nLife said if you want to do an organic way of doing that we just talked about that maybe three hours ago on Joel you'll have to remind me two and a half hours ago the homemade weed killer with the vinegar epsom salts dawn dish soap combination\nWhich you can Google Search Randy lemon homemade weed killer all day long and it'll get you that recipe got it now here's your inside secret for new saw though\nGoing to cost you a lot when you're doing twenty pounds a grandchild but if you really want the grass to set up shop really quick you gonna saturated on it every other week basis with soil activate or\nLike my data mhm okay\nThat'll break down the mud that the grass comes in and help they reached systems establish itself to that worked up soil you mentioned a few just scrape the grass off your grass will never set up shop for it'll take over a year\nGot it okay and you want to ensure the success right away everything I just told you follow through with okay I'm going to work [laughter] that's a lot of work good luck [laughter]

down not soil so I went to the other parts of the grass is greener and that's where I noticed them running around the numbers for the ground okay\nSo we were always recommended that you do three applications of a\nUm liquid insecticide over the next two weeks don't miss an application every five to seven days so you can break the cycle you should be able to do that very easily with the cooler weather coming up so I Would get out and do one today\nOkay All right I Would do it again in five to seven days even though it's going to be much cooler and do more and more time in five to seven days after that don't blow off the third one just because the weather got cooler\n[noise] okay and now and I use as a gradual\nTodd no you have to use ... insecticide that's what our tip she calls for okay
