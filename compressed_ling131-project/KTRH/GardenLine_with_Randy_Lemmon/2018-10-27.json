I I I always got to remember we we got a lot of Amazon Prime type people listen to this program to that's good I was yeah I Would love for them to come back and be promoted and great way thanks for the reminder that\nIf you can find it it's worth it but again it goes back to call we had last are I don't put anything out unless I actually know I'm having a problem with brown patch which by the way seems to be Gary's question to the morning Gary and sugar land what's your question about brown patch\n... is even there what\nWas wrong with that phone call we got this like the guy in College Station can you uh see if he's actually on a speaker phone or the let's ... double check that in the meantime we're going to go to ed in orange\nBorn in the morning what's up\nWow my question is is there anything on the market that you can put down on your loan to get rid of the Virginia button where you without killing your son Augustine\nYeah shame on you for not listening to us every weekend for the last four months shame on you for not being registered for our weekly email tips are following us on Facebook do you know why I'm saying all that tongue firmly planted in cheek\nCalled ... gave everybody the green light on Virginia button we control the cool season herbicide last week\nA ... year old truck for a loan weed free zone make sure you administer fact and what we've been telling people to do is pull it up up until the point where we could use the cool season herbicide even when it was warmer we were giving people options on some other products like\nFahrenheit or Celsius but that does do some damage to the lawn lightly damage them on\nA in the heat of using those kinda herbicide so we were desperate for the weather change so that we can cool to use the cool season herbicides that we're promoting on line for the last four months\nOkay so if I had to get it use it pull up what you can I still think he should pull up what you can and then wait a week and then do the treatment with the cool season herbicide it's always the wise idea and we actually have had a we have a\nVirginia button we control she on our Web sites and Randy lemon dot com K. traits dot com and it basically says pull up what you can look for the new growth use the cool season herbicide and when we're in that time of year and you get better control of Virginia button wing\nHere we

doing there but do it all you know maybe make sure I'm getting a triple actually content on their\nWell here's the week or something you're doing the right thing you know the good news bad news you're doing kind of the right thing you can also dust once you remove them those kind of open wound that open flashed areas once you do they're merely might dust it was so for one time see if that does a better job\nOkay the ... that's a good first step here's the bad news usually when you have those kind of mushrooms coming off the tree it's at a sign that the tree is one suffered from some kind of damage\nSome kind of wound or that the tree is on death march\nEarly means decaying matter inside that tree and it could mean that it's dying\nFrom the inside okay and you wouldn't see any evidence of that a top yeah I mean I Know you\nDo eventually yeah you'll start seeing some browning limbs here and there on that side where you see the mushrooms\nAnd uh it probably yell at me for this one but I mean ...\nWhat you want to don't yell we lecture we know you know maybe ... maybe\nI Would tell us and like I talking to my kids when I say that it's like well dad yelled at me and said did ... did I really yell at you or does that just tell you what to do [laughter] so this is going on I don't yell at anybody but we lecture All right just like we do with their kids so what's your lecture point you name for what I'm\nSaying is I mean should I mean what what caught a rise in the outside do anything\nHow would you ... with the torch now that that would be more data adding problem okay\nAre you learning any live to issue that might still be there\nOkay well enough that was just\nThe ... it's usually a sign of an interior decay and that was either caused by it some kind of damage or it could mean the trees dying so just keep a watch violent because if it starts turning brown up top okay what kind of tree was this by the way [noise]\nOh it's one of these weird ... like a Mexican okay fake huge leads you'll know if the tree starts browning leaves and then they'll leave stay on the tree if they'd goes through its normal round cycling drops 'cause of fall that's a good sense [noise]\nArt
