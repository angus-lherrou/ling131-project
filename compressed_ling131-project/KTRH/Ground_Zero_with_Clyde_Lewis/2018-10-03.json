[laughter] I don't know if you do that but anyway ah he asked me what I thought was going to be a the final blow a bit\nAnd I hate it would be you know get put on the spot like this because you know I'll say something and immediately ... Lewis says he's so full of crap you know I I you know short you know you can make\nPrognostications improper season you can predict stuff in the weatherman does it every day but no one says he's a liar you know and if you ... if he messes up no one's a liar well it's like what I Do is kind of like being a weatherman\nI feel around in a in a look around and I see what the atmosphere is I'm Wondering what's going on and and uh so I make my determination so Jones ... me and he said hey just tell me what this final blows give me what do you think it is that I said it's going to be a biological jak on the United states\nMeals I agree I agree that um and uh I think I'm going on the show again soon probably this will be a good follow up for that job when you're talking about this uh\nBut yeah I told him that I felt it would be a biological attack on the United states and speculate on many different occasions that this will be carried out because I started off talking about ... acts in may I talked about the the tabletop exercise of a pandemic\nSo there there are preparing for some biological attack some contamination some toxic release\nUm I talked to a geena function exercise is something that most people don't know about it I'm bringing to the forefront of talked about how sometimes in order to do a test run they they take a lesson virulent form of something and they released into\nThe public is test to see you know how people react to it sometimes they provide them with the antidote sometimes they see how many people checking\nThe hospital how many people stay home how many people bring it to work it you know it's just the way for a the CDC and others to to to monitor the movement a disease and some people don't support this and a lot of people say it's not good to do this but they do it anyway\nUm\nApparently there's new TV show about doctors called New Amsterdam\nOr apparently that was that's a show that's on TV Now and somebody had said that it deals with a guy who gets Bola Andy brings it to the United states on a plane\nAnd of course we talked about the arrow plague we talked about you know the situation that happened\nAh with the ah Emirates plane for other planes where uh you know there was um different diseases monkey pox and uh gosh all kinds of things are happening and it's all happening at once and they said\nThis is a is is again of these again are forced to exercise\nAnd ah I said you know something is going to happen where are the real thing is going to go down and when it does you know we'll know that this the beginning is the beginning of the final blow that\nIs I actually well and it could have been ... through the camp trails that could be you know given through mosquitoes so today I read that the Pentagon reporter the envelopes containing biological poison rice and arrived at the Pentagon\nOr the office of the president and centered Sen Ted Cruz's campaign office\nSo two packages containing rice and\nWe're in is intercepted by on the way to the Pentagon and the existence of the suspected packages was had been confirmed by the department of defense officials who indicated the packages never made it to the Pentagon itself the packages were flagged in the mail delivery building on Monday\nBut in announced that they were here until Tuesday that was located next door to the defense department and right there it's at its headquarters the FBI has been called in now\nTo lead the investigation ended up packages which we're addressing the secretary of defense James ... there was an address to James mad as chief of naval operations admiral John Richardson and the president Ted Cruz's office the FBI released this statement\nThis is a statement from the FBI on Tuesday October second twenty Eighteen in coordination with the Pentagon force protection agency FBI special agents took possession of too suspicious and below ups that had been screened at the Pentagon mail facility\nIs envelopes are currently undergoing further testing if this is ongoing will have no further comment on this\nShow as Washington DC has been working to figure out of this you know this was any threat to the president Ted Cruz's office said they received a piece of mail it was addressed the Senator Cruz happened this morning when the male is open it contained white powder\nAnd so the night for the Phoenix tower was evacuated after packages found Pentagon also reports that rice and was detected and that\nAh and and so we're having a full on biological attack biological a poison rice and\nAnd just reminded me if you remember when I was talking about the project for the new American Century I said something to the fact that ah one of the other ways that they can change the direction of anything politically is to use biological warfare and even biological warfare that has a certain abilities to mark\nA you know biological markers that would you would actually activate this stuff and and rice and acts upon your DNA if ingested\nOr if it's injected have you inhale it it's a you can survive a inhaling a rice and it's just that you can die if you're not taking care of\nSo uh it's just some uh pretty scary stuff going on right now and so you know timing is everything and uh I think that uh once again we're seeing history repeating itself because remember back in Nineteen eighty four\nThe Russian each called here in Oregon tried to poison the group of people to try and change the vote a in Dallas, Oregon\nAnd ah I think here we're seeing a somebody trying to either stop the investigation into cabinet or to believe that the investigation into Kavanaugh or what they're doing is they're trying to find a way to um distract us from it [noise]\nUh there's there's a number of things you know especially going down during this time that that I think is volatile time in this country and ah I said the other night on the ground zero lounge they probably will have this investigation wrapped up by Wednesday\nThey'll hand down their decision in the American people probably won't hear what the decision is and they don't have to the FBI doesn't have to reveal anything about their investigation they could put it to a vote and Kevin okay to be confirmed and I think it would\nTrigger a lot of anger with a lot of people in this country if Kavanaugh actually becomes chief justice and so tomorrow it to Eighteen\nEastern time they're gonna be doing that test and emergency test on your telephone so as I said timing is everything just as peculiar\nAnd uh I think we should have a discussion about this because I think that uh you know as we were predicting it I predict it on our Jonah show I talked about it at great length on this program for a good long time and people who is this program know\nLived on this people who let's this program know that if I'm On to something and I see the patterns these things go down and when they go down it's not necessarily to the exact here because I remember we talked about the pope stepping down when Ratzinger stepped down\n\nAnd we said oh you know he would probably lead retired die within three months he left the ... he left the papacy the one of my friends has really blown away by this but it was because we can see you know the talk we heard the we heard the Marines and rumors coming up from Rome\nAnd there are several other times in instances where we have a pretty much reported ... be prepared for this and it's happened or not always right Baugher damn close believe it or not for damn close and\nSo we're obviously seeing the beginnings of what would be the final blow if this gets out of hand [noise]\nI'd say be prepared because if the work goes down tomorrow that cabin uh [noise] some people aren't pleased we can see some more civil unrest in some of the major cities across the country [noise] so we have to prepare for that not that it will happen [noise] of repair if it does

and being a delivered to you know the Pentagon some address to the president I don't understand why\nThis is not being investigated and and uh people are wondering if this was an attempt to assassinate the president\nFor in a in a more broader sense that'd be ... should exercise because if they could send to all of the uh the people involved with the cabin for case you know packages of rice in ... they could have killed at every single one of them or make them sick enough where to stick to vote\nAnd they said before a this is something that the ... called did back in Nineteen eighty

that that called them are that that text tomorrow [noise]\nUm the the thing I keep thinking is is a couple of things is you know is it possible that is that anything is possible but is it possible that this could also be a distraction or I use that word by word but\nCould it be that actually\nThe right side the right thing so to speak\nOr could be putting this on as a distraction or whatever I'm too you know get some sympathy or whatever and then the other thing would be is um it's kind of interesting that they're targeting a course Donald Trump you know he's the head of the right and then you have\nTed Cruz which if you cruise Facebook\nYou know everybody seems to have Ted Cruz even though he's not really in the fall it anymore and the other interesting thing is is that Ted Cruz at one point wasn't he kind of\nA a guy that would have been considered to be a good a Supreme Court nominee so\nWell I don't know if we're getting to bench a secretary of defense James Mattis was targeting also chief of naval operations admiral John Richardson was was also targeted\nSure yeah I don't I don't know where their political affiliations why but\nBut see that's the thing is that if this was I mean obviously this is politically motivated\nOr we don't know do it for what reason it was politically motivated I Would say it was just work the investigation and the vote the confirmation vote\nI think that would give them a reason to we're going to stop this right now and we're going to investigate who was involved with sending the rice and but it's not going to stop the FBI the FBI's already made the decision and and I know they've already made the decision because um you know uh actually we were to ground zero allows discussing this and somebody said to me they said well\nThey're going to wrap this up by Wednesday they don't have to wait till friday and he said well ... weeks' time they don't have to wait all they have to do is go back over some existing papers

near the White House so they were sent I'm sure there were sent yesterday or the official announcement income today because they were wanting to inspect all the mail to find out of rice and was involved they made the announcement the rice and was in the packages wanting to of course\nSend to the president United States but what I find interesting is no reporting of is another major networks none in fact that they're focusing again on the ah there was again a cabin on board\nIn fact right now they're talking about the protesters I just talked about confronting of course Mitch McConnell and others of course getting in the faces I mean like they do it's like they're not getting in the faces of the senators\nAnd basically blaming them and saying that the Republican Party is the party of rapists and and this is this is amazingly out of line in my opinion\nIt totally out of line\nSo I mean who knows if he was responsible for his rice it and who knows what the motive is\nBut it just all sounds like it like I said the Nineteen eighty four tempted warning a boat or changes vision on a vote by the Russian each called in Oregon in Nineteen eighty four it's the same ammo\nIf the same purpose to somehow stall or otherwise uh for the efforts of either the FBI investigation or the voting for senator cabinet so yes the timing of everything and I like I said there would be a biological

you get an additional costs just not as far as [noise]\nBuying go to you when you call a program stick to topic it's going to fill up the hype fill up your own ground zero [noise]\nGot high I think it had a memory about the story that nice story that was going on in in the summer of two thousand one right before nine eleven and a matter of fact this morning the nine eleven before the fight our\nHead hunter reporters stayed out immigrants senator named ... ... and the investigation on the shorter levy remember that yeah I remember that\nIt it after the price of ours and they was getting a function of the art but after the towers that story was that was God I didn't hear about it\nOr do you say oh I Love you I mean but she she disappeared in May of two thousand one right and uh yeah I mean that was a the hot news item until the the towers went down and then that everyone was like by after that you know no more are talking about Gary Condit\nI'm thinking this is comparable with Kevin for well\nI I yeah I I but Gary wasn't planning on a ... ... being a chief justice [laughter] we're having one again we have an extramarital affair story we have a a dead woman Chandra Levy a we have an investigation started in may and probably just disappeared off the map\nAfter that no one cared about it because of the nine eleven attacks\nAnd you're right you know there's a ... that's a pretty big deal to cover up bad to have a bat but uh I Would say that you know they're not connected but I Would say that something like this once again distracts people from other stories and of course I'm sure many people\nLost track of what happened was John relieving the Chandra Levy case would Gary Cohn did that is if they were able to look through the ... the nine eleven attacks\nRight okay well I got out there and I'll let you get\nGood very good point though very good comparison history you get your brownie points for being a story about I think it class I loved it and you've been I Love you too man skilled at TJ in Rhode Island I\nDon't either I might be quick as much as I can be bought you obviously ... what does two plus one plus eight at up to\nTwo plus one plus eight yep ... eleven\nThat's right and what does two plus zero plus one plus eight add up to\nUm eleven\nOr try and when was nine what was what was that date back in September\nAnd then I ... when I was one plus one add up to nine plus one plus one\nYep twelve\nNine oh what a loving sorry that's right although nine eleven had the total eleven twenty Eighteen eleven you have this thing going on at two Eighteen as you said right which is an eleven eleven\nYeah and we just had a job or who was murdered in DC not too long ago\nRight to what was discussed just recently by the previous caller right Kentucky yeah it does have an air quality to it and\nYou might want to get technical when was the ground broken for the Pentagon\nWhat I've what day was that September eleventh All right yeah\nI Would say just one thing but I was calling up about the rice and to to go on Ben and I forgot where the young man was from but when he was speculating on it being possibly from someone on the Republican or or Republicans sympathetic side because if you recall back in terms of protective programming\nWhat happened to the general in Venezuela where they accused him of staging his little assassination attempt with that drone ... might have tip their hand right they're letting you know in advance what was coming\nWhile I mean you can see that there was something going on with these uh when I called these gain and function exercise I Believe the Emirates plane was part of that\nI Believe that when you have a group of people on the on the plane and they all complain of flu like symptoms all at once that's not a flu that something else and it does\nSmack of of rice and poisoning and I'll just to be cleared Nineteen forty one nine eleven September eleven Nineteen forty one was in the Pentagon round was broken for the Pentagon then so I Know nine eleven to be a talked about two\nAnd then remember overseas there's a lot of provocative behavior taking place upon the part of the United states for their already threatening to strike a Russian missile or install installation because of start\nTreaty violations and they're moving a shift to the U.S off to see a off of the Ukrainian coastline over there and they're Crimea right and so I mean there's a lot of powder keg occurring right now within the world right\nAnd so there are a lot of distractions but the thing is is that how are these distractions affecting the votes how are they affect you invest\nAll the vote I Would tell you you don't have to I wouldn't even worry about it because I'm already screaming now the court has been de legitimize by Mitch McConnell's machinations and when something comes down that's going to be a dramatic decision that will be the battle cry\nWill be confirmed yeah and when he finally does make a decision for something that will become a fifty fifty unpopularity then it will be pointed out that while you can politicize a court you can't make it political\nHow would you feel vote if the FBI did not release the information about cabinet and his activities when he was in high school\nOh I Would be I wouldn't be ripping but I've also ripping based on the fact that there's this ... this a speculation on the part of Fox News that they're going to already be finished by Wednesday\nOn space now you have the ... not ... I'm Sorry to tell you what's on speculation in fact I knew it was going to be done and over with on when ... knew that I heard it already from inside or that I have\nBut the speculation will be now that Mitch McConnell pressure them to wrap it up to a quicker than would necessarily be a\nNecessarily the FBI are quite frankly all they had to do is just a value wait a certain times in certain other things he could be guilty as hell and they wouldn't tell you\nOh yeah but I doubt metro call has to take the fall based upon the fact that they'll say his fingerprints are over this\nDoesn't matter they're getting what they are getting and the American people are going to a prize over it and that's what I\nTell you when you when you start playing with the very last\nWord because it's not right because it's the last word but it's ... it's the last it's ... it's the last word not because it's right but because it is the last word once you start making something from politicized the political that nobody's going to have faith and or in in the integrity of that institution anymore\nWell I think we've lost faith Eighteen years ago\nYou do really I Do I did and I have that's why I'm not political\nWell see that's why I don't understand your problem with people again being harassed you say by it I don't call that harassed and I think\nThat is around look if I if I get on an escalator and a woman says to me oh you turn your back on women is I treat women I look back at it and say no I'm On an escalator I'm getting away from you jumping all over me and yelling at me for something I have no control over\nBut they wouldn't be doing it to you because you're not a person who takes on the position of publicity and demanding attention\nAt it and then even then I had an\nAgreement because I still consider it better than a presidential candidate who says to people beat the cream cheese out of somebody and I'll pay for your\nLegal you know any excuses Trump I don't excuse Trump for what he says in fact he causes own problems on his own but when you have people\nThat that basically a sumo things about you in public and yelling out all over the place I get very angry about in fact I get mad when people assume things about me the run through and the reason why they\nStand on anything and you have I mean I don't know like you don't have\nIt didn't matter than antimatter than I Do have power I have I have three hundred stations across the country to give me power but\nIn terms of being able to directly affect change or not a politician you don't have that kind of power [noise] I don't know about ... celebrity yet that but again you don't take positions on anything you you offer hypotheses and have your gas and your uh\nSure I ... the seem to come through now don't that\n[noise] but that's still it's still something you let people debate you don't take a stab you\nThrow it out there and we all get to talk about right but the thing is DJ here's a thing as simple as I may be and it's maybe not as powerful as a politician I maybe I Swear to God I get accused of so many things in my article wrong and I and I said to myself how do people come up with this crap what are you will come up with this idea that I'm been some this and this is not\nYour personal throws out possibilities and say now discuss them well and\nYou know it was like people always say oh quite a show for the women look if I was in the ...
