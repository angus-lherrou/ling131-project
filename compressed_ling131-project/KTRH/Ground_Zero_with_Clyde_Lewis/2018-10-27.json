I'm just an average person\nBut I had some celebrities talking [noise] and they wanted the board and one lady who who son committed suicide at the board she 'cause originally the board was just\nThe same image but I put it on would ... with blue you know what I made a color copy ... [noise]\nAnd so I ... a lot of people in Los Angeles used it in one very famous actress and her son had killed himself and she reached out to us meaning me and my friend\nAnd I censor the board and she said that she had spoken to him Peter and thanked me and she's a very famous she's dead now a convention or if you if\nYou don't you go ahead and it was [noise]\nWas she was from the Dick Van Dyke show Mary Tyler Moore and she was very sweet very kind Rosemarie no she was Mary Tyler Moore\nOh Mary Tyler Moore was on the Dick Van Dyke shattered show on her own shows weren't time and more now [noise]\nBut she was very she was searching for ways to communicate\nAnd just understand so it is out of it so in other words what I'm saying it's not just the evil if you can ... you know to channel what you want I think\nBob [noise] was naive and he put he put this together to talk to his victims and then you didn't realize they're going to come\nAnd they come back and haunted him and he kept on driving around at one point in my ground fuzzy was it was in one day and then a month later he was in the town another town and then it caught up to them and that's um I think that's why he just and he killed himself he drowned himself and his body was ever found no\nBut he turned my he sent my grandfather a note I saw the note and it was typed because he never would write and free hand I'm never wrote anything down and he were type it or use stencil [laughter]\nWhat did he say to me what was his last words in the letter\nHe said that he can't take it anymore because of the the the stress that he's being haunted he said he made a mistake by making the board\nAnd people were haunted him that he is hurt and then he he went into a New Jersey beach town and walked into the water he said he was going to do it anyway and the letter\nAnd no one ever saw him again so my grandfather who was a much healthier a man like a stable man and he loved it loved Bob for all his faults and he said

power disclosed the path to forecast the future\nSo we know that the industry of do the talking board into the into the community of the spiritual Smith meant and also it in the United states only that it was an Eighteen Ninety the we used to board that we know today got its start\nIn Eighteen Ninety One it was patent and trademark and was in production at that point so there's always some interesting stories about that but an Eighteen Ninety to Canada bought some rights from us the United states to sell their own version of the leader board and so they started making boards and Eighteen Ninety two\nAnd the rest is history and so bored such as Bob board which again falls into category\nHockey boards a lot of sports after the ... makes it a prominent glass into the market I mean everybody was buying them and using them at the heyday I mean this has been a special moving with going big time and\nI was going on with their communication at the time that people started making copycat boards and started doing different types of their own type a board and of course we get the trademark patted her name they couldn't use that name\nRight so you have to use different names but I mean this is the story behind this board is rather unique I've never heard anything a particularly as unique as the story of of Bob being a a suspected serial killer or making a board ah basically it's ... it's almost as if it's penance for him to make this board so that he\nWould feel right about himself or what have you ah in his own special way I'm just curious if there are any other unique stories behind certain types of boards that have been released in the past\nThere there are many reasons that people make their own boards and as you mentioned earlier people do you make around and start customized and selling them um but the degree of this type of story no I never\nHeard of this story but there are reasons why people make boards and it could just be a personal their own little personal portal or they want to communicate with the deceased one or they see an opportunity to make money there's a lot of different reasons but this is a very unique case\nUm and it's I haven't heard ever heard of a serial killer making aboard before or I shouldn't say he was in a secular he was posted\nA legit or we don't know if he really was or not\nYeah we we don't know if you to be checked into somebody mental institution right in fact a you know\nThat's that's the that's the thing is the avoided a any kind of prosecution because he checked in a mental institution I mean in in since you've been using the board you've gotten longitude and latitude of you submitted any in any of this information to the authorities and if so did they take it seriously\n[noise] well it's just kind of awkward because I haven't really [noise] you know this is really just a small thing that I was just selling on on on we just put the color\nA Xerox is on on board and then I met this guy used to work for current affair which is an old TV show or on the which has only channel five or something right in the east\nAnd um she was really for years he was kind of trying to do something with the board\nAnd he worked on hate to like them show he did like producing I think mhm current affairs\nAnd then he was the one who introduced it to the guys that make these um [noise] it's a company called allied board and they make different games things and they took it to another level\nI think it's the same image to same exact you know but then they took it and they just put more quality thing with boxes and everything yeah\nAnd the and the background to write the background history\nYes and they were told and everything you know and they\nPut it down but they made it more like a sophisticated I guess but I'm the same story and it's a very and I tell people you know\nThat too I I made them put on there that you can't be under Eighteen years old because this is real this is really happened this really works\nAnd it's very scary and if if you have the wrong intentions and you know everybody is we call go to the same place at the end but says some bad people that are around and they go to you know so you don't want to send them back\nSo I always say that it's not a joke\n... no I'm In I Want to ask here and you know I have some idea of criteria that I have you know if I ever use the word I use the board in a long time let's be honest man used to board\nA gosh I Can't count back but I I I've been president during other sessions with boards I mean I Know somebody who has their own board they brought it in one night and they used it wasn't really a board it was just\nSomething that just rolled out like it was a laminated a lemonade peace that had a a crystal glass so they use them and you know boards rudimentary like that even even\nWhen you see the TV show stranger things that you kind of a mix you bored with Christmas tree lights so that her little boy you could go to the uh the little boy can communicate with his mother his mother\nUm you know ... it doesn't ... we really don't need boards do we care and I mean even the boards there or you can channel on your own and you can use a you know automatic writing and other things in my right\nYeah that's a good point and the board is really not doing the work we're doing the work ourselves the Borgias becomes a permission slip if you will or it becomes a stepping off jumping off point a springboard into being able to to access your own ability to this work\nA lot of people don't think that's the case and I I didn't think that was the case for many many years but when I realized what was happening here when I started working the board was at my own six cents ... started developing really started really being fine tune\nAnd taken about the way I can still do this work and be a lot of people use and the old days these typewriters [laughter] word processors now they use computer keyboards and the channel that way\nThat's what I find it to board the people at the tactile experience and the movement movement itself that kind of opens up the receptor so you can start bringing in the information right and so again I might be real clear the board there's no negative energy with any board that's why I have no problem\nHaving any board at my home so then I got an ... even this board that I'm that great uncle made 'em for his purposes I have no problem with that because I Know nothing negative will happen\nUnless I Want that to happen unless I Try to bring that to me or that my desire or that's how I view the world so people doesn't mean you know people in these scary about even talking about this on the radio\nWhile I have a hard though they they they bring in the they don't understand and this is what I Want to try and bring out with this whole conversation and they don't understand that a lot of this has to do with what's inside of them and it's a deal motor response is a bit our basic basically muscular suggestions are subtle suggestions in the mind that come from the unconscious\nIt's from deep within dream scape time it's like you're in there and and things come out of you I mean the human body in the brain are big transmitters and so the only way this can work as a transfer through the body\nAnd then the board as you say it's like a permission slip and it's like a way to to view I mean people would use pencils that I I used to do a medium that would ah would he would do his thing he would just scribble he would\nTake the pencil and he would just scribble on a new bad and it just scribbling scribbling as he scribbling for some reason he just doing the scribble he's looking at this go on all I see a scribbling but what I what he saw it was something else and so this was his way of I don't know what it was but it was just his way of kind of\nI don't know doing something with his hands on his mind was bringing in the information wherever you're getting it\nFrom so either you're scribbling or using a pendulum are you using something else but it certainly is there to have the mind generate or push through the body of the city of motor response that certainly is an interesting and you see it in an action tonight on grounds are talking about Bob's warrior care and\nA dominant program who is the director of the
