to be here again\nIt's good to have you and like I said ah it it's it's just amazing to be able to have you in such a time I mean\nAs I was explaining there seems to be like this shift in attitudes towards I guess you could call it conjuring attitudes towards what would be considered darker magic or some of the darker arts why do you think that this is starting up now why do you think there's a newfound interest in this\nI think people will be brought these ideas for for all kinds\nOf reasons I think you'll have people who will be drawn to choose things like social stairs there's a sense of that as an insecurity within society you see that happening\nIn Brooklyn tomorrow at these these wages are going to bind cabinet is other people look at things like you know\nQuantum physics and these ideas that reality is malleable to a certain extent and that\nThey won't they literally wanna test these ideas and they want to say well you know is it you know is the five cents reality is it malleable is it\nKind of change it cannot alter towards my will and still the only effective mechanism out there to do this as things like magic and so people are drawn to him for that reason as well I think also there's a there's a kind of the maturing going on at the mall and that it's almost living in the age where\nYou know people that look the especially in recent years we've seen like the behavior of the major religions in the crimes of the Catholic Church and other organizations have been exposed quite readily and people have set themselves with these guys are on the polling things and here they are telling us that you know which ... evil so\nIt is evil really considering the source was coming from and then I I think that's got a lot to do it I think a lot of people have a kind of a hunger now to see if they can test the boundaries of reality using their will\nAnd it's becoming more apparent that they can uh I was just talking last night\nWith Chris Jones Riggio we were talking about this new medium that is on the Internet right now that certainly is causing the the left wing of the United states to be disturbed because they say it's humanizing it it's certainly\nA

very simple way drawn but it's supposed to be there is some sort of a a I guess you could call it a toll ... or some sort of mean that that is spreading and certainly going viral and this is a form of magic\n\nI'd been taken a great interest in this as soon as it came to fruition on the electromagnetic spectrum last weekend I knew this was going to be something special\nThe like I I've been watching this whole thing around for ... and the way these people have been using ... for a few years now and we are in a different world there's a basically\nA a generation of\nInstinctual chaos magicians who are using things like mediums two actually mold reality in terms of the political structure medicine and this and the seeming is that is quite fascinating and not so much in its was putting out there but the reaction to it\nIt's it's it's tapped into something very visceral and frightening in deep within the people it's been it's been aimed act it's almost like the you know that that the judgment is the mirror and the mirror has been held up to these ... these kind of like a\nCultural ... painters or whether you want to call them and gather not happy they're not happy because they wanted to believe they were special and certainly they're realizing that the only thing ... they're probably just like androids\nYeah and that's the thing is that\nSaying oh the humanizing it
