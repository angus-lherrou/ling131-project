having me on now I used to introduce you as the\nOr do you call the magic stirred a manager of the church and state than I was a magistrate in the church so you're a manager that you're just said now you've created the carrier the chaos in period\nYeah I have my own my own order\nNow you know what kind of order is it is a the a six eight and a shorter is it a witch order wizard order what kind of magic quarter is\nThe case from hearing is the most advanced black magical order\nIn the world and essentially we see the prince of darkness as a a ... and being at a doesn't exist inside of physical space time is outside of that is not involved\nUm in just a center around the idea of worship but that to this being can actually be contacted through a actions involving um the highest forms of black magic\nAnd uh we see this being something that we can learn from directly because we can become like it it's the our position is to become God like beings\nAre in a in the elation\nOf this first formed principle which is responsible for all ... life in the cosmos\nSo we're talking about a dark figure that you have this contract with but it's on it's dark has its mission it is on the Leighton right it's not state and\nSay and then in of itself has a\nHas a a a kind of a dumbed down I'm a\nIdea of this super consciousness inside of physical space time it's a and this guy stiff 'em rebellion and a a decadence and\nI'm a heating ism but uh the ultimate elevated form of this as a stoic looser furry and form\nWhich is where we are\nAre actively involved in so I'm forever action there's an opposite ... equal reaction so as you see manifestations of ah forms going to a a higher spiritual forum or as\nA decision to to forcefully moved the intellect and the psych through physical space toward a higher uh form you're going to the replica ripples in in its back wash that are going to manifest themselves as decadence and degenerate but we're also living inside of the cyclic nature of the Kelly yoga\nWhich is a ... and understanding of cyclic time in this position that's happening right now is the degenerate\nI'm a sales oriented um cosmological construct within the human physical ... of action and form that is at its lowest uh\nA continuum it's it's the worst possible position we can actually live in so you're going to see this like all across the board politics philosophy art music um\nYou know a cultures et cetera\nIs this something that ah the chaos because some very him do they relish this or were they like to see a higher form of been lightened meant there would be more refined satanism\nRunny actually acts absolutely no interest in what happens to the rest of the world no interest at all no we're we're we're we're Paul bearers of western civilization were just watching it happened the rest of us are just moving toward something that's a continually outside of that\nSo you're waiting for all of us to destroy each other than you guys move in and basically we'd be the you know\nWe're not even interested in in in the earth we're interested in transcending me on even that position singer and sending one day and they are really unhappy about is the fact that there are so much\nA destruction of the beauty of this planet and a lot of that was manifested in things such as an animal abused child abuse is I think we think this kind of thing is really a a really horrific actually animal abuse even worse as far as we're concerned because of the true\nI'm a a\nHolders of the of the planet you know they were here before we were and we've come a long and we've like eradicated\nA their land um\nOr their position in the world you know they're they're ... they're simple rights to live so well actually I don't really buy ... well I I is is that the you know we've we've ... overrun all of that and I just think that there should be some kind of vengeful action against that type of\nThing but it will actually give animals using child ... oh yeah absolutely um you know it's interesting because I said that statement earlier I said satanism now it's harder to find black magically well yeah I mean you will for more you are you talking about ... black magic\nBut I'm Talking about how now where the ... the definition of what satanism is it's not easy I remember when I first met you and I talked to her back when you were part of the C O s\nI uh I I was trying to put a handle on what's sameness believed or at least the way in St Louis believed\nAnd uh before it wasn't easy to find satanism it's getting even more difficult to divide and said that the actually say that the would say is there is any more because\nWe go for like a like I said we go for the most ridiculous definitions to the more psychotic definitions of what it is and I was just curious is this why you left the church\nIs safe you know a ... satanism which is the ... a a fairly universally and philosophically recognized as the first manifestation of a true a church and devoted to satanism too I'm an acknowledgement of the devil I'm as a a as a symbol for\nUm a form of personal internal evolution and that each and every man and woman is their own satanic deity moving to try and become something greater than what they are\nUm there's within the like the last Twenty years there has been literature that has flooded a literal a cottage industry of books that have come out claiming to have been some type of\nOf former age old undiscovered um clan Gaston form of a U.S the satanic worship that um that you can tap into and that's just not true\nI'm a scholar of black magic in satanism and I've researched it and it's it's either a um [noise] highly embellished ideas around a satanic dating or be blatantly neo a manifestations created\nBy people who are who are betting that you don't know anything more about it than they do well\nMost people that I remember when I first uh\nWas interviewing you there are a lot of people by identified with what you say they were saying well we identify with what rex who say we we we'd been and are either of them and saying well I find uncomfortable I find it uncover all that I'm agreeing with what he said because of your position in the church and state and now you have your own group of like magic magicians and\nI mean your message really hasn't changed all that much only that you seem to be more or less like you said Paul bearers to the fall of western civilization\nMeaning you're standing there watching it all the collapse around you and then you'll be cleaning up and basically we won't be\nCleaning up or escape ing it altogether but then when I ... I'm just saying that you know I\nI Am I'm looking at what's happening and I'm I'm recording it but I'm not part of it um the the chaos impairments\nA transcendent order when we say transcend that we're talking about the ultimate most uh virile form of spiritual\nUm a a a destiny and\nA descent so I'm the only way that can actually happened is to be able to remove oneself from the human equation altogether right okay so\nUm because we see that this this ultimate deity form which actually cannot in any way be defined because she doesn't exist inside of physical space that Supreme talking about which I use language you weren't trying to use formula mathematics whatever transcribing you can't really do\nThat was difficult it's difficult to actually quantify I've said this before when I have arguments or aliens and demon ... demons are mainly a spiritual into ... to not be quantified it's not in touch with\nSome tangible you somebody that enters in and wants to have you done even if not physical it's got a a an energy signature it can be measured and therefore it so it's a physical bay shore\nIn that way and it existing inside of physical space jobless rex with us tonight on ground zero [noise]\nChaos period is the group and he represents formerly the churches Satan and that we're talking about black magic we're talking about the state of the world on Halloween Night believes except for three thirty seven hundred extremely fix up at three thirty seven hundred I'm quite Louis [noise] it was to be ground zero we'll be back [noise]\nNews radio seven forty Katie our age [noise]\nI needed new lines I knew I could save a ton of money if I put them in myself but I was nervous about measuring right and then in selling them that's why I went to blinds dot com I heard their ads on the radio or the number one online retailer custom window coverings\nBut I still had to install them so I called them I designed consulting Carla she talked me through it all from picking the right blinds to installing them class online defined consultation was free samples were free shipping was free my looks perfect\nThe holidays are just weeks away but there's still time to get your home guest ready with brand new made to order custom blind the blinds dot com now through November fifth by one blind to get the second one sixty percent off plus take an additional five percent off ... y to blind dot com we promo code might\nOf self Sam Houston ... telephone road was gonna crash they're taking the writer lanes and to any aid south busted Holmes wrote to ride lanes are blocked with a collision\nI ten ... ad Waco street in an accident in the right lane and some high water reported along I forty five southbound FBI ten Katie freeway exit ramp [laughter]\nI'm like rocks and the Gulf Coast windows dot com twenty four hour traffic center [noise]\nWeather Channel forecast a strong storms probable for the rest of the overnight localized three flooding is possible we've already heard about it in some areas lows in the upper fifties and remember there is a a a a ... a severe thunderstorm warning\nFor a western Galveston County that's going to go on for about another Fifteen minutes for lived up or seven forty weather radar anytime go to ... to your age dot com and click on operation storm watch right now there's Seventy a and a showers at the Katie outrage west I north side Lexus twenty four hour weather center\nIt is ten thirty wanted our ...
