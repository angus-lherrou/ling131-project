you and your Newsmax Daily Caller Daley wire Drudge Report I think you're good to go\nI agree except what I find is that mainstream media where people don't have the jets and meet they don't go to

would say we're going to cover news objectively moderate\nTo the right side of things wouldn't they make billions of dollars because you can't NBC ABC and CBS it's the same newscast every night at

know she she was a stupid and they said they said well I guess because they're starting to accusing him of going after you got to prosecute its its competitor and why is he whining about how unfair it is it's cracking me\nI'll tell you what's unfair criticism on your picture our first lady has a stripper engaging in sex acts in the oval office\nAnd the mainstream media doesn't care about it and the other floated says don't gather around my lawyer to protect her can you imagine if Michelle Obama was captured in a a video performing sex acts in the oval office well with the media due to the person that did that to Michelle Obama\nHigh there is none because it's Trump is Mrs Trump ... that no outrage\nIs sufficient to cause criticism as long as it's Trump Bullock we gotta go Chris thanks for

that remember that night I become a vet night okay my memory is it's kind of follow the right now\nOkay so so okay so\nThe whole Russia Russia Today I went to look for the notes and\nNothing nothing\nSo something weird happened last night too and this is this is a this is from a read a page or write a\nRabbit is reporting that there was a fall worldwide shutdown of YouTube last night there was because we were having a hard time preparing our show because a lot of the stuff we use for a montage has been for\nA music in liners and stuff we get from you know we get the audio from you too we couldn't get audio last night for a lot of things because you too would shut had been shutdown full worldwide shutdown of YouTube and there are rumors flying around as to why this outage happened\nAnd one of the cheap rumors is and I'll read it directly from a ... this is from read it okay\nIf anyone has the footage of but many in uniform warning of an impact on the moon last night before you to shut down a took it off please share\n\nBrewer is that YouTube\nHad to shut down a viral video of a man in uniform there was pointing out that the moon was about to have struck by something\nOr he didn't say what it was he didn't have ... people say they thought it was like it had hundreds of thousands of hits and then it was taken down and then all of a sudden you to shut down\nOkay\nSo that's a mystery that's tacked onto this you know I was notified by an email a guy named Scott who told me I got to go back and see ... ... email\nUs Scott told me he says have you seen this video he was mentioning the video he said it to me like five six teen\nOkay okay\nAll right so he said have you seen this video and and I and I didn't know what he was talking about\nAll right so you to shut down to the moon get hit by an asteroid or was it as\nA cyber attack here's another Youtube video saying was shut down because of this whole moon thing\nOkay so I mean I'm getting now I'm getting bombarded with emails and all kinds of other pointers and and and references to what happened last night with you to shut down\nUh [noise]\nSo that's something that's mysterious something had crashed on the moon and they didn't want anybody you see it hit the moon so they shut down YouTube to keep people from watching it because it was going viral\n[noise] now\nIt's like I said that sounded like a lot of science fiction disinformation right and and the fact that you can go back and reference things but I Do know what I talked about two nights ago I Do know I played those homes I Do know that I played a frequency that was being sent by the so called armada\nAnd\nThis armada apparently the sounds coming from is shut down the radio stations a couple across the country now YouTube shuts down okay it's back up again today but all this reminded me of an old science fiction film called earth versus the flying saucers and what happens in that film\nIs that rockets and missiles and satellites all get shut down because the aliens are planning to arrive they're planning of land\nAnd so I got to thinking about what's been happening in the past few days first of all the Russian rockets so use MS can\nFeel the launch on its way to the IOC says according to a statement that was released by NASA\nThe so use that as ten spacecraft launched from about ... nor Cosby drumming conflicts done to the international space station for forty ... am eastern daylight time Thursday October eleven or carrying American asked Rodney Kagan Russian cause not Alex C o engine shortly after launch\nThere was an anomaly with the booster and the launch ascent was aborted resulting in a ballistic lending of the spacecraft\n\nBut lunch appeared to be going smoothly but about Ninety seconds later NASA on his life's dream reported that a problem seemed to have occurred with the booster rocket between the first and second stages of separation the space agency tweeted that ballistic descending above the sharper angle of landing compared to normal the castle containing the abstract successfully separated from the rocket booster\nAnd parachute into the ground with a rescue teams were there to pick them up it's also interesting to know the two of NASA's important space telescopes when did the safe mode\nShutting down about sending information back but\nThe shawndra X ray observatory when did the same boat and halted all the science operation is a few days after Hubble the Hubble Space telescope\nShut down due to a gyroscope failure\nAccording to the agencies genres a transition at the same boat as possibly triggered by an issue that also had something to do with this gyroscope component in charge of pointing and stabilizing telescope however there are some investigators and those were into deep space conspiracy theory\nThey're saying that something is happening in space that NASA does not want us to see\nAnd ... and and just out of coincidence NASA's curiosity Mars rover it's temporarily halted science operations to there's been a glitch with that so that we can't see anything from Mars\nCan't see anything from Mars here's an overnight bulletin it hasn't made national headlines yet but here we go NASA's planetary defense coordination ops are offices\nTwo year old a two year old the organization that NASA's it's NASA's planetary defense coordination office two years old it started with a budget\nIt started with a small budget and now it's gone to overnight and they they spiked it to a hundred and fifty million dollar budget for this a planetary defense coordination office\n\nFirst of all it was Ninety million dollars I wouldn't know sixty million dollars he went from sixty million dollars to one hundred and fifty million dollars overnight and says you're amid growing concerns of humanity is utterly unprepared for the unlikely but still an ... an asteroid strike of climate is proportions\nThe White House has also recently issued a new national near earth object prepared to strategy an action plan intended to energize a host of agencies who could contribute to potential ways to prevent such a disaster\nSo Ninety million more dollars I mean we have nothing to concern about why is it the shot up to a hundred and fifty dollars a hundred and fifty million dollars\n... white issue a brand new plan that it's intended to energize the host of agencies who can contribute to potential ways to prevent such a disaster if there is no debt disaster looming for the foreseeable future something is that right about all this something is definitely wrong here\nI mean it feels like a really scary B horror science fiction film it sounds like a war of the world scenario it sounds\nToo weird to be real but it is real it's happening\n\nI mean these these shutdowns I mean remember the sunspot observatory was shut down on September Six twenty Eighteen\nAnd then all this stuff is good chicken shut it got to remember all the other space observatory to shut down after\nThe September ... shut down in New Mexico\n\nI mean these shutdowns remind me of what happens before an alien invasion well he's from a science fiction perspective I mean and I I don't want I don't want it to be about this but I guess it all depends how you look\nAt what is going on around you and everything around us is is is is it just it sparking a lot of anxiety I was feeling really bizarre all day to day a lot of tension in my neck a lot of uh I couldn't concentrate\n\nI couldn't concentrate something was up and then

I don't think it was a mother and my son and then in the train those are that's like a real real Peter ... to me you know there was\nJust bizarre I think it's bizarre that the that's the sound uh that uh they picked up on and and while it's in the science journals still you know geoscience journal saying well this is what we think is some seismic waves were picking up on others are saying well this is this is sending is like you say this is like a repeat or\nSending something that was certainly a is bizarre especially in all the coincidental something going on in the past three days\nThat I liked it off the single going in and then coming out it's the same and the strength\nAnybody anybody can take the signal and they could speed it up or slow it down to see if there's anything inside the stigma because I used to have a guy who he would hear signals he'd say well let me speed it up and see what I get it needs to be to have all this like rpm and you get all these weird sounding side bend voices going on\nSo are there you know whatever they said that could be I get really even slowed down side band or a spin upside banned it could be a lot of things at the moment though they're saying this is what they're getting these are seismic waves or they could be the wind and they're not sure they saying it could be under the cross or it could be something going over the crust decreed this type of\nUh the sound uh it does sound very much like something out of preventing planet it sounds like something to be from an old Nineteen fifty science fiction film\nAnd uh once again I I played it and I get I'm getting worried that when I play that I got some jamming going on so I don't know if they're trying to block me from plane as I was going on and kind of reluctant to play it again but maybe if I get enough demand I'll play it again so people can hear\nOne quick question and a ... more about that you sort of CERN\nStructure in front of the sun\nI thought that might have something to do with all this\nIt it's one of those things that we get out into the the ... that's for sure that something you know that they were looking into it sunspot\nCertainly connected to this we we we never know though I mean sunspots shut down all the telescope shutdown\nWe have the rover shutting down on Mars and then we have YouTube shutting down so he sent me the Amazon shut down in I don't know what that's about it but maybe maybe something else is going on maybe this is some sort of a test maybe I don't I don't know but it just seems a little weird a little awkward to be talking about a possible alien invasion some people are feeling like this is how many of the invasion would begin that\nYou know you we campus or use rocket going up its into back down and get away you can't go into space the INS is abandoned\nOr you know all these things are happening and no one's giving an explanation as to why except the budgets going in to protect the planet from extraterrestrial attack had just increased Ninety million dollars which is also something to pay attention to\nIt then you go to like the winter may but\nI wouldn't have either I agree with you mark thank you so much for the call I agree it doesn't sound like the wind doesn't sound like anything like that it it's\nIt's just too peculiar and if you tuned in and I a lot of strange things happening you to shut down last night possibly because of a viral video [noise]\nIt was sent by some man who apparently a looked like he was military warning people to something was about to hit the moon\nIs also putting down going round of what looked like an armada of UFOs going into the moon or going around the moon\nAnd we have the Chandra X ray a telescope in space to shut down due to a safe mode glitch humble shut down because of a saint ...
