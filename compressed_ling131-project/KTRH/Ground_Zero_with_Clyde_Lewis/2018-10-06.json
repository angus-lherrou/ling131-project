Michel ... how much information that can be an right no brain no human brain that can really get all that information\nSo I think the reason why that are so many crystals called out to the mall nuns asked to give people the opportunity to train\nSo they can access information and crystal skulls so that to get her and this will be a very very important point to get it we can piece to gather information at the ancient put into the crystal skull\nAnd I think that's important it's very important because as you say or quartz crystal is a recorder it does ah maintain a or at least holds onto a ancient technology each information and as you were saying you talked about the the ... you talked about\nUh just what they used it for the use it as a transmitted the the uh the arc of the covenant was an example of a of a cue\nThe holy ... through the temple example because you and uh they actually utilize the courts crystal crystal skulls imports love mind temple ... they were able to utilize these very artifacts ancient ancient technology but it's been used in the past that we have here in Studio tonight\nBill home and with this and also on the phone Dr John ... with its the talk about the crystal skull more information coming up\nAnd your calls her belief examined three thirty seven hundred as Tripoli six seven three thirty seven hundred I'm Lou as you listen to ground zero and we'll be back [noise]\n\nAre you considering a safe to secure your valuables or firearms let's face it seeps are not very attractive they usually end up getting stuck in the garage or in a closet\nWouldn't it be great if there was a saint that had to look up a beautiful antique so you could display it in your living space as an air a little while also having easy access to it while there is check out the\nHere's blamed ...
