thank you had a quick question I'm trying to gain some a little bit of understanding and and I I mean I Know deep down what the answer is but [noise] ... from a logical standpoint let us know few years ago Mr Obama\nFiled federal suit against the state of Arizona and Governor Brewer for trying to enforce immigration laws they successfully argued that immigration was the sole per per view of the federal government [noise]\nWell now we go back and at that time ... the state of California and a few other states joined with the federal government to win that argument\nWell no that Mr Trump is they're trying to actually enforce immigration laws some of the same states are suing saying oh wait we can do our own thing as well such as California with the uh [noise] a sanctuary cities yet\n... it's ... it's because it's when they don't they ... people need to understand about liberals\nThey don't have a set of values they stick with its the values I think at that moment will help them the most that's the reason why they're willing to do whatever I mean there are ... million you a liberal it's easier to be a Democrat in politics because no one will ever criticize you for for ...\nNo one will ever criticize you for doing one thing or saying one thing one day one day and doing the complete opposite the next day me in\nThe ... is the part where I'm confused as is if there's what the court to who sit there and argue the whole the whole notion of story to the east coast and stuff like this yet those same courts are stepping back and in reality they're decisions don't stand\n[noise] well you got to remember\nWe're talking about ten years ago when Obama was talking about enforcing the border and that that issue Democrats thought was less popular to be anti border security now they're they have to go all in on it Rick because if they don't eventually I think they'll keep losing the Republicans like Donald Trump\nThey need new voters in here and they need to give out amnesty and they need to do a quick it and if you had to enter the I mean we could take cruises a perfect example with is that the race if all the illegal immigrants in Texas could vote Ted Cruz will be done Oh absolutely absolutely\nAnd and you could argue that there's virtually it's impossible to win a presidential election if you as a Republican don't win Texas for darn sure and really there's a very good chance every time for us to when you got to win Florida because you're never going to win California well if you can turn Texas to them\nFor the Dems those three states ... it's\nVirtually impossible to do math that makes it were Republican to win the White House so all you need to do to switch Texas over is just skip the illegal immigrants are there the ability to vote\nAnd then you've got it the same way that you have it in California\nThe same exact way\nBy the way we've got some very important breaking news Rosie O'Donnell you know she is very serious

about there are different ways of thinking we're hearing that you know we're hearing in the quantum immortality I mean science is basically going all\nParanormal\nAnd they want to quantify all the paranormal in a scientific way scientific way like ah they want to be halfway with their religion and they want to eat half way with the conscious that they want to do ... and this is where I was looking for about how here we are\nGoing to ship this ... this was a a major paradigm shift and we have a temporal blind spot in some regard because events happened or we perceive they do\nAnd then later we're schooled on the idea that everything we perceived\nAs wrong\nThat what we think we know it was done exactly what is that somehow we reach a point\nWhere we're satisfied with their opinion\nAnd all that it's based on his bowl nebulous stimuli we all agree to this and it's like this is my opinion and this is my\nTruth and you say well it's not truth it's just what you think it is see it's all about your selective perception and we know that selective perception is necessary because we didn't have selective perception\nWe wouldn't be transfixed by the hyper reality and sensory

perception of time\nI mean the brain can be objective it been chooses to however it's emotion that is driving these guys and so there's this war going on between the brain\nAnd subjective experience and this is what they call the explanatory gap where we've had to bridge the brain consciousness experienced emotion critical announces we're struggling with primary consciousness right now where we wonder if the experiences worth feeling it all we get this shoveled in this disenchanted experiences and feelings we get now are both natural and organic\n\nAnd of course now we experienced a virtual meeting hyper reality from electronic allusion it's unfortunate that we're seeing more and more people responding\nTo the electronic illusion they're becoming a non player they're becoming a person who just sits there and watch it watch things or you know go in front of them they they they decide that you know it's better to read the script that it is to follow the follow their own hearts and follow their own minds\nSo there are a lot of people that are getting fatigue right now\nOver what George Orwell called double speak double speak actually disguises the nature of the truth giving new meaning to words with what appeared to be scripted dialogue and it's provided by the party and it's never ending\nPropaganda that keeps pushing and pushing and pushing see many people who live there not had the the time nor the guess desire to read the book Nineteen eighty four\nOr by George Orwell usually but you know they say things like a big brother's watching you ride ha ha ha you know or you know ignorance is strength or you know that kind of stuff they they know a few lines right\nBut big brother was not only watching in Orwell's dystopian he was capable of brainwashing and skipping the drones or groom to follow the wishes of the ministry of love\nThe George Orwell was a British Intelligence officer and with his ability to see the possible future he predicted a totalitarian world

like\nWhat are now being called non player characters see non player characters and PCs or the newest name that have appeared on Twitter and Facebook and they seem to be a form of kind of propaganda against the liberal left\nOut\nAnd NBC has a mean there are there are and the season games gamers knowing NBC's are okay or actual NBC's or computer control characters in video games with limited scripted responses I'm given the parameters of the games which they appear for example NBC's bad sign missions to a player like in skyrim\nOr they joined the players a companion like in fall out but they create is NBC mean\nAnd what it is is that it's basically there to um to attack or a mock what it's called left wing propaganda and I think\n... is cleverly I I think it's being used cleverly to explain what we usually hear his program responses regarding things like fascism\nWhere it's like not being overused outright connections to the KKK and the NBC mean mocks left us and they make it the base of getting expressionless face is kinda like um\nA statement face and it it is and and you can see these things on Twitter read it in for Chan and over the weekend twin responded by suspending

he's\nGetting sick again I Know you know she's she's been coughing and they've been getting it on on on\nOn TV lately\nAnd the thing is is that this all goes back to Pepe the frog which was a character that they were using\nTo a ... that was I guess a precursor\nTo the un PC and they're saying you're you are at being with the fabric of reality this is black magic please stop you are happening with powers you don't understand if you keep this up you could miss all out of existence\n\nChris geo ...\nIs this a form of black magic I mean I thought about that you know I never did talk about Pepe the frog\nAnd the reason why is because I knew it Pepe the frog represented a lot of people had mixed mixed feelings about Pepe was another one of these meetings where they used Pepe to represent a lot of things from racism to what have you it was kind of a just a stupid frog but he was a menacing\nOf the medicine type of me now they have the among kill us this balding it looks like actually one of the characters of dollars through crowded it it kind of dreamed up\n\nWell you know what's interesting is um it said Joe magic as you mentioned before and essential is when an outcome Mr Black magician will take a series of letters or symbols\nAnd you may not necessarily recognize them but I notice that this Pepe the frog guy he was he was drawn very strangely just like these NBC's\nThe anti seeming to try and very strangely now I'm not that familiar with a cult symbolism but I'm pretty sure that if you look at ... work or something like that you can find something similar with a similar type of symbol it's being blasted on the human consciousness him over and over and over again\nAs a matter of fact I'm Crowley how to spell that he used to do and this was something that he was very famous for him he\nUsed to be able to take control of the body of one of these on PCs and he was why there's a story of him walking down the street with a some prime minister or something like that and he says watch this and he points to the guy in front of them any needles down and the guy in front of them starts kneeling down almost as he is controlling them like a puppet\nNow if one person can do this and matching what's going on through the Internet through the mainstream media so on and so forth and people have lost their ability to think if I can take a political here for just a moment I'm coming into this\nSelection I've just been so jaded by the oligarchy that we've had that I thought that you know it's just going to be the same BS coming through the pike and then when Trump got it I was still a little skeptical but I'm looking at Trump and thinking wow I Can't find any fault in this guy I mean you know I don't agree with everything he does but considering what we've had in the past\nTrump is has actually done a really good job the only thing I can fault him for is that he likes to eat a steak well done with ketchup which to me I think should be an impeachable offense to ruin an iguana fake like\nThat I mean you look at his behavior sometimes they're ... times but you know he's the president and I mean president that act that way

locking the relationship between two six ... six times six times fix\nThere are plenty of other numbers and it can ruin the Bible the hundred and forty four thousand uh there's\nAlways the third like the third of the angels rebelled against God remaining two thirds remained with God and then there was the one third the rebuilding and they remained with state and it's all these magical numbers so if you do the math\nYou got a hundred and forty four thousand divided by two sixteen get you thick thick thick thick thick thick thick thick thick fabric for an item to divided by three two thirds point six six six number two thirds remained with God eventually became in one third of the rebelled against God what was Satan\nFix cube decor six type six times fixes to sixteen you divide one hundred and forty four thousand by fix fix fix you get to sixteen to sixteen to succeed just added that that\nThat is the workload God that is the key okay and numbers and images and cheese and codes\nAre all part\nOh the matrix system wherein so even God who is the probably the most intelligent program or we have no it was the power of means symbols numbers and coats\nAnd this is white tonight the argument that we're making Chris Jewish Riggio her on the program that I be arguing the argument that we're making is that we live in a matrix\nAnd the reason why is because in PCs non playing characters are easily programmed the organics the ones that are that they use a good I'd say critical analysis are the ones that will not be programs and they are the ones\nThat are going to try and pull us out of whatever it is rent otherwise we'll be mesmerized by this online magic Chris geo will go back to ground zero it's good to have a year\n[noise] um let me finish up this point I was making real quick about the politics because here we have the mainstream media\nI'm putting out a program and the program has been racist racist racist racist thrown at the White House right and then all of a sudden Kanye West shows up and he has this meeting at the er at the White House and what I saw was the dissolve meant of the ... agenda\n'em to divide on race and then the mainstream media turns around and uses a derogatory term against ... that I Will not repeat on this brought to have the N. word but it\nIt go ... and ... to show how the script all of a sudden change the law or\nHave you ... did you see the the the there was a traffic it was being blocked in Portland\nThe anti ... members were blocking and directing traffic world guy pulls up at a car\nAnd some guy who was holding a plate of tacos I don't know why but he was with the group and he started yelling at the guy goes you look like a Whitey I bet you're a Whitey aren't you he says to him I'm gonna go on this guy's a white guy calling another guy all Whitey same with what happened was ... we have a a a black faceless and PC\nOn CNN calling ... n word that can read is what he said\nExactly and so all of a sudden what happens is that the script just changed on the PCs and they don't know how to handle this and it just goes to show they're just running a script or that they've been pre programmed with so um you were talking about numbers and a number so symbolism\nAnd numbers play a big big role in this you were talking about the ... and PC means the way the means or ... and so on and so forth I mean there are so many different levels that we can take this to come\nFrom what direction do we break this down in because well I just it's huge I just want to\nPoint out that parents and they can actually called me and this was before this is like not in Nineteen Ninety this is\nTen Twenty years before this time that we're in right now it's called the mean\nThe smallest unit of an idea that still has coherent see and what a genius to biology I mean it's to ideology and so you need a lawn chair mean boldly and see if that will replicate just like jeans replicate and in fact and move into the organism that society and the leading as I Do that society operates on a kind of\nBiological economy then I Believe these names are the key to societal evolution\nAnd you see with within PCs I I\nJust have to say it's almost like they they don't understand how to even make means\nIs that it doesn't make any sense to in order to send them in some way whereas the organics are full of them in and constantly creating these means and they really do change our society and drastic ways very quickly\nWell maybe I could use some other magical terms of people are more familiar with like top as a there's a ... a mind form that is that when you manifested becomes an ... which is of course another a cult concept which is a thought form or a collective group mind making a thought form that becomes a ton of it's kind of like slender man okay\nI I Would say this Letterman's kind of an egg regards Letterman really\nSentiment is is fictional he was made on the Internet okay but he becomes real\nWhen two little girls lure another girl into a playground and ... and stab her\nBecause they say that this this egg records that serving a master whichever the master the creator is is actually influencing these girls to go and kill something\nSo that's what you got you got a a mean you have a toll but you have an ... and those things are are set out to grow and to become either monsters or or just serve in once again ... the ... says the same thing and what is\nThe un PC me it is the bald\nThe you know ... basically does the will of its master\nRight exactly and it it really it's it's one of the stock changing devices that that as a result it's the backlash\nAgainst this these autonomy and that in the auto autonomous I guess you could say\nOr anti autonomous thinking process that just totally dissolves any boundaries that that that whenever the media or whatever the the whoever's in control of all this is putting out it dissolves all of that in a in a\nSplit second and it and if that's what makes him so angry about this when ever people do come up with means that really did change people's minds up really quick way\nWell this is even more ancient magic let's go back to the Jews okay let's go back to ...\nWhat was going but he was a a it was an animated anthropomorphic being made of clay that was there to protect it was a monster that was created to protect the Jews pretty much it was there to protect the children in Prague and and so they created this\nThis this creature out of clay or he was harmless to to ah those he was a made for but he would attack those who are trying to attack them\nAnd and so this is the same principles the idea of creating an Internet gum creating an Internet home to as an Internet tool or an Internet agra Gore if people you know they don't understand the meanings of means means are certainly like this they are the thought forms that when when they are unleashed\nThey can cause trouble they can call it causes ill will once again goes back to what Chris has been saying is is if it's so easy to create a ... if it's so easy to create an\nAnswer ... perfect form that is illustrating a programmed a ... if you will\nThan we know that we live in a matrix we live in a programmable world that the that they're it's getting easier to program because people are becoming more susceptible and not dealing with plane consciousness\nThey're not dealing with a movie called primitive consciousness the idea that they can either feel or understand anything at all and I think this is the confusing part is because people are getting so confused now\nThat they're reaching a point where they can't even find you know simple\nConsciousness they have to seek it out elsewhere Christian a tree deal with the sit on the ground zero fasting discussion and I [noise] Tripoli six seven three thirty seven hundred Tripoli six seven three thirty seven hundred if you've seen the end piece seeming\nIt's certainly a central is most certainly a sign if it's some form of Internet magic sorcery they were\nTalking about that on ground zero it's very real and it's very effective\nAnd that's why we're talking about if you are a modern
