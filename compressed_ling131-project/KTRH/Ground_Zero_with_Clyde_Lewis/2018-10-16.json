would start breeding in America and you know I Know that\nPeople ... near the the very suggestion that the United states is starting to resemble some sort of a dystopian a Ninety maybe for those do you have ski um position by demons type of thing um in fact I brought up ... says story\nOr when I did my show the other night uh when I was talking about uh what was happening in Portland\nOr we had over the weekend we had a the the the rival a groups get together and fight in downtown Portland and so uh it was certainly you know ... the thing that I had to stay out again and do work or because of the fact that\nUh they needed someone to go wall to wall and I'm not complaining because I I Want to be a non be or I Want to be in on the secrets I Want to know about the big things that are being planned I Want to know\n'em I Want to know who's involved and why and so I brought up this book called possess the doubles it's a book was written by a ... and uh it was pre revolutionary a it worried the details but the middle\nClass society would be destroyed drew a crackdown on dissent denial is\nExpected to revolt in a way to the time\nWhere the people would rise to the occasion and give the power structure a reason to pounce on them and remind them of their place in the food chain\n\nDenial is expected some sort of revolt so they awaited the time whether people would rise to the occasion and give the power structure a reason to pounce on them and remind them of their place in the food chain basically giving the power structure heartening to resolve the power structure to literally come in and clean house\nYou know began and does the U.S he's book it began with the silencing of the people the silencing of those people who are putting forth to the fired state power that would happen\nYou know they went and they shut down they shut down the you know the printing presses they shut down or you know journalists silencing people their free speech the freedom of the press everything taken from them and little by little information became scarce and the result was a\nFerocious anger that erupted in several fires destroyed the main city\nThen came the flashpoint a will to power that ended in destruction and violence and it ended up in a huge war\nWhere young people were sacrificed in order to empower the leaders with a blood bond or the blood bond or a blood cement they would hold their grip on a frightened world the American people\nHave actually managed to solidly adapt to intolerant ideologies to dissent all these forms a\nOf of a you know group said to are supposed to represent neo Nazis and fascists and and then we have the anti fascist and the left wing umbrella of its shades communism and and all these factions fighting together thinking there's one side of the other side wouldn't reality that there is no one side of the other side there are several factions within\nBoth sides everybody's trying to identify them is one thing but you can't anymore\n\nI mean what are your conscious of it or not you can say that doing this\nDividing and fighting as anti liberty it really turns out to be very difficult for the media to understand her except that is why they say well we have these guys over here that are out right and we have these counterprotesters the hour they never say who they are\nI've never I mean maybe I can find some place by every time I have never heard anti far being spoken up by the media\nAnd you know the only ones I hear about are Proud Boys in anti far but there's also others and you know\nWe have to learn and we have to remember there are two main dangers to liberty right now one that comes from the left and when that comes from the right and that is this bond receive from the Warren groups of the city's literally\nAdapting this blood Samantha back in time in Germany and Hitler was blue kites they call the book the kite balloons kite demeaning blood Senate meaning that the leaders would commit acts of accent of murder and violence and the others would follow suit\n\nAnd that's what's happening now we have a little blue kite going on\n\nIn in the deep state certainly is breathing this boots kites\nAnd we are\nHaving a little something called fascism and in the in fighting a this is this is how we do terrorism American style is is that we do civil instability or instability was reduced in civility uh American style\nI mean\nYou know the jak boots of course are coming from our own people now be enforced is their own people police show up I mean this kind of stand there and wait kind of a referee between the factions fighting\nBut here we are following in the footsteps of or well we're following the footsteps the dos yesterday were following in the footsteps of all these guys who forewarned us it's the way I mean given all we know about what's going on and given all we know about the new world order and what it's going to do and what the new I mean this is this is the example of new world order it treats\nThe citizens like faceless statistics and economic units we bought sold barter traded in tracked it lies the system why is it cheats it steals it spies it kills breaks laws\nOver reaches authority abuses its power almost every turn and they love to violent their empire so what they do is they create wars they\nThey uh they take over everything they they're swallowing up everything little by little and so we have is deep state that is a myth superpower ... worldwide deep state of global industrial deep state\n\nAnd so it might get like you know network where uh the mid ... says there are no Russia's there are no countries there are no there is no west there's only one organized system of systems and that's money and that's takeover and that's dominance\n\nAnd that's that that that's become becoming true you know conspiracy theory but it's becoming a a a true thing\nFor everybody\nAnd that's what's the most terrifying as it is it's very true ideology we we were first afraid of terrorists now we're afraid of each other we're afraid of the rising up rising up all the middle eastern terrorists now it's us but needs to be careful because you know we have a fourth estate and its failed us\n\nAnd and what they have they have these controls in place now would you be crucial in creating a warm climate of politically motivated violence\nMay want you to speak politically correct speech politically been dismissive talking points political fanaticism I mean we manufacture racial tension we for fifty one people that we don't like we burn the books in the same places we burn people\nAnd it's because of the global establishment has risen up against the people and the people responded by radicalizing political ideology that by all intents and purposes is eating us from the inside out\n\nAnd we have a large number of people that always cannot be ... be happy with themselves in let's say pressure other ... other people into believing the whims of of of the deep state or believing the whims of this ... solution or this course of project to get people angry at one another but see in the end\nIn the end we're all terrorists to one another all mean to one another somebody's going to step in and say well you got to clean house\n\nWe got to clean house we got to make this place say because everybody's at each other's throats we got to go in and we got to get everybody to play nice we needed an intervention of some ...\nYou know we do that with other countries\nWe did that with other countries it it you know we see something going on in Iran or Iraq we see a civil war we step and we send in soldiers we tried to clear up the problem\nHow would you feel if we all are fighting like we are right now and China's says you know what there's a problem we gotta send troops there to take care of the United states and when they're done they're going to thank us for what they've done for them\nThat's how vulnerable we are that that's how fragile we are ... you realize is that if someone decides that we're just at each other's throats too much they decided they just want to walk in and clean house they will\nAnd boy you won't like that will you will be fighting against one enemy or will be fighting amongst ourselves well there are coming in and taking over\nBecause the whole future [noise] we have

enemy is out there too and that we shouldn't be fighting amongst each other we should be fighting against this order then wants to take over\nGo to Jack in California hijacked during ground zero\nSo high Clyde yeah this is an interesting story but there's a couple of things that just doesn't ring true to me about how you pronounce his name ...\nLike I had nothing to show gets ... jump cause Yogi\n... you\nKnow you had a [noise] the Turks came out and\nShowed us the pitchers in the airport or what was supposed to be the team coming in [noise] well if they knew that these guys were there to put a hit on somebody why didn't they stopped them so I think you have\nA the Turkish government also complicit that they also let this happen but what does it ring true to me is have you ever heard of a of any nation states sending Fifteen people to do it hit I mean if you're\nIf you're interrogating somebody you don't need Fifteen people to kill him and the more people you have in the inner price like this the more chances of something leaking something going wrong so the stories from the beginning didn't ring true\nBut Trump has a between a rock and a hard spot now because you're coming up on the mid term elections and they're pressuring him to do something against Saudi Arabia but he knows if he does in Saudi Arabia retaliate and they pull their oil back\nOr you could see a barrel of oil at a hundred and fifty dollars a barrel rather quickly and the price of gasoline would skyrocket\nIt would have an immediate effect on the economy and it would of course one of the things to lessen Trump's powers to blame him for a bad economy and the worst time for this to happen this right before the elections so what's your indicators that something like this is a foot\nThis hasn't the stock market been dropping\n... like I said this is an example of worldwide deep state manipulation beat is I mean it's not just about it's not just about President Trump is about everyone else is going to be affected in this domino occurrence\nWith this ... this happening and and how the world is going to be able to handle a high gas prices inflation and the economy is going to go by\nWell\nIt's a big conspiracy believe me it's a conspiracy wish and we're looking at\nAnother indicators the price of gold gold spin going up stock market's been going down oil is going to start going up I think to moral could be a very bad day in the stock market is is this thing somehow\nStarts to escalate now how how does Trump do anything against Saudi Arabia when ...\nIs a Saudi citizens and he was actually in a Saudi embassy which makes him on Saudi territory we have no authority over that we shouldn't even be involved in that the fact that he works for a newspaper here the United states has no consequences the president\nUnited States has really no authority to retaliate against Saudi Arabia but yeah I watched him get pressured to do something and\nYou know it's interesting how CNN was I think the first one to the story out that Saudi Arabia is going to say that the interrogation went wrong and he died by accident or you know there's been no official statement from Saudi Arabia\nI Know I Know but you know the turkey and said that they know that he was taking in was killed and was dismembered and the flu is remains I Can't remember the ... too but uh they moved out of the country\nSlide if the Turkish government had a video evidence of the hit team coming in at the airport why didn't they stopped it will\nProbably do the same reason you say that you would then ah he was in Saudi Arabia territory they can get in there and empathy and do anything about it\nWell but you're making the argument that maybe the CIA let this happen that\nThey know the argument the CIA was pursuing painting operation deep laid off in the argument that he said operatives in the high a poor facilitators to the murder of is a a I'm a ...\nAnd of course Saudi Arabian or a B C D operators were volunteers well now turkey had something to do with it that will be revealed to what I'm saying is is that they all knew and they let it happen now why just like you said it's a conspiracy to topple\nOr our country even more can we give the Trump is pressure to do anything it's going to bring up gas prices and is going to bring\nUp the inflation and it's going to kill our economy\nAnd the worst thing that could happen to Trump is that the Democrats get control of Congress so you would want an instant does an incident like this to happen right before Christmas right before the elections what could make Trump look worse I Hope he doesn't fall for the bait and retaliate against Saudi Arabia and\nThe thing I have a feeling do need to do that well I have a feeling though that's what they want I mean big the neo cons are still in control of a lot of things around Donald Trump okay you got Bolton who certainly it was a signatory on the project for the new American Century and they moved them into another George W. Bush were screwed so he's old\nEnough to remember when Saudi Arabia pulled back their oil supply and the seventies and we had an immediate gasoline shortage there were long lines for gasoline yup then they went to the odd even license plates right so you could gas up one day if your plate was even in the next day if you play was on even\nOn that I think they went by the last number of your plate so I remember I was working in the motion picture business at the time and I'd have to have my\nWe had two cars so I'd have my wife gets up the car for me to get the car ready for the next day and then that day she gets up the other car and because the lions horrible I didn't have time to wait in line for gas but the price of gas skyrocketed\nAnd you can only imagine the leverage that Saudi Arabia still has now if they pulled back or on their oil and they're saying if we're retaliated against by sanctions or any other means or that we're going to pull back or or oil and I think they use the figure that oil could go to two hundred dollars a barrel\nSo it'd be looking at ten dollars at the pump a gallon\nOr easily by Chris I don't know does does a Trump want to call their bluff no idea that ... thing for the bait and retaliate\nWatch and wait now right and that's why I brought this up because I'm Glad somebody had asked me they said well why don't you talk about George W I thought what am I talking about and then I realized oh I Know what to say that I looked over and I figured well gosh if they were all facilitating this this is one more way to destabilize the country namely United States of America\nDestabilized this from the pump it stabilizes with inflation destabilize this with an economy that's going to go by\nAnd then what will we have to do will have to be put on a war footing my by Christmas Time\nRight and and remember the key thing is though is if this goes south quickly it could really affect the mid term elections and the Democrats if Trump looks bad the Democrats would easily get control of the house\nAnd so do you think this is your well once again the deep state so what do you say the deep state intelligence ops wanting to make Trump look bad and making them by putting him in a position where you have to make the decision\nI think he made a good point that they not only the Turkish government but the CIA is a facilitator because I've always maintained that there's elements inside all of our main intelligence agencies including the CIA that hey Trump and they want to get rid of trumpet and it costs like\nWell it's the allowance subject like this\nTo happen it's creating the it's creating the atmosphere in the environment for a global is to Lucian meeting that he does that work in America anymore the guy or something\nYou might have missed there there was last night and National Geographic special about the secret service and they talked about I'm a real story about an assassination attempt on President Trump while he was in a foreign country\nAnd kinda was behind it\nInteresting well we'll we'll see what happens but like I said right now this is certainly you know that's the whole purpose of the show tonight was discovering to show\nHow the deep state is worldwide thing about bad promote these states worldwide W I might not be a a you know 'cause we're still the British guy you have all boys things to make

before we've seen it in the you know down to you know to maybe even a ... two oh five to ... gallon but now we're pushing four dollars a gallon and uh I I really think that would have an effect probably not as much of the fact is maybe you know\nTen dollars at the pump by me but I always get into the sphere that some somebody will wake up see ten dollars a pop because it's something we've done or something that's happening yeah I don't know the the just the world down anything is possible anything that we speculate about the past is coming true it it's just\nWeird how you know and and

the the beginnings of what they want to establish and what they want to put forward a and that is a conspiracy to destabilize the United\nStates of America to go to George and Kentucky Hi George you're on ground zero\nHey I have a foot here scenario world that I think you're right about the eight states but what about the situation with with Trump we've never seen a president for that the rallies way Trump has two they liked the public on both directions good and\nBad or we have an if Shirley how George George no these are like I say my life but you know you know you need to acknowledge\nThe fact that they've been other presidents have had the ability to do with Trump does\nAnd what he's doing now if we destabilize the country when these elections come up and I don't think this election is going to be\nA major but I think the next one coming up is it ... all of a sudden we're destabilized with this tape state airing involved and all this Trump is going to be put himself in a situation where he's going to say we're going to hold off on elections and we'll just carrying the through until we stabilize country\nWar so this is what they thought Obama was going to do this where they thought George Bush was going to do they didn't do it so you think the Trump would be stupid enough to suspend election so that I\nKnow it's not stupid if you think about it\nWell he did he would lay you that\nMost you got lost in American public\nI can hear Hitler Hitler Hitler I give you your Hitler chanted in the streets about happened\nYet but that's what we think about
