fact that\nThere were books written about a young man named a barren Trump who was advised by a man named John these are some very interesting synchronous these and coincidences did make me wonder

usual mind thinking situation that\nYou always open the candle can and let the mind begin to think that great I Love that you do that thank you so much and let me get started by saying that a person who makes predictions and things like that\nYou know generally person should have a totally open mind on that because one never knows what's going to possibly happen in the future anyway right and there's a person has come up with the idea that there will be something good because you'll notice with production a lot of times it says either something good comes up or something bad happened\nI think one of the other\nAnd ah so you know people predicting things and people who are in the past it protected thanks\nYeah Nineteen forty five show for instance that you're listening to\nUh put on there earlier was probably something that was played after World War two and England because the gentleman that talking\nAs it sounds like he's English and they will try to bring hope people make them realize someday there'll be no more face to worry about right yeah so that that's that's what that in my opinion is what that's all about as far as people make a production of this stuff sometimes they're good sometimes they're bad\nMouth all the the secret society than now I totally believe that also too as you're saying\nThey alter plus\nA possibility it's I don't know myself personally if ... if there is but with the way the world is today and the way society is today and the way the policy issues are and the way everything is in this country is right up there is probably cigarettes

G. wells and uh several other people Thomas Edison Mark Twain all having connections in fact they said that even does the was a member of this plus ultra group and I thought well that sounds really believable is plus ultra real well\nYes and no okay cause I'm finding out that maybe it's not called plus ultra but it's something else even just be was a part of southern golf club thirty three that he created it was just a special club for some of the people he knew and some very special people and of course a lot of people who believe that the club thirty three comes from the thirty three degrees and masonry\nBecause this was part of the Malay when he was a kid so plus ultra\nIs there any truth to the idea that maybe plus ultra may be some time travel group for some group it created a a breakaway civilization on some other plane a utopian plane well H. G. wells are as you know\nThere was a movie made about H. G. wells called time after time it was another fictional movie where wells goes into the future to find Jack the ripper and he does so by using his quote fabled time machine and the movie and it's kind of ... cryptic late says H. G. wells\nMarried Amy Catherine Robbins who died in Nineteen twenty seven and then it's just as a writer he anticipated socialism global war space travel and women's liberation he died in Nineteen forty six but wells also claimed\nThat he was a Fabian socialist he was part of the open conspiracy to establish a future new world order out he knew that he wouldn't live to see the day that this new world order what happened but he knew that a new world order was in the works and he wrote a book in Nineteen forty called the new world order\nAnd the book addressed the ideal of a world without a war or a utopia that basically emanates from a global government there was a ... lead them and the whole nine yards well prior to that book wells wrote the shape of things to come which is another book that was kind of eerily prophetic because he talked about a World War started in Nineteen forty\nOr the world will be brought into a new world order by criminal dictator who ... the war machine and so that actually approximate what really happened in World War two\nWell then he wrote and several of his books that\nThat there was a shadow government there was looming that this shadow government was there to create a new world order that would replace world religion and it would be an ugly thing and kind of like what Ben joined Israeli said about the British Government and well well you know he was a visionary we notice\nAnd whether or not he was a time travel is anyone's guess\nI don't know if you ... ... but ... but he according to this movie was part of the plus ultra program now Nikola Tesla\nIs also\nOne of the guys that was in this program this plus ultra program allegedly in the in the Disney movie and of course his inventions went beyond electricity in fact there were some people who believe that he created a time machine that he was the I guess the American equivalent of H. G. wells at the\nTime well by the time of his death he had patented about seven hundred things but after he died in Nineteen forty three\nAll of his possessions were seized by a government office called the government offices of alien property and about three weeks after they were seized all Tesla's things in documents were given a thorough examination by group of FBI agents that included none other than John Gee Trump who was the uncle of Donald Trump our president what's interesting is that\nYou know John gene Trump said that Nikola Tesla's papers were really amounted to nothing but\nA Trump went on to ah actually create X ray machines Tesla was working extra machines inside but he created them and of course Trump Donald Trump always says well I come from along the light of intellectuals and very a genius says like my uncle John J. Trump John Gee Trump he was a genius as well well\nUm what's interesting about all this is is that the question is what Donald Trump Sancho finding those papers in Nineteen forty three well there's a question as to whether or not test I had a time machine and that\nThere was something about that the era of wells the era of Tesla and this this writer who the science fiction writer his name was Ingersoll lock would unlock wood was the author of a a few books\nOne that raise many eyebrows a couple Baron Trump's marvelous underground journey and another was called Nineteen hundred and then there was the last president\nWell both of the books are in the library of Congress and you can read them but Newsweek did this strange article and twenty Seventeen basically saying that\nThis barren Trump character in this book goes to Russia he gets advised by a character named on\nAnd then he goes to the Fifth Avenue hotel in New York and then a Fifth Avenue a hotel or whatever it was it was I think probably the Waldorf Astoria if I'm right basically had some significance as well\nBecause there there were there was that book by luck would called\nAh the last president and in the last president\nThere's a quote from the book is really interesting it's about a state of uproar in New York after the election of an outsider candidate for the entire east side this is from the book this is in the Eighteen hundreds by the way uh it says the entire east side is it a state of uproar police officer shot it through the streets warning city folk to stay indoors for the night\nMoms have
