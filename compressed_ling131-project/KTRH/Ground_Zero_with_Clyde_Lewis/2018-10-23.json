God created having the you're got also created an heaven and have been and heaven and heaven and earth and earth and earth an earth meaning there were several genesis\nUh beginnings several different ones ah where\nThere's a fifty percent chance of of the life forms which opposed the norm and they do exist and sometimes they show up and when they show up we don't know what you call the window would do it I'm not talking about big for it I'm not talking about the Loch ness monster I'm not going to any of those things I'm Talking about things that you know you look at them and you get a second look\nLike this chicken that swim so it's a chicken feed this chicken monster type creature that I have in my uh\nUh I have in my article tonight uh but when you're looking at the multiplicity of creation and you're looking at how the diversity of the multi versus unseen in the multiplicity being\nAnd she would call that the underworld creatures from the underworld they'll come up from nowhere like the Demi Moore gone from you know stranger things or you know I don't know if anything that extreme but still I mean stranger things called the upside down we called the abyss uh\nThe timeline of creation and the creation myth that we here too are the ones that have been handed down through millennia and each one is unique it's interpretation our the concepts pretty much\nAre the same wherever you look\nSo scientists are speculating scientists are speculating that strange organisms that might be alien in nature exist on the planet\nAnd there isn't\nA very far jumped to suggest that stranger life exist on the planet that well you've never seen before and that if you were to blow up in the shadow biosphere lurks every monster and viable thing that no one even wants to see or or take on or have contact with there was another creature that I saw it and somebody was kind enough\nTo actually send me a picture of this thing it's called the penguin\nI don't know if you've ever seen a tangle and but I saw a paying all end today for the first time I've never heard of a pain Glenn in my life it looks like a mini Godzilla with armor looks like something from a Japanese horror

cute but it's also scary looking 'cause I have this armor all over its body and it kinda like conscious over like Godzilla it looks like it could take out a a you know it\nIf it was big enough or you could take out Tokyo and that's how we're to this to see that these ... waiting creatures that nobody has seen before\nOr they've seen them or they can identify but didn't know what they are and this is what I mean by second genesis these are things that\nYou know you've heard of unicorns yeah right well you know this is a lot different than ... I think there's a lot different than that you okay you know and I'm not talking about big for it I'm not talking about the Loch ness monster this is beyond my band is beyond the flat with monster these are things that you see and you're like going what the hell is this and it's something that's never been seen\nOn in search of someone who's never been talked about on coast to coast they I'm not saying that uh you know I've talked about really that I that I Know about that I've seen and you know that ... this reminds me of the myths\nGave the movie the mistreatment of missed\nIt was a it was a veil and it was also a a movie okay and the idea that\nYou know there are some quantum joke science can beat us with dimensional theories that point to the possibility\nThat there are areas of planet wear the veil is thinner\nOr there's some extra dimensional vortex where a second genesis occurred\nParallel to our own and their locations throughout the planet which suggested to me the most powerful due to their position to be the appropriate ritual perform there by the right officiate could actually be a cleansing moment for the planet\nTo open the best new creatures could come out and take I mean we're being warned\nThat there are wormholes reporter was that can be open through ritual or through the auspices of super collider is like CERN and those real into these can pass through and haunt mankind and change the direction of the future\nAnd as I said you know the mist they had a project they're like ... it was called arrowhead euro had project\nAnd\nThe whole catalyst for the story was a dimensional breach\nProject arrowhead actually creates this myth and rain and enveloped the small town and during the night large insect like creatures are seen and Tara doctor like creatures attack livestock and small pets eventually these creatures attack humans as well\nThose horrifying creatures from the film we're known as the great with orders and they can only be described as deadly spider like predators each about the size of a small dog\nAnd these creatures produce corrosive Web strands which burn through materials like cloth and flesh and both the book in the film great widow where's simply killed their prey would they're acidic ... put in the film\nThey also have the ability to capture and lay off hundreds of eggs in the living human host\nThe eggs say goodbye the data hatch and they multiplied quickly now\nLooks to these creatures were terrifying and there were even some\nThat were the size of a human being Ruben ... remember the there was a show called mimic I didn't know the adults ... did the show mimic is one of my favorite scary movies because of the fact that this this Roach or whatever it is\nGets to be the size of the human and you get to see it looks like a man and black standing there in the subway but it's not it's a big mop like creature scary looking creature see when you're looking at these creatures in the midst are you looking in in in\nThe movie like mimic these creatures are terrifying and and and you know if they're the size of a human being even worse than it was explained by the producers okay other movie and then they said we based many of their creatures\nOn supposed a second genesis creatures that were proposed by science there\nWere based on real animals but from an alien ecology admittedly dangerous wild animals from a more brutal ecosystem that we are not familiar with but still basically just animals\nMade of flesh and blood nothing supernatural about them okay but they are from a second genesis ecosystem\nThe brutal ecosystem is the same ecosystem that the scientists at CERN and when a guy by the majority rows\nHave talked about with regard to opening dimensions and allowing these vile creatures in for study Charlie Rose is a co founder and chief technology officer of the wave\nWhich is the Canadian companies selling machines that he claims exploit quantum mechanical effects to solve certain problems hundreds of millions of times faster than traditional computers\nAnd rose is also the c._e._o. of hindered systems or kindred AI which is to sell the start up he founded with others that was back in twenty fourteen and he dedicated\nWhole company to delivering advanced tell operated autonomous robots but\nHis goal is within the way of quantum computers he wants to summon a tsunami of demons or aliens or whatever they are the equivalent he says to the old one spoken of\nBy horror Arthur H. P. love craft so the concept of opening the dimensions for some love crafty in like creatures to come through\nSounds very much like he wants to open the realms of where the second genesis took place\nAnd and I mean I played the the the ... talked before we talks about this I don't know if it's for air because I think he swears in it\nBut he says something effect he says well when I'm going to tell you is is that we have the power that we're going to bring things over but they're not going to be like us\nHe says alien you know or you know different the the things that we're building are not going to be people they might be really smart they might be a really good at all sorts of things but they're not going to be like us they're gonna be aliens they're gonna be I'm Sorry to say way smarter\nThan every single person in this room in ways that we can't even comprehend so this of course triggers a lot of a worm with people right I mean\nYou know one must says you know if you're playing with a guy you're opening up these dimensions you're unleashing the demon little guy you know with a pen a gram you're going to have to throw your holy water on it you're going to have to weigh about it and say by God it's going to do exactly what you say not anything else but see that it doesn't always work out that way right\nSo you're copying this attitude that something will happen if you don't mess with Mother Nature so opening up\nThe wormhole letting these creatures through a very very very terrifying prospect and it's something that we really really shouldn't be doing what they're going to be doing it anyway and so the question is what is out there that does not fit the mold that we can see that one day we do see and when we see it\nIt's it's it's just too much [noise]\nYou seen anything like that [noise] I mean have you seen something I mean look [noise] I'm not asking you to tell me about ...\nThe thing that's the supernatural I'm Talking about real monsters here I'm Talking about things that you've never seen before you can explain [noise]\nDon't put them all the big foot Loch Ness monster anything else [noise] I mean [noise] giant spiders huge mosquito I don't know [noise] these things are terrifying [noise] and coming up we have a woman\nAnd whether they got to clean [noise] some activity crash launch\nSixty nine south bondage to eighty eight split down south\nTo less lame short a block their ... make sure to move here right and we do have some evening there overnight roadwork that is scheduled of course whether ... forty five gold freeway north spotted Broadway as well as to eighty eight shop at the beltway eight south and east bound to Ninety had if I can sixty\nRocks and the Gulf Coast windows dot com twenty four hour traffic center [noise]\nWeather Channel forecasts mostly cloudy were scattered showers and butter ... around sixty four tomorrow mostly cloudy which scattered showers as well in the mid to upper sixties right now it is partly cloudy and sixty one of the ... west side\nDoor side Lexis twenty four I'm a weather center it is ten thirty what our top story the president is in Garland, Texas Republican Senator Ted Cruz ally intent anymore\nPresident Trump was in Houston tonight rallying support George former political rival Trump said even though things got nasty during the twenty sixteen campaign since then no one has helped advance his agenda board and crews\nAnd the president made while says that the care of at our Central American migrants heading towards the U.S must be stopped speaking at the White House earlier today before leaving for years didn't Trump again threatened to cut off us aid to Honduras El Salvador and Guatemala\nTesla CEO Elon Musk believes the public good try out his proposed underground transport loop as early as December Moscow has been pushing the development of an underground transportation system or next to update is that the eleven o'clock time now for more ground zero I'm Eric sharp news radio seven forty Katie our age\nThe original and\nLike our traffic update the\nFor your morning ... don't you want to go on trial they want you can try to make\nOn radio seven forty\nKatie R.

something doesn't fit in with the block that issue for Congress stories dumping\nBarbie NATO on the program something if it's something I've been ... infested or homes you know what it is she wondered if it was some sort of demonic\nBeing one of some sort of an alien thing wondering if it's something that she doesn't understand but we do have inspectors literal inspectors that are going to go to our house to inspect this way she doesn't have to pay out any more money to find out something that she doesn't already know or what have you but we ... them we're going to be arranged you would get them to her and\nUh that we will get a logical scientific explanation now that doesn't hold where to go further we're going to probably have some growth in theaters or maybe in some other investigators demon I'll just go and if there's something demonic going on there\nUh but uh you know one of the things that we do on this program and we've done it many times is that we actually have to vet the stories now the thing with Barbie is that she came to a news press conference\nOkay and we were at a news tour press conference in Oregon uh some of the tour went to Seattle and beyond she came to that press conference to ask the news department\nWhat could be done about the home and how it could be inspected so it was not\nBut she had me she asked me if I knew anything about it there was something paranormal about it I was at bat\nI thought I don't know would throw to my audience and find out of the biggest paranormal and on and so this is why I brought Barbie on the show this is not to try and convince you something paranormal this is an investigation and process now\nUh it's also I thought appropriate for Halloween to talk about this and the reason why is because I don't know about you but creepy crawly crap coming out of a house whether it be spiders or any other bugs or or whether it be rats mice or anything else aren't terribly creepy\nThey aren't terribly creepy and a and this is why I ah this is why I wanted to talk about this tonight\nSo uh if anyone you know if anyone has had this happen to them or maybe that's something that they can claim that they've had happened to them I'd like to hear the story because you know things that are out of the ordinary things are anomalous\nOr certainly worthy of talking about especially around Halloween and so I said the chauffeur around this time because I wanted people you know because it's all part of Halloween right the creepy crawly being the we the spider things going down up and to the ads crazy but there are these are things that happened\nAnd uh the I'm going to talk to ... you know this is something that's really out of the ordinary Jason calling us from California how are you tonight man\nHow are you doing right now you sent me some pictures tonight of of what you say you were doing okay you're rock musician and my correct\nYeah I play in a bad in San Diego we were filming a video and are
