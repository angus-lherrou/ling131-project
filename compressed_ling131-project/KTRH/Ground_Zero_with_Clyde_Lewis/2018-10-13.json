close pretty close\nThey might hear quite a bit about where Michael ranked historically [noise]\nNow ... what you hear the top five so I'm not quite in terms of recorded hurricanes in us history\nBut by name storms that is the case here's the deal we've had in Atlantic hurricane season that we've tracked since Eighteen fifty one but they didn't start naming hurricanes until Nineteen fifty three All right so\nYou actually had the strongest hurricane that's ever been recorded in us history\nWas named it it was the Labor Day hurricane Nineteen thirty five\nO'clock in the tops of state window ample hundred and eighty five miles per hour\nThe second one was hurricane care Nineteen sixty two top with one Seventy five\nThen you have a ... for the third strongest hurricane at the time of land fall hurricane Camille Nineteen sixty nine a buck sixty five yeah Hurricane Andrew in Ninety two and one sixty five as well eat fish the strongest hurricane\nAt the time the landfall recorded us history what's called the ... hurricane of Nineteen twenty eight that's another one deals with Lake Okeechobee here in South central Florida if you will under sixty miles an hour tops the same way and so where does Michael rang\nWith twins at a hundred and fifty five miles per hour at the time of landfall this text strongest hurricane and recording us history that big of a deal\nCertainly prayers go out to the folks impacted directed line they're one of the other things to watch for two we heard the death toll earlier today Lebanon twelve and a lot of concerns that number's going to rise one

mistakes after hurricane\nThey'll end up dying it's been four to track record historically really easy by the way when you're hot you're tired you don't have power to go do something silly\nThat sometimes it just didn't include stepping in water bottle or something with a downed power lines I kind of thing happens and the case of what we're taking a look at though with\nHurricane Michael what we don't know how many people were actually in those homes Mexico Mexico beach and uh let's pray that folks did get out and that we are going to have a a death toll that rises considerably\nTomorrow and over the weekend this one was bad bad news for sure All right and the end on a lighter note\nI couldn't help but the but they do actually the first time I remember hearing the name Kanye West and is that when I was doing radio in Savannah during the Iraq War\nThe folks you saw in a Baghdad or toppling be statues of Saddam Hussein heroes among heroes those are the third if the third Infantry Division third id at Fort Stewart just outside of savannah\nJust amazing people and outside of the tourists that come to savannah it's a major military town everybody is either friends or family was somebody serve it and back then somebody who was overseas\nSo when we had the Iraq War going on it was important with all the major updates to get the information out to all of our radio stations we happen to have a a urban station a rap station there was a young rapper they are in the afternoon\nAnd uh he was playing in in ... is from Atlanta and so he's got a big deal in Georgia and he was just starting to become a big deal I think nationally about that time so anyway I'm supposed to be going in there to do this major update on the third Infantry Division and the Iraq War\nAnd I go in there and this young rapper is doing his thing and he's all worked up and then he is coming over to me out of a Kanye West's song\nAnd he couldn't remember my name and he went it's it's it's Whitey with the news and I became Whitey with the news\nAnd [laughter] I managed to hold it together long enough to give the the update but after that we kinda turned it into a thing and for ... for many couple of years that was in Savannah he would end up helping me with culture and so I Would do things like ah you know learn how to to speak the language\nI'd just be a chilling and stuff you know ... those are the types of things that I was doing in in in Kanye West was at the forefront of my urbanized education\n[laughter] anyway I digress a it has been a couple of weeks for sure from the gaffe an odd

know he says I Want you to swear on the Bible you walked on the moon and he wouldn't when he wouldn't do it should real goes well you're a liar then it'd be cheating how dare you how can you sleep at night so ... but it was all just popped in in the jaw\nUm so yeah I mean people get all kind of a big shift if you tell them I doubt I doubt that we went on the moon I mean you'd be skeptical about UFOs you'd be skeptical about everything else but that many you start being skeptical about the moon landing\nIt's like you kick the pope somewhere in his body parts I think it's really a bad thing people don't like it well I can tell you I still have my doubts about the moon landing and uh\nYou know I have them even more now after what I read today\n[noise] um you remember back in when was it it was a two thousand for President George W Bush\nPart of the conversation about putting them back on the moon and twenty Fifteen and he said the NASA will test the new spacecraft was called the crew expiration vehicle by two thousand eight and ... the first manned mission no later than twenty four team\n\nWhere we are four years after the fact nothing we don't we don't have men men started back on the moon again we're we're just really talking about sending the first space tourists he's not even land on the moon is this going to go around the moon\nBut the President Bush had a goal set of having\nA man on the moon living and working there by twenty twenty having a base there and it's not out of the question I mean if you look at what Bigelow Aerospace is up to with\nMaking these inflatable moon basically I could have been done even um ours based could've been done\nWell in two thousand nine we were told the NASA was carrying out this LCROSS experiment and they were lying to us about it about what they were using it for is that they were looking for ice on the moon but there are plenty of missions prior to the moon landing plenty of missions like the Clementine mission whatever scouting out of the moon finding ice pockets\nAnd so they didn't need the LCROSS mission but ah\nAnd of course NAFTA had five hundred million to spend on a rocket who's going to slam into the moon blow up and then a cause of created it's about six miles wide\nAnd you know people say oh my God they're gonna new moon and they were going to do this two days or two days shy of the ... anniversary of first landing on the moon\nAnd there was a lot of stuff about that mission that didn't add up didn't make any sense\nAnd\nTwenty love and after the LCROSS mission failed rock Obama cut funding for the proposed constellation program and the space vehicles he basically cancelled the five year nine billion dollar effort to build new Orion spacecraft an aries rockets\nThe new space vehicles were slated to replace the masses three aging space shuttles and launch astronauts into orbit and onto the moon that was the thing but no Obama pulled the nine billion and they put the money towards data that that that climate change climate science\nSo Obama kill the space program in order to turn announcing the climate change police and that's that's really sad I mean if there was ever a time but now that we\nWent to the moon at all that was the time because it you know they just shut down you know here we have this dream or going forward then\nSays not not that we're not going to go so here we are in twenty Eighteen and we'd again been told that the moon is the goal and later Mars to news stories\nToday that I Want to tell you about that really helped me excited but ah some bad\nNews first of all a Russia seems to be out of their minds ah apparently may have detected what appear to be to colliding stars\nAnd I think somewhere I have the sound of the stars I'll Try and dig it up but um yeah they they detected these stars are putting off of sound gate of weird sound and are there going wait a minute or these really colliding stars are we looking at a space armada coming our way\nAnd if they're moving is asked we think they're going to be here by twenty twenty two\nI'm sitting I'm not kidding Russia found these colliding stars they start collecting stars and they they've warned them out there saying well if\nThese look like cutting stars but the sounds are giving us seem to have intelligence in them so they may not be colliding stars at all\nWhat are they well they are um are there are no mater of of huge space craft coming our way\n[noise] um [noise]\nNow also reported today that Seventeen scientists often to report stating that searching for signs of life should be part of every future national mission\n\nThe breathing was offered by the national academies of Science Engineering and medicine it emphasizes the importance of including\nAstrobiology the study about life originated on her than how it might evolve elsewhere in the University of every phase of all now submissions destined for space from inception conceptualization to planning to development and operation\nSo once again we're Seventeen scientists and guess what guys every mission that we do from now on is going to have the purpose of finding life out in space\nOnce again\nEvery mission is going to be about finding a life in space that has to have a a quest of finding life in space Russia's says they picked up on to quote colliding stars that may be a space armada heading our way\n\nSo I Believe that the reason why this is happening why they're saying hey every mission has to have a fact finding life giving whatever is because they have confidence that there's intelligent life out there and the recent reports of techno signatures in fast ... actually it's fast radio burst or the motivation behind the quest\n\nI don't know that it has anything to do what he's claiming stars are possible are modest coming our way but it certainly has a lot to do with a techno signatures and get this\nAstrophysicist are now saying that with all the\nThousands of exoplanets out there and and how they're uncovering new insights into the complexity of diversity of life on earth the authors also sit in the briefing that not only are you going to be looking for techno signatures guys we want you to look for bio signatures\nSo this is pretty amazing don't you think I mean I think it's cool I mean this bolsters the chance at life could exist out there\nAnd therefore all space exploration missions should incorporate technology and find traces of alien organisms\n... signatures take those things I mean look I presume view of the universe is more cramped plants never before\nWe have two thousand three hundred confirmed exoplanets discovered by NASA's Kepler Mission and that leads to after six out of every ten stars could host Earth like planet\nSo the sheer number of known exoplanets operas exciting opportunities for finding ... signatures fighting chemical markers indicating that yeah there's live out in space\nIn the report sciences recommended that NASA accelerate the development of technologies to detect microscopic organisms citing the current lack of a single flight ready instrument that can travel to a distant world and measure the composition of its elements minerals and organic matter\nReport also suggest that direct imaging systems that suppress star like should we use outside our solar system to improve detection of ... signatures from planet that might orbit those stars NASA could also play more missions that the peer under the surface of exoplanets\nWhether or not the rock the icy or ocean worlds\nDefined subterranean alien life according to the report however [noise] ... neighbors either in our solar system are light years away [noise] we'll take more than technology alone and all of these advancements will cost money and guess what guys [noise]\nMasses only plan to return astronauts to the moon after nearly fifty years just got slammed by an internal auditor [noise] that means [noise] they weren't going to the moon anytime soon and we're not gonna look for aliens anytime soon [noise]\nWe're using fatty and Matty [noise] an astronaut some really excited about the possibility of life out there [noise]\nBut our rockets the F.

I'll tell you about that coming up once again that makes you wonder if we really go to the moon I mean why can't we get a rockets sophisticated enough to go out and do this and why are they now

I don't believe that we went to the moon I Believe that a Hollywood has been telling us all the time that we have in the Stanley Kubrick directed the moon landings two guys want a space odyssey\nTime for mayor did the moon landing stuff and of course we were ... showed in Nineteen Seventy one diamonds Are Forever James Bond film is James Bond gets on a a moon landing set\nNineteen Seventy eight Capricorn One movie the talks about men faking or the Mars landing spot or two thousand and one of Fox special conspiracy theory did we land on the mood basically saying stating a fact\nThat we never went to the moon then came by several film titled a funny thing happened on the way to the moon he claimed he had footage\nOf the astronaut speaking the famous earth shot and uh it's it's in Israel and if you want to look as funny thing happened on the way the moon it shows the astronaut speaking the the the famous blue earth shot\nSo you know there are plenty of things that can cast doubt plenty of things we can cast doubt on whether or not the moon landing happen in two thousand for\nPresident George W. Bush started the conversation about putting them back on the moon to Ryan program the ... the crew exploration vehicle\nBy two thousand eight you know we're supposed to be a working towards going to the moon getting there by twenty fourteen normally no later than twenty Fifteen didn't happen why because in two thousand nine actually with the two thousand nine round two thousand nine rock Obama pulled the plug\nBut uh it it was because of a a a failed mission that we had to go to the moon within Al Cross a rocket\nWill cratered unknown to see if there was water which didn't make any sense because we already had surveyor and landers in and orbiters to map the moon Clementine actually mapped the moon in Nineteen Ninety four and a Seventeen was able to deliver more than one point eight million digital images of the moon back to the ground\nAnd um\nThere was the interest satellite they were ground tracking the stations are ... they were they had to enter L A ground tracking satellite station was picking up on these images so everything is accessible to the general public via the Internet\nAnd one scientist reviewed the data from Clementine they already found the existence of ice within the moon's crater so why did they did as well you know it was a failure nonetheless the LCROSS mission was a failure Brock Obama pulled\nThe funding from a vis a constellation Orion a project which kept us from going to the moon and a nine billion dollars is cut from the program and uh it slows down now here we are in twenty team\nWe've been told the moon is the gold again what's really cool\nIs it today it was reported that Seventeen scientists often to report stating that searching for signs of life should be part of every future national NASA mission there the briefing was authored by National Academy of Sciences engineering and medicine it says ... instead of the briefing and says that ah\nIt's very important\nThat the new NASA missions include\nA studies at astrobiology studies of how life originated on earth and how it might have evolved elsewhere in the universe and every phase of all NASA missions destined for space from inception conceptualization they have to plan\nOn trying to find a way to discover life in space\nAnd I think ... it's obvious the reason why they're saying is is because yes they have confidence that they found these techno signatures they found the grammatical waves are in fact Russian scientists to colliding starts thinking it was armada I played the tones of the stars coming out us in the south alarms all over the country so I won't be doing that again\nBut um\nAnd in fact this awful arms of shutdown radio station so if I had that Arabs because of that ah\nBut in recent years we in the show has been discussing that\nThousands of exoplanets and biologists were actually uncovering new insights to the complexity diversity of life on earth and and also a these discoveries would bolster and move closer to\nThe chance to life could exist on other worlds and therefore\nAll space X ray exploration missions now should incorporate technology to find traces of alien organisms\nSo you know with the number of exoplanets they've discovered with all the ideas about life on other planets scientists recommending that NASA accelerate the development of technologies\nTo detect microscopic organisms citing the current lack of a single flight ready instrument meaning there isn't anything ready now nothing that can fly out the space to take care of this problem nothing that can traveled to distill rose and measured the composition of its elements minerals organic matter that sort of thing so the report suggests\nThat direct imaging systems to suppress star like should be used outside our solar system to improved detection a bio signatures from planet that might orbit those stars NASA also uh is being told that they can plan for more missions appear under the surface of exoplanets however\nThe average to locate extraterrestrials either in our solar system are light years away is going to cost a lot of money and you need to advance technology to do it well here's the deal\nNASA space launch system the S.
