one will listen because there are been dead has to be settled and revenge is a dish but his best serve cold in America\nYou whenever I speak of civil war ... civil of people in America I often get told that it will never get that bad quiet and then I\nAmong ring for the sake of clicks or ratings or whatever you think I'm doing well I always say back to people that is certainly cynics bitter there in order to keep telling yourself that America is still United however it appears that that ship has sailed\nAnd living through a civil war in South America can teach you what to expect and it it's a real experience that I talked about that and the first hour\n\nI mean I Want to make it clear that during the civil war in a modern day at a modern city modernist city like when I ...\nI mean life was normal except for little things that would make you wonder if you would make it through the day or if you will be able to do routine things I mean I can imagine that the United states is civil war would be similar\nExcept that we have the Internet that's the difference say I mean the outbreak of a civil war in the United states wouldn't look all that different to the normal news cycle\nRegularly you know and that's the thing that I think people don't understand it doesn't look different than the normal news cycle and what they would regularly report it's the same thing I mean it begins with something like a politically motivated mass shooting\n\nAnother example would be a biological attack on the United states either in a major city\nOr directed at Congress or to the president\n\nI Know I've talked about the final blow I don't know if that was the final blow but it's certainly sent the ball rolling\nBecause there was a political attack using rice and a poison that was aimed at certain people including the price of the United states if they would have sent all that the members of Congress we would have had an attempt to the decapitation exercise\n\nWe all know that the anthrax attack happened in two thousand one after the nine eleven attacks\nSee how we have the rights that attack that happened just before the cabinet vote\n\nWe talked about the Russian each colt an al ... tried\nTo use biological warfare is a way to get people not to vote or to somehow change the direction political you have an area here in in Oregon\nI mean these are simple politically motivated attacks and these\nAttacks are usually supposed to not only change directions politically but they're also there to generate copycat attacks\n\nAnd these can be both domestic terror attacks in foreign attacks whose sole purpose is generating a backlash they're simply done in order to provoke a response if the response was overwhelming and police department's going to keep up with a politically sectarian violence then we will see the next phase of civil warfare\nAnd that is the domino effect if there is an insurgent\nAnd the domino effect is in play military crackdown on any kind of insurgency will be inevitable this will be your martial law scenario except it will either\nBe the military working within already militarized police or the police working against the military there also be restrained to start with\nHow or if there is an insurgency there will be some re straight at first but then the insurgency military weapons martial law all these things can be applied to a situation I\nDon't know if that'll go that far but it can be applied I mean there's a misconception that in a modern civil war there'll be two sides\n\nAnd the reason why we think this is because we look back in history and we all know that it was the union believed to be into less slavery and the confederation really being more slavery but most people are thinking right now that if there was a civil war in the United states it would be two sided and that's it\n\nLike Republican against Democrat conserve against liberal no on how it's going to be\n... with civil war will be in the United states if this happens you know it's not\nModern civil war would have many\nSo called side's seeing the dirty war South America there were several sides that we're fighting there were the parent is kind of nice that the radical radicalize the communist called me and he says the Nazis the Catholic Church the Jews sewn into the police the moderate plaza I can go down all the list of who are fighting against to\n\nThe age group would have their own band if terrorists carrying out executions abductions and torture of course the government had access to the police they had access to corrupt cops had access to ... military and so of course the government utilize them whenever they could the church would utilize them as well your poll by the way was part of that group\n\nFeeding America we'd have a left wing group incite violence or insurgency that which Marco response from black lives matter or me too but all eyes would be an anti ... because they're usually the ones that carry out all the stuff\nOn this stuff hits the fan\nOver the weekend there was a vigil in Portland, Oregon for Patrick ... there was a black man\nWho was shot by police afterwards members of anti five blocks streets directed traffic getting harassed drivers and other people the police looked on and allowed to harassment to happen it was horrible\n\nAnd elderly man who made the mistake of not following orders of anti pot what's called a racist at a Nazi among other things and there was chased down by an angry mob where they proceeded to use ... times and other weapons the damages vehicle\nThe police looked on\nThe driver says he was following two other cars that made the right hand turns instead of a left when one protester stepped in front of his car and the other surrounding the man was out numbered probably scared and did not know what he did wrong the truth is he did nothing wrong\nAnd it could have wound up\nWith him being beaten shot once again the police looked on didn't do anything didn't intervene\n\nYeah I had about three thousand dollars for the damage done to his car\n\nOnce again if it's civil war breaks out there that are here or in the United states would not be\nTwo sides fighting we could see hundreds of sides with hundreds of agendas yearning and fighting for independence\n\nThere are separatists groups in America the militia groups oath keeper storm front patriot prayer Proud Boys Christian sects Muslim groups all these guys could come together\nAnd feel the flames for civil war\nOther and certainly the Kennedys could be criminal gangs like MS Thirteen black nationalist groups white nationalist sovereign citizens generally any armed organized group with some kind of history to it now with the Internet\n\nWe would see more organized insurgency through social networking\n\nIs anybody remembers the purge threat August fifteenth twenty fourteen the mainstream news is reporting on the events are happening in Ferguson,
