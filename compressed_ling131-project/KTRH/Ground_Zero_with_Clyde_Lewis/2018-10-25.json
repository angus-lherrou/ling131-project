N. for Hillsdale dot com that's living for Hillsdale dot com [noise]\nAlright Claudio Rockford, Illinois the great W are okay go\nNext to live and how are you okay thank you I'm a ... a lot of a lot of the topics and twice that\nYou make our our typical ingredients of what is taking place in the destruction of Europe and fortunately we in the U.S are just mere in that image and I I Believe that uh\nThat what we're seeing happen in this country is just a um\n[noise] it just what they're seeing taking place in Europe as far as the the uh what they called them the you know that they're there Mike when they're um uh people coming from the Syria should ban and all these regions that are going through wars\nAnd we have the needed that is destroying everything and has their opinion and agenda and they have in Europe the you which is people that are wearing suits but not appointed by anybody they're dictating what's going on\nMhm and I find very interesting I fight and I don't know if I can share on the air with you\nWhile let's not but uh you make you make some interesting points there and um\nAnd you're probably not aware of this but you're quite right in this to this extent the progressive movement or reaches to its philosopher kings in your roof so and ... and marks and ... among others\nAnd also you know in in certain respects the signing of this nation reaches back into your\n... to skew in Sydney and and others but also of course Aristotle and says real but\nBut the point is these are really two different ways of looking at humanity\nOne looks that humanity one individual at a time that's where we come from you and I one individual at a time individuals have merit individuals have value individuals have worth their God given God given God created\nAnd then there's another view which is to look at the whole the community\nAnd if people are stepping out and they're not doing what they are expected to do for the better good\nThen those people need to be addressed and dealt with and of course what happens here is a relative handful of individuals when compared to the overall population determine what is good for the community whether it's good\nSo the community or not and this is where you get in trouble you get into these various ideologies and theories and obstructions in which I'm a a relative handful of individuals seek to impose their will on all of society and to destroy man's nature\nAnd so the individual is only as good as the individual is willing to surrender his or her individuality to the greater good to the state because conformity and uniformity our priorities their primary\nNow are viewed as in view it that way conformity in uniform me there's not the priority as much liberty for an individual as possible and in order to society and moral ordered society that's our model\nAnd so you want in in addition to that in economic system that is competitive that is market oriented that is relatively voluntary and so forth and so on as opposed to this constant central is Asian a government\nPower uh but that is essentially seized by an elected individuals and they will that is imposed on you rather than exercising your own will you can see this now your point on the immigration from\nThe vast majority of Americans don't want what's taking place on the southern border the vast majority of Americans do want the southern border security even those who are fairly liberal and the issue of immigration\nBut you have a political party and leadership and a political party that believes it must change the population it must change the electorate it must change the citizenry in order to have as close as possible a permanent hold on power\nAnd that's exactly what's taking place here that's what Merkel did in Germany that's what's taking place and people don't have a right to come to the United states of America they don't have a right to come here at all they're not even covered by our constitution\nIt's the people in this country who have rights and have the right to make these determinations\nAnd so uh I agree with you to that extent that what's happened\nHere on the American left as they've taken the European left the progressive left both of which are ...\nOf haggling marks and NGOs and the and the Russo and others are and that's the that's the row they've taken as opposed to the road we've taken which is the enlightenment they embrace of western civilization and those sorts of things\nThat's my round about kind of process Oreo way of agreeing with you All right Claudio thank you for your call

we decided to have a civil war or we had a civil war I don't know if we decided that the civil war broke out because we didn't agree we had such a disagreement about how our system was run we have some we had a civil war\nThere was so much instability at that time the civil war broke out it wasn't declared it broke out there were divisions on on a on the front lines there were a\nYou know border divisions and things of that nature it was clear cut as to what a civil war was back in the Eighteen sixties were not living in the Eighteen sixties anymore America's instability\nIs increasingly an undercurrent in political discourse right now\nBut I Know it's difficult to see that the civil war is happening because we always thought it would be an armed conflict then one day President Trump or whoever would step up to the pulpit and say what about your guns guys we're going to war here in this country\nBut he established with a battlefield America had already been proposed during the Obama administration has proposed by none other than John McCain who now is a political hero of the left for some reason\n\nWe always thought it would be an armed conflict where we would be shooting other Americans every day where the police would be forced to shoot Americans every day we're martial law would be declared\nAnd all that can happen but at the moment\nThe symptoms of civil war have not been diagnosed by the majority of the people and most of the diagnosis you get about wars are from history not declared by the president but ... be declared the aftermath\nNow in the past there were a number of ways that the military had identified illustrated the point by point sign post\nAs to what a new civil war would look like in America and this is based on contemporary standards not the standards of the Eighteen sixties or the Nineteen fifties or or the forties or whatever I mean there are major coups in the planning for Truman and for FDR major coup of course planned\nAnd and and uh actually executed by a those in the deep state against president\nKennedy but a new civil\nWar in America look something like this according to military planners number one the country would be in France in\nNational polarization would no obvious meeting place for resolution\nNumber two\nThere would be increasingly divisive press coverage and information flows weaken institution notably a Congress and the judiciary\nNumber three\nThere will be a sellout or abandonment of responsibility by political leadership and the legitimacy and the illegitimate evasion of violence\nTo solve any and all disputes\n\nNow I Know that that's pretty damning to actually point all these out and of course we have been analyzing and speculating about the state\nManipulations it's a ... we've been told is conspiracy analyst said this is a\nAn invention of Donald Trump would we know that the shadow government has not been in Ventura Donald Trump the shadow governors always\nBeen the dark command that leads from the shadows\nBut it needs to be clear here\nThey while we're looking under rocks for false flag proof or we're having these\nDisputes and the symptoms of war here in the United states the effect is working in the left has made it a point to turn what happened today with the bombs into a moment where their persecution complex can be proven which makes it even more suspicious especially when\n\nThe media should be talking about how more than a week ago Senator Susan Collins a Republican from Maine\nReceived a suspicious letter and again early this month President Trump's defense secretary James Mattis\nAnd chief of naval operations John Richardson were sent rice and and more than a year ago there was an attempted assassination of multiple Republican congressmen during a charity baseball practice and yet since no one died this doesn't indicate civil war does it no not at all it's just we're attacking officials\nBut this isn't registering in the media today the only thing\nThat's registries the persecution complex we see on the left because the left is all one sided in their pain but continued attacks on political figures from shooting so tempted bombings are part of a civil war tactic and it's becoming more and more pervasive these are attacks on the Republicans and and the intelligence\nThat are linked to these resistance they're using it for sympathy they're using on the Democrats were simply be the truth is Democrats are not unique\nRepublicans are not unique in the American people are not unique we can and will if we're not already having a civil war in this country\nBe attacks are happening to a lot more people than just the Clintons in Obama's there are journalists that are being attacked we've had anthrax being sent a journalist we've had a rice and being sent a journalist\nSo time to wake up\nSome Americans if it is Suze Orman since they're not affected directly by the evil in this country they walk around like outsiders just like in John carpenter's a movie they live they have not put on the glasses to see the real world that has been glazed over by an overly political narrative that does not wish to expose the demonic Lee infected among us\n\nThe movie they live created by John Carpenter was actually released Thirty years ago this November\n\nThe film still remains chilling only appropriate as a metaphor for what is happening today of course John Carpenter is responsible for the movie Halloween which is having a bit of a renaissance is is forty years sequel is selling out two theaters across the country the original Halloween introduced to Michael Meyers who was eventually referred to as the shape kind of evil that cannot be killed\n\nJohn carpenter's films or horror metaphors exploit what trauma does to the soul\nBut he also infuses his films with a strong anti authoritarian messaging concerns about how our society is unraveling and there's always some evil hidden in the shadows ready to pounds with every moment in\nThe film they live carpeted portrays the government working against its own citizens\nThat appears to be some silent alien infestation echoes the films invasion of the body Snatchers if you remember that film however in the body Snatchers movie there were some people that we're realizing that their loved ones were losing their humanity\nIn a film they live\nCarpenters shows that the majority of the populace are out of touch with reality and may have allowed technology to run amok they have allowed believed to choose their values they are unaware that a war has been waged against them and their way of life do you recall\nCarpenter also did the film escape from New York where the future of America is fascism\nSo the bottom line is\nIt was a message has been quite clear and no one seems to be listening we're being fed a series of\nCarefully contrived fictions there no resemblance to reality [noise] the agent provocateurs create these attacks in order for us to feel as though we are threatened by forces beyond our control [noise]\nAnd what these tactics they're able to destabilize the country making us distrustful of each other divided by our prejudices and the other's throats these types of events generate a lot of fear based retaliation\nAir symptoms if part of or within the realms\nIn the confines of civil war in the United states of America\nUsing the constitution eliminates these problems using the rule of law limits these problems the corruption impunity that would eliminate these problems but until then\nWe will be in each other's throats will accept the pictures that are fed to us and we will not admitting or we will see a civil war on our doorstep and tell us to a\nRelief

all excited about what's excluded they don't get excited about what they don't see they won't add up to say hey we're in the middle of something really bad year\nAnd it it it's like a the civil war that happened in South American the Nineteen seventies and eighties it's like what happened prior to Ukraine and then when he was destabilized these things are happening in America and no one sees it for what it is\nRoger why is that people are not paying attention why don't they why don't they just stop ... they they they're they're completely incensed and they want to continue this I guess maybe it's it's just a waiver so your\nFrustrations outta why do you think this is happening\nWe have we have had established over the last three generations in this nation something I'd like to call
