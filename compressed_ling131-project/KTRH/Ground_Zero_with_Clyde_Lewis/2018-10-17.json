back at some of the medications that have been used by the public that have led to\nA lot of bad effects that Philip am I a situation in the Nineteen sixties I Believe was one of the perfect example of a sedative ... it was anti ... medication medication pregnant women were taking in pregnant women who use the drug cause serious congenital Mao formations and their baby\nNow today they're still drugs that are on the shelves right now but when misused or when they're taken responsibly can cause accidents and you can get anything from\nThe justice intolerance a dying and that's why they call it I after Jenike artifacts\nAnd physical dependence can happen with the chronic use of any drug including many prescription drugs he would have taken his instructed\nPhysical dependence in of itself is not constitute addiction but often accompanies addiction and it stinks and many people cannot or discern the distinction it's difficult to discern particularly\nPrescribe pain medication switch the need for increasing do just dosages actually represents tolerance or worse thing underlying problem as opposed to the beginning of abuse or addiction and I've always learned\nAs a general rule but if you're taking a pill to kill the pain you're\nDependent if you're taking a pill after the pain is gone you're addicted\nBut if you're taking your pills as directed in the paper says your body has gotten used to them overtime or the worst case scenario would be that the drug companies are doing the equivalent of watering down the alcohol and I've always talked about that as well be advocacy\nOf of a pain medications I Believe the yo yo wing of the doping mean is what is causing the opioid crisis and so what we're getting is adverse effects for getting opposite expectations of outcomes it becomes a no CBO effect\nSo called pandemic of opiate overuse may be seen as a as a no see ... no no CBO effect itself tonight and I'm going to be the spoiler 'cause I don't really give a damn about the TV show it's called ah the Connors\nAre used to be Roseanne on ABC Roseanne he said that in the show they were going to kill her off\nThere were to kill her off the program I'm with an opioid overdose they did it they actually killed or off\nFrom an opioid overdose everybody says how does how do they know how do they know they're trying to cover up the fact that she's spoiled at for everybody weeks ago and I basically had said well if you're following the Roseanne program she was actually are in need of knee surgery and the show\nAnd then she'd been taking pain pills from friends and others and having a stash around the house so it was a given\nThat they would kill her off\nBy giving her an opioid overdose\nAnd see this is the thing that bothers me about the opioid the opioid problem in the opioid overdose in and out of the opioid overdose scares that they're giving everybody and that is if you are addicted or if you overdose on pain medications it's a moral failing\nPeople will have you believe it's a moral failing of propaganda will have you believe that you're ... you're an addict\nWhen you're not\nAnd so the killing off of Roseanne with an opioid overdose in my opinion is exactly what they were expecting is exactly what was going to happen and uh and that's\nWhy it was done so tonight I wanted to\nBring on a friend of mine who uh I've I'm I'm not sure we haven't had him on a long time been Fuchs and he's a registered pharmacist he's really fishes and cosmetic chemist and has been\nCompounding custom medication formulating nutritional in skin care products and consulting with doctors and patients just graduated from UC University of Colorado School of pharmacy in Nineteen eighty six distributions recognizes nationally for his work as the on air pharmacists nutritious host of the bright side radio program Ben Fuchs welcome to ground zero\nA fight and talk to your dad loved by doing this show because you are so darn intelligent Clyde thanks you [laughter] I ...\nI really appreciate it and so so bad and I mean what is it with a propaganda when the world today making people who are using pills for paying give it give making them a treating them like moral a pariah I that's what they did when Roseanne denied they actually killed her off on the TV show\nOr said she had opioid addiction and she died of an opioid overdose ... why are they\nDoing off her twenty six for you I answer a fool according to his\nFalling you know people are so silly ... it's just ridiculous how we had this idea\nThat uh we're okay to judge people or whatever their behaviors are OK to captains Persians on others or whatever their behavior is back to the human body is hardwired to the addicted to substances as hard wired specially can be addictive substances that are already inherent in it and that's what opiates are\nThey are analogs of bio chemicals that are already in your brain so when you take an oath you say that you have you have a pain problem and you take opiates an opiate tell what all immediately happen is your ... your brain will down regulate\nThe production of its own and dodging is opiates and you'll in Athens become decision by taking artificial opiates you'll end up being the fission which we'll put you in an deficits day and if there's a there's a pills that are right in front of you and be almost impossible to reason\nNow I Know that I Know that we have a a sort of a psycho social context surrounding the patient Dr relationship the patient farmers ... pharmacist relationship\nBut yeah I I think people tend to ignore the fact that you know right now if you're using opiates you you've become pretty much a ... you become a dark and NPR why we're what's that\nYou're award you're awarded the state yeah you belong state you belong to the medical model and that and they love that yeah well now what you're going to you're hooked on August ... you you have to go to the doctor you have to go to the pharmacist even if it even if it means Dr pharmacist shopping\nYou ... your compels me to be a part of the model of the paradigm once you get on a city that once you get on the drug ... shut illegal drugs too by the way I tell people get that's how dealers and and a drug drug dealers gets you hooked on heroin\nWell and that's the truth or you know one of the thing I did a show one time about crocodile\nAnd it was interesting because ah I was talking about it was cheap heroin and that many people that look very attractive to use this cheap heroin\nAnd uh I was saying you know be aware of crooked deal because your kids may be using it and blah blah blah blah blah and boy did I have an education I had people calling me all over the country in their sixties and seventies\nSaying to me that they were addicted to heroin and that they are they're the ones that ... that the they worry about that the that uh they said you should be worried about grandma and grandpa\nOr have gotten their pain pills taken away from them\nAnd they have to resort to using heroin or they have to get heroin and they get it like a really low dose of heroin but if they can make cheap crooked deal in their kitchen it'd be more than happy to do that get rid of their pain\nAnd the stories I heard were heartbreaking stories of like a guy called me and said I was in a motorcycle crash and I was in a lot of pain and the doctors gave me my medication and then one day they just decided we were going to give it to me anymore\nAnd so I had to use heroin\nAnd I'm going wow you know and and I never thought because I always thought you know be where the kids taking drugs but no be where grandma and grandpa who aren't getting their pain medications because the doctors don't know how to treat the pain\nIt's a terrible situation it's absolutely terrible situation as you our talking before a lot of it is based on the fact that we've created a society and we've created a culture that is conducive not not the physical damage the psychic pain to to access the actual pain and guess what opiates work on that too\nYou know it's not just work on physical pain they work on a a spiritual pain on Hanks and now I ... I Believe as a pharmacist that this is a really big part of our our an addiction problem is we are in hey\nWe are so somehow not in a culture that role wars its citizens for being alive or just citizens for participating in society we live in a sick and just ... culture and our our nation's or just a symptom of it\nSo it it is is that there's something missing yeah and that doesn't that doesn't give us a I I like to use this raid the dope it means squirt if you will\nI caught reward Dylan e square is what when you hit it tells me your brain does yet the like you won the lottery it activates the reward center in the brain and we are inherently designed by a chemically by our major she had to get the feeling whatever we want in fact\nWe get to get the feeling when we reach for the door knob and open the door or you get a little hit it don't mean so we we have lots of things that we're supposed to have a lot of the ways that we're supposed to be able to access the doping square as you say but we've created a culture\nThat drives a it's a habit in members the members of the society to living here yeah let her\nSo this is Shane\nAnd rama bitch trauma they they they induced the right amount of trauma and the right amount of time and people need to find\nThat holds missing in their heart in their ... like you say we were talking earlier about ... this is something very real and something that I think everybody should be listening to tonight just to let you know the Connors airs tonight on ABC used to be the Roseanne show and it's Roseanne and predicted that killed her off by using an opioid overdose\nWithout a tight rope between the U.S in Saudi Arabia\nSharp it's ten thirty others radio seven forty Casey outrage traffic and whether they get it [noise]\nThey should make the way to the\n... south but at old Katie rover earlier stalled vehicle has been moved to the shoulder\nAs full size forty five ... balance at cross timbers and we have some evil and overnight roadwork schedule by forty five to go free way north ... south loop as well as to eighty eight south about at six jet [laughter]\nI'd like ... the Gulf Coast windows dot com twenty four hour traffic center [noise]\nWeather Channel forecasts cloudy with a chance of showers overnight lows the fifties to borrow cloudy with just a chance of rain showers in the mid sixties right nowadays fifty seven we're getting reports of rain here at the ... door side likes us twenty four hour weather center\nTen thirty what our top story secretary of state Mike Pompeo calling his talks with Saudi leaders direct and Frank Pompeo met with three Saudi leaders today including the king the king and a crown prince agreed that they are there needs to be a thorough investigation into the disappearance of the journalists ... who was believed that\nOh the death toll from hurricane Michael last week is growing the storm being blamed for at least twenty nine people in four states search and rescue teams are looking through debris and in some cases discovering bodies Nineteen people died in Florida six in Virginia three in North Carolina won in Georgia\nAnd it was on the bed with Katie R.

hardly an sling or you know you know tell me about him or ... or with uh with uh the first drug czar in a column and trucks are but he went on his ... marijuana we say back in the Nineteen thirties the Nineteen forties\nEver going to move the reefer madness\nYeah I remember ...\n... a a Mexican immigrants who are coming to this country for a year to\nTake the lead us back in the Nineteen twenties actually trying to ... century\nStash civil war maybe after the stash American War of the F ... um a lot of Mexican started to come over here at the in the early part of that twenty century and they brought marijuana with them so marijuana became identified with Mexican immigrants and ah this was around the time of alcohol prohibition and\nA government got his great idea to uh to uh to\nMarijuana along with alcohol and we really complain about marijuana nobody really knew what marijuana marijuana was back then but uh they made a they created in the ... campaign around reefer madness this idea that if you smoke pot you would go crazy and there's just a funny movie now wasn't funny at the time covering for mad at the talks about all this stuff\nA ... but they couldn't make it illegal because it was a plant so they had to do is create something called the marijuana act act which I don't know if you heard of that a\nMarijuana tax act a ... put people in jail for not declaring their marijuana\nAnd they put a tax on marijuana and they said he didn't declare tried marijuana and taxes on it you go to jail and then the Nineteen seventies they actually are completely ... or ... with Nixon's war on drugs they actually completely may marijuana illegal and it's been illegal ever said but the fact of the matter is\nIs that people have been smoking pot straight through prohibition or not and our ... our jail are with people who are they are simply because\nThey were selling or smoking or possessing\nAnd like you said earlier we created the police the police state around the around people\nAre just around people who simply want to get high whether it's through a marijuana or psychedelic or even with opiates why don't why don't we don't have a prohibition against alcohol but we know that marijuana clumps I'll\nTell you this is the thing that uh you know and for me I guess it sets be apart from a lot of a talk show hosts are mostly on conservative radio stations because I live in Portland, Oregon where of course it's legal or both recreationally andme ... to to to uh use marijuana use cannabis and um what's really funny is that when I was a teenager\nA and of course one of the rights of passages or in some in some areas is to actually smoke pot\nAnd ah when I did and it was a teenager I smoked it and of course Scott Hi a couple of times they never touched it again and it was funny is that uh you know after you know you make a pact with you so I'm not going to touch this is not good for me to do this I think it's good for my body to do this then I got cancer right and uh when I got cancer\nIt became a so difficult\nTo actually a deal with the law did every day the feeling of ah\nA foggy had all this stuff felt bad and one of my friends came by and he says hey I Want to have you tried something\nThat looked as though no no no I Can't do this and he says what's wrong he says I says I did it in high school it's silly you know no big deal I'm not gonna and he said no give it a try I says I'm a uses and and and it was a guy that it was just completely out of character\nFor him to suggest to me\nThat I should try cannabis and so I did and uh it it it basically took the pain completely away and it was not like some psychosomatic deal where you know so the idea of ... helped me that that came to me because I was totally against the idea\nAnd I I certainly changed my mind and one of the things they found that in studies with older people who have had these hang ups about\nUm things like a cannabis that they ah let them use CBD Oil Somalia does it as an eight minutes on their joints and ever ... ever since they've been given it or if they're given it to end brownie form or an edible form\nThey find that it's far more preferable to the side effects they get from a using a kind of a a a a an ... an opiate\nAnd so that's the problem is that it has such a bad rap and drugs to this country have such a bad rap and see in other countries in Europe in England places all over the world they they treat or this type of a crisis\nNot with jail time and and punishment they actually go in and they give them a medical arrest where they put them in the hospital and they have to be treated\nAnd and and they cannot be released from the hospital facility until they show that they're clean and ah and I'm thinking that I think it would be a far better or a far better thing for this country to look at people with this is not\nFeeling morally but they actually people who are in need of help and they are in need of a ... they are in need of medical care and I know that that may put a burden but there are ways that we can develop facilities we developed cancer facilities were developed a facilities for specialized treatments\nAnd I think that the facilities a specialized treatments on various drugs some of the more lethal ones like crack\nOr uh or or or even heroin addiction and other addictions you\nKnow everybody complains about you know the needles everywhere well if we were to find people put them in facilities and have him is not going as criminals and be trained to be put into the position of criminals there actually put into hospitals where they were under a medical arrest\nThat would be something I think would be an idea that we would need in this country to help ... rehab all the people that have gone through this because the problem is bad and you can agree with me I Know the doctors do not know how to actually\nGet rid of pain that's one of the things pain is one of those things I said at the beginning it evolves over time and you even brought up existential paying you brought up deep pain inside the body that is not pain\nThat his felt physically but it's pain that is felt on a on a I guess you could call it on a conscious level or or your consciousness is he in pain or wracked with pain\nExplained al ... they'll work on that I hey they do yes absolutely that's why people do it yeah I I don't I Can't speak from personal experience but I Know that people I've spoken to many people who say that they like things like ...\nAnd uh I don't know if you've heard of that is a similar to opiate similar they went over ... or a Vikings fan or\nPercocet because it makes them they say it makes them feel good\nAnd what they really mean is it ... it makes them it takes them out of their painter the pain of existence you know we we live our lives as thorough set and most people live their life was quite a sense of quiet desperation ... and like we get beaten down over time\nAnd that creates this sense of I don't want to be a lie they said well you know what I mean one of the scariest\nThings one of the scariest things about opiates then I'll tell you this this was a scary for me I remember when I had my first cancer surgery and uh I was given a pain mad I don't remember what it was I was in the hospital and all of a sudden I felt balance I felt no pain and I felt great because you know after you're dealing with the initial pain and you're feeling the stitches and you're\nAnd this is my got here and it's been caught you know you can't move because it you know your core has been cut and you can't move and it was really weird it was a weird experience to have something that takes the pain completely away and you feel balanced\nAnd that's exactly how I felt when I needed the pain medication or to get rid of my pain and see that's the thing is is the idea of the balance at times\nFeeling that balance when the pain will not go away and you have that balance of of calm where you have that moment where the ... the the warmth Russia's over you and the pan is gone but like I said before there's dependence where you take that pain away because you're dependent on appeal to take the pain away and then when the pain is gone and you still take the pill\nThat's when you realize maybe I'm addicted or maybe I have an addiction to the smell\nIs your body down regulating some natural production\nSo all of a sudden your decision you're out like you say you're out of balance but what's really interesting to me why and how much of the stuff that we talk about an exit central pain for example could be related to things like inflammation inside the body from too much sugar Yeah Yup\nOr or at least some of the nation say maybe we're not getting enough I think we know Tate think out of the diet completely one of the things that happened to get anxious to pry\nSo maybe there's people are suffering from the conditions never teaches this stuff but now they they gave us the food pyramid but they never say hey you know what if you eliminate sugar from your\nDiet side of the information is going to go away just like that you lose weight you're going
