so anyway so we were talking about today let me just to\nGet back to what we're talking about night so I'm really I'm fascinated here and there are not going to let up until I get to the bottom is okay\nI'm fascinated by the comments coming out of the search for extraterrestrial intelligence and the messaging extraterrestrial ... and they're beginning to act as though they are located something okay they're not telling us they've located something that I've had several meetings one in California University of California Irvine\nBad a workshop in Texas just a few weeks ago on how to\nIdentify technical signatures in space it's one of the reasons why we bought the black Cubans go on because we wanted to talk about this type of signatures maybe some people up and we could pick up on low frequency higher frequency whatever so\nWe have to look at various ways\nWill be will make contact with us or how we make contact with them\nOn this program as well I mean not just the black you but we've also at times even run brought this up we used it to reduce\nWe blow into did reduce and we'd blow them over the over the air but they did reduce over the years so in hopes that the signal would go out on all the radios all over the country and all the signals all over the country we send this huge orange sound this ancient sound\nBut I'm sure aliens would understand and listen to\n\nAnd uh you know and and nights we do this we've had like UFO's sightings you had all kinds of cool things going on\nJust last night we had a a a huge fireball come down out of the sky silent Oregon in Lincoln county or people were telling you about it or we just got Tyler and Jeremiah calling the program in the last start seeing the day so that was the only guy to report it and they saw me wonder if anybody else side\nAnd apparently it had an impact a little bit of boom there\nBut see I've been reading a lot of things lately about this whole techno signature clue stuff and for more advanced um you know what they're looking for more advanced civilizations using these techniques signatures well\nI also was reading that there are some people that are bitter believing that ah that there's more to it than just listening for the techno signatures so that we may be\nUnder the control of some of these techno signatures as a human ears picked up on the signals\nAnd unbeknownst to most people it's affecting them in different ways so far there's been no need to panic because they don't know which is how the signals affecting people but it certainly has affected people in the truth is\nThat there are plenty of extraterrestrial signals out there the world's it'd be the whole universe is awash in extra trust just single so we can't even perceive\nOr do we even know about unless someone else ... basically says listen that you hear that that's what we're looking at right now see and so city and many\nGuys run city and Medi spend a lot of time wondering how these messages are being transmitted they're hoping they can find a source before more people pick up on the sound at the moment there you know because it buried it actually buried in the\nBackground of earth noise\nBut uh like I said some people were already hearing this pulse leak sound I recently there was a a story out of Sweden where a mysterious humming sound was recorded the sound is a constant pulsing home but according to witnesses laughed at forty five minutes\nTo an hour a there was there's a film on the Internet going viral right now a snow covered mountains ... out in the middle of nowhere you leaving

uh you know at the polls a media writes in in media or they're all they're they're found very easily and and it's commonplace to find things that just fall who stay\nIn in that and touch region of our planet right um so you know it came to mind a lot of tension that what\nIf while they were building this neutrino detector system has to be so deep in the ground so large that they ran across something they found something that lady shouldn't have been file\nYou know ... and and and that may explain these new or a microorganism\nWill see that you know it might be if y'all out from from whatever they may have filed we're building this detectors or the question is you know where each\nOne is the fall out why does it go against the the uh when they called the classic model these go against everything the classic model opera the right not son particles\nHe's aren't new apart these aren't these are not neutrinos from the sun is not neutrinos from perhaps the quasars something else these neutrinos from or what we call break off from any kind of I guess nuclear fuel or anything it would be similar to nuclear fuel so this is it is something that doesn't belong on this planet\nIs being a ... for the Antarctic ...\nExactly because you know neutrinos generally follow one path and um the majority of them was perpendicular throughout pointed and we're finding their detected large numbers of these\nAre coming from the polls you know that that that's\nThat's a that's all right out and to make our magnetic field or or whatever even affect the trajectory of beef up the drummer particles right\nAnd ... and you know it it is really concerns me 'cause we're you know they they detect this out to be buried deep underground in meal with a water\nAnd in in order to you know to detect a neutrino ...\nLarge numbers of it has to bounce off a particle\nRight ... ... a heavy water molecule right and what when it hits that he'll be ... molecule it creates a flash that the detector can detect it left how they detected neutrinos now while they're building this incredibly large apparatus this you know this has been\nUsed a trainer detectors are not quite ... not quite as widely known as the um had drawn a collider right at least those things are ... miles twenty miles law in in circumference that leads to take these tree or detectors they're\nNot quite as large right but they are in the vicinity of a gargantuan nature and\nWhen they're taking down into their eyes that has not been disturbed\nOr hundreds of thousands of years I mean I'm a little bit later found or a or a thing literally yeah like the movie\nYes they moved around a thing as here in the end it\nIn and and they could open our planet up to something we're not ready to him\nAnd they and that's why they had to bring down the Russian Orthodox a patriarch a president I say are turning his day\nAll the all these our all all of these um\nUm public figures in and politicians in and scientists to before for what you know it it it's scary\nCome really come see what we discovered come see the alien that we've discovered come see the the the creature that lives on practically nothing lives on Aaron sunshine doesn't live on any food\nLives in harsh conditions and look what is putting up putting off neutrinos that are not the classic model sending a signal out into space and then we're getting a signal back and this is why we're so concerned about tech technical signatures SETI\nThey could just do the microorganism whatever they found carry you know we carry microorganism bacteria\nIn our bodies are foreigners just to live just for us to survive you know have good and bad right now what ... wherever they found that may be there and it may be very first to our biological system\nSo they're keeping them contained there obviously but they they're they're they're certainly concerned about the signatures it's giving off there certainly concerned about what we're hearing what we're watching this the the fast radio burst the ... the the rumble in the horn sounds in the air\nThey're concerned about these things because they just don't know how to identify it they can identify\nCoincidence no it's not going to grow it is going out and said oh something's\nBeen found in Antarctica something it was a a actually sending a signal out from space I Believe was more and more they traced the signals to an article the neutrinos signals were also trace\nThis is definitely communication and they won't tell us it's communication until they most certainly

mean we're going to find out we are going to I Hope I Hope we don't find out too late before we can do anything about it\nYeah it's amazing time 'cause Oh thank you for your expertise thank you for calling the program said it's a it's it's definitely something and I'm sure\nThey both the president or those who want disclosure and all this never thought this was going to be happening the way it is a lot of people who are like you know talking about you know other things going on in an article that may have nothing to do with this but certainly it's interesting how this is all coming together I don't think anybody is mentioning\nHow important it is to notice that the things coming out of there do not and and do not fit they do not fit the model the standard model that science has show is
