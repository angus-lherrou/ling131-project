you from the darkness\n\nAnd while there are many conspiracy writers and observers that tend to talk about the material world within the conspiracy history\nWe always seem to point to whomever we hate has control over the world spiritual realm\nWhat is the thriving right now and then it's globalization a lot of frightening and somewhat complex beings that are difficult to understand even I sometimes have to go back and read and understand that's why come in every day early\n\nAnd yeah you can go through all of the bad guys the Mason the jazz with accusing them of controlling all the spiritual rounds of what appears to be the imperial called however it becomes more complicated\nWhen you deal with witchcraft or prescribed that takes place within the spiritual matrix of the elite\nAnd a lot of this I mean I'm sure many of you don't understand it and you know I understand a little of it\nBecause of what I've studied my my entire life what I Would I put into this program every night every major step in the development of the new\nWorld order from a simple ideology to a worldwide super states can be traced back to specific ideologies which uphold ruled by a chosen body of spiritual elite secret Brotherhood's from behind the scenes the Brotherhood whatever it may be or the sisterhood if you want to be equal\nAll plays a role in the hidden hand that guides us towards disorder and it can also be seen as a manifestation of elusive theory and spirituality the professors to enlighten practitioners through mysticism and magic\nAnd I kind of alluded to it in the last hour I used the word synergy there was a guy by the name of a Joseph ... say knives\nAnd he\nHad an opposition to the rise of anarchy and the second half of the nineteenth century\n\nAnd to him the ideal state was a rigid social hierarchy topped by an elite that is pre destined to rule absolutely at odds with the event emerging concepts of democracy\nAnd so he decided that the only way to win and to gain power which do you use the supernatural as a weapon\n\nAnd so\nHe wanted to transmit the secret of synergy throughout the ages basically coming in coordination and cooperation with a divine rule meaning that some spiritual fathers do not exist on this planet and they must be conjured up contacted\n\nAnd one of the spiritual fathers or some of the spiritual bothers us that are key were of course the knights Templar\nAnd other groups that you know actually spawned and and and new ideas and and mysterious mysterious subjects and hidden meanings and certain conjure rings and all these things\n\nAnd I said before that it seems to me that you know be beyond the deep state in the dark state or whatever state you want to point to as a problem there is a darker type of rule\nOf dark command that actually uses the darker powers to greet as sin arcade may be in power right now the government it's run\nAnd it's not our government into towel but what it is it is a government of some kind of group a conspiracy of men or women that form a priesthood and are ruled by a secret society open societies are not always the ones\nThat are named by conspiracy theorists all of them however it played a role in establishing their power plays within the United states and within the world\nThe formation of this nation was perhaps the mother of all conspiracies but from there there were other conspiracy groups other secret societies\nAnd I know many Christians in America believe that the founders were the United states was based on Christian values an ideology this is half true\nBecause the rebellious nature of the insurrection was purely was the very end any bordered on things like her medic arcane ... except for the very beginning\nWe've always had that group\nThat are simply observers they they they're custodians and they make things happen and they call themselves into a different opinion that of the Christians or the Jews are the Muslims and they're in systematic opposition\nTo the apostles to the disciples to those who've adopted the views of Christianity Islam and Judaism and they're against the general teaching any gospel whatsoever any word there would be connected to a\nGod\nA God that they don't approve of\nAnd they are on the opinion that the dog was of any gospel are not good for anyone\n\nAnd this is why they're really ... in most respects has a secret doctrine which is reserved for the elite and this is why when\nYou see things happen but don't sincerely seem\nGodly or or Christ like or or anything you you look at the symbolic language you look at the actions you look at the numbers and all the numbers in the symbolic actions in the language and all of them are puzzle pieces to a greater picture and not always do you have the greater picture and even I don't\n\nThat's why you know I gave a few clues gave it a few hands and I said a couple of nights ago I said you know I'm not gonna give you an exact date I Can't give you a decay exact date or anything I'm not here to tell you the world ending I I\nThat would be stupid to do something like this and many people say that many people are used to the idea that people who talk like guy talks are wanting to just gather everyone together and say the world is ending do yourself then that's it no I'm not a cult leader I'm a talk show host\nAnd know what I'm Talking
