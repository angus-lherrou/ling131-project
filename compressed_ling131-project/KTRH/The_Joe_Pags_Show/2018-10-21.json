{"month": "10", "state": "TX", "station": "KTRH", "content": "So your gains are tied to an external index like the U.S and the five hundred\nAnd you can make forty fifty sixty percent of that index without the risk\nRight now you can get around sixty percent of the S. and P. five hundred without the the downside volatility so when you look at that tool and you say okay it's safe principle protected I can get about sixty percent of the upside my gains lock in every twelve months there no annual fees coming out\nAnd oh yeah if I Want a guaranteed lifetime income I can turn it into a guaranteed lifetime income and that provides me long term retirement security because I might be afraid of running out of money that I may not have enough in retirement\nSo when you look at it as a tool and then you compare that tool to bonds and bond funds will bond funds are probably going to lose money over the next ten to Twenty years\nYou know when you look at real after tax returns after inflation returns and especially if you're paying an advisor to put you into a bond fund the best the bond fund itself is returning slack than taxes and inflation and an advisor fees are probably going to be negative with most bond funds over the next ten to Twenty years\nSo when you compare the one tool a bond fund to another tool fixed annuity are fixed indexed annuity they fixed annuity has a far superior option for someone in retirement no doubt about it\nAnd when we do the statistical analysis and we're looking at portfolios and different weddings into stocks inequities in sectors and different asset allocation models and ... and\nWhen you take the bond funds out and you add the fixed indexed annuity in what it does to the risk return metrics are amazing not to mention all the added benefit you get from a guaranteed lifetime income and peace of mind and confidence et cetera\nSo looking at that tool as a tool and comparing it to bonds in this environment\nThere's no argument to be made the bonds are better investment in my opinion than the fixed indexed annuity for someone in retirement now the downsides to the FIMA you have some liquidity concerns there\nUm most of them only allow you to take out ten percent of your account value per year during the first five to ten years and if you go above that if you take out more than ten percent\nThen there's a fee so that's where the insurance company is going to make sure you don't take too much out say ten percent a year but if you take more than that out they're going to the charges surrender charge\nAs long as you're not putting too much money into that you know let's say Fifteen twenty twenty five percent of the portfolio maybe looking at a short term bonds strategy for whatever else you need safe\nAnd then putting some money in stocks and dividend stocks and some good funds et cetera now you can have some safe money you can have some stocks and you don't have to worry about that safe part of your portfolio bing inefficient unproductive and ineffective\nThat's where the tool comes in from a planning perspective it's a better alternative\nAnd once you look at it objectively because I used to have new ways to you know I said annuities are horrible why would anyone invest in two hundred annuity\nI was only ever aware that variable annuities we're an option it wasn't until about twelve Thirteen Years ago that I became aware of the fixed indexed annuity it's a tool that's all it is that as part of a comprehensive retirement plan once your vision is clear your goals are defined strategies and tools are discussed\nWhen we start building that plan for you if that's a tool that makes sense to you then it can be worked into a recipe of other tools to help those goals come to fruition so division can be executed in retirement\nSo if you have questions if you if you don't understand the annuity world maybe someone is talking to in about a new day now and you want to review of that in ... maybe you have an existing annuity that you've had for some time and you just want to review of that to nobody\nTo see if there's something better in the marketplace that works for you

news radio seven forty cagey our age we're trying to think whether together here Stephen ... [noise]\nAbsolutely and what if somebody came to you a ... and they said hey you know what to over the last three months you've made this much money at work\nHow would you like to make that much money in one week right because that's really what's happened over the last little bit of the markets have gone down we have erased three months worth of growth in the markets in one week's time well imagine if you could get to the point where you looked at a down market like Larry was saying it as an opportunity to generate income\nLiterally taking that opportunity and being able to make money as the markets are going down\nNow in one week the ... the thing I always like to point out to everybody is the difference between ten and twenty is the same whether you're counting up to twenty or whether you're counting down to ten right if you're going twenty down to ten it's the same as ten up to twenty right so when you're making money on the way down that is one of the reasons why we talk about how it's like\nGetting a raise as the markets are going down as long as you understand how to generate that income and you have that skill to generate that income it's like getting a raise in this case if you take that kind of apples to apples comparison it's like making as much in a week\nAs it was it making it in three months so imagine you're your employer coming to you and saying hey how would you like to make as much as you made in the last three months in one week\nWhat would your answer be you know I Would imagine that everybody the answer would be yes\nYou know and then it would be well what do I have to do to be able to generate that income well what do I have to do to be able to make as much money in a in a week as they did in the last three months where you just need to have one more skill you just need to have the skill of being able to time it bearish market and it's just like ... market it's just the other direction it's very simple\nProcess and it's something that like I say we're talking about earlier is can be very very very lucrative and a lot of times a week and come back on to this because we want to do a little a little give away to help people get started\nBut a lot of people look at it as and there's more risk and the thing is is there's not more risk and in some cases there's actually less risk\nAnd embarrassed market than an abortion market but one of the things that we can do to help you people get started Larry's we get a big stack of tickets here for our show today we say we give away some passes to one of these half day classes definitely especially if there's somebody out there that now believes they hit a point in their lives when they realized they deserve more we gotta we gotta help I'm Ryan absolutely right now we've got to have to a class in your area\nThe happy classes where you'll see exactly what it takes to really generate that income whether the markets are going up down or whether the markets are going sideways\nAnd just a second you're going to have a chance to win a set of passes one of these half day classes to get your phone's ready and if you are driving now is a good time to pull over\nIncluded with your passes going to be our professional insiders kit now this kid is packed with lessons from some of our top instructors lessons on topics like how do we Hansi retirement strategy how to make money when the market goes down income generation capital preservation crypto currency is much much more the professional insider kitten makes it so you can get started right now\n... we need you to call now and reserved those seats\nThe number is eight eight six one to eight seven to three that's eight eight eight six one to eight\nSeven to three if you end up being colors nine or Twenty one sorry about that hit us up at Houston oh TA dot com ... passes there\nBut Larry that's one of the things I think people kind of miss on in a down market as it is we think oh it must be more risky and in some cases it's actually you can prove it out to be far less risky in a down market with how margin and different things work but at the same time\nAnything that we don't understand where usually afraid of it isn't it just mainly fear that holds people back from accomplishing their goal so absolutely you know when in fact\nI'll share a story short my students Jim the other day it was funny we were talking about this whole concept the fear of leaving a job\nAnd the worst thing that ever happens to any of us especially if you're listening is it all of a sudden you start working for someone else and then your net worth is tied up and to what other people define it to be let me explain what I'm Talking about Ryan so yeah I remember the old story the frog and the frog can jump as high as it possibly wants to\nBut if you go to ... frog in a box and you put a lid on top of that box and all of a sudden the fraud charge a couple of times to jump\nBut it's the lead even when you take the little way the frog still will not jump higher than it could be for and that's kind of most of us out there and we start getting into these routes we're relying on a pay check for somebody else we start to believe we can't make any more money and what's great what Jim is ... and a lot of other students\nAnd we've been doing this for over Twenty years right now is that feeling of when you first start making more money than you do at work\nBecause then all of a sudden you're just frog again you can jump very very high and all of a sudden that cap that you've been believing your whole life has gone away\nAnd that's the sad part right now 'cause most people out there are stressed out that they have to stand a job they have no other outcome or vehicle when reality you can go ahead and you can short the markets\nSo great analogy like when I use is each week and I like using it as well I've said this over and over again when you're learning how to short the market meaning you're able to trade when the market goes down\nVery legal coach ... and the great part about it is I think of yourself in a car right now and you know you want to go somewhere but if the car only one and drive and never went in reverse\nYou can eventually get there it's not going to be cost efficient for gas or time but you'll eventually get there where why would you want to do that\nPeople do that everyday Ryan what they're trading they're only looking in the markets to go higher and as you said when the markets go lower it could be an opportunity to buy at a discount it doesn't always mean there's a problem with the stock\nYeah absolutely right there there's opportunities all over the place and and I love what you're talking about what the frog because 'cause it it it you know I was teaching a class last night and I have another session with with the same group tonight and you know I was talking about how a lot of the the the obstacles that we have to overcome our mental\nRight and and what you're talking about the frog hitting its head on the boxing you move the box and all of a sudden they can jump up\nIt is that it it is that ceiling that we're putting on ourselves right and we we have the whole oh I Can't do that type of a conversation and I have a five year old son who who over and over the the words I Can't or or just not even really allowed in our house because we do start to put\nThose uh we do start to put those binders on us and and make it so that we really don't know if I'd jump high it's gonna it's gonna hurt my head as we stop even trying you know a while ago they uh you know ... years and years ago they said it was physically impossible to run a four minute mile a vis the about a week ago there was a world championships for Iron Man and Kona\nAnd the the winner and about a six minute mile for twenty six miles after doing a hundred mile bike ride wow if you can't run a four minute mile you're you're not even on Olympic on Olympic track and field team anymore at least one for a minute mile not not to mention back to back to back straight\nSo so so these these these these restraints that we put on ourselves we also put on our finances and we ended up kind of\nPainting that our own picture that we end up residing in it and if you're if you're willing to kind of challenge the norm and you're willing to put in a little more effort\nOr a lot can be granted to you and it really just does come from getting started and putting a little bit more effort in but we could help a few more people get started we've got to stack tickets here the show is just beginning what you say we do know that give away let's do it\nRight now I've got a half day class coming up in your area and they have to classes where you see exactly

O. B. right stance for just over broke because if we're just relying on it we are just over broke because if it goes away we're in a world of hurt well in this segment here we want to spend a little bit of time on retirement accounts\nThe markets have been super volatile right we've had a big us we've had big down and so what can we do to protect those retirement accounts and whether you're just tuning in maybe your first time listening or maybe been with us for the whole show get excited\nThe best is yet to come and Larry whenever I'm Talking with a lot of our listeners sometimes via social media and a lot of them when it comes to retirement accounts are saying number one they're saying they don't have enough money to retire and those that do have enough money to retire\nOr just not quite sure really what they should be doing with it so it's kind of the consolidated message that you can or individual messages whichever direction you'd like to take it\nThat that you and your instructor team early giving those people who are concerned about their retirement accounts especially with the with the big drop we had in the market the other day well the simple thing I Would share with our\nAudiences the cavalry ain't come and there's nobody here it's going to protect your capital better than you can right now and the way to do that with education I mean right now statistically about every ten years the market has corrected we saw fifty percent correction in two thousand uh fifty eight percent correction in two thousand eight\nWho's to say we might not see a sixty four sixty seven percent correction in the market and matching your four one K. becoming a one oh one K. and the reason for this is\nThis is the first generation right now that it's been subjected to market fluctuations in your retirement accounts think about it prior you had pensions that was completely outside of the market you're basically boss put aside their profits or payroll to make sure you had a retirement account\nAnd right now that's gone away you're completely dependent upon your four one K. and here's a scary\nThought Ryan you know I've talked about this all the time\nRight now people have been told and I've been doing this pretty pretty habitually of putting money into their retirement account every two weeks when they get paid but here's the big problem and I want everyone to listen to this because it's kind of scary right now is that you've been putting money into this market the last three years at all time highs\nNot when the market was low so imagine when there's another correction the first money that's going to come out is the most expensive amount of money that you've been saving towards retirement\nA lot of our students come in they want to learn the right way to be able to preserve capital how to make sure they're in the right funds when they're putting on their trades to be able to maximize for their retirement and well a lot of things that we hear right now is can you see or do you see how this can really help you pretty much preserve capital over the long term\nIt's always buy low so high it has been for a thousand years it will be for another thousand years that that has never changed and that was one of the topics are ahead of my class last night as is the markets don't change the marsh don't change we look at it on a phone\nInstead of looking at it on a on a on a ticker tape\nBut getting print it off right but the market still don't change it's all about by low and it's all about so high and somewhere along the lines we kinda got distracted from that and I think the average investors out they're investing their money on pay and they plan to sell when they're sixty five and none of that has anything to do with price and so if we're not buying it a low price and we're not selling at a high price\nIt's pretty much impossible forced to make any money now one of the fun things about the markets whether it's your retirement account or whether it's your income account\nIt's it's the same right it's it's all about just identifying a low price and buying and identify a high price and selling\nNow we get kind of caught up in this whole emotional back and forth of maybe stocks that we love her or or or things that we want to be invested in rather than being invested in the right things and and uh there's this guy Dan that uh when it first started trading I I I did a lot of work with Dan he was a great friend ... you know acted as a mentor and many different kinds of aspects\nAnd Dan used to always say you can't live your stocks they're never going to have you back and he would talk about and he had a little story to help you remember it I won't share it out there but it was just kind of funny you say you can't live or stocks they're not going to have you back\nAnd think about it if you're invested into a company right now it doesn't matter\nFor what it is if you called them up they wouldn't even know who you are right but for some reason we fall in love with potentially investigated this company who number one doesn't know who we are number two doesn't care about us they don't care about it all on an honestly why would they write and Larry you're talking about you know taking care of our retirement accounts and how nobody's going to take better care of it than we are\nAnd and it's it is true and the reason\nThat I firmly believe that is because nobody has to live off of our accounts except for us right nobody has to live off of your account except for you\nNobody has to live off of Mike accept for me and so in the end as kind of courses that can sound\nNobody cares right there's there's not an institution out there that they that they stay up at night going men I Hope I Hope John and Mary have enough money in their retirement account\nYou know what they say that because they want to make sure they have enough fees being paid to them as long as their monies in retirement account but every day there's a new twenty two year old that opens a retirement account replaces somebody who is closing their retirement status perpetual\nKind of ... income stream that comes from that anyway so at the same time do we stay up at night right the average person\nHas many sleepless nights over money but how much time as the average person spent getting educated on how to make sure their money is growing right I I find the financial markets very interesting because we go to a a car dealership and there's a car salesman there and we really don't take his advice on what we should buy but yet we go to a car dealership\nThat has the uh financial institutions name on the front of it where they're selling mutual funds and we take the cells persons advice to heart and we go well he's the professional in the situation\nNow with a lack of education that's kind of where we end up ah falling behind the eight ball and the financial world one of the things that we can do is we can help a few more people out with that because we still got some tickets we can give away let's do it\nRight now we've got to have to class coming up in your area that the cost of ... exactly what it takes to really take control those retirement accounts and have them growing generating more income whether the markets are going up down or sideways\nNow included with your half day class including with your past is going to be our professional insiders kit now this is packed with lessons from some of our top instructors the professional insiders kitten makes it so you can get started right now\nBecause tenth through twenty when he did a call now and reserved those seats\nThe number is eight eight six one to eight seven to three that's eight eight eight six one to eight seven to three if you end up being colors nine or Twenty one sorry about that hit us up in Houston oh TA dot\nThat what I Believe here is that the average layman can most of the time and it's the only profession you can do this\nTrading where the layman can outperform the professional with some coaching and some education\nSo right now a lot of our students are realizing that these cases are kind of dwindling I mean in the twenty first century right now as long as you have a laptop and you have an Internet connection and you have a series of simple steps that's really what we teach is they simplify trading system of step by step investment strategy\nTo help define the way that people make money on Wall street there's no excuse not to and Sam ... said this many times the architect of our core strategy that really what trading is is just the transfer money from people who don't know what they're doing to people who do know what they're doing\nI think that's an important concept to remember because it's not like the money just grows on trees and all of a sudden it shows up in our account right what happens is there's a buyer and seller and there's a transaction that occurs and there's a winner and there's a loser and a lot of times we we forget about that side of the market but the markets are really just a conduit and this is one of the ways I explain it to my classes as\nThe markets are a conduit just hooks us all together that's really all the market places to meet up\nWe all go there to hang out and what do we do there well we buy and sell stocks and people who want to sell stocks show up with their stocks and people who want to buy stocks go there to buy stocks it's just like a farmer's market but at the stock market or commodities market\nBut it's just buyers and sellers and money transfers like a farmer's market when I buy tomatoes money transfers transfers from my account into somebody else's account and it's the same thing in the financial markets and a lot of times we don't realize that as we're losing somebody else who made the right decision is actually out there making\nYeah and they're also living their lives most of us right now which jobs are stressed out we're worried about losing our job especially for the correction comes again\nMost people are just one paycheck away from poverty and so a lot of our students are figuring this out how do I go from being emotional to becoming strategic\nAnd the way they do that is to get the proper education learning how a three hour session can completely change your alive and you know Ryan you know I've talked about this over and over again\nHolidays are coming up it's that time of year again everyone's going to make their resolutions yeah right well that's kind of silly 'cause a resolution is basically your intention to do something and the two biggest ones we hear what\nI'm going to lose weight this year they come out of out of debt and made our money but the difference here right now is don't just make it a resolution make it a promise to yourself\nThat you're going to figure out a way to get more financially secure\nYeah I remember my grandpa used to say this and I remember hearing it somewhere else too but I'm just gonna give him credit for it but it used to always say\nUh the goal without a plan and executed will plan is this is a dream you know go without a plan is a dream and and that's one of the things that we spend a lot of time on an online trading ketamine that step by step plan that step by step process on how to accomplish the goal because in the end we are we going to come up to the holidays here pretty quick\nAnd all of a sudden everybody is going to plan out their New Year's resolutions that I don't remember all the statistics we went through it back in January on the show but it ends up being something like within four weeks eighty percent of the people have completely given up and I'm not even thought about their New Year's resolution and part of that is there wasn't an executed plan\nThey didn't know exactly what to do tomorrow and\nThe only attributed plan right now is the gyms knowing they're going to start running their commercials in there and you know\n... and they're going to make a killing thirty bucks a month but at the gym memberships skyrocket but at the same time\nPutting our our best foot forward and giving us an opportunity to reach that financial goal is critical out there as well and and we have to do\nWhat we have to do what it takes to accomplish the goals we want to lose a little weight we got to spend a little more time on the treadmill\nAnd we want to make a little more money we've got to get those skills and one of the places where we can really start bringing the knowledge that we can work our way up into that skill set is I don't want to have their classes and we've got this stack the deck a tickets is dwindling we must be towards the end of the show but we got a few tickets left would you know they give away let's do it\nRight now I've got to have to class coming up in your area and they have to classes where you'll see exactly what it takes\nTo really live that life that you won't get your money making money and and I always like to see what he got two dollars or two million dollars you'd be able to see exactly what it takes to get that money generating that income that can really sustain that lifestyle that you deserve now include with your passes it's going to be a professional insiders kit and this is packed with lessons from some of our top instructors\nLessons on topics

how many people spend so much time watching TV procrastinating\nComing up with the reason why they can't do something and what if you only need it to take maybe a third of the time that you're doing right now he's a procrastinating of watching TV just to learn how to trade and make more money so I asked you to solve the time you ever wondered what your life would be like if you can quit your job

predict it wouldn't get to this level right but but I said I was a hundred percent on board and because I knew\nThat my father in law can do this job he's a businessman he is so smart when it comes to negotiating seeing when he's been able to do in in so many different respect what Tara with trade um\nHe's really great at that than I knew back then that he would be great at it um for me it was a hundred percent and again I don't think anything prepares you for for all of this um ... it's it's it's so much bigger than any of us but\nThat's why I think although we all get attacked on the time although the president gets attack every second of every day\nNone of us for a second one change any of that because we know that it is about the bigger picture and the future of the country and if we have to take a couple of things going on here and there and the president\nOr you know take that every single day more than any of us it's totally worth it because I really think this country is headed in the right direction they get an I always tell him he's going to go down in history as one of the greatest presidents and countries ever had\nA ... roof that it's Laura Trump or her husband his or her father in law is the president I asked him back in twenty six teams of because you just said it was nowhere near I mean you expected that the media would come after the leopard come after you guys but not like this\nAnd I understood it was completely unexpected he said no I knew that they would want to go hard on me probably go dirty on me but I had a lot of friends in the media you told me I made millions and millions of dollars for NBC on The Apprentice for thirty or forty years the media actually treated me very well and wanted me in the newspaper on their television or radio show\nSo he didn't know that it would get to this extreme you've been in the media for a long time I've been to newsrooms for a long time as well yesterday lean left but I didn't know was going to be like this\nShow what ways when was the realization for you in the family that this was way worse than we thought it was going to be [noise]\nWhile I was actually still for a portion of the campaign working at my former job in television and\nI ... it became very frustrating for me to work there because\nI Would be all different nations but sometimes ours including um the way that they would find things in and say hey that's not what he said you know what he said um that that was it it it wasn't very clear wind to me that I don't didn't think that I was going to be able to work there for for\nForever if you know he became president ... but um but certainly after they started attacking all of us personally and you know when I was pregnant and they they attacked my unborn\nChild needs to make them talk about it is a ... so crazy\nBut again I think it's because they knew before that I'm trying to McCain president that if he got in there there was no turning back that he was all business and he was really going to be looking out for the American people and their old way of life was going to come to an end though um I have to say that it it's just another sign that he's doing a great jobs\nYou know I Would agree with you you guys were you have the ... of any family members even my wife is Lara Trump or Iraq because her husband and father in law of course is the president of the United states we've got we've got senatorial races now that are starting to lean writes the midterms are starting to look better in the Senate for Republicans although I can say that it doesn't mean anything unless people go and vote\nIn Texas where I should go Ted Cruz the incumbent he was doing an incredible job in working with your debt with your father in law are very well know although it was rough on the campaign trail who's being challenged from a guy by a guy who's basically Obama\nAre saying you know we can work together yeah one one undivided Texas but under the surface those you know he's a former left wing socialist disco ward you look at places like Michigan or W ... been there for three decades and it's time for her to go now and you've got a guy named John James who might actually be able to get\nThe senatorial seat this really is going to come down to whether we can motivate people who believe in what they see happening now in the country to get off the ... you can go vote I mean it's really what it is isn't it\nOh absolutely well as I speak to you right now I'm In Minnesota not traveling estate campaigning I Will be in your neck of the woods in Texas on Monday youthful\nI Will be onto your day ironically and Michigan I'm miss it so so important we we know that\nThe president has done incredible things already and that's what a lot of people against and even people in his own party in terms of money and get them to think about\nWhat could happen if he had a cohesive unit of people behind him that voted along side president and and really pushes agenda forward we can see so much more progress in the country and by the way I Know we talk about socialism if anybody has any question about what social and them look like the look in Venezuela right now\nThat could become the United states of America\nIf we let people like or or take over and and put his agenda forward it's really very frightening\nSocialism has never worked in fact that the Democrats are embracing people like that since shock everybody to a degree that you you not only are going to get out and do it in the midterms but you're going to take everyone in your neighborhood and everyone in your family to go about\nUm it it's very area and I know that it felt like a fight and twenty think came to get Donald Trump elected in ... certainly was the fight isn't over you and you can't come back we can't relax we can't be complacent me I think it out and got to vote and put people in Congress who we are going to vote with the president\nIs running if anybody ever wants to know about socialism talk to them in their shoes are delicious it was his wife is from Venezuela who tells the stories of how disgusting is there I mean there are people waiting in line for food than the government officials show up beat them up maybe even kill him in the streets to take care of their families for students may him in the country it is horrific\nAnd you really do have people in this country\nBecause you've ... you've got people who are actually starting just guide Gillum in Florida we are going to go the way of socialism because that's the best way to go\nTo Florida last question I really appreciate your time and by the way I'm Glad you're in Minnesota we go forward stations or we were very highly rated in Minneapolis St Paul and keep your kids are hearing you right now um\nWhen you look at the fact that people on the left are saying voters and will impeach the president will open the border will abolish ice we will roll back the tax cut you can take more of your money away it will drive jobs out of the country\nThat's what they're running on and the factors there almost fifty fifty right now in almost every poll you see what is it that we're doing wrong you and I ... done junior the president's ... the Fox news sanity what are we doing wrong but it's still so close that is crazy to me\nWell I don't know Joe that it's really that close I mean we thought how accurate the whole weren't true in a great point but I don't\nReally think that if that is out there I think there are people that are afraid to tell a pollster that call them or approaches them on the street\nSet they want to vote Republican because the media and Hollywood and done such a a number on on people whenever they come out and support him to president or as a Republican I'm so I think it does make people a little\nHesitant to voice their support sometimes but when they get in the voting booth whenever no one else is looking when they think about the ... where we come in this country and almost elected in two years under President Donald Trump through\nAnd they think about their children and the teacher the country I really think that they're going to vote Republican and um it's just a matter of getting people out and encouraging people to get out and vote volunteer knock doors make phone calls how everybody you know to go vote\n[noise]\n\n[noise] [noise]\n\n\n[noise]\n\n\n[noise]\n[noise] no\n\n\n\n\n\n\n[noise]\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhen when he was off the land Joe packs dot com Facebook Twitter Instagram email all the way through the live video feed\nIs well plus the blaze radio network it's the weekend\nWas Joe ... won a hundred ... all one Seventy eighty\nJoe ... comments they said uh Michelle ... is a great political commentator great

talked to germs Michelle I appreciate you how are you\nGood how are you doing I'm doing great ... listen thanks for taking a ton of want to jump into the gods no movie a which sort of piqued my interest the other day that's why I reached out to you but you're not start with Elizabeth Warren it turns out is one one thousand twenty four\nNative American so I'm Out in the left BDO ... the show now says she's basically like a a Cherokee queen [laughter] that's right what am I missing here\nShe has been vindicated I I'm I'm I'm never\nFlabbergasted by the links to which the identity politics left will go to write to try and unwind\nBlatant lie ... this is a woman who advanced her her career by manufacturing a ... a Native American ancestry that it's been debunked over and over and over again and I I really do believe that her staff was\nConvinced that by releasing their results of tests\nThat showed that cheap possibly\nHad Native American ancestry six to ten generations back yeah but that was based on a proxy of Native American blood right in other words the researcher\nUsed South American genetic markers as a some sort of of estimation for whether or not she really at this ancestry come on\nThis is someone who identified as a woman of color right in order to secure a position in a in a prestigious Ivy League university\nIn a very real way Rachel does all is about as black is this woman is Native American and you're right you're using what ... as ... hoping they're praying that the south American blood somehow has some native blood and there is no proof in other words she's wider than I'll ever be site and in\nFact by statistics that were quoted and none other than the New York times it turns out that this one thousand one one one thousand twenty fourth fraction of a possible Native American bloodline makes makes sure her less\nIn other words than the average white American right more Native American ancestry than she does\nA hundred percent but you're absolutely right about that in the Boston Globe tried to say that she was one thirty second at the at the most and one one thousand twenty four at the least they even had to update that four hours later and say okay maybe one sixty fourth at at the most\nWhich was an army battalion I'm English are polish and Irish or you know these things\nAnd I'm I'm I'm actually you know about two thirds Italian than the other stuff falls into\nI have no clue one one thousand sixty fours anything else and nobody can ever we I don't think you'd never really find that out but then one tiny little marker on one time ... scale amazing Trump's you don't need a million dollars and apologized or help me understand\nYeah yeah you know the the rich irony in a serious point is that this week I'm of a very important cases being litigated by legitimate Asian American students have um suit Harvard University which awarded\nElizabeth Warren this a position as a as a professor right because of her fake claim and those Asian American students have on earth do all sorts of admissions\nDocuments showing that they were discriminated because they were Asian American and there were too many of them in the university system and it just goes to show you that you know the the ... the Olympics of grievance and the Olympics of identity politics brings us exactly to the to this point in time and and it's\nAnd it and I think so many people are sick and tired of it I mean for the\nTwenty five plus years that I have been an outspoken conservative quote unquote of color and yeah I'm darker than Brock Obama\nI've had all of these white progressive left is shouting at me that I'm not really my ethnicity because of my beliefs\nAnd that to me really is is the real offense here of of white liberal progressive telling true legitimate quote unquote people of color that they're not people of color while they're bracing phony like Rachel do at all and and Elizabeth Warren\nAnd all through shown getting in there as well ... ...\nDot com boom to read her blog on what you do the room as you know you're going to re TV show on TV where she's at noon incredible investigative reporting um I wanted
