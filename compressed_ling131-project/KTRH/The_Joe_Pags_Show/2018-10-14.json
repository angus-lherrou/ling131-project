going to help us clearly identify your goals\nAnd then once we have a very clear picture of your vision and goals now we can talk about which strategies are best to employ to help bring those that vision and those goals to reality\nAnd then only at that point and we didn't talk about the tool such as stocks or bonds or mutual funds or annuities or insurance or long term care planning whatever

uh the thoughts are the Texas survived a cause of the uh uh coming off whenever Oklahoma but this was about having a persevere with what Baylor was doing and losing your starting quarterback today than it was about anything else\nAbout no doubt and Baylor has been playing well in Texas all offensively moved to football but couldn't punch it in and\nAgain you know the the fleeting moments of a of a place kicker last week Kamron dicker the huge game this week he he came up missed a couple of free of field goals that could have extended that lead to multiple possessions but\nUh the defense made a couple of plays got some pressure on Charlie ... wouldn't like he just do it up and they were incomplete sometimes he was forced to throw it up on the last drawn because of the pressure was coming but uh it's been I Can't remember the last time they've gone seven straight weeks before the by usually they get a little bit earlier\nAnd to win six in a row after we came home from from

see the last time ... soul possession first place in the big copper\nStanding especially this late in the season last year and then they got off to win in conference play but this late\nIn the season six game winning streak you have to go back to two thousand nine for the last time they started out six in one so uh they're getting back to that area where the problems are a little different now because you can talk about problems after wins it it's a lot easier to stomach and probably for the coaches a lot easier to to go back to the office and work on\nIt is a twenty seven I was stately

economy really shed some light on consistent returns in the market [noise]\nOne of my favorite topic those talking about consistency in the market so many times I'll I'll run into different traders different investors if they've had some success they've had some success in the market but they really had a hard time duplicating it and that ends up being the key really in anything that we do is how can we make money consistently how can we make\nMoney over and over and the financial markets are no different it's all about that consistent approach being able to make money as the markets are going up being able to make money at the markets are going down\nAnd also being able to make money at the market's going sideways we need to be generating income whether it's income for today or income for tomorrow in this segment we're going to spend a little bit more time talking about the income side of things but whether you're just tuning in\nMaybe your first time listening or maybe you've been with us for the whole show get excited the best is yet to come and learn a lot of our listeners like we were talking about are are are looking to replace their income with trading investing some are looking to upgrade their lifestyles with a little additional income\nAnd and you can even call it maybe that that supplemental side that you were talking about a few minutes ago and and some are looking for this to go kind of beyond that supplemental it'd be their primary source of income\nAnd I've even heard people say that they're number one goal is to be able to fire their boss now now whether they're going to or not you know being in that position where you can make that call you know that starts to be that primary source of income but what are some of the key things that you guys work with students on\nWho are looking to supplement or they're looking to even build this is the primary source of income that's a great\nRight you know what I find with a lot of our students they first come into the academy thinking they want to make a lot of money when reality what they're looking for is freedom we've been doing this for over Twenty years we have over four hundred and fifty thousand students now in the academy and what we find over and over again especially coming to this class\nIs that they are really looking for freedom as I mentioned that could be they want to leave a job they don't like they want to spend more time with their families\nThey really are looking to take a vacation make people now are so nervous about going on vacation because they'd lose their jobs if they even took a day or two off we're living in this constant stream of stress right now and what I'm finding is a lot of our students who come in thinking they want to make a lot of money\nIt's really about that freedom and it's funny I got him Adam was one of my students and he actually did just what you\nRaces the gun on Sally Adam seven thirty on these radio seven

structure it online trading really shed some light on multiple streams of it a little bit about half of it can we talk a little bit about active income and then specifically\nSpent a lot of time on the Baltimore streams of income side of things in the financial freedom that that can really generated I Love the the the conversation about the the average millionaire having five plus dreams of income\nAnd you can break that down into different directions but but even the whole conversation we're having a few minutes ago leery about about building the skill first the skill comes first the income comes later in so many times we want the income\nWe want the income now without the skill right how many how many times have you talked to a a surgeon and they said oh you know what I'm going to do a little bit of surgery here I'm In a practice heart surgery so that I can pay for medical school and then develop the skill it just doesn't really work that way we've got to have the skill first otherwise that operating table can be dangerous spot to be laying\nNow unfortunately it ends up being that same ... that same conversation when it comes to our money and I had somebody say oh well this isn't life or death\nBut really when we're talking about our finances it is our financial life or death so we really want to take this just as seriously we work too hard for this money\nTo have it not heading in the right direction on a consistent basis and this retirement money that we want to talk about in this segment is exactly that it's in a situation where we're usually just buying every other friday right just 'cause it's paid and we've been told every other friday we're just supposed to put some money and our retirement accounts\nAnd it will just slowly growing and well that's true in a polish marketing it bearish market which was what you were just touching on his right as we were going to break that kind of detrimental side of things we can continue to buy into assets that are deteriorating and it's a lot like lighting our retirement accounts on fire or at least a little portion of our paycheck\nWhen we're throwing it into a deteriorating assets oh just a few of the things that we want to want to keep in mind and one of the things I really love to have you Larry shed some light on in here because we do have a lot of our students\nWho are really out there trading they do have their retirement accounts and and when I talk to our students I'm hearing a lot of people say you know number one they either don't have enough money to retire on you know are a number to those that do they're not quite sure really how to continue the growth\nAnd to protect the downside right and that's really that point you were getting at a before he took the break and so I'd love to give you kind of give you the floor here to take that back over border some of the things you and your instructor team are doing with investors to help make sure they have income for retirement\nRight and the number one mistake that most people make because they think they could do this on their own then they wind up coming back and realizing they need the education so we start talking to our students about is how they can start creating a strategy for success when it comes to the retirement\nRight now you know it's funny when the market started to go down this week a lot of my friends call me and they started going what does this mean they started getting all nervous not one student emailed me and said Larry do you see this is a bad thing in fact\nMost people who know what they're doing they're elated that this is starting to happen most people waited ten years for another market correction why because statistically the markets always tend to correct about every ten years or so last major when we had was obviously in two thousand eight here we are in two thousand Eighteen\nSo what's now becoming more important than ever\nIs it took people about six years to recover from the last correction\nPeople out there listening if you don't have six years right now or you're planning to retire\nYou don't have anything saved right now you need to figure out how to create a plan to help protect you and a lot of our students come in the door really nervous about I don't have enough money to start well you know what they're doing right it's pretty fascinating they're starting to learn how to trade\nOther asset types like futures and ... and they're saving that money from trading and they're starting to fund their retirement accounts\nSo again a lot of people first thing they always say is what I got the mortgage I've got the kids' college up on their retirement always comes last so we start to teach our students right out of the gate that they could come up with a plan they understand most importantly\nWhat you need is because a lot of people the one size fits all does not work when it comes to retirement you can't just do this you first have to figure out what your needs are learning how to manage that need most importantly how to learn some really important risk management and how to protect that money\nAnd then at the end of the day you'll have enough to retire on based on what you need not someone else who's telling you what you need\nYeah and you're talking about the kind of the cycles that the markets go through the big ups and the big dams and we do generally have a crash about every and we call them crashes but we do generally have a nice big drop in the markets about every ten years\nAnd one of the things about that if you go back and look at um how often\nThey're forty fifty sixty percent drops and so\nKind of that average uh that we can expect is about a fifty percent if you go back into two thousand and eight new kind of measure that yet about a fifty percent dropped Becky fifty eight percent about fifty eight percent you go back into their early to thousands fifty say the same thing and so if we come to here and we say OK here's here that's kind of what we can expect again that's kind of the new normal\nBut the thing that I went through with my father about ah we we had a conversation about this you know back in about two thousand and eight\nOr you know we're talking about drops in the market we're talking about drops and accounts and and one of the things that we're we're kind of walking through was\nIf somebody had a fifty dollar if somebody had a hundred thousand dollar account\nAnd they lost fifty thousand and they lost fifty percent will they lost fifty thousand so now they're account value of that fifty thousand that happened in one year and that drop happened I think it was fourteen months total rights that happened in pretty much just a year it went down when they take the average rate of return on the way up and let's just be very very generous and let's say somebody is averaging ten percent on the Web\nThat's ten years just to get back to break even 'cause when you take a hundred and you turn it into fifty\nTo take fifty and turn it into a one hundred requires a one hundred percent return on our money and so one of the conversation we were talking about was how long does it take the average person to really even get back to break even after going through a big catastrophic drop like that\nSo one of the scariest things right now is that people just don't have a plan that don't know what to do they haven't been educated and so unless you're really sitting there thinking about this and say to yourself\nFool me once shame on you fool me twice shame on me and\nAlbert Einstein had one of the greatest quotes was the definition of insanity is doing the same thing over and over again it's amazing how many people are not willing to spend a little bit of money to get themselves educated to invest in themselves instead of taking this big roller coaster ride and think about it Ryan going back to two thousand and eight\nAnd what are the some of the things people are doing to really get that freedom\nWell the first is taking a step I mean a lot of people are poor for the simple reason\nPoor stands for passing over opportunities repeatedly\nThe people tend to do better in life do so by taking action when opportunities arise they're not in their comfort zone they're not fearing all the time what they're doing is they're learning a skill that will allow them not only to help themselves maybe their kids their grandkids and again what I find with our students Ryan is they're not\nFrom a certain way or education or background\nThere simply people that are ... and they're passionate about learning something new again I mentioned this earlier the number one mistake that most people make with their money is they think they can do this on their own and then they'll go to the education later well that's the wrong thing to do one creates bad habits\nAnd number two they never do go back to the education because they blown up the money they had\nSo what do good students do I talk to them all the time number one\nThey've realized in the twenty first century that they can take a laptop anywhere in this world right now it doesn't matter because as long as they have an Internet connection and their laptop\nThey can trade all over the world in fact we had a student named ... he's in San Diego and a lot of times are students feel it's too hard they can't do it well not only is beyond done this and his left his job which is exactly what everybody wants to do right we want to quit a job you don't love to do something we do love\nHe's become a excellent trader and he's also now started funding his wife's real estate business so the two of them are doing something together\nSpending more time together spending more time on vacations in family but the important thing here Ryan is it they're loving what they're doing and there's so many people out there and if you're one of those people hopefully you can see how you can benefit from just learning a skill that can give you the freedom that you desire\nYeah absolutely and it's it's kind of interesting as we're as we're sitting here talking about the lifestyle of a traitor I'd just literally received a text message from a dear friend of mine\nAnd it just popped up on my phone and he was actually somebody who got me started in trading he was one of the first people who said this is how you open an account these are the steps that you go through it very very first conversations these just become a lifelong dear friend of mine and and he he's a huge ski bum he lives up in Salt lake you just easy travels around it as a great time\nHe just texted me with a picture of snow ski saying hey can you use these this season or should I take him to the ... because if I go to Salt Lake uses bum a pair of skis from it rather than a hall in mine around\nBut it it's just there's just so much freedom that can come with it and it\nReally ends up just pulling down to a couple of basic steps a couple of basic as you were saying changes or actions that need to be taking because I think it's very critical it's very important it's it's very powerful once we do understand\nThat that that poor is just the state of mind right that passing over opportunities repeatedly\nAnd it's something that can be really easily changed just by stepping out of our comfort zone right just by stepping out of our comfort zone and doing something different we talk a lot about\nKind of cliche statements on the show here but it's because they're so true and there are so useful and it goes back to if we've always done if we always do what we've done will always get what we got in and if we are completely satisfied with where we are then then great let's continue to do what made us so happy and the first place\nBut if we want a little bit more for trying to create a little more income if we're trying to create a little more freedoms we have a specific goal\nThat we're trying to accomplish that we haven't been able to get to\nWe have to make the necessary changes and that's one of the life lessons that my grandfather shared with me my whole life growing up he would hold up his five fingers I Would have to name all of them\nThe first one is no your business the second one is be converted and that converted one as a youngster I honestly didn't understand what it meant and as I got involved with trading and I really started to go kind of soul searching down is is this something that's gonna work for me am I going to be able to do this\nThat converted when I started to realize was make the necessary changes the necessary metamorphosis do what's necessary\nAnd and and in the beginning and that was the one I was kind of didn't put as much emphasis on when I was like ten eleven twelve even Eighteen Nineteen twenty you know but then as I really started into my my grown up years I started realizing\nHow be converted that pointer finger of the five to me became the most valuable because if we don't make the necessary changes we're never going to accomplish that kind of outlier goal\nThat were after that one of the things we can do there is to help a few people get started with this as we still got a few tickets we can give away let's change some lives right now we've got a half day class coming up in your area\nThat half the class of ... exactly where it takes to really take control of the finances really taken truly a retirement account generate more\nIncoming side of the market's really live that life that drafter and just a second you're gonna have a chance to win a set of pass as one of these half day classes to get your bones writing if you are driving now is a good time to pulled over\nIncluded with your passes is going to be our professional insiders kit now this professional insider kit makes it so you can get started right now ... century twenty when he did a call now and reserve those seats\nThe number is eight eight eight six to eight seven to three that said it eight six one to eight seven to three if you end up being colors nine or Twenty one sorry about that hit us up at Houston O T H ... come see if you can score some passes there\nNow Larry one of the things that I always like to say and I said it earlier on the show is doesn't matter if you have two dollars or two million dollars it's all about getting that money working for you and really getting it to generate that income so you can live the lifestyle you can reach the\nFinancial freedom goal that you're after ... what are some of the things are what are some of the other kind of examples I Know you have your bags and bags low the view of these examples of our students that you've talked to that we're in one place that are now in another well\nThe first thing we always understand here is that with trading it's simply a transfer money from people who don't know what they're doing to people who do know what they're doing and what's really sad as people will get themselves stuck think about just time right now\nPeople can sit in front of a television for hours versus going out there and learning a skill that can help them and every year and you're we're coming up to the holiday season again we can start seeing all these Jim commercials again right cause here comes resolution time and one of the things I hear our students say over and over again is beside wishing having had more time was\nThis was the year I Want to get out of debt and I want to turn my finances around and what's amazing is how many students\nCome in through the classes that we're doing right now and simply imagine what their life would be like if they can learn a skill to help them generate more money\nAnd that's the key it's about doing something taking action and getting out there to change your current situation again if you're ... and something that you are really interested in learning how to do there's no limitations here in fact one of my students June\nShe actually came to my class and she said all she wanted to do is play golf and coaster Rica and so she started realizing that by learning how to trade gave her the time to do that I said it's great to send me a postcard and she did and she said she was trading 'cause that's a whole nother piece of it\nPeople go on vacation Ryan right and they get raid the

in commando with Arnold Schwarzenegger anyway\nShe's made that decision and the left or media the legacy media in this country listening to what she has to say and it's like now giving her grades if he hears the odds then\nAnd the whole thing is odd but what was the models involved at all but here's the really odd thing\nWhen you turn on a television network whether it be CNN MSNBC or Fox News or were you see me during the week on Newsmax when you turn it on\nAnd\nSomebody has presented as an expert on something\nLike I'll have an author on are all have a geologist on are all have a\nAn actor on it and I'll say this is an actor you might remember from this this is a geologist who's an expert on this topic that we're talking about this is somebody who is a senator former senator um the IRS the president's son you'll normally present the person and say here's why you want to hear from this person\nOn some of the networks will say that the person who's a contributor well that means is the person who's getting paid for your parents or an analyst\nGenerally speaking you ever go to do\nBut they keep on presenting it wasn't a lotto and they never see why we're supposed to listen to her and address illicit mulatto says really equal rights amendment and then they do a whole story on at USA Today\nI'm I'm confused why are we doing a story and a list of a lotto I don't get it I'm confused but not as confused ...\nIt is for some reason she thinks if there's an equal rights amendment which is unnecessary because we have guaranteed equal rights and equal opportunity in this country for some reason she thinks that we had an equal rights amendment then\nChristie lousy forward would have stopped the Kavanaugh nomination an appointment\nAnd she's never really said why\nAnd again I don't really care why ... why she is not an expert\n\nI talked about this while I'm Talking about this for a while now but we just we sometimes see our top athletes that people that we really like or actors or actresses people that we see you on the tube or or on the big screen for a long time\nAnd we set ourselves well we were you for some reason project intelligence on them\nAlyssa Milano is not intelligent\nShe's somebody who clearly was easily indoctrinated and she has no idea what\nShe's talking about none she has no clue she has yet to make a point that makes sense yet the the\nLegacy media keeps putting her up on high because a she's attractive and be they think\nThat she has some political sway that will help to get their viewers in general Americans I guess where the dumb people out there like a like me\nTo buy into this far left wing garbage listen to the lotto actually doesn't help at all not ... doesn't know better side they think she does but she doesn't win the lotto actually does is she hurts the cause\n\nMe she actually makes intelligent people arguing may say well I'm definitely not going to vote that way\nLookout dumb vis the thing is that she's saying or liquor taking selfies or taking videos while sitting in a very serious hearing or look at her blindly saying you must believe every woman 'cause every woman who's telling the truth well we've got documented case after case after case where sadly women have lied\nThey don't misunderstand me I'm actually this from the beginning you should take every allegation of sexual misconduct seriously but you should not just simply because it said believe it you should believe in once it's proven\nBut there you go you turn on the job or you're you're ... you know some of these current events websites there's Alyssa mulatto and they never ever ever never say why we should believer you should believe all as the lotto because\nFill in the blank just doesn't happen oh another trend big thing that's happening today which\nWill boggle your mind is Robert ... robbery rubbery we of course the Confederate general who lost and had to surrender to to US Grant\n\nAllegedly if you believe NBC News of the Washington Post President Trump last night went to Ohio and praised Robert ... period and the story\nAnd of course that's the only period understory your legacy media but large to your viewers and your readers and and those who follow you on social media of course the president did praise Robert de leite on his lead up to talking about how Ohio in Ulysses Grant kicked his ass\nHe talked about what a great general Lee was and how great still kicked his ass\nNow the media knows that but they also know you don't know that you don't have the\nPresident said it that way so if they say the president praised will Ulysses S grade are they telling the truth or praised Robert ... are they telling the truth yes\nBut it's also a sin of omission or reliable mission\nThey didn't tell the whole truth\nCan I say I've got to a section of that and make it sound like the president went to Ohio and praise Robert de leave and left and waved to the crowd ... it's the best thing ever going to go to my my plane they'll go back to Washington yeah I guess you could say that if you're a liar [noise]\nA better thing to say it might be what he really said\nUlysses Grant was so freaking good vetting

we're all in all the button to try to figure out how to say that\nIt worked out because you press the button you took my first time in ... her but you know say that's her that's out there you got a hold of me because you are seeing what was unfolding or in in Washington DC I still to this day sir I have no idea how Lisa Murkowski ... became a senator\nOr as a write in relief so that's the starting point for me and then she says as a Republican IQ support Brett Kavanaugh and the reason she said she couldn't support him was that he's not the right guy at the right time\nDo the people of Alaska except that excuse\nNow and go back even further\nWrite in campaign out after he lost the primary up here remember what's her Senator Frank were kept you after having served twenty two years in the U.S and he gave his daughter the job\nWhen he was elected governor up here right there on ... and I ran against him into heated him read that at least got and that's how we stayed in a sense we could man once you're in and you have a special interest from around the country right up funding you you know you have to it\nIt's tough to hold them accountable and say okay enough is enough time to go but no I'm irrational reasoning that she provided regarding that that\nThat vote again cabinet because as you point out she daddy good man it's not about qualifications and I'm like wait you know of course it is and whether either good manners yet um\nSo no it didn't make sense and then her speech on the Senate floor which is kind of talking in circles are very very very disappointed because Joe as you suggested as an outright set on friday\nThe things that she's putting in jeopardy not just for the state of Alaska but for this country I mean it come down to the Supreme\nHaving so much with in its graph having to do with our solvency our sovereignty and she was willing to play some games with that\nWell she was willing to play games and the point that I made that I really appreciate that you know you are you why was it up in our circuit court of appeals at all over the ... of course the\nFormer vice presidential nominee for the Republican Party back in two thousand eight and of course the former governor of Alaska and just a great all wrong person or you know this but I wasn't a vote for John McCain is going to write of my mother's name\nUntil you got on the ticket and then I voted for you\nShow and I think a lot of people actually did that the point I made friday was Lisa Murkowski and people like her were actually putting in the hands of the most liberal court in the United states\nThe Ninth Circuit court of appeals the the um\nThe more issues of Alaska and everybody in the west coast in other words if the Supreme Court has eight members and it's tied for the foreign almost everyone would be for the for now it goes back to the previous court in the Ninth Circuit court of appeals will decide the first amendment Second Amendment Fourth Amendment Fifth Amendment Pence Amendment for Alaska what does that make you think\nThat's exactly right and Joe I was impressed because nobody else was talking about that share what her\nAction was was essentially bolstering the nights circuits had she had her her way and that's the Ninth Circuit out of\nSan Francisco right you know talking about injustice and\nJustice being delayed for Alaskans because that court sixty million people they are to quote unquote served it's the largest by far\nThe second largest as the eleventh and they are only thirty thirty five million right so there is such a backlog of cases and not even talking about the ideology behind that very very partisan very liberal Korea is just the practical reasons why we don't want to give them any more power anymore say over Alaska\nSo

saying ammo the St modus operandi as we just saw a bunch of indoctrinated idiots scratching and clawing or on the ... of the Supreme Court so you're saying this is what they've done for the ages for generations now\nAbsolutely but this is what happens when you make a deal with the devil when when the left decided\nThat the ends that they're ... getting power justifies the means this is what you end up doing you will destroy innocent man you will try and you'll use every dirty\nTrick in the book because as far as that can said it doesn't matter what I Do to another human being because I have to have the power and that's why it was so important I I couldn't put this in my book you know why we fight because it happened off they came out but when the president stood out\nIn the White House two days ago in front of the world\nAnd pulled out the Democrats for the evil things they did the justice Kavanaugh and thin pronounced him innocent that was a historic moment because just as what chambers within it said Seventy years ago so is justice cabin or a man who the Democrats tried to destroy\nThe name of the book is why we fight defeating America's enemies with no apologies going get

the left\nThat that you so well said and actually talk to my my friend did do denounced as soon as about this as well he goes back even further even before World War one and World War two where this sort of fascism has been known to be on the left we just have pretended through history that didn't happen that way but but let me let me ask you about why we're so successful and I have an idea as to why\nBut but I'll ask you more more specifically\nWas it so successful because the right always cow town gave in and again you just have outlined it incredibly this president said I'm not giving in this justice cabinet decided I'm not going to give it I'm not going to allow them to do this to me but is that why it's lasted for probably the better part of a century because the right always gives in and\nPull the nominee or or bend over backwards for the left\nI'll tell you what I saw when I was in the White House so I I I had very quickly I developed the reputation the White House a lot of people especially the press department said I I'm ... and the strange one why because I refused I just refuse flat out from day one\nTo talk to the the fake news I I didn't care whether it was what's

out also\nThe blaze radio network who's the weekend with Joe ... you're always glad to catch up with my former governor the go former governor of the great state of Texas Rick Perry he's the energy secretary for the United states of America no and you might wonder well what does that person do\nA lot clearly and a lot of travel is well we talked to about ... we're talking about liquefied natural gas would go to an war as well uh ... appreciate you how are you\nJoe I'm good thank you very much where I'm up in Washington DC for a few days here so you know Texas but it's a it's what are called temporary duty\nAnd you're fighting the fight very well it's interesting as you know I'm connected with several people on your staff and I can see their travel on\nFacebook and on Twitter and so on you or your or a global Trotter now is it did you know that was going to be part of a job to be over in Africa there'd be over in Europe and be over in Asia and then back home base it on your back over Indonesia we did you know that that was gonna tell all of us\nAre not necessarily but what's happened is is the energy revolution runs off that occurred in the United states\nIt makes sense in hindsight it would be in all those markets because it's you know we are now selling American a liquefied natural gas into thirty different countries on five caught in the next grade and uh there there's more to be done so I'm being there\nUh I I consider one of my jobs of it obviously being a regulator making sure that we're\nA you know were regulated at the permit process is smoother than as\nA as as transparent as it can be but it's also to be the you know a salesman for American energy whether it's a a liquefied natural gas for the rich are crude whether it's our fossil fuels whether its nuclear energy whether it's a A R renewable technologies all of that is desired around the world\nAnd the secretary of energy that ought to be their job\nIs the United states secretary of energy Rick Perry so I'm watching the the the terror of talk of the trade talk and the leverage that are that the president has ... and he's putting it on the ... you and everybody in the left in this country ... they're all complaining ... putting terms is going to ruin trade and in no time flat\nBiggie you stepped up and said we're making a deal we don't want the terrorists we want to have fair trade that in a big part of the deal was liquefied natural gas\nNow are you are you consulted as the president's doing that as you like Rick can we do this Ellen gee thing can we make this happen can we make a part of the bill how does that go down\nYeah he he obviously talks um you know [noise] extensively with his cabinet or the as the secretary of treasury\nMy notion and secretary of commerce Wilbur Ross day all have a role to play in that and and so absolutely there's a there's a good a correspondent back and forth a\nAnd a ... everybody's on the same team and I want to get back to\nYou know this is what people should expect I mean I Know the left doesn't like him for a lot of reasons that I you know ... and that is what it is right uh but they're not being realistic they're just they're just they don't like him because he's not Hillary\n[laughter] that's true but\nIt's true and and and the point is that what you would expect to see out of a a negotiator a person who goes and what they really hard line I mean he he plans on winning I mean his his theory here is that listen if I trade you and you agree to it you know that's your fault\nAnd uh and and that's exactly what he's doing with these trade deals where he comes with some really hard stuff I mean you think about with you and then a young kid and came back in here or after they laid out some really tough or a sanction or not sanctions but tariffs and retro\nA trade deals with the Europeans and they said you know what we decided we want to buy your allergy and let's let's find a way so to the Chinese ... again you know ... heads blew up when they announced the terrorists originally with China and then the Chinese came back a few days later\nThe Chinese know that they will lose a\nThey know that we will lose a a trade war or or the Chinese or they'll lose a trade war with us so if\nI were the biggest customer they don't want to screw with us that would be dumb [laughter]\nSo we just want you to be fair we want you to be an equitable we want you to be transparent oh and we don't want your stealing our IP either our international uh our our intellectual property\nRights of any good neighbor yeah that that's another big part of it it's a energy secretary Rick Perry you're in the state of Texas so efficiently and our economy here still booming under the great guidance of a great job it now when you get into a position where you know there's so much bureaucratic red tape and there's so much garbage that you've got to go through before\nYou can actually get to the source of the issue when you finally got to see what these trade deals worth especially energy wise with these other countries were you surprised at how uh how completely out of balance they were we got very little they get everything it was very strange yeah\nIt it was really pretty fascinating and\nHere's the other side of it is these things were outdated do you think about the north American free trade agreement that was put in place I think in Ninety two is rented was side\nThat was twenty five years ago and and think about we're America was twenty five years ago from an energy standpoint I mean completely a hundred and eighty degree\nOr we were dependent on a lot of countries that didn't necessarily have our interest in mind who are still a developing a the energy sources that we were buying and now\nI'm you know Mexico and and and and Canada both very different positions than we were twenty five years ago so it makes a button that good sense that the president will say you know what it's time to renegotiate this thing\nAnd we got an email now the uh uh I think it's a ah what do we call it the uh uh", "year": "2018", "show_name": "The Joe Pags Show", "city": "Houston", "day": "14"}
