H. Houston and I are the radio station announced\nIt is asked throws up by two games I'm Sally Adam seven o'clock on news radio seven forty Katie R. H. trafficking whether to gather Here's Michael Scott Overall not\nWell on days like that like back in February you know Goldman Sachs had the two hundred million dollar day on a down day just like that right so one of the things I Love that I was just getting started off onto with with my point is I Love being a part of these happy classes and being able to really introduce people to how to make money as the markets go down\nSo they don't have to fear the bear right you don't have to be afraid of embarrassed market bears markets just like polish markets\nAre great opportunities to make money and even even sometimes greater opportunities to make money because uh which uh which speed the market goes down\nIt's that whole fear and greed ... principal the up markets are driven by greed the down markets are driven by fear and you know I I remember asking a class once you know which which which motion was more powerful fear agreed\nAnd I had some say I I I think it's greed and we chatted about it because most of the class thought it was fear and one of the points that I came to was if it was greed everybody would do everything in their power nothing nothing would ever standing anybody's way of making money but it ends up being fear 'cause the fear of the unknown the fear of trying something new\nConsistently stands in the way of people's people's ability to make more money and it gets back to your point of that is why most people go out and they just get another job rather than generating another stream of income like passively are actively via the markets because that's a safe zone they already have a job to get another job well it's not\nMost appealing thing it's a little more safer for our psyche and so those are some of the things we help our students overcome a so I Love that you went down the shortest path there because that is a great way to make money as the markets are going down and one of the things that we could do to help get a few people get started\nReally being able to see the opportunity and embarrassed market is we've got a big stack of tickets here that we are going to give away today what do you say we pull a couple of these out and we give them with some more listeners get some people educated\nAll right well right now we've got to have to class coming up in your area\nAnd at the half the class and really it online training academy ... we focus on generating income as the marks going up in the markets are going down but the half day classes where you really get to see exactly what it takes to be able to do that\nNow the half the class there about three hours long your investment is going to be three hours of your time to come in and raise that financial like you to help you get better returns in the market in just a second you're gonna have a chance to win a set of passes the one of these half day classes to get your phone's reading if you're driving now is a great time to pull over\nIncluded with your passes it's gonna be a professional insiders kit now this kid is packed with lessons from some of our top instructors lessons on topics like enhancing your retirement strategy how to make money when the market goes down income generation capital preservation crypto currency is much much more the professional inside of it makes it so you can get started right now\nI was ... when he did a call now and reserve those seats the number is eight eight six one to eight seven to three that's eight eight eight six to eight seven to three if you end up being colors nine or Twenty one sorry about that hit us up a Houston O T H ... see if you can scores and passes there\nLarry's we start to kind of continued on this path of making money in multiple directions we've got the up market we've got the down market you know what are some of the hurdles people have to overcome we touched on a few minutes ago as far as the Bush biased that we already have is being consumers\nMaybe maybe you could take that into it into a ... expand on that ... for our listeners and even even anything else that you work with or that you deal with when you're working with new students whether they have twenty years' experience or their brand new to the markets on how they really construction things to make sure they're poised to profit as the markets are coming down\nGreat question right on the number one mistake that most people make when it comes to trading are investing is they try to do it on their own\nThey don't get themselves educated said no it's okay I'll do it on my own and eventually they'll get around and some education the problem is the very costly less and why would you want to spend all that time energy and money when you can learn a system in what I Love about the term system Ryan it's saving yourself stress time energy and money\nAnd so we teach our students is to try to get like banks do back in February last year Goldman Sachs had a ridiculously large winning day was ... million dollars in one day simply by shortening the markets and so I Want to use this analogy hurt me use it before it's like driving a car\nIf anyone said to you well you can go anywhere you want to go in this world right now but the court can only go in drive you can never put it in reverse\nIt'd be a pretty frustrating Dr number one you're educated enough to know that the car goes both directions well most people don't realize so did the markets you can trade when the markets are going up you can trade when the markets are going down and what most people have learned\nBy coming to the academy ... coming educated and not trying to do it on their own is that there's a simple step by step process the system regardless of how old you are your background your education level if you're somebody who's co troubles somebody's committed you can make money trading the markets like the banks do\nYeah and when you look at how we learn how to do anything it's really how we learn how to trade and invest as well it doesn't change just because we're in the investing world and and the thing that the thing I was stressed inside of my classes is that we focus on the skill and that was one of the things that my\nMy mentors really pushed on me about Fifteen sixteen years ago was focused on the skill and the money will come the the the issue ends up being is it's a natural tendency for us to stare at the money right out of the gate and we want to make I got to me\nI Want to make a hundred dollars a day we got to do that starting right now right rather than building the skills you have the skill you can generate the money but you have to have the skill first so many times we tried to put the cart in front of the horse there and that's where the appropriate type of mentoring and\nTeaching and different things like that can can can really help you know too many times we we approached the markets and and and when I talk to people is very normal that did they say\nI say I I lost a question are you looking for a get rich quick program you know and and everyone always says oh no no no I'm I'm not looking at looking for that and I say well good 'cause that's not what the financial markets are this is where you really have to develop the skill to be able to go in and generate income but once you have the skill\nYou can generate the income scale has to come first and it's the the patience of developing the skill that really determines in my opinion whether or not somebody as successful or not it's just like I I compared to flying an airplane I mean how comfortable would you be if you sat down a inside of a seven forty seven and you're about to fly from LA to New York\nAnd over the intercom you heard the pilots say well good afternoon ladies and gentlemen I just finished my Youtube video on drag versus lift we are ready to take off\nRight at that that's not going to get you there you have plenty of knowledge on\nOn how flight actually works the mechanics behind it but as far as the skill to fly and navigate that plane across the country that's a\nThat's a whole different conversation and we would never get on that plane because that's the life or death situation but unfortunately we do that with our money all the time we did that with a lot of things all the time and and when we're dealing with our money is a financial life or death situation that we could be putting ourselves\nAbsolutely uh let's face it we've been doing this for over Twenty one years right now we've had over half a million students have come through the academy to learn how to trade the right way the way that the banks make money at the end of the day what you're really hoping to do is find freedom you want to be able to\nFind a way to generate income ... spend more time with your family some people want to move on to do a different type of job may be one of volunteer locally in your community the thing that we want to do most\nIs get back the time that we don't want to lose and so a lot of our students have been very grateful to come in to spend a little time with us and learn how they not only can generate more income but also save themselves more time\nYeah absolutely we're coming up next to a break when you say we squeeze in another give away let's do it All right well we've got our half day class coming up and your investment in there it's going to be three hours of your time's three hours of your time to come out and see exactly what it takes to generate more consistent income in the markets whether it's going up down or sideways\nAnd

H. dot com [noise]\nThis is how retraining radio now back to the show\nIf you're just tuning in us Larry Jacobs director of instructor development and half instructor it online training me really shed some light on income we've we've talked a lot about multiple streams of income we talked about different types of income\nPassive income active in a little while ago we did a whole a whole series on passing versus versus active income\nAnd and it's so much fun to talk about income everybody needs more income whether it's whether it's for income for today or whether it's income for tomorrow in a net income for tomorrow is what we want to spend a little bit of time on in this segment talking to a little bit about the retirement accounts\nAnd so one of the things that may be missed out on that last segment as far as talking about more ... more generating more income well don't worry we're going to be doing it in this segment but really focusing on that retirement side of the the income equation\nWhether you're tuning in for the first time maybe you've been with us for the whole show don't worry get excited the best is yet to come and Larry sometimes I'll be talking with a lot of our listeners and and that happens a lot of social media we got the Twitter we've got the Facebook\nRe we've got all these different avenues where they can reach out they can ask questions we have different the different ... in our series and stuff like that but one of the things that we hear a lot there's two things really that we hear a lot\nNumber one we're hearing from people saying that they don't have enough money to retire even with the markets at all time high is right now\nThey don't have enough money to retire and those that do have enough money to retire are consistently saying they're not quite sure what to do with their money so maybe if you could address a few of those topics because I'm sure we got a lot of listeners in one or two of those ditch one or both of those situations listening to us right now\nLet's talk about urgency because right now historically statistically the markets and to correct about every ten years or so so here we are ten years later like I mentioned earlier on the show we're seeing the Federal Reserve continuing to raise interest rates were seeing the housing markets starting to reverse so what does this mean for you\nWho are listening right now with the first time you've got to do is go back to how this all started if you have a four one K. where you're only able to train a mutual funds the biggest concern you should have right now is the fact that prior to\nTwo thousand we came into the mutual fund world in Nineteen nineties where it was a roaring bull market well the first time we experienced any pain was back in two thousand so what makes this different than most is if you have a pension where your boss is set aside money for you\nThose monies were protected because it was coming out of our their payroll are coming out of profits and it was put aside the separate account and it wasn't subjected to what was happening in the markets will everything in your four O. one K. is not protected in fact if you think about a congressional people and senators they don't have for one case they have\nPensions intentionally because they want to make sure that they have this money available through our taxes well right now you should be thinking about and especially if you're putting money in every two weeks into your Ira we're four one K. you're investing at all time highs\nAs you might have mentioned I don't remember but let's just worth repeating that the market falls three times faster than it goes up so right now if you've been investing the majority of your money in the last couple of years at all time highs right now than it is a lot more room for this money to fall you should be concerned\nBecause we saw what happened back in two thousand eight it was a four O. one K. the became a two oh one K.\nAnd again it took about six years to recover\nWell this is much higher than we've ever seen before in fact if I look at the Buffett index speaking of course of Warren Buffett right now it's higher and more extended\nThe we ever seen that index have been in the past and they simply means that if we have a correction and things continue what's to say this four one K. won't become a one oh one K. and do you have the time right now to be able to put off your retirement and still work\nWhen you thought you were going to be able to finally retirement and start living your life\nYeah and the the the the the way to make money in the market hasn't changed over a thousand years we're talking about it earlier when you brought up shorting and making money as the markets are going down it's always been by low so high and it will always be by low so high most of what's the probability of buying an all time highs as being you buy low opera opportunity\nRight can markets go higher than they absolutely can we're taking on a lot of risk in those situations there's ... there's constant pull back there's constant wholesale offerings ...\nEven as the marks or going higher and over paying for things is is really what limits are potential upside and ... opens up the downside for ah\nFor for risk you know we we talk a lot about the the the bullish biased and how as consumers we just usually sit there and buy everything we Bye bye Bye bye bye And right now the markets are going higher and higher and every payday the average person buys more stocks they buy stocks through their mutual funds to their four one case\nAbout through there are a speed through their IRAs doesn't matter what account type it is that's ... that's the general practice kind of around the world is on payday we just buy stocks\nWell it doesn't matter what the prices though just matters that it's payday and so we're going to invest into it now is the markets are collapsing our financial advisors have a brilliant way of of of talking to us about why it's okay to continue to buy as the markets are going down\nRight a ... dollar cost averaging as the markets are going down they say by more by more by more as it's going down and then when it comes back you're going to be rich and while that math actually makes a whole lot of sense the problem ends up being\nIs we don't stop buying when it's on its way up if all we did was by on its way down dollar cost averaging will be very powerful strategy\nBut when you're averaging your price back up buying it these all time highs offsets all the money that was invested in that four one K. back in two thousand nine and we're taking the\nAverage price up with us which which raises are risk exposure and lowers are profitability and in the end it's for one reason in my opinion my humble opinion and it's because Wall Street's businesses to sell us products and that's OK right we just have to know that\nA Wal Mart's businesses to sell us products too and that's how they make money and I don't think they're evil right and they'll think Wall Street's evil but as the customer not client noticed I use the word customer as the customer we have to understand\nThat what we're what we're doing when we're when we're engaging with somebody when I go to Walmart I realize that I'm not planning on making money I'm just buying something from them and if that's the same thing that that's happening with us with Wall Street we've got to kind of take that into consideration with the\nWith the kind of analysis that we're doing on the situation are we planning on making money on this transaction if the answer is yes\nAnd the timeframe that won't piss somebody else off and do you do that all the time right is the idea that you can be making money anywhere you go and we have a student her name was Hayley she's younger she didn't want to want to work a desk job anymore she had recently gone through a divorce\nAnd what she decided to do is she wanted to pursue trading currencies and she realized that being in Europe was the center of the currency universe\nShe moved herself to Barcelona, Spain and she knew that she was young enough it had time to do whatever she wanted to do\nA lot of our older students are really starting to reassess what's going on in their lives right now and they realize they got to keep up with the cost of living right things keep getting more and more expensive every year but imagine that you go in the markets for a couple of hours a day\nCommit to maybe one hour a day to practice\nTo get the skilled down and then you could start generating money that you can pass on to future generations your kids grandkids anybody you want to help in the future\nYeah and I think the key to this too is it's not about creating a fulltime job it's about creating a full time life\nYou know we talk a lot about financial freedom and that's that's really what it boils down to is being able to move to Spain if you want to move to Spain you know for for a while I spent my my winters in the Caribbean and\nI was living in Boston at the time and and I had somebody actually come up to me and say why do you go [laughter] I chuckle Everytime I think about it he killed me and he said why do you why do you leave Boston and go to a Puerto Rico and the winter time and I looked at him and said have you ever spent a winter here in Boston and he was like\nWell yeah and I'm like that's why when it gets really pretty cold here in the wintertime and I'm running from it\nAnd that's one of the things that that the markets allow you to do is it doesn't matter where you it doesn't matter where you go as long as you have an Internet connection and we've joked about it\nA few times where he where back when I used to do that I wanted to go back and forth as I was down in Puerto Rico and I'd have that big a tea in the air card hanging out of the side of my laptop that it was almost the same size as my laptop\nAnd even my satellite radio down there like it only worked for like ... it only worked for eight am like noon 'cause that's when the satellite was over me and so it was it was hilarious but where we are\nFrom a technology standpoint is is is light years beyond where we were you know twelve years ago Fifteen Years ago when when I was just getting started and this\nAnd it's kind of a fun it's been a fun evolution to see but for everybody who is just getting started right now it's like it's like you have no idea how good you have it I feel like when I talked to a new traders I'm like my grandfather and I'm like oh and I went to school I had to walk uphill both ways and the snow you know we had dial up Internet and now it's just in the palm of your hand\nBut we have so much access to our money that really going in and just getting a little bit of skill and getting a little bit of a little bit of knowledge can really go a long way we don't have to call up a broker and say hey you know what about this what about that it's just right at the ... of our hand\nIdentify the price and we want to pay set the order and then wait for priced really come down to you it it ends up being that kind of classic negotiating tactic\nYou say you know and my grandfather taught me this when I was like five years old I remember going with him and he was buying my grandma new car and he said watch this he says I'm going to tell them the prize I'm going to pay and and as soon as he says no we're going to get up and walk away and that's really how you approach the markets you say you know what I Want to buy this these these shares a stock but I Want to buy 'em at this price and if I Am for this price\nThat's okay there's lots of other stocks that I can go buy it a great price and you have to have that mentality and that is the mentality of the professional\nOne of the things that can help you operate like a professional though is confidence\nConfidence can come from education confidence can come from building skill a great place to start that is at the half day class we've got a few tickets left before the show is over and we're going to give some away as long as Larry says okay I think it's okay alright right now I've got to have to class coming up in your area that have take classes where you're going to see exactly what it takes\nTo really live the life you want to live life on your own terms have that financial freedom but a lot of that just boils down to having the income to create that freedom\nNow just a second you're gonna have a chance to win a set of pass as one of these half day classes

some of the other kind of examples you could share with our audience out there as far as times where where people have come in and they've they've got the ball rolling they've taken that initial first step and how it's gotten him to that point a financial freedom let's consistency\nRyan most people come in they make that commitment it's really pretty simple you know you have to be willing to commit ... coach ... beat a point in your life when you're really wanted to make a change if you're somebody who's just kind of going from one thing to the next to the next year really never going to achieve what you want to do it's all about stepping back\nAsking yourself a simple question how's that life working for you if you're not happy right now then you have to get yourself out of your comfort zone start thinking there are better ways to do things but more importantly learn from people who already doing what you want to do I've heard my whole life\nYou know growing up at school that copying someone was bad well that's completely false you want to copy somebody who's doing what you want to do and who are successful so you need to be able to have mentors you need to be able to have coaches you need to be able to be somebody who really is willing to make a change\nBecause people don't change in fact I'm Stein once said the definition of insanity is doing the same thing over and over again and expecting a different outcome\nThis is how most people live their lives they'd rather just continue to be miserable not do anything different when there's a whole opportunity right in front of them to go out there and she said giving up a couple of hours of your life where you can be watching TV or doing something else it's more important to invest in yourself to invest in some TV show out there\nYeah and I remember seeing a as you were saying copying somebody being the the way you learn it it really is I I remember being in a in a class um you know ten Fifteen Years ago and I remember the instructor actually saying\nYou know if you want to be wealthy wealthy people do if you if you see somebody who is in the situation that you want to be in and if you follow them around all day long and you do the exact same things that they do eventually you will be in that same spot\nOr any brought up the the the the inverse side of that too and he said\nIf you follow somebody around who is making terrible kind of financial decision somebody who maybe is a homeless person who's kind of lost everything and you do exactly what they do you know that's the same thing if you're copying that process you're going to end up in that situation at the same thing in the financial markets and it's one of the reasons why we teach\nOur students how they could identify what the financial institutions during what are the professionals doing what are the best people in the world\nDoing inside of these financial markets how can you identify that\nSo that you can go in and just

what he was doing every weekend and every weekday basically in Nineteen eighty two or whatever it was\nSo as much as she might have been believable that something happened to her and I hope she gets built the knees and help the person who did it is brought to justice but it was not credible her allegations against this guy specifically\nAnd that to a point ability Asia and that the the legacy media didn't want to have\nLegacy media didn't want to say well she's credible as somebody who probably had something happened to her but it is not credible what she's saying about Brett Kavanaugh the legacy media didn't do its job and didn't report that correctly the second accusation which I'm a woman named Deborah Ramirez\nWho says that at a party\nThey were playing some game\nThat I don't know who to spin the bottle or it was ... quarters you they were playing something to where if you lost you had a drink and they were purposely making her drink and got her so drunk you're going to remember anything and then she's told Brett Kavanaugh put her but his member are pulled pulled it out\nAnd put it in near her face\nNow she admittedly doesn't remember it and when Democrats staffers from the Democrats senators that are on the panel calls are contacted her she spent six days calling old friends asking headed\nSomething happened to me you remember anything happened to me and nobody remembers anything but\nSix day she decided yeah I I guess he did happen I wasn't I wasn't sure but yeah I I Am now he did it I don't remember him doing it but I remember people telling me that\n\nSo which Kavanaugh said no there was anything like that what are you talking about\nThe third one is from slime ball lawyer I have an oddity is Julie sweat Nick who says that for three years Brett Kavanaugh and mark judge worthy organizers of parties where there would be trains are boys are taking in gang rape\nCabinet and judge she said which bike the punch with grain alcohol\nIncludes\nShe knew this was going on but she was smart enough to not drink the punch then one day and this happened between Nineteen eighty one night than eighty three she said but one day a one party she wants ten of them in Nineteen eighty two she somehow was the victim and was gang raped\nWill continue to go into the parties for another full year\nAnd instead of calling the police which she said was just don't drink the punch\nShe changed her story to NBC News at least once NBC\nNews instead of saying we can't run this because she's not viable not credible not believable they rented any way and then she said it's important to note that the stories you say today is different or there are differences from the story she originally told us her story is changed a bunch of times in her history comes out especially somebody that makes you got about allegations all the time\nSo completely not credible but\nThat didn't matter to grow because Booker that didn't matter to lady that didn't matter to Feinstein that didn't matter to Coons they didn't didn't matter to Kamala Harris it didn't matter to any of these people\nHe was he's guilty Cory Booker ... recalls all Spartacus but he's admitted Grover when he was Fifteen he groped a girl he admits that he's a senator somehow he actually said at this point it doesn't matter if he's guilty or innocent\nCory Booker said that and he meant it\nIt doesn't matter if judge Kavanaugh is guilty or innocent at this point well that I Believe galvanized us as a people we said that's not fair due process of this in this country is guaranteed you are innocent until proven guilty and if that's the threshold than it is\nThen he's innocent nothing any of these women has said or the the the slimy lawyer has said or the far left wing resist lawyer cats who's a lawyer for Ford nothing they've said\nHas proven anything\nAll you have is Deborah bureaus completely uncorroborated in fact refuted by people Julie sweat Nick just seems to be a nun ... from outer space story she's given\nAnd received Ford\nOnly vase say something happened everybody else named and the FBI spent five days six days interviewing many more people who didn't come to the bushes offer evidence that there is no corroboration there is nothing more here\n\nYet the left is still today going Twitter read your favorite website they still today have these paid protesters showing up in the Senate halls\nThere ... people which means are putting out their information their their phone numbers their addresses\nIt say a violent crew of idiots better still just completely disconnected from the rest of us Melissa mulatto is your spokesperson Amy Schumer is your spokes person\nAnd their argument against Kavanaugh they're still attempting they're still attempting these days are rapists serial rapists at about a rapist on the court it's it's a disgusting this way\nThey are trying their best to change the best although flawed system judicial system on earth to to be in Saudi Arabia or something or China\nCome on man\nSo Brett Kavanaugh and again as I Do the show it's not happened yet but I assume that he will be confirmed later today there are a couple of things that could happen\nBetween now and then and and yes we've got to talk about Lisa Murkowski who is a an alleged Republican from Alaska who is going to vote against Brett Kavanaugh today\nAnd she the reason she gave was he's a good man just not the right guy for the job right now what what\nCome home and so I Need your thoughts on this\nI I'm guaranteeing that you would have never been this engaged in a

cutesy trolls just you know saying hateful things to be so again at Joe talk show a lot of people want to be heard um this confirmation process has been disgusting\nIt really has been enrolled at all really started with Diane Feinstein sitting on this letter that she had for two months you realize you're dying Feinstein the ranking member of the ... member bunch then you realize that she had this letter\nEven when she was talking to Brett Kavanaugh privately in her office didn't say a word\nHad a letter when she was questioning Brett Kavanaugh\nIn the open to hearing didn't say a word when it looked as though Brett Kavanaugh was going to be fast track because he's easily qualified for this job then suddenly somebody in her office or some lawyers somebody leaked to the fact that there was a letter and what's the woman's name was\nSo no matter what you think of Christie loves before she was a victim year two of the left politics\nEight hundred five zero one Seventy eighty let me go to the phone lines to see where you are on this 'cause we're either a country divided or it could work country galvanized I think this was just\nAn absolute practice\nIn futility for the left and I think that it probably served to motivate those on the right I think you'll see a lot more conservatives and Republicans do\nGo to any centrist that lean right go to the polls for the midterm whereas they might have set set at home before I think the Republicans will gain two or three seats in the Senate and we'll keep control of that body a it's still gonna be very close in the house but I think they have a better chance now because now the bases riled up\nThis was a really bad miscalculation by the left to this country the political ... let me go on the phone lines and say hello to uh Roger who's in Spokane Roger what's going on high\nIn the morning you know hey I think clay clay is appropriate name thank you and you\nWere in favor of that and I'm really disappointed in theory you know that they cannot stronger during the early process\nThat even more upset with the Democrats and the ... and ... not a and get your act together and that he truly representative and not\nGetting the crap and and get very disappointed in the whole process that happened to be elected and ex green card\nOr Roger I think it's a very good point the Republicans were very weak in the beginning venture for the call by the way I'm very weak in the beginning they just they wanted to keep decorum they wanted to keep it all up and up and I and I can appreciate that but when the hearing started let's go back to that a month ago\nAs soon as grassy started speaking Kamala Harris interrupted him rudely do all this fake outrage about how Kavanaugh interrupted Feinstein and some others because he was fighting for his political and personal life and for his family Kamala Harris purposely interrupted him\nYeah Cory Booker purposely interrupted him\nI think clover started\nThere were ... ... it was it was set up that you had protesters that there are some pictures out there that suggests they were getting paid to go to the chamber of protest so all this fake outrage about Brett Kavanaugh on it and his ... and his temperament is that it's all be yes\nBut I agree with you the Republicans a grassy I think that in the end they did it the right way but as that was going on hey wait a second elections have consequences we won were in charge of this can be I Will clear this room would be given interrupting then it would ... would proper protocol is\nBut they were breaking it on purpose because they really\nThought they're putting on a show which somehow window for them he turned out it made them look like idiots will be it used to that they are Clyde in Lexington, Kentucky iCloud what's going on\nIn your bag thank you very much for taking my call really you've got a I think the Democrats are definitely oh now they're they're getting worse every month they are just getting worse and worse and they try to take that man down they get it\nVery frustrating or the other thing is I Can't understand how anybody could think that pointing a finger at a man makes being healthy\nAnd you got to listen to both sides if that's true but that's why the court case\nAnd I just I get off of what they're trying to do to Brett Kavanaugh because the guy obviously has a lot of class either very well rounded young man I\nCall and young because I'm sixty six I'm over the hill but I eat [noise] he he's just a great guy and I just hate to think that people think that our justice system is going to come down to just pointing the finger and you're automatically guilty we have due process in this country now and understand that that's what makes this country great everybody gets a fair trial\nWell they do understand that what what did somebody on the left the energy Bill Clinton got way more due process that he was ever ... deserving of\nTheir um but he made he was on the right side if it's somebody in a what I mean the correct side for them obviously the lead not the right side um but when it comes to somebody on the ride a conservative Republican they're always ... prove themselves innocent and it just blew up with their faces this time it was interesting was Collins said yesterday\nThis isn't about you know I'm\nGuilty beyond a reasonable doubt this is just the more likely than not and that still doesn't even happen is is this is not more likely nobody but nobody says this happened except for the woman who said that it happened\nEverybody else she said was there not only said it didn't happen they completely reviewed it they didn't they weren't leaving like I don't really remember no they they said it didn't happen so that's\nThat's a problem for the left they should have known this and now we're hearing that there might have been some tampering of the witness where we're her lawyers tried to get her best friend to change\nYour story I mean the whole thing is disgusting to be honest with you it's very disgusting if they ignorant\nBy quite I appreciate you open line now one eight hundred and five zero one Seventy eighty one eight hundred and five ... all

lots of stuff going on [laughter] but um or to just\nFind it very very hypocritical that here were interviewing the man to be a um fair and fair and honest person to decide the premier court cases what we find it very strange when he gets extremely angry when he's accused of these baseless crime\nI'm both a a survivor I Will never said victim survivor of a sexual assault more than one [noise]\nUm I was in law enforcement as well and I think that if we listen and we let\nOff allegations like the um Dr Ford may have been assaulted but there is nothing into her that was ... and if we let women like to come forward and do this kind of damage to manage reputation it's actually going to set back women testifying by decades\nUm I I went through a horrible time in the seventies when I was attacked\nAnd it was because of women that come forward with I mean that's why we have that term crime rate\nBecause women have notoriously done at when they've been scorned or that or or many other things and the fact that we would want to do that we wouldn't want judge Kavanaugh\nWho surprisingly enough he's now in the second highest court in the country nobody came forward before now it it's just a political smear campaign and I do I do agree with the whole idea that they are becoming more socialist [noise]\nI have a friend that would actually grew up in Argentina and came home became a citizen and she is\nA hard core Republican and and try to explain to people what it's truly like to live in a socialist country we don't want to go that way but I just find it so hypocritical that here we're\nExamining the person for a job in a court where he's supposed to be fair right at we get it that when he showed his emotion why he's being attacked unjustly\n... you couldn't be more courage that he ... something one of the most dogs there are things that were received ... ... you know going to be here and and liberal him about this I'm Sorry to absorb that happened to you and I'm Glad that you're a survivor and you're not looking at yourself as a victim no I I Wonder\nDo you remember the details of what happened to you because this was love you or doesn't remember anything does that mean if you did all the victims\nThe survivors that I've ever spoken with have remembered every book\nWhere she lost and to me one of my I had a a less traumatic incident when I was fourteen and where she completely lost me I'd rather than go parent household with that there were six cats\nWhen I was fourteen I had something like that happened to me I didn't tell my mom right away\nBut I wouldn't leave her side for men right that when she first started to live with me was when she said that they went to the grocery store and she wanted to go on a separate entrance just weeks later we after she almost died\nThan the fact that she had the physical composure to say Hi to someone that was in that room when I saw my attacker\nWhen I was Eighteen and was it was a home invasion I was raped and my home gunpoint front of my family\nWhen I saw him in court I became physically ill I couldn't look in the eye and tell us to identify him\nBut I became physically ill and I have a horrible memory my family laugh about it all the time they'll say to me mom don't you remember an off a that was your first mistake\nBut I can remember what I was wearing\nEvery single detail and both times every single detail there's nothing that isn't completely clear and cemented in my memory\nI just I found her not credible with regard to cabinet and honestly I hate to but I find her not credible I'm trying to be as open minded as possible because I wasn't\nAnd I know ... right my got on her now she's\n... and ... but but you you and I both know that the the left said well here's what we're going to do with was before no matter what she does the word we're going to use is credible to everybody that we talk to and we're going to force them to all repeat credible because then the the watching or listening public will will agree\nBut she was credible but I agree with you and I said there's really gone may I Believe that maybe she was a victim of something or survivor of something I don't think anything she said about Brett Kavanaugh was in fact credible in fact that was the wrong usage about words and that's\nWhere I was I mean and I was attacked because I said but what so what I mean I saw when I saw heard what I heard and even her best friend doesn't corroborate that tells me something\nWell and and I was away at how much I have personally been attacked\nBy either survivors product called them back then\nBecause they allowed it to the point that likes to write me away as I had a guy friend that I grew up with that I Can't\nBelieve with your history that her [noise] I Would be

H. let's start off with traffic and whether together\n[noise] expect delays as you travel north than a forty five freeway American airline\nThis and I I wanted them to do it I you know ... it's been so Bogle he'd been so tough on it ... and it was time you know you you see the nonsense that's going on you say that the ... the reality is that there's no one that could have accomplished what he's been able to do that no one that you know so few that ever signed the front of a paycheck\nSo few that had ever you know in our whole political system that had ever had a they or someone family someone livelihood their safety and well being of their kids and grandkids dependent on their success he'd actually done it I mean that was the big laugh I had last week when you know Obama's running around claiming that's like on any of you know\nI remember when Obama say hey you didn't build that it's like\nNow now now he owns it right because his policies of oppressive taxation insane regulation general hatred of towards business we went oh you didn't do that I mean Obama himself when my father I don't know why we couldn't have three\nThree and a half four percent even even better right GDP Growth Obama goes and I look there's no magic wand for that right at the New York times back him up no no no because you know of course he can do no wrong\nNo no this is the new normal well Africa Deborah yeah of course we expect Obama to be able to fix anything you've never done anything\nIt turns your ... your damage\nAnything he never had any experience there was no way and we should expect him to be able to fix anything economically guess what my father has done that he has built businesses or he didn't build that\nAnd so it shouldn't be a shock to people that were able to turn that around and now the Democrats won a reversal of that they want to take everything into one eighty why because we have an all time historic lows for blacks and unemployment\nFor Hispanics for women you know you want to reverse all that I mean if the Democrats the ... sorry Donald Trump came out today in favor of oxygen\nDemocrats would be against it I mean that's their policy it's just hate\nBut we have to show up we have to stay on the fight because people's they've done I Love your dad doing it's so great it's amazing it's\nYou know but I say well how are you voting for who your congressman they are voting for November what do you mean it was November right they're not they want to vote and twenty twenty but they don't realize that it can all go away in twenty Eighteen they don't realize that Donald Trump is on the ticket in twenty Eighteen Donald Trump is on the ticket in six weeks\nSo we got to get out we got to mobilize if you like what's going on a\nMixture of fight for it because the other side I don't know what they're motivated by I don't even know what their platform is other than ... you'll have an outrage I mean you know what their outrage or they should be outraged about their platform and their failures over the last few decades but they are outraged about something else but there are turning up\nWe got to turn up I see it all the time they're like no no no the same fake news media that said Donald Trump can't win is saying that he's going to lose now\nBelieve it I see the numbers you got to get out you gotta stay we can't just be fat hand being lazy and expect that stuff to continue he needs he needs guys like Ted Cruz he needs guys like ... to all of the congressional people in Texas that are up he need those guys helping him he can't do it by himself and I didn't giving the house to Nancy Pelosi\nIs there a question I think about it I mean that would be a disaster for this country\nBecause we got to turn around and we got to bring our friend\nIt's trending on drugs today the ... you blows to use ... I'm going to be the speaker again it's Donald Trump junior and uh we we always appreciate the time a couple of things they didn't realize that your dad had the magic wand the whole time because I didn't want\nIt was common sense and experience right is it an a magic wand it's just you know you can't expect a community organizer to ... understand let alone actually affects you wait real change when it comes to economic our fiscal policy on fiscal but I think about it we we've discussed the economy I Know him what about foreign policy\nI look at the end you look at the Israeli embassy you look at what's going on in North Korea that took guts fine you know we don't just draw red line in Syria like Obama did win the cross it they slap you in the face where they they tried doing that at least fifty seven Tomahawk missiles and ... and guess what the rest of the world was watching\nOkay we were not going to let people take advantage of something whether it's trade deals got NAFTA it can't be renegotiated\nCan be done and never been against what congratulations Mexico and Canada now on board done there were ... when when you have a real leader\nI Wish that we had somebody in journalism in journalism was dead known him and he says is all the time too but it didn't go on one person steps up and says former President Obama just told me one thing you did\nThat caused this to happen because how do you take credit for it if you look your dad when one eighty on everything Obama did and fix the ... how can Obama even for a second even think to himself yeah I did that because we're not\nWe're not fighting a fair fight and that's why we all have to get out because we're fighting with one arm to arms to arms and a leg it feels like at times because the media will yeah like I said oh no this is the new normal one point ... percent lifted that doesn't have to be why why would the New York times back him up on that front because they needed to make him a success because they all believe in the asinine policies you see that\nI mean look at what's going on in fact that in bed or August putting up a challenge I mean Beto O'Rourke and run for mayor of New York city and be on the left side of a ticket\nI mean that's really you know his his money's coming from all places other than saying this\nBecause you know those are taxes the values that he espoused or you know the attacks on law enforcement want to eliminate ice and the ... I mean I've only save nine hundred kids last year from you know a sex trafficking but they're terrible we should get rid of them I mean these people are insane and so we have to get out we have to stay motivated we have to bring our friends\nAnd you can't buy into the media stuff just look at what's going on in your business is look\nAt what's going on your place to work with your paycheck I mean you're winning with these policies these policies are moving the needle these policies are making a difference in America's getting respect again because we're not going to let little third world countries push us around and slap us around\nYou know I changed and\nWe have to remember that because they can all go away in November\nAnd people need to realize that it's Donald Trump junior and I appreciate the access let's talk about Texas as human beings in San Antonio Fifteen stations in Texas we've got a hundred and twelve around the country but we focus now on Texas because there's been a challenge Robert Francis awoke is what I call him he's somehow called appropriating but he's Hispanic and he's\nNot he's not at all that spending and he'll pretend he is for the road but that's a democratic ... you can get away by the way if Ted Cruz did something like that now he happens to actually be Hispanic selling for granted something like that they would destroy absolutely you you you were going to be on it every day for better or it's\nNot a problem when he said something about what was the voluptuous breast or whatever that that's not a problem that only one day story of Ted Cruz did that it it would be you know he should be disbarred he should be you know write it killed ...\nWe're not fighting a fair fight and there's down ticket races that are dependent on this thing you know it's been great for taxes he's done he's fought for those values I look at the ... platform I'm like I said I mean this is in New York City mayoral candidate running for senator in Texas\nWell he's getting big support for Mellon so you know that's good to Donald Trump junior so you're in Texas you got Ted Cruz who I I ... from ... wait longer than he's been a senator and he's always made promises that he's always done exactly what he said he would do was the first thing is your dad and then went out in the primaries but\nThere are very very similar politically in that they're not doing it politically basically I'm going to do this this this this and this and you're dead and had actually believe I should do those things I promise bigger was just given us you know a ... puppy dogs it's weird well of\nCourse I listen I I really respect that I mean was it was a brutal primary and a little story I don't know if I'd actually even said this publicly but ... you know a couple of weeks after that and it was a brutal primary there was\nA big AI dinner in DC you know the usual\nYou know this stuff [laughter] I I went uh and you know it was all my friends are from Texas from there all the time hunting fishing or raised a lot of money there and campaign down in Texas I'm sitting there at the Texas table and a couple of friends Ted at the table and we actually have a great dinner good conversation at the end of the dinner we say hey\nWhy don't you know we're going back to the Trump Hotel right in the middle of DC on Pennsylvania Avenue a couple of drinks hanging out whatever you want to come along it came with us and that and the Trump Hotel we had a great time for three hours knows that took guts yeah but you don't wanna showed me beyond the guts if he\nUnderstood Donald Trump going to be president and he was going to help support policies that he believed in that we're going to be good for America and they were going to be good protects and he was able to put all of that aside and now they have a great relationship\nBecause they're doing what's right for their constituencies that was impressive to me that was a great\nA testament to his character and everything and I don't think I've ever told a story before but I think it's actually relevant huh because you're doing what's right for your constituency and I don't see that everywhere else I mean they can look at where bagel rocks money is probably coming from\nThat probably doesn't represent the average guy in Texas right now that probably represents the average guy in the Hollywood studios so that's the difference and I don't want Texas to become California\nAt Texas a I mean just look at the economic success if it had to look at all this debt but you want to become California give me a ...\nAnd the people coming from California bringing their politics but that doesn't make any sense to me it's a it's Donald Trump junior up you have an opinion as to why anybody would listen to I'm going to take away your tax cut I'm going to\nI'm going to lower your paycheck we're going to open the border we're going to get rid of arguments and forcing the border in every single week they're either catch agreements Thirteen or stopping sex trafficking\nWhy would anybody want new you blows you to be in charge against things are going so great right now why you have no idea but like I said\nWe're we're not in a fair fight you know the media will show business loan right thing to do it but I'm all for taking care of other people once we take care of our own problems but we've got plenty of friends who are going to disastrous education system would what twenty eight and like the world after\nA long list of third world countries to the gym and half of you know to spend and I have spent the a small fraction of what we spend per capita right I mean we had we had that problem that we're working on fixing and they're making great progress with all of those things but like we need to keep going\nAnd you're going to have people in there that basically the next two years until twenty twenty you will be a total stalemate nothing will get done it'll be a total disaster\nLet's start off with traffic and whether the gather\nAll around Houston we are having some we can construction I taught in east west ... million shelled and that is going to be shut down

think it's by the mainstream media where he used to come in and they've never seen a positive data point that they had it ignored enough and I guess how fat that sat down ever\nCovering this economy jealous God Forbid it ever starts to go down even all the numbers you already know allowing employment numbers among\nAfrican Americans in Asian Americans and Hispanic Americans and winning they're

out her identity issue as to remain anonymous they did it by sitting on it by dropping it and after the twelve hour hadn't told and\nBut for the Republicans bloody Ford may not have ever had a forum\nTo testify under oath it's a set of Sherry committee and the majority of the other Republicans I gave her that um but you're right they're talking about ice and beer this week and so that's probably a positive sign we respect the process of folks like Senator flake and others wanted the FBI investigation expand the um\nExpand the supplemental investigation here since the FBI has already completed six\nVetting on Brett Kavanaugh including one completed this last July which is on the desk of every senator so we'll see what happens\nBut if you're if you're a few of those red state
