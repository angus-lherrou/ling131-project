understanding of where my incomes going to come from how do I protect my assets against the next market crash\nAnd how do I bring this all together in a very simple easy to understand coherent plan that allows me to to do the things I Want to do in retirement and that spend time with kids grandkids get involved in the community travel so you need a plan that is what we do for every single person we sit in front of\nI truly believe it's what God had destined for my life I had to go through some of those things to to get where I Am trials and tribulations we go through in life\nThey make us tougher in our we grow strong stronger and our face if we do the right things and that's just been my experience and that's just in my story so when we sit down from you across the table and we're talking about retirement you know I look for these same traits and every single person that works here people don't come here to work because they want to collect the pay check\nThey come here because they want to make a difference because they want to make an impact\nOn people who are entering retirement\nAnd society at large and and that's the type of people who surround ourselves with and that's the type of person you're going to sit with if you give us a call to come in and talk about retiring\nTo start that process to have a discussion to see if we are a good fit for each other give us a

with you've got to learn their vision for their retirement their hopes and dreams\nAnd all of that is kind of the starting point and then this is a process it's not done in one week basically\nIt's purely a get to know you type of situation because we don't work with everyone I met a gentleman in here recently and you know he was stuck in his ways he was stubborn and wanted to keep doing it his weight and want to take advice and\nYou know he had a a good amount of money but he's gonna fail in retirement plans simple it's working now that you know is way too much risk way too concentrated and

one's going to sell you anything we're trying to make sure you're a good fit for us I'm just like you're trying to make sure we're a good fit for you\nAnd um if we are a good fit and what you can take to the bank is that you're going to be working with a fiduciary who's going to one hundred percent of the time put your best interests first\nAnd work their butts off you know to give you the best retirement that they can from a financial in retirement planning standpoint\nAnd that's all we can do is we can come in every single day you know work are you know butts off as hard as we can for you and partner with you in this process you know I feel like I retire thousands of times in my life just because every single day I come to work I help people retire\nAnd I see the stress I see the the uncertainty the questions the fear I get that are really really do so our entire process is is built to make you feel comfortable to to ask good questions to get a little bit deeper with those

three if you end up being colors nine or Twenty one sorry about that hit us up at Houston oh TA dot com\n... passes there there is we stay on kind of this consistency track because of this consistency conversation I should say\nYou know you talked a little bit of a a little bit about shorting and that is a great opportunity to make to make money as the market going down\nWhat are some of the other ways that people can diverse into different directions you know we hear diversification as far as I Do have a little commodities have little stocks have little bones but how 'bout diversification as far as different directional vehicles go well you can always sit here and say we know that when the markets go down there's usually people pulling out of the\nMarkets the Marty money's going somewhere either could go into gold it can go into bonds the cool thing that our students learn here as it doesn't matter your background your age what you've done before we teach them how to read a chart so it's a stock chart bond chart gold shark\nThey're able to start learning how to trade in the beauty of learning what shorting is is that again a lot of people have been told their whole lives when the markets go down it's a bad thing last February\nGoldman Sachs made two hundred million dollars in one day by simply Shorty in the market now imagine that we had a little piece of it I'm not going to be greedy you know but if you start to learn how to treat like the banks do then it's amazing\nThat all of a sudden you can start learning a skill that can make your money and not have to sit there and think about a second job or to get into a little bit later\nBut one of the ways I look at this and I get this analogy all the time when people are just simply trading one direction or they're waiting for the market to always go up it's like a car imagined that you were told you can get in a car tomorrow and you can drive somewhere but you can't put the car and reverse\nYou're going to go on a lot of circles eventually going to get there but you could waste a lot of time energy and money getting to the same place if you simply had all the tools to get you there faster so a lot of what I'm seeing our students learning the first time is it they're becoming\nDirection ... they don't care if it goes up down or sideways as long as the markets are moving they can learn how to make money and what a lot of them are seeing right now is they could create more freedom for themselves because they're able to make money no matter where the markets go\nYeah absolutely and I love I Love the analogy of the car and there's so many so many other analogy that we could pull into this that in in I Would say in real life you know outside of the are investing life in our normal everyday life we there's no way we buy a car that didn't go in reverse right but so many times we find ourselves in investments that only have one direction or one avenue where they can profit\nYou know it's it's the same thing you go back to our you know go back to high school education and where was your stock picking class where it was how to balance a checkbook class right the law to check but after I said I just dated myself victory over there\nBut it is it is true though I mean we we really didn't have that stuff and so we're left to to rely on the quote unquote professionals really guide us through this process\nWhere unfortunately they make a commission off of these transactions and I say unfortunately kind of tongue in cheek there because that's okay with me that they make a commission that's that's what they do for a living your real estate brokers make a commission when they sell real estate so stockbrokers should naturally make a commission when they sell stocks\nBut when we buy a home it is up to it was up to the individual to make sure that they are buying the right home for them in the right market place in the right area that the right payment the right everything it's up to the person to do it\nThe broker just completes the transaction and unfortunately it's up to the person to also make sure that they're making the appropriate decision when it comes to their investing but when it really boils down to about Ninety nine percent of the world\nHasn't ... they spend more time analyzing the menu when they go out to dinner than they do analyzing what investments to to select\nIt it just puts his behind the eight ball and it's something that I think if we did a quick give away with a few more these passes we could probably make a dent in and help people start making better investment decision I think it's a great idea let's do it All right well right now we've got a half the class coming up in your area that half the classes where you'll see exactly what it takes to generate more consistent income in the market\nUnderstand how the market works understand what the risks are involved with a lot of different investments out there and nearly how to capitalize capitalize on the upside not have to classes about three hours long and so you'll be investing three hours of your time to really raise that financial IQ and start getting better and returns\nOn your investments now just a second you're gonna have a chance to win a set of passes one of these half day classes to get your phone's ready and if you are driving now is a good time to pull

light on multiple streams of income talked a little bit about half of income we talked a little bit about active income and then specifically\nSpend a lot of time on that multiple streams of income side of things in the financial freedom that that can really generated I Love the ... the the conversation about the the average millionaire having five plus dreams of income\nAnd you can break that down into different directions but but even the whole conversation we're having a few minutes ago leery about about building the skill first the skill comes first the income comes later in so many times we want the income\nWe want the income now without the skill right I mean how many times have you talked to a a a surgeon and they said oh you know what I'm going to do a little bit of surgery here I'm In a practice heart surgery so that I can pay for medical school and the skill just doesn't really work that way we got to have the skill first otherwise that operating table can be a dangerous spot to be laying\nNow unfortunately it ends up being that same the same conversation when it comes to our money and I had somebody say oh well this isn't life or death\nBut really when we're talking about our finances it is our financial life or death so we really want to take this just as seriously we work too hard for this money\nTo have it not heading in the right direction on a consistent basis and this retirement money that we want to talk about in this segment is exactly that it's in a situation where we're usually just buying every other friday right just because it's paid and we've been told every other friday we're just supposed to put some money in our retirement accounts\nAnd it will just slowly growing and well that's true in a polish marketing bearish market which was what you were just touching on right as we were going to break that kind of detrimental side of things we can continue to buy into assets there deteriorating\nAnd it's a lot like lighting our retirement accounts on fire or at least a little portion of our paycheck\nWhen we're throwing it into a deteriorating asset so just a few of the things that we want to want to keep in mind and one of the things I really love to have you Larry shed some light on in here because we do have a lot of our students\nWho are really out there trading they do have their retirement accounts and and when I talk to our students I'm hearing a lot of people say you know number one they either don't have enough money to retire on you know we're number to those that do they're not quite sure really how to continue the growth\nAnd to protect the downside right and that's really that point you were getting at a before we took the break and so I'd love to give you kind of giving you the floor here to take that back overboard or some of the things you and your instructor team are doing with investors to help make sure they have income for retirement\nRight in the number one mistake that most people may cause they think they can do this on their own then they wind up coming back and realizing they need the education so we start talking to our students about is how they can start creating a strategy for success when it comes to the retirement\nRight now you know it's funny when the market started to go down this week a lot of my friends call me and they started going what does this mean they started getting all nervous not one student emailed me and said Larry do you see this is a bad thing in fact\nMost people who know what they're doing they're elated that this is starting to happen most people waiting ten years for another market correction why because typically the markets always tend to correct about every ten years or so last major when we had was obviously in two thousand eight here we are in two thousand Eighteen\nSo what's now becoming more important than ever is it took people about six years to recover from the last correction\nPeople out there listening if you don't have six years right now or you're planning to retire\nYou don't have anything saved right now you need to figure out how to create a plan to help protect you and a lot of our students come in the door\nReally nervous about I don't have enough money to start well you know what they're doing right it's pretty fascinating they're starting to learn how to trade other asset types like futures and lately and they're saving that money from trading and they're starting to\nAnd their retirement accounts so again a lot of people first thing they always say is like the mortgage that got the kids' college up on their retirement always comes last so we start to teach her students read out of the gate\nThat they can come up with a plan they understand most importantly what you need is because a lot of people the one size fits all does not work when it comes to retirement\nYou can't just do this you first have to figure out what your needs are learning how to manage that need most importantly how to learn some really important risk management how to protect that money\nAnd then at the end of the day you will have enough to retire on based on what you need not someone else is telling you what you need\nAnd you're talking about the kind of the cycles that the markets go through the big ups in the big downs and we do generally have a crash about every and we call them crashes but we do generally have a nice big drop in the markets about every ten years\nAnd one of the things about that as you go back and look at him how often they're forty fifty sixty percent drops and so kind of that average uh that we can expect is about a fifty percent if you go back into two thousand and eight and you\nKind of measure that you've got about a fifty percent drum Becky fifty eight forget about fifty eight percent you go back into their early two thousand fifty say the same thing and so if we come to here and we say okay here's your that's kind of what we can expect again that's kind of the new normal\nBut the thing that I went through with my father about ah we we had a conversation about this you know back in about two thousand and eight\nOr you know we're talking about drops in the market we're talking about drops and accounts and and one of the things that we're we're kind of walking through was\nIf somebody had a fifty dollar if somebody had a hundred thousand dollar account\nAnd they lost fifty thousand in the last fifty percent will they lost fifty thousand so now they're account value of that fifty thousand that happened in one year here that drop happened I think it was fourteen months total right that happened in pretty much just a year it went down when they take the average rate of return on the way up and let's just be very very generous and let's say somebody is averaging ten percent on the Web\nThat's ten years just to get back to break even 'cause when you take a hundred and you turn it into fifty\nTo take fifty and turn it into a one hundred requires a one hundred percent return on our money and so one of the conversation we were talking about was how long does it take the average person to really even get back to break even after going through a big catastrophic drop like that\nSo one of the scariest things right now is that people just don't have a plan that don't know what to do they haven't been educated and so unless you're really sitting there thinking about this and say to yourself fool me once shame on you fool me twice shame on me and\nYour lifestyle can have a lot of freedom in it and that's that's one of the things I I I'd like you to expand on 'cause you you talked with more students than probably anybody I Know you know what are some of the life changing things your seeing\nAnd what are the some of the things people are doing to really get that freedom\nWell the first is taking a step I mean a lot of people are poor for the simple reason\nPoor stands for passing over opportunities repeatedly\nThe people tend to do better in life do so by taking action when opportunities arise they're not in their comfort zone they're not fearing all the time what they're doing is they're learning a skill that will allow them not only to help themselves maybe their kids their grandkids and again we're fine with our students Ryan is they're not\nFrom a certain way or education or background\nThere simply people that are ... and they're passionate about learning something new again I mentioned this earlier\nThe number one mistake than most people make with their money is they think they can do this on their own and then they'll go to the education later well that's the wrong thing to do one creates bad habits and number two they never do go back to the education 'cause they blown up the money they had\nSo what do good students do I talk to them all the time number one\nThey've realized in the twenty first century that they can take a laptop anywhere in this world right now it doesn't matter because as long as they have an Internet connection and their laptop\nThey can trade all over the world in fact we had a student named ... he's in San Diego and a lot of times are students feel it's too hard they can't do it well not only is beyond done this and his left his job which is exactly what everybody wants to do right we want to quit a job and I love to do something we do love\nHe's become a excellent trader and he's also now started funding his wife's real estate business so the two of them are doing something together\nSpending more time together spending more time on vacations in family but the important thing here Ryan is it they're loving what they're doing and there's so many people out there and if you're one of those people hopefully you can see how you can benefit from just learning a skill that can give you the freedom that you desire\nYeah absolutely and it's it's kind of interesting as we're as we're sitting here talking about kind of the lifestyle of a traitor I'd just literally received a text message from a dear dear friend of mine\nAnd it just popped up on my phone and he was actually somebody who got me started in trading he was one of the first people who said this is how you open an account these are the steps that you go through it very very first conversations these just become a lifelong dear friend of mine and he's a huge ski bum he lives up in Salt lake you just easy travels around it as a great time\nHe just texted me with a picture of snow ski saying hey can you use these this season or should I take him to the ... because if I go up to Salt Lake users bum a pair of skis from him rather than a hall and mine around\nBut it it's just there's just so much freedom that can come with it and it and it really ends up just pulling down to a couple of basic steps a couple of basic as you\nWere saying changes or actions that need to be taking because I think it's very critical it's very important it's it's very powerful once we do understand\nThat that that poor is just the state of mind right that passing over opportunities repeatedly and it's something that can be really easily changed just by stepping out of our comfort zone right just by stepping out of our comfort zone and doing something different we talk a lot about kind of cliche statements on the show here but it's because they're so true and they're so useful\nAnd and it goes back to if we've always done if we always do what we've done will always get what we got in and if we are completely satisfied with where we are then\nThen great let's continue to do what made us so happy in the first place\nBut if we want a little bit more for trying to create a little more income if we're trying to create a little more freedoms we have a specific goal\nThat we're trying to accomplish that we haven't been able to get to\nWe have to make the necessary changes and that's one of the life lessons that my grandfather shared with me my whole life growing up he would hold up his five fingers and I would have to ... them\nThe first one is no your business the second one is be converted and that converted one as a youngster I honestly didn't understand what it meant and as I got involved with trading and I really started to go kind of soul searching down is is this something that's gonna work for me am I going to be able to do this\nThat converted when I started to realize was make the necessary changes the necessary metamorphosis do what's necessary\nAnd and and in the beginning and that was the one I always kind of didn't put as much emphasis on when I was like ten eleven twelve even Eighteen Nineteen twenty you know but then as I really started into my my grown up years I started realizing\nHow be converted that pointer finger of the five to me became the most valuable because if we don't make the necessary changes we're never going to accomplish that kind of outlier goal that were after that one of the things we can do to help a few people get started with this as we used to\nAbout a few tickets we can give away let's change some lives right now we've got a half day class coming up in your area\nThey have to ... ... exactly what it takes to really take control of the finances really take control your retirement account generate more income inside of the market's really lived

million dollars it's all about getting that money working for you and really getting it to generate that income so you can live the lifestyle you can reach the financial freedom goal that you're after\n... what are some of the things are what are some of the other kind of examples I Know you have your bags and bags low the view of these examples of our students that you've talked to that we're in one place that are now in another well the first thing we always understand here is that with\nTrading it's simply a transfer of money from people who don't know what they're doing to people who do know what they're doing and what's really sad as people will get themselves stuck think about this time right now\nPeople can sit in front of a television for hours versus going out there and learning a skill that can help them and every year and you're we're coming up to the holiday season again we're gonna start seeing all these Jim commercials again right 'cause here comes resolution time and one of the things I hear our students say over and over again is beside wishing haven't had more time was\nThis is the year I Want to get out of debt and I want to turn my finances around and what's amazing is how many students\nCome in through the classes that we're doing right now and simply imagine what their life would be like if they can learn a skill to help them generate more money\nAnd that's the key it's about doing something taking action and getting out there to change your current situation again if you're ... and something that you are really interested in learning how to do there is no limitations here in fact one of my students June\nShe actually came to my class and she said all she wanted to do is play golf in Costa Rica and so she started realizing that by learning how to trade gave her the time to do that I said it's great to send me a postcard and she did and she said she was trading because that's a whole nother piece of it\nPeople go on vacation Ryan right and they decorate the vacation they're making money to pay for it and so I asked you or your training before after golf she goes oh\nBefore of course that I Love that of course\nYeah we're talking with a group of students just a little while ago did a big trip through Europe and I remember him saying\nYou know where we were trading out in Europe and we made as much money out on our trip as we actually spent on the trip so it's kinda fun to come back from a trip with a with a with a flat balance or even being up after having a great after having a great time\nAnd that's the thing is it doesn't matter where you are you just have to have an Internet connection doesn't matter where you are and it doesn't matter where you're from it doesn't matter what your background is it's all about just proactively identifying good opportunities and that's really what we introduced you to insure you exactly what it takes how to do that inside of the half the class and we are\nPretty much at the end all but before we end where you say we do know that give away\nYeah let's give at least ten more people the opportunity to get some tickets here\nOh right right now we've got to have to class coming up in your area and a half day classes ... exactly what it takes\nTo really reached that financial freedom generating more income in the markets like I always say if you're why is big

America studios this he's use radio seven forty Katie our age bused in orange radio stations\nMore sadness from Pittsburgh I'm Sally Adams eight o'clock on news radio seven forty Katie R. H. with traffic\nAnd whether to gather years you think\nSally easy traveling on forty five ... five Seventeen watch out for an accident taking up to right lane and I'm forty five north than in FM five Eighteen bad accident take that the right rainiest posh and trying to get around that\nThe are ridiculous legacy disgusting media reporting but it's the Margot bomber the make America great again bummer which is disgusting\nReporting that\nThe bomber was going after Trump targets no not the case would you have is a bad guy who did something very bad\nAnd calling him demographer bomber is not only inappropriate it shows that you shouldn't be in the journalism business at all\nThose of us on the political opposite side we're not calling the shooter African rational baseball game the Sanders shooter even though he was a vehement Bernie Sanders supporter that's not what we do that's also not being honest and they start reporting the news\nAs as it is in reality\nSo we've got more violence today we don't know why other than this person allegedly shouts some sort of hatred and I'm\n\nAn incredible hatred and loading of people have the Jewish faith we don't have any motive other than that we don't know his name although it's been a reporter to use a white guy with a beard and also it was reported as a bombing suspect was a white guy to that guy list themselves as native\nEric in this first name is Caesar or says are so he could be Hispanic as well and also a report that he's a talented Filipino\nThe media always the quick\nTo say it's a white guy remember George Zimmerman the guy who killed Trayvon Martin because Martin went back and was beaten hell out of them in in self defense he shot and killed him they reported him as a white guy for a long time until they had to wants his picture was out there admitted that he was Hispanic so then they started calling him a white Hispanic\nSo dumb that is so the media always is looking for a spin I'm always going to give it to you straight as I can\nAnd that's what we have out of Pittsburgh I'll give you updates as we go I definitely want your thoughts on this uh this bombing suspect that is a ... that's under arrest and even more than that I mean it looks like at some nut job who had some crazy delusion about\nWhat his role should be in politics in this country I mean\nJust the pictures the van itself if you're looking at a going what there was a guy riding down the street with a van that looked like that and nobody suspected and even here's a guy with a ... a substantial criminal record\nYears and years and years of convictions who by the way was a registered Democrat I've seen reports that he switched to Republican and twenty sixteen\nAnd suddenly Trump made him do it according to the media\nSends out a bunch of alleged bombs I'm not even convinced or really bombs but he sends out a bunch of alleged bombs to people we return addresses on these fake addresses on the actual said into an area they were supposed to show up at all these prominent Democrats houses and their officers they never made it there\nBut\nIt's for the media it's not about are the bad guys off the street thank God nobody was hurt it's more about\nTrump did this I guess there were some letter signed by hundreds of journalists about how Trump is somehow inciting violence against journalists that's not true he's done nothing like that in fact it sounds really stupid and an journalistic to even say something like that\nIn fact I can make a good argument that the media is inciting violence against those who support President Trump you if you were a make America great again hat your target and that's okay\nIf you go to a Trump rally or you have a Trump bumper sticker you're a racist and Islamophobia Xena fall but that's OK the media school with that\nYou're late night talk shows calling the president's mouth a blank holster for for putting that's okay that's perfectly fine\nFake news incessantly that's just the way it is will correct it later\nAnd there are there is an example of for example at the example of that with the media again playing the victim in fact\nJemma concept from CNN the other day tweeted out this appointment or engaged over the fact that when President Trump was talking about the bombs that were they were going he didn't mention CNN specifically give that in mind\nThis is a guy whose job is supposed to be to go there to report the news and he's not ever supposed to be the story is mad that he wasn't the story\nAnd when the president does call CNN out than a cost and and and his ilk say he shouldn't be doing that he's putting his endangering denigrating what we do for a living and make you make your mind up either you want to be mentioned by the president or you don't want to be on the president you don't get to tell the president in what mentioned he has to make\nFor you so I mean we're living in bizarro world here really are\nThose who perpetrated violence on the left should be arrested and or or killed in the act like the guy with the shooter was in that congressional baseball practice they should be prosecuted to the fullest extent of the law and sent away for as long as we possibly can those who committed violence and they're on the right same thing should apply\nBut the selective reporting and there's the desire by the media to pretend like one side is inciting violence and the other side is that it's just a crazy person that was unhinged that's irresponsible that's responsible\nOr by the way that the bombing suspect very odd the whole thing's odd claims he's a seminal Indian\nIs family or a family friend or a lawyer somebody claimed that he wasn't at all that he is in one by one name that he went by different name one name sounded Native American or American indian and the other one sounded Italian first they've certainly sounds Hispanic\nWho knows what he is when we do know is he was some promoter for chipping veils and some bouncer at at a bar and even the night before he was arrested\nSo whatever the the left is trying to glean from him and put it on Trump easier responsible and stupid\nAnd the media needs to learn it's job again the job is to go there observing and tell us what you saw\nIs not drug or observe and then tell us why Trump caused it that makes no sense so I'll keep you updated on what's happening in Pittsburgh certainly we've got a bunch of interviews coming your way a bunch of interviews I might take us impulse led called ... led Charlie go\nI'm I'm not going to do conspiracy theories today that that that's that's stupid Charlie you can go ahead and hang up in Maryland I'm not technical I'm All right\nOkay John Hi Beau she is the guy from the he's the executive director of the Ronald Reagan um Institute\nIn California great interview with him where we compare and contrast to Ronald Reagan um through his accomplishments treated was treated by the media and how he treated the media\nAnd it wasn't much better than what's going on with Trump and then how Trump does it very very different styles both of them had incredible accomplishments for the American people the media was not on either one of their sides how is it the that the media is Harold ... Ronald Reagan as a great president great leaders thirty some odd years later we're as Trump is being treated as he's being treated\nSo get that for ya I've got representative Kevin Brady you're hearing the president talk a lot about a new a new tax cut plan for the middle class in America is that tax cuts to point out or is that something different we break that down we talked about it and make sure you stick around for that I've got a ... that caravan\nWe've got that for you which is okay\nI did it last minute I think on Thursday Wednesday or Thursday so it's okay\nWe'll try to get you that also mark a lot or from the G O P we talked to him about traveling around with um with vice president Mike Pence\nAnd a ... become the communications director of the Trump Administration for eleven old days you got a new book out we'll talk to him as well your thoughts right now in the bomber the bombing suspect that is on the media coverage on the\nThe climate in America and look I think that the left is causing this\nBecause they're deathly afraid\nOf what's going to happen on election day and by the left I mean the media the political left\nUm Hollywood left there were all freaking out now and there was one event that happened last Monday that I think is causing them to freak out we'll get into what that event was\nUh it happened to to to take place in Houston, Texas will talk about that too it's one eight hundred and five zero one Seventy eighty one eight hundred and five zero one seven zero eight zero Joe ... dot com stay right here [noise]\n... rules for alerts and offer semi automatic catch message messenger data rates may apply\nAmerica this is Martha Stewart now you can cut great casing dinners at home and even forget it that frozen foods and take out instead of killing me for great home cooked food introducing Martha and release them Neal Ken repression fresh ingredients it's my wonderful easy to follow a recipe delivered ...\nAnd right now you can try three for free for a very ... and then it came time I'm offering three free Martha ... eastern meals can everyone\nThem getting these now acting to report if you're traveling on the ... freeway going east and west ... they're\nNow on the eve freeway we're talking about a twenty minute delay from the east to spread three thirty\nAnd a three minute delay from spreading me thirty to downtown and the goal freeway you're only thing about a three minutes away from the same Ethan to wait to downtown and on the north ... that the north and south down I mean as the and the ... dot com twenty four hour traffic than our high pressure from\nThe next several days ... can try do Tuesday as we had to do tonight uh mostly there's ... low low sixties Bob sunshine for your Sunday and Monday\nHospital days low eighties I mean does Todd Bork the weather channel\nSeventy two degrees from the west side ignore side Lexis twenty four hour weather center it's eight thirty one our top story members of the Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania synagogue\nHave had a long long day three police officers were shot eleven members were shot to Lebanon have died more members were shot they did not include however children or the officers\nIn those who have perished suspect was wounded as well and is in custody in a hospital record breaking amounts of voters are in area counties\nAnd they're hitting the polls at this midterm election again tomorrow when the polls are open from one to six in sports college football cougars deep south Florida Today and you heard it on AM nine fifty long horns are behind Oklahoma State you can hear that now on sports talk seven Ninety Aggies\nBarely behind Mississippi State in the third quarter and of course that World Series still has no\nRuns\nNews on demand to Katie R.

but police say the FBI shows was this idiot but\nSent out a bunch of bombs but what are your thoughts when you see that I I personally as a family man is a community member really relieved that we got

talking about blaming politicians and pundits let's do the investigative work and find out who this is that's exactly what happened I think that's the right way to go after\nI think so too it's a Kevin Brady of House Ways and Means Committee chair what one last thing on that um ... is there any changing how the media is doing is they're calling him a demographer bomber they're calling you know for our good bomber do people do not call the guy who shut up the baseball practice\nAnd almost killed these college they didn't call him a Sanders shooter or some ... why is there a double standard here and\nThere is and I will tell you a jot play baseball I played second base with Steve and I had to miss the shooting by only\nA few minutes and in fact the coach after batting practice or apt I took a swing city one takes some ground or as a second I looked out\nThe was take them I Know I'm fine and I grabbed my gear and left just about four minutes ahead of the shootings so uh this is a ... yeah the media um there is a double standard here and and and I guess my frustration is\nAll the blame the president and others for what they believe are overheated rhetoric they often um are filing when you hear\nHillary Clinton urged instability or Maxine Waters Cory Booker or encourage harassment and violence and\nThen rock Obama and Eric Holder ... we've got soundbites from all of them that are actually inciting violence and none of us ever said well the violence happens they made it happen I mean\nWe'd like to see them tamped down their rhetoric a little bit but what a bad guy shoots up a baseball practice or a bad guy since uh bombs I I'm not going to blame the president nor Hillary Clinton I'm going to leave the guy that did it\nYeah it's the guy yeah that's exactly right and and that's the way it ought to be handled so you know it is the the year where frankly President Trump can't even breathe right for some people criticized for everything but I'll tell you what what he's doing for the country for our economy for our security is just unbelievable\nBut I had a conversation with John Hi Bush from the raging a librarian and he's the executive director there and we were comparing and contrasting what this president has accomplished to what Ronald Reagan accomplished and the fact that it's thirty five forty years later\nThe media looks back on a regular you know lovingly and and they didn't love and back then um and and they're treating from horribly and basically they've got about the same record in fact the Heritage Foundation finds this president is even more conservative\nThan President Reagan was yeah I mean it it it's unfair but but that's why have you on let's talk about the successes\nYeah and so Joe to your point well thank you for saying that because that that's my point look Ronald Reagan perhaps of grace president in modern times yeah probably is in my view you know has two legacies\nTax cuts that the ... the economy for decades in the United prosperity and rebuilding the military exactly what President Trump has done in just a his first year and a half really and then you put on top of that this amazing\nA record in the courts of a constitutional judges\nFrom the Supreme Court on down it really is a remarkable record\nIt's remarkable success you have to\nYou again is never going to give them a chance it's Kevin Brady House Ways and Means Committee chair or it'd be the success that we're seeing was fueled by what you came up with ... you worked on this night and day I remember you your jaw I Want to come on but I live in a

again or promising to start doing it so the other side Kevin seem all that success as\nWe got we got to raise the taxes again we have to hurt corporations again and drive them out of the country how is it a winning strategy for them\nYeah I don't know that it is and and and they but they are doubling down on it so appealing and tax cuts raising the taxes on businesses going back to the old a code
