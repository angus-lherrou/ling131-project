they get their people to go in and vote straight Democrat all the way down and we have a lot more trouble with that I got I got news for you you don't want to vote\nFor any Democrat that is pledging allegiance to Morocco Obama Hillary Clinton they can tell you they're a nice guy they visited all two hundred and fifty four counties you don't want any part of and\nGetting you geared up for the weekend\n\nOn a university campus tour\nThe Texas Tribune finely noted that when they talk to people at these rallies that show up\nIn big numbers to see ... most of them can't and do not intend to vote I'm not really sure what the purpose is of\nGatherings huge numbers of people to hoot and holler and talk about\nIf they're not even voters and this is why you keep hearing these stories about

office and he was at Columbia University\nWhen he wrote that review referring to women bother anatomical parts for which he had to apologize last week so Robert Francis O'Rourke who is white is the candidate Kendrick Sampson wants them to vote for\nWhereas Ted Cruz is half Hispanic and basically the same age\nBut he does mean what he says doesn't he don't let these old white people decide our lives for us\n[noise] how long do you stoke this fire until it rips the fabric that unites us\nThere is a a\nVery effective journalist who's been covering what's going on in Portland where mayor Ted Wheeler has basically handed over the reins of authority in the downtown streets of Portland to antifa and he has been publishing video\nYeah all of these ... mobs who've taken over the downtown streets\nThey've closed off some streets they're redirecting people when you pull up there screaming at people they're impressing people this threatening people they're getting in front of cars they're banging on cars you why does this you Whitey that and it's white kids doing this\nOh they have some some blacks in the group but it's mostly white punk antifa are idiots doing this\nHere's a little audio but I Want to encourage you to go to Michael berry dot com and see this for you so you can't believe this is happening in the United states but it is\nAnd it's happening in downtown Portland where the mayor Ted Wheeler continues to relax to a post tweets about joining with other mayors over renewable forest\nAnd energy and third world countries and recycling\nWhile his city has been taken over\nSo these guys have taken over control of the streets like this is like the the the rioting that occurs\nOr at the University of Missouri when after the Michael Brown case when control Ferguson, Missouri when when when towns are taking over\nThe business owners board up and flee well that's what this antifa has done it's the Occupy movement to point out that that's that this is the group we're talking about the same types of groups and they're carrying sticks and clubs and they're standing at the intersections and ask cars unsuspecting\nDrivers drive up they roll their windows down like what do I do you've you've blocked the street would and they tell them where to go you get out of here you go over there but that's but you know the ways or the the Google Maps is telling me to go up there I\nI have a you know a doctor's appointment to block so people don't like change they're scared and as they do this these people begin to threaten them and the mayor Ted Wheeler won't do anything about it\nReally little by little\n\nWhitey are allergic to go\nDown the road\nAnd rice and I just traffic\nHere you\n\nHair dryer\nRaleigh\nNorth\nSo they chase cars they bang on them they threatened people uh\nIt's not good but it's always on the basis of euro Whitey even coming from winds now increasingly this lack of civility is becoming normalized their candidate in two thousand sixteenth said as much over the weekend\nYou cannot be civil with a political party that wants to destroy\nWhat you stand for what you\nSo do you see what you're doing you dehumanize middle Americans you'd be humanize Republicans you'd be humanize conservatives you\nPeople are trying to destroy antifa you're trying to destroy women you're trying to destroy minorities and gays and foreigners who come here you're trying to destroy their abortions you're trying to destroy the environment and because of that we can't be civil with you\nWe have to be violent with you as Maxine Waters said we're going to chase you wherever you go not just your elected officials every one of you you will have nowhere to go you will have nowhere to hide and it's because of you know we can't be civil with you because you're destroying our way of life\nThat's quite the logic isn't it you cannot be civil with a political party that wants to destroy what you stand for what you care about [noise]\n[noise]\nFurniture made in America [noise]\nUse radio seven\nForty Katie our age Houston orange radio station\nFace to begins tonight I'm Sally Adams on news radio seven forty Katie our age in traffic to Ninety is closed eastbound it hurts my sister and west bound west wrote tech started doing bridge work and here's the weather with Jeff Maher\nOkay so you don't want to be a full so we'll talk about that and I also ah as I said you know we specialize in working with people who are retired retiring soon uh most of our clients are over fifty\nAnd so we talk about the risks that you face one of the things as a financial planner you know we want you to enjoy the best retirement that you can we want you to have your second childhood without parental supervision we want you to go play enjoy whatever it is that you want your retirement to look like\nAt the same time though to make that happen I Believe we have to protect you from the risks that could take it away from you okay so this week I Want to talk about where we were on a series of the Eighteen risks based in retirement\nAnd I want to talk about number six which is called frailty risk which is essentially the risk that your cognitive skills deteriorate as you get older and how do you plan to head for that and unfortunately it is something you need to plan for now speaking of planning for stuff\nOne of the most foundational basic question that you have to think about if you haven't started collecting Social Security already is when do you apply\nAnd so uh we're gonna talk about that or this week we're going to have a a segment on went to apply for Social Security\nAnd uh we may not be able to get through all the questions that are lined up that I think you might be interested in so if we don't we'll continue it next week as well now one of the things I mentioned at the top of this show was that uh you know we work as I said with people who are retired are retiring soon for the most part\nAnd so we believe that maintaining what you've spent your life building\nYour investments your your net worth is\nJob number one if we're going to be able to generate the income to give you the the lifestyle that you want okay so therefore we believe that by hold which is you buy a bunch of investments high quality stuff and you create a great portfolio you re balance it and your job is done our view of that is that it's it's an incomplete strategy\nYou need to have a third part to that which is you need to have a cell strategy and that's why you know is is that we told our clients to sell the November of ... and just stay out for all of two thousand and eight and then even half of oh nine we didn't say to buy until June of old nine so we're we're we're by holding cell\nSo this week I Want to talk given to drop that we saw last week and how dramatically it happened and how quickly um I Want to address the hey you don't have to worry about it because you're a long term investor everything takes care of itself overtime time heals all wounds and all that good stuff your long term investor by whole through thick and thin [noise]\nWell I Want to talk about that one with you because I think that is one of the most dangerous things that people tell you if you are the aforementioned retired retiring so now most shows jak would stop right there most of those who say you know what if we did just that we have done more than our listening audience could possibly want from a financial show\nSomebody shot or don't you dare stopped me because on this show do we stop there no we don't we boldly go where no financial show has gone before\nAnd therefore at about ten till we all have our state tip of the week this is the part of the show is on where we talked about how to pass onto your greedy and washed undeserving airs the fruits of your labor and this week we're going to talk about my favorite trust is called a dynasty trust\nAnd this is where you can protect what you leave your heirs from lawsuits divorce and estate taxes for potentially one hundred years it's a terrific thing and we'll talk about that at about ten ...\nSo we've got a ton of get to but I Want to just quickly\nGive a shout out to\nA ... a listener Laura if you're listening to talk about you [noise] um I mentioned last week that we have a a puppy and the puppy uh she had this submissive pink thing that she does you know it's like the mom and she sees me\nYou know when I first come home from work or in the morning or whatever it is first time she sees me bam a gallon a pie right there she just squats and peace and it's like oh my gosh\nAnd so the lord I heard this and she sent me an email to ... we had the best\nI can tell you it's it's awesome thank you Laura a she's a retired veterinarian so if anybody knows it's her right [noise]\nWell I don't know I have to call her she gave me your phone numbers you said call me and Laura I'm going to call you okay I just haven't had time this week but I'll tell you this weekend if if that's okay [noise]\nAnyway let's talk about is this a thousand and eight all over again okay so you know I Want to go back to a you know two thousand and seven the end of two thousand seven October ish and all that\nAnd at that time\nYou know there were some clouds there were some dark clouds or the unemployment numbers were starting to get weaker a there was a inflation was picking up\nThe economy was slowing down a little bit I mean there was no signs of what was to come but there were signs there were some dark cloud let's say that it wasn't raining but there were dark clouds\nAnd uh and there was a lot of volatility the market was dropping dramatically and then a rising dramatically than dropping dramatically and at that time people are saying this is a buying opportunity you know when the market fell\nAnd by the way that's almost exactly what happened in Y. two K. in October of two thousand August through October same thing the market was going up and down the same way before it finally fell off a cliff\nSo is this like that I'm no\nIn my view okay first of all the economy right now is not showing signs of weakening in fact it's the opposite is showing signs of strength unemployment is showing signs of strength inflation is is is in good shape so we got a lot of signs that no this is not two thousand and eight all over again so what is it\nWell basically it's a re calibration okay so in other words the Federal Reserve raised interest rates the market finally has come to terms with that and said oh my gosh interest rates are going up if interest rates go up people buy fewer houses pure cars\nCompanies it costs more to borrow money profits go down so it's a re calibration is just adjusting to the new paradigm that's all so I don't think what happened last week is the beginning of a new bear market recession all that kind of stuff but you know what it does do\nIn my view it should be a wake up call to you\nBecause did you did you see how fast it fell\nI mean it was like what eleven hundred points and two days\nI mean that's fast the market when it goes down it goes down very fast and you can lose your retirement very quickly I mean you can you if you if you're about to retire and it goes down thirty or forty percent like didn't Y. two K. U. and two thousand eight and you'd write it down like that\nWhat would that do to your ability to retire or if you are retired what would that do to your ability to generate income from your investments\nSo that's why you know as I said we don't believe that by and hold is it sufficient okay it's great you should do that you should buy you should hold you should diversify all those things we believe that but it's not sufficient\nYou need to have a third part of that which is a protection mechanism and if if you're over fifty and your contemplating your retirement or you are retired\nWe want you to be a client of ours we want to help you plan your retirement make those decisions all the stuff that it takes we want to be there with you know there was no doubt so here's what I

of financial information every week I wrote that I'm proud of it as bad as it was I take full responsibility [noise] um\nAnd you about this I Know a good [laughter]\nWell how it is very silly incredibly silly [noise]\nSo uh as I was saying I had been a a certified financial planner professional now for the last twenty marvelous wonderful and very exciting years at all of the idea that we talk about on this show these are the same ideas we talked about with our beloved and most valued clients\nTwenty marvelous wonderful and very exciting years and all the ideas that we talk about on this show these are the same ideas that we talk about with our beloved and most valued clients and we're not work with over a thousand four hundred families are in in forty three states and you know what it never ceases\nTo our and me and in and and actually it it gives me enthusiasm it makes me want to go to work every day and do my best because that you know it's such a wonderful thing and Financial Times named uh our financial advisory for money matters one of the top three hundred\nRegistered investment advisors for the second time this year okay so that's and\nThat's quite an honor and we're very proud of that but you know what without our clients we would be nowhere so I give that to them and we are affirmed that specializes in working with people who are over the age of fifty who are retired or retiring soon so we we look at retirement planning is our primary focus\nAnd us so that you would love to help you if you could and you can go to our website to find out all about us and we have tons of stuff on there for you we have podcasts and videos and articles all about the topics of a retirement planning and uh the website is money matters dot net okay so you can find it there\nSo let's talk about Social Security and one of the uh areas are probably the most important of decision that you make when it comes to Social Security is\nWhen do you apply for benefits okay and it's not sixty five anymore full retirement age for baby boomers now is sixty six sixty seven but Social Security benefits can be claimed any time between the ages of sixty two and Seventy\nSo it's crucial for you baby boomers out there to understand how claiming early benefits will reduce your benefits for life\nAnd how delaying benefits will increase it and how to coordinate spousal benefits as well and that's an area all by itself that requires a lot of studying knowledge and all that and so let me answer some questions that are that are the\nThat was looking at here so first of all why would you delay claiming your benefits if the average person will get the same amount from Social Security regardless of when they claim\nSo the way Social Security is designed just so you know is that they're going to pay out the same dollar amount to you regardless of when you start okay so if you start at sixty two they're going to pay you a lower amount for a longer period of time\nYou start when you're sixty six they'll pay you a higher amount of money but for a shorter period of time to wait you're Seventy they'll do that even again so what happens is they actually end up paying you the same total amount\nOkay it's just depending on the time zone so therefore why would you want to take a ... why would you want to delay it why wouldn't you take your sixty two [noise]\nThe problem is that most people will not outlive will not live out an average life okay so uh you have to look at your life expectancy\nSo an average life means you live to be eighty six currently I think is the uh is is it is the life expectancy so you know I was talking to a client just the other day who whose mother is Ninety eight years old and she still drives her own car I mean she's healthy and his his brother is a eighty\nYou know and he's healthy and fine so so in his case you\nKnow we got to look at longevity and how long it's going to be so the first thing you want to look is is a is longevity and by delaying you lock up\nPermanently increased benefits for the remainder of your life and your spouse's life the second reason is if you're married as I said because then your spouse will get that higher benefit because they have the choice of whether to take their own or yours whichever is higher okay so if you delay does a higher amount that will be paid to you're surviving spouse\nSo there are reasons why you might want to delay even though the amount that you'll get in total dollars if you live to life expectancy is the same\nOkay so something for you to consider now as I mentioned uh we do specialize in in in working with people who are retired are retiring soon and we look at ah we we primarily do work in the area of retirement planning so if you are over fifty if you are retired or you are retiring sooner\nThan we are here\nFor you and our goal is to help more people in retirement than anybody else that's what we want to do [laughter] so uh if you go to our website is money matters dot net money matters dot net\nAnd or do you have two options when you're there one is you can sign up for one of our seminars\nAnd we have seminars near you and at the seminars we talk about three of the worst enemies that you are will deal with during your retirement which is a inflation and taxes or income taxes and of course bear markets we also talked about uh do you have what we call your magic number will help you to calculate\nYou have enough money to retire on\nOkay that's a big question well also talked about five strategies that you can use to reduce your income taxes when you retire we'll talk about how to maximize your cash flow okay so when you are retired it's in my opinion\nIt's all about cash flow you got to make sure you have the cash coming in to cover the lifestyle that you want and you know we call your retirement your second childhood without parental supervision\nOkay that means you've got to go play and have fun and you got to have the money to pay for all that stuff so we want to help you to figure that out we also talked about your four one K. and when should you take Social Security sixty two sixty six Seventy\nAnd and how do you plan for the next market crash what about that you know look at what happened last week you know what if this is the beginning of another beer market what do you do about that so we have the information that I think you'll find of interest so if you go to our website at his money matters dot net and you can sign up for one of our seminars and look forward to seeing you they're All right so I once again it's money matters dot net\nAll right we're going to take a break and we come back we're going to talk about hey you're a long term investor don't worry about anything yeah balder dash stay to this is money matters and I am ...\n\n\nMainly me [noise]\n\nI Am in our for ever [noise] and we are back does his money matters with Ken ... but of course I Am your host Kenmore\nRay [noise]\nYou Jack I've been a certified financial planner professional now for the last twenty marvelous wonderful and very exciting years and all of the ideas that we talked about on this show these are the very same ideas that we talk about what our blood and most valued clients\nAnd now we we work with over eight thousand four hundred families in forty three states it is a a just a an honor and privilege\nAnd we specialize in working with people who are retired or retiring soon so most of our focus is on the retirement planning and so is this show\nAnd so that's you then we're here for you and the second year in a row now money matters with Ken rape that would be our firm is a finalist were finalists or ... or the two thousand Eighteen north central Texas better Business Bureau torch award\nFor ethics which is a mouthful but basically uh we are up for it for the second year in a row as an award winner for the better Business Bureau toward toward for ethics [noise] yes and do the winters will be announced November first that the awards ceremony and I'll tell you whether we win it or not but we're\nUm I think honored just to be in the running to win it which is a a good thing because you know in our business I think ethics in in all businesses but particularly in our business I think ethics are very very important [noise]\nAnyway um we're going to talk now about the foundational philosophy that we have when we manage our clients money because we are financial advisors as I mentioned\nAnd one of the functions that we performed for our clients as we manage their money for them and what we tell them is you know that uh we're going to take care of we're going to manage your money for your job is to go and take a cruise okay we love you but get outta here [laughter]\nSee you later take off do go be be gone\nAnd we want you to not even think about your finances we want you to enjoy and we call your retirement your second childhood without parental supervision\nWe love you baby and I love you back\nAnd so you know we want our clients to be out there having fun and enjoying whatever they think of as their best retirement okay so we want that for you\nAnd uh so one of the things that we believe or to make that happen is very important is to protect the nest egg to protect the money the investments that you have built up over all the years that you were saving and and all that so that you could retire\nAnd you know as I mentioned earlier in the show and we've talked about it cash flow\nIs the primary thing that we look at when it comes to your retirement\nMeaning that we want to make sure that to the extent that we can that the income you have coming in is going to be more than the expenses you have going out and we want that to be the case for the rest of your life\nOkay so if we can do that then you had a successful retirement we've covered your cost of living and we you been able to go out and enjoy your second childhood and uh all is well\nNow cash flow is a function of\nThe amount of money you have to generate that income to generate that cash flow right so the more money you have the more cash flow you can generate the less money you have the less cash flow you can generate that that makes sense okay so therefore if a bear market comes\nAnd you lose thirty forty or fifty percent of your money like many people did and Y. two K. and in two thousand eight then what could happen is that your cash flow could be cut in half right or by whatever amount that your investments dropped and if\nThat was [noise]\nIt would be a big bummer no kidding", "year": "2018", "show_name": "Money Matters with Ken Moraif", "city": "Houston", "day": "13"}
