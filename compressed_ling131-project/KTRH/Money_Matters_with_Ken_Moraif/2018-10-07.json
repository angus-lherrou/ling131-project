{"month": "10", "state": "TX", "station": "KTRH", "content": "You've got to make sure you get it right but here's the point once you do start to make these withdrawals\nThese are called required minimum distribution the IRS tells you how much you must withdraw there is a minimum amount you must withdraw and it's required hence the name R. M. D. required minimum distribution\nWhen you begin to do it you have a choice\nYou can take the money is a single lump sum once a year or you can take the money during the year whenever you feel like it or you can do it systematically such as taking the same amount of money every month like clockwork so you get a monthly check out of your account just like you would get a Social Security check\nIt doesn't really matter Chet how you do it provided\nYou do it consistently in other words if you're going to receive a monthly check every December which you said you were doing fine go ahead and do that your dollar cost averaging in reverse you're making withdrawal every December and you'll do that for the rest of your life\nIf you wanted to do it on a more frequent basis instead of one check once a year you take twelve checks once a month that's fine to do it however you wish just make sure that whatever you choose you maintain on a consistent basis that's how you will generate the best value\nFrom a reverse dollar cost averaging perspective this way you get the average cost of the withdrawals based on the values of the count at the time what I'm more concerned about\nIs not so much whether you do it once a year or once a month I I'm really not worried about that so much the difference isn't that huge the bigger concern I have\nIs whether you're doing it in conforming ... with the IRS rules as I mentioned if you don't do it correctly you could pay a fifty percent penalty\nAnd what do I mean by doing it correctly well if you have multiple retirement accounts which most people do they've got an IRA\nMaybe his name and other Iranian her name the guide retirement accounts from several multiple employers in the past\nThe IRS generally says we only care about the total dollar value of the accounts but we separately care if any of those accounts\nWere for a one case in other words you can't take money from an IRA that was meant to be withdrawn from a four O. one K. even though you might have taken the proper amount failing to take it from the proper accounts\nCreates the penalty problem here's another concern the IRS calculation is not based on the date of the withdraw\nThis is a big mistake that people often make especially if you're withdrawing the money once every month the IRS doesn't face the calculation on when you withdraw the money they base the calculation on the value of the account on the prior December thirty one\nSo based on that you might accidentally withdraw two little\nBased on last year's market values\nConversely you could accidentally withdraw too much more than is necessary causing you to pay taxes unnecessarily\nSo the calculations are complicated the rules are cumbersome and the penalties for ever are usually not only severe but they're on yielding meaning if you try to complain to the tax court\nYour blood most likely going to lose that case\nSo we strongly encourage you to work with a financial advisor and attacks advisor\nNot only to make sure the calculations are correct but so that if there is a mistake you're advisor will alone that liability instead of you because you can hold your advisor responsible for negligence or ... or omissions\nAnd a reputable advisor will certainly stand behind their advice to say oh we told you to do it we were wrong we will make you whole not for the taxes you have to pay those but for any interest or penalties that you may incur\nSo we'll be careful make sure you get it right don't mess around when it comes to withdrawals\nOut of your account so that sounds good Rick and and we do only have two accounts and uh I Do coordinate with my accountant so good we make sure they're not the amount is right I always take out an extra two dollars [laughter]\nVery clever so that I'm Glad you got it on the money I'm Glad you're on the ball bear I Wish everybody else was to the thanks very much for your call\nWell You're welcome have a great day

Seventy and you have in the gun withdrawing money yet\nGive us a call triple a plan wreck let's make sure we get this right and let's make sure we tend to this much sooner than the deadline oh by the way you want to hear another way that people make mistakes\nThey know they have to withdraw the money by age seven eight and a half so they withdraw the money in the year that they've turned Seventy but they haven't yet reached age Seventy and a half guess what\nRift draw doesn't count so when I talk about the complexity of the rules quite frankly it's a whole thing's a a set up the rules are so complicated they're designed to trick you and trap you\nEnabling the iris to nail you with penalties these rules could be made so much simpler so much easier so much more fair that would eliminate the

H. with traffic and whether together here Scott when he was\nBut if you lose a large amount of your money in the next market downturn than I Would argue that being able to do those second childhood activities will be very difficult if you don't have the money for it\nSo therefore when we manage money for our clients we have an overarching strategy that is called by hold and sell okay meaning that we don't believe that by hold is enough you also have to have a strategy to sell\nAnd so this week I Want to talk with you about a by whole myth that is a I heard or I called because I've heard it and that is that if you sell\nYou know and we advocate if you sell your going to cash to protect your money a while you're in cash you're not going to make any money and if you don't make any money that's a bad thing\nAnd that's like the silliest thing I've ever heard but I ... well maybe not ever but I put it up there and I want to go over with you why I think that one is just really dumb okay so we'll we'll talk about that now most shows would stop right there I mean most of us would say you know if we did all that we've done more than our listening audience could possibly want from a financial show\nDoing very on beyond and\nRight do we stop right there on the show no we don't we boldly go where no financial show has gone before and therefore at about ten till we will have our state tip of the week and this week the estate tip is called a Q tip okay so this is normally we talk about how to pass on to your ...\nCD and washed undeserving airs the fruits of your labor but this week we're going to talk about how to pass it on to your uh not too you're very uh what's the opposite of greedy I'm giving [laughter]\nWashed and very deserving spouse okay and that's called a Q tip trust it says a special kind of trust designed to protect your spouse so we'll talk about that at about ten to ... to dive in before we do I just got to have a quick update you know it's interesting jak jak as my producer extraordinary [noise] um\nYou know I I'm I've kind of talked about we have this uh now seven month old puppy and this puppy now ways fifty pounds I mean this this is when you look at her she'd like a big dog and you forget that she's just a baby um and so you know but ah her name is noodle and she's a noodle so it's noodle dishes noodle\nAnd so the the update because people apparently are interested in this I don't know why\nIs that a noodle house training has progressed okay we had a moment there where it wasn't going well so now she she doesn't ever poop in the house anymore okay so that's a big plus I Would say right\nHowever and she doesn't pay however what she does do is this the mission P. thing it's awful it's like the first time she sees me she squats and ... a gallon a pee on the floor and I'm like what the heck you know\nAnd I can't stop it it's like I've tried like being outside\nAnd opening the door so she comes out to me but then she peas right on the patio and colleague I don't know how to stop this people tell me they they outgrow it eventually but I Hope so [laughter]\nAnyway so let's talk about interest rates the economy uh the jobs numbers that we saw this week uh looked pretty strong not as strong as some forecasts were expecting but still two hundred thousand jobs you know a month as what the economy is producing right now\nThere's some talk that the unemployment rate has rates so low that it can go lower than\nYou know the problem with that is that we always look at what we called the ... what's called the participants labor participation rate which is the number of people of working age that are actually working\nAnd that number is still very very low relative to history so therefore there are a lot of people that are now coming into the workforce that weren't in it and if you're not in the workforce you're not counted in the unemployment numbers so\nThat unemployment rate number the headline number is actually one that we don't really look at we look at the labor participation rate and it's still low so there's a lot of room for people to come in and start working still so the economy is strong\nAnd so the fed most likely is going to continue to raise interest rates and we've seen interest rates spike here in the last few days would that realization that we've been telling you that this is something you should be thinking about for several months now\nNow that the question I Would ask you is have you reviewed your bond portfolio if you have bonds and your portfolio and and we do we believe that bonds are part of a diversified portfolio\nUm you need to look at what's called the duration of your bond portfolio because longer term bonds bonds that are ten years Fifteen twenty thirty or bonds you no longer term bonds even longer than five years\nAs a Federal Reserve raises interest rates the value of those bonds historically has gone down now that doesn't mean it will in the future but the likelihood is very very great that as the fed raises interest rates those kind of bonds are going to lose value\nSo you need to look at your portfolio and ask yourself what do you think rates are going to do over the next year or two and a so we believe that we are actually in a bond bear market\nThe difference though is that bond markets are the death of a thousand cuts you know it's not like the stock market we're falls and crashes it's like there's this general decline that lasts for several years and that's what we're seeing\nSo as you know a a a couple of months ago we reduced\nThe direction of our bond portfolio we actually uh put half of our bond portfolio into government a cash equivalence because what happens with those is that as the fed raises interest rates the interest rate that you get in those kinds of ah accounts goes up\nAnd ... 'cause it's directly correlated and your principal is very very safe so we wanna we wanna make sure that we can\nMake money when you know as to the extent that we can make sure that we make money when the fed raises interest rates in our bonds and not lose money okay so one thing that you may want to do if you have not reviewed your bond portfolios talk to your advisor or better yet go on our website money matters dot net money matters dot net\nAnd there's a link on there that says meet with an advisor\nAnd if you click on that then uh you know we'll sit down with you and we'll talk

for the last twenty marvelous wonderful and very exciting years and all of the ideas that we talk about on the show these are the very same ideas we talk about with our ... and most valued clients\nAnd uh we are so thankful we not work with over eight thousand four hundred families in forty three states\nAnd we are a retirement planning specialist so we work primarily with people who are over the age of fifty who are retired are retiring soon and so that's you we would love to meet you and become your friend have you become a member of our family\nAnd help you to get through your retirement we call your retirement your second childhood without parental supervision so we want you to go play going to have fun and not worry about all of this boring financial stop\nNow Financial Times named our financial advisor for money matters one of the top three hundred registered investment advisors for the second time this year so we're very proud of that\nBut again without our clients we would be nowhere so thank you thank you thank you so we're gonna talk now about a topic that comes up I Would say just about every conversation we have with our clients\nAnd even with people who are in our clients who are considering it\nAnd that is Social Security okay and so one of the big questions that if you haven't started collecting Social Security that you probably have is when should I start and then there's another which is how should I collected and\nIt's very interesting but if you look at all of the different permutations of that decision whether you're widowed whether you're married difference in ages difference in income different in health all those kind of things there actually\nEight thousand combinations of that the answer to that question how how and when I take my Social Security and what's crazy is that one of those is yours [laughter]\nSo how do you figure that oh well I mean I'm thinking right it could be just one maybe there's more than one but it seems to me there's only one that's right for you so you got to figure that one out and it's not easy and it's complicated you know our advisors in our firm we put him we we have in fact the starting next week we're putting them through intensive training\nI mean it's it's someone who spend their time learning about Social Security still has to stay up on it the laws changed I mean it's it's it's complicated\nAnd so for you and I'm Talking about you ladies and gentlemen listen to the show as a lay person that doesn't do this for a living you know I Would say that the odds are stacked against you that you're going to make the right decision so be that as it may\nI Want to help you to have some of the criteria you should be thinking about so one of the questions would be you know should I wait till I'm Seventy\nAnd start claim Social Security then now just to set the stage Social Security you can actually\nStart when you're sixty two assuming you qualify so you can take six or start taking Social Security at age sixty two but if you wait for every year that you wait the benefit that you're going to receive increases and from sixty six through Seventy it increases by eight percent per year\nThe benefit that you received us okay so\nIt there's an incentive there to wake because the benefit is larger however you're giving up the money while you're waiting so there's a disincentive to so there's some math involved in that\nBut let me give you generally what we believe to be the reasons why you may want to wait you're Seventy okay one big reason is that when you die your spouse has a choice of getting your Social Security or there's whichever is the higher okay\nSo if you are in bad health or or something where you have a low life expectancy\nThan it may make sense for you to wait till you're Seventy because band the benefit that you'll receive will be the highest and then upon your debt your spouse will take over that benefit and get that highest amount and so that's one big reason why you may want to another reason that you may want to hear that you know you don't need the money\nBut as I always tell clients when they say that as well if you don't need the money then started taking it a sixty six and just give it to me [laughter] if you don't want and I'll take it [laughter]\nBut uh anyway yeah so if if you feel that the you know you don't need the money you may want to wait because also one of the things that can happen is that your spouse can collect half of yours and if you both weight than the benefit that you get at Seventy could be a lot higher as well\nSo there are some reasons to wait until you're Seventy generally speaking though they are few there there's very few reasons why sixty six is normally the best time to take\nBut are there are reasons to take it at Seventy now if you are over fifty if you are retired or retiring soon if you are within five years of retirement or five years after retirement that ten year period\nThan we want to talk with you OK we want to help you to build your plan we want to help you to look at your cash flow we want to help you to make important decisions that you need to make with your retirement\nSo here you got two options won it and they all start with going to our website which is money matters dot net okay so the website is money matters dot net now while you're there you
