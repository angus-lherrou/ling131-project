buffet only FCC's prices and participation very taxes and drinks excluded restrictions apply\n[noise]\nThe leaders\nFurniture made in America studios use radio seven forty Katie our age abused and and I are the radio station Houston\nIn view of our philosophy so because we work with people who are mostly retired retiring soon our philosophy of how to manage your money is preservation of principle comes first okay we want to grow your money certainly we want to give you the income all those things are important but first and foremost we want to make sure that we protect your principal\nBecause for you to be able to go out and enjoy the all the things that you want in your retirement if you get hit by a big bad bear and it takes down twenty thirty or fifty percent of your money you know that's going to change a lot for you so I'm going to ask you the question the average bear market and this is according to net Davis research going back\nTo the great depression the average bear market\nIs a loss of thirty seven percent\nOkay so it's an average now two thousand and eight the S. and P. went down to fifty seven percent in in Y. two K. it went down forty nine percent so those were bigger than average so but let's just go with the average thirty seven percent\nSo I'm gonna ask you a question which I'll answer later on in the show but I'll kind of leave it with you a and the question is if you if you had to of course you don't want to but if you had to\nWould you prefer to lose thirty seven percent of your money at age sixty\nOr at age Seventy five\nWhich one do you think would be better age sixty or Seventy five and a if you answer like most people do you got it wrong [laughter] so so we'll talk about that now you know what jak motion\nThat actually stopped there that's a ... show that is chock full of great in though right and that's how most cells would just stop there but on the show do we only go where people expect us to\nOf course we don't we boldly go where no financial show has gone before and therefore at about ten till we're going to have our state tip of the week\nAnd normally that's you know that's the part of the shall we talk about how to pass onto your greedy and washed undeserving airs the fruits of your labor but this week we're going to talk about how to educate your greedy and washed undeserving heirs and so we're going to talk about paying for college and not having to pay a gift tax okay because the IRS\n[laughter] [noise] yeah those guys they want the tax gift and college in most cases is more is is is expensive\nAnd you don't want to have to pay a gift tax so I Want to dive into everything but I Want to have a quick thing that I Want to share with you um money matters and and my family we are a a we think the boys and girls clubs as one as a charity that ah you know really helps young people to it to become\nSolid citizens go to college all those kinds of things contribute to society in a positive way have a better life and so we are a benefactors of that and over the last\nSix years are the boys and girls clubs we've we've ... sponsored a program that's called a sponsor a child [laughter] and uh so we we want to raise money for that and last\nWeekend we had the gala at uh in in Plano in North Dallas and uh we raised over a three hundred thousand dollars in the sponsor a child which was really phenomenal and now six years of doing that we've raised over two and a half million dollars for the boys and girls clubs\n[noise] and uh it is it is [noise]\nIt is really really something it's amazing how\nYou know if you put some energy into something good things can happen well let's talk about two thousand seven\nUm you know are we we have as I mentioned they sell strategy or we don't believe that by and hold is enough that you should also have a cell strategy and it's because the people that we work with primarily are you know wanting that they work their entire life you've you've saved and everything and now you're retired and you're living on that money and you can't you know you got to preserve it\nAnd so our philosophy is is mostly defensive okay we want to preserve that we have to be able to grow it in the future\nAnd so you know with our by holding cells or philosophy we have certain criteria that says it's time to get out of the stock market and as I record this we haven't reached that yet so don't don't don't panic yet uh but this is very reminiscent to me of two thousand seven\nAnd what I mean by that is that you know one of the things that that kind of happens is that uh I guess I'm I'm human and I want to be a hundred percent accurate whenever we do something\nAnd so what happens is that you know when you get close to your cell signal where you're about to pull the trigger and say okay we're going to get out of the stock market you want to be right you know you don't like being wrong obviously\nA and if you're wrong you know we're in for example in two thousand Fifteen and two thousand eleven our strategy said to sell both of those were very very near to bury markets but they actually missed it by a little bit and where and and so technically those were you know bad calls if you will\nBut if we had to do it again we would you know the market went down Nineteen percent and two thousand eleven so that's not too bad the ... the U.S and pay 'em\nBut be that as it may\nThose two which we call false alarms I was very convicted that that was the right thing I was like yes our strategy is right it's going to kill it we're going to be right this time perfect wonderful I'm Glad we're getting out\nAnd are those turned out to be near misses or they were close to a bear market but they weren't and the market to rebound quickly after that but in in uh in November of two thousand seven\nWhen that one came I was like oh no I Hope we don't you know I didn't want to sell because it felt like the economy was generally okay it's not like things were generally okay there was a lot of bad news everywhere you know it was the new news wasn't great but it wasn't terrible\nAnd so I was very feeling now I don't want to you know but of course we did and we we follow or discipline up and then the same thing is how I feel now\nYou know you look at it we just got GDP numbers that looked pretty good you've got a you know the consumers and this and that and generally the all the indicators tell you things are are looking good right now\nBut yet our indicators telling us that we are close to getting ready to sell and I don't want to sell when things are looking good you know I don't want to be wrong but what's interesting is that that's how I felt to two thousand seven and of course that's so maybe I have a contrary indicator when I think it's right and wrong and what I think it's wrong I'm right\nOr it's right anyway whatever\nPoint being ladies and gentlemen is that if you are retired are retiring soon do you even have a strategy to protect yourself and the next market crash what if this is the market crash what if we're about to go into a trade war with China which I think we are now I've changed my mind I think we're going there\nAnd if that happens we can see the market go down to another two or three thousand points from here or maybe more if it's an average bear market it could go down another seven thousand points from here\nAnd are you going to stay in for that do you have a plan to address that if you don't you should be talking to one of our advisors are coming to one of our seminars to learn more about it okay I don't want you to get caught in this\nAnd so here's what you do you go to our website it's money matters dot net money matters dot net\nAnd click on a link that says meet with an advisor or

work with over a thousand four hundred families in forty three states we are blessed we are honored\nAnd in two thousand Fifteen Forbes named our financial advisory for money matters one of the top

to our website it as money matters dot net money matters dot net and when you were there we have a everything we can think of to put on the website to help you to plan your retirement okay so do their mind about Social Security estate planning all that kind of stuff\nWell this is the second to the show where I normally talk about Social Security so let's do that so here's a question uh can you enroll in Medicare at sixty five\nRefrain from claiming Social Security until Seventy and still receive delayed credits meaning you know if you wait till you're Seventy\nWhat happens is is that the amount of your benefit goes up each year that your weight by about eight percent so if you're sixty six you wait till Seventy the benefit you're going to receive from Social Security uh journals for years goes up about thirty two percent which is a pretty good increase so the question is it by enroll in Medicare at sixty five\nBut I don't collect so screwed I wait till I'm Seventy well I still get those eight percent delayed credits the answer is yes okay so you can take Medicare without Social Security but not\nThe other way around okay if you file for Social Security you must enroll in Medicare part a All right so a second question\n[noise] um this one is a a a person who has never applied for Social Security and is eighty years old\nAnd he applied for retroactive benefits okay so you never applied you waited Fifteen escape twenty Fifteen Years okay so if you apply is now well his benefit including adjustment to make up for the last benefits\nAnd the answer is that uh the you can get\nSix months of retroactive benefits but that's all okay so he's not going to be able to go back and get fourteen years' worth but he can get six six six months' worth and it might come to it could be ten thousand dollars or more you know if you think about it six months at age eighty um with all the delayed credits that went to late Seventy\nUm one more question we have time for yeah okay so can apply is kind of person born in Nineteen fifty to repay his Social Security benefits to rent a receipt to date and then re file to obtain a higher current pay out okay so\nIt's my understanding that uh I can do so but ah I went to the local Social Security office and they said they didn't even understand my question [laughter]\nThat's good so here's the answer if it's been lasted twelve months since you filed you can withdraw your application to repay your benefits and re file okay so there's no need to go down and asked\nThe local Social Security administration worker okay you just file essay\nForm five Twenty one so so if you're if you're if it's been less than twelve months since you filed you can get you can repay what they paid you and then re filed later All right so that's funny I I asked them and they didn't even understand the question\nHas this talk will Tom I Am too so um as I mentioned uh we are a firm that specializes in retirement planning so all the things that are that requires we want to help you with so uh we have seminars that I'd like for you to go to because\nAt the seminar we talk about do you have enough money to retire on we call that a magic number

how to maximize your cash flow alright so once you retire you want to get income from your investments where'd you get it from that kind of stuff\nOr we want to talk about should you roll over your four O. one K. um when should you take Social Security when you're sixty two when you're sixty six when you're Seventy when's the best time to do that\nWe want to talk about the fact that the IRS\n[noise]\nMan she's afraid of that IRS guy [laughter] I Can't blame her or the IRS once the tax eighty five percent of your Social Security benefits did you know that eighty five percent\nSo we
