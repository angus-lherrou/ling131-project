H. trafficking\nWhether together here Steven top heavy traffic\nAnd so I Want to take you this uh this week on on this show on that journey but I'll apply it to you because I think the the life lessons that you can learn\nIn terms of having a business is going to endure for a hundred years or longer or the same life lessons that you can apply in your personal life and in your financial life and then you're investing life because we're a financial advisor ...\nSo it'll it sounds kind of a you know philosophical this week but I think we're going to I'll bring it home to where you can use it in your life but I think also the lessons that we can learn from it will be will be good All right so the first thing then is I Want to tell you as a as a from\nWhat we've decided that we have to go so I think in life for you to be able to progress in a way that helps you to be happy\nThat helps you to achieve what you want I think you have to set goals you have to say what are the things that I Want to accomplish so in a financial advisory firm that would be you know what our what's our mission statement what our two goals and for us the two goals are now we want our clients to have financial peace of mind\nThat's number one we want them to relax we call your retirement your second childhood without parental supervision okay so we want to make sure that uh you have financial peace of mind but then secondly we want your money to last as long as you do\nOkay so our financial goal there is that and philosophically how that would apply to you\nIs that\nWhen you retire we specialized work with people who are retired retiring soon so when you retire ... it's it's easy to be in the same mode that you've been for the last Thirty years as you've been accumulating which is growth mode\nAnd while growing is important keeping the growth that you have accumulated is now even more important okay because if you suddenly take a huge loss like in a bear market or something like that or\nMake a bad beer or a financial decision you make a mistake you do something you invest badly then what could happen is that you will not achieve the goals that we have right one is\nPeace of mind financially [laughter] if you just lost your money you're you're you're not financially have peace of mind and then secondly to your money last as long as you do it can be hard to do that if you take large losses\nSo that ties directly into our whole philosophy of managing money for clients and I think it should be your so if you're retired or retiring suits you should be thinking in that mode so how do you build a company that's going to last a hundred years how you build something that indoors and and and in your life it could be how do you build a legacy that indoors\nWell the important thing is that you need to have what ... what are what what I've called core values what are the things that you scan for\nYou know what are the things that you said these are ... and they stand the test of time in other words a hundred years from now they will be as true then as they are today\nAnd in your family what I Would say is these are your morals these are what you your your values you know what what what makes what what what are your beliefs what are the things that you teach your kids your grandchildren that are important if they're going to have a successful life\nOkay so in our for our we have ten core values and I just want to tell you about core value number one first and then a core value number six a core value number one is\nThe right thing to do is always the right thing to do this one was taught to me by my mom and every time I talk to my mom and I had a moral dilemma I had a question like that her answer\nWas Kenny the right thing to do is always the right thing to do and I hated her for doing that because I wanted her to give me the answer and she would say if if you have to ask you already know what the answer is you already know what the right thing to do is just do that and you'll always be okay so that's the first thing\nAlways do the right thing to do is always the right thing to do\nThis the core value number six is never sacrificed honesty for growth\nAnd what I mean by that is you know everybody wants to grow everybody wants to succeed everybody wants to you know have more money or have more prestige or you know I have a successful family or whatever it may be but never ever ever since the sacrifice honesty in the pursuit of that\nNow in our world is a financial advisory firm you know I think it's all about your ethics it's about ... never putting somebody else in front of you it's about what helps somebody else eventually will help you in the in the process and not disclosing everything\nOffice skating the truth promising returns that you can't deliver all those kinds of things are not telling somebody about the downside of what their their investment strategy is all those kinds of things are sacrificing honesty for growth and if you do that will happen is eventually it'll come back to get you\nYou know so in in your life when you're looking at\nHow how do I get from one place to another you want to you want to improve your career you want to do something you know ... if you if you sacrifice honesty and the pursuit of whatever that is it will eventually catch up with you and you and you know if it's for example just if you lied on your resume to get a job\nAnd you did get the job eventually they'll figure out that you lied on the resume and they'll fire you for it so sacrificing honesty to get the growth that you want\nNever works in the long run I mean it it just doesn't and it doesn't in our world either so we have a very strict policy that you will never sacrificed honesty\nTo to get a new client or to keep a client or whatever we disclose everything warts and all we want you to know everything about us we want to know all the fees involved we want to know what's wrong with what we do what's right with what we do so you make a fully informed decision and we never have to apologize for anything [noise]\nNow one of the things that uh I Am not going to apologize for is that we would like to have you if you are\nThe person that we specialize in working with as a client son to do some selling here or if you are over fifty if you are retired are

rape\n[noise]\nThank you Jack I have been in the financial services business now for twenty nine years and I've been a certified financial planner for the last\nNineteen marvelous wonderful and very exciting years at every single one of them has had a character of its own and they've all been different and they've all been that and this year is no exception and uh so we currently work with over a thousand families\nThat we [laughter]\nYeah yes and in forty three states which is a insane and also a you know recently uh barons named why you're faithful host one of the top one hundred\nFinancial advisors in the United states actually for the six year in a row and uh I Know for a fact that if it wasn't for our clients they wouldn't even know who I Am barons\nAnd so therefore all your clients are listening right now thank you and those of you who are not clients I appreciate you listening also now on this program where we are talking about\nOur philosophy of a of a business and I think that are the philosophy of of running a business\nIs the same philosophy that you can apply in your own life and so I think that to this week's up this week's show it was a little bit different than what I normally do but I thought it would be beneficial for those of you listening to kind of get some\nSome some of my thoughts of of uh of how you do that and and to kind of frame it\nAs I mentioned we we work with a thousand families and if you think about how many people that is\nYou know when you think of a family of grandparents do your children and grandchildren and great grandchildren I mean ... and and spouses of all those people and and all of a sudden you're talking about a lot of people that we are responsible for helping with their finances and helping guide them and all those kinds of things\nAnd so it it dawned on me a few years ago that a ... grows we had the responsibility to make sure that our firm stays around you know the whole thing is you don't want your financial adviser for him to die before you do\nSo [laughter]\nSo therefore uh we create it will be called vision one hundred which is we want our firm to be as strong or stronger than it is today a hundred years from now\nAnd if that's the case then uh you know our clients that we're currently serving will be taken care of and so will there down line family members et cetera et cetera so how do you do that well you have to build a company that has enduring core values just as a result of my studying of lots of companies that have succeeded to last over a hundred years\nAnd I think families so to apply this to you personally\nFamilies that have succeeded that have been healthy and have endured as well over the years are ones that have very strong morals and values that they all it here too\nAnd those are taught from one generation to the next parent teachers child child teaches a grant or their child et cetera et cetera\nAnd so I Want to share with you core value number nine okay so core value number nine is make a client every day that is our noble obligation\n[noise] so what does that mean well that sounds kind of like okay we'll go out and sell something and and it is I Do believe that we do need to have new clients obviously and and the reason why I Do that is because I think what we do as noble if we help people to be financially secure I think that's very noble what we do but in a broader context and how you would apply to in your life\nYou know I I my wife and I are about to celebrate our thirty third year of marriage\nAnd I believe in making my wife\nMy wife all over again\nEvery time I every time with her\nOkay I make her a client every day my goal is to make her my wife again every day I never take for granted that because we're married you know the old song that you know I I don't need to keep telling you I Love you all the time I told you that back then if it changes I'll tell you okay\nSo now you gotta keep keep doing that making a client every day so we visit with a client when they come in to visit with us we want them to leave feeling like you know what I made the right decision in choosing money matters we want anybody that comes to ah talk to us that does not inclined to say you know what I Want to be a client\nSo in your life with your family with your friends your business associates make them a client every time it's your noble obligation what you do is noble and therefore you should take the time\nTo have that person understand that every single time don't ever take anybody for granted anything for granted because the moment you do as in a marriage you take a marriage for granted guess what that marriage will go way you take your children for granted your children will go away\nYou take your health for granted it'll go away All right so don't take anything for granted make yourself healthy everyday strengthen your relationships everyday everything and that's why we believe is our noble obligation to make a client every day so that's our core value number not\nNow one of the things I'd like to invite you to do is to become a client of money matters if you are not and what you can do is you can go to our website it as money matters dot net is our website money matters dot net\nAnd you have three things that you can do their alright what one is you can get my ... e mail ...\nIt's free goes out at least

knowledgeable and they will help you to build your financial plan and I will do all that at no charge or obligation and if it helps you fantastic\nAnd if it doesn't you know what that's fine too we will part French\nAnd then finally you if you don't want to do any of those things that you can also do a third thing which is you can go to one of our seminars and over the years we've had thousands of people attend our seminars\nAnd uh I think they have enjoyed them and you can learn about your retirement planning your a diversification Social Security all those kinds of things and the ... and
