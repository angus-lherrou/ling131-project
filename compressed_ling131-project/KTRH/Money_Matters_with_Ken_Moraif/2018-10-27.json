station\nAt least eleven are dead and tips birds from Sally Adams four o'clock on news radio seven\nTo the great depression the average bear market\nIs the loss of thirty seven percent okay so it's an average now two thousand and eight the S. and P. went down to fifty seven percent in in Y. two K. it went down forty nine percent so those were bigger than average so but let's just go with the average thirty seven percent\nSo I'm gonna ask you a question which I'll answer later on in the show but I kind of leave it with you a and the question is if you if you had to of course you don't want to but if you had to\nWould you prefer to lose thirty seven percent of your money at age sixty\nOr at age Seventy five\nWhich one do you think would be better age sixty or Seventy five and a if you answer like most people do you got it wrong [laughter]\nSo so we'll talk about that now you know what jak most shows would actually stop there that's a\n... the show that is chock full of great in though right and so most children just stop there but on the show do we only go where people expect us to of course we don't we boldly go where no financial show has gone before and therefore at about ten till we're going to have our state tip of the week\nAnd normally that's you know that's part of the show we talk about how to pass onto your greedy and washed undeserving airs the fruits of your labor but this week we're going to talk about how to educate your greedy and washed undeserving heirs and so we're going to talk about paying for college and not having to\nPay a gift tax okay because the IRS [noise]\nYeah those guys they want the tax gift and college in most cases is more is is is expensive\nYou don't want to have to pay a gift tax so I Want to dive into everything but I Want to have a quick thing that I Want to share with you um money matters and and my family we are uh uh\nWe think the boys and girls clubs is one is a charity that uh you know really helps young people to it to become\nSolid citizens go to college all those kinds of things contribute to society in a positive way have a better life and so we are a benefactors of that and over the last six years are the boys and girls clubs we've we've done sponsored a program that's called a sponsor a child [laughter]\nAnd uh so we we want to raise money for that and last weekend we had the gala at uh in in Plano in North Dallas and uh\nWe raised over a three hundred thousand dollars in the sponsor a child which was really phenomenal and now six years of doing that we've raised over two and a half million dollars for the boys and girls clubs\n[noise] and uh it is it is\nIt is really really something it's amazing how\nYou know if you put some energy into something good things can happen well let's talk about two thousand seven\nUm you know are we we have as I mentioned they sell strategy or we don't believe that by and hold is enough that you should also have a cell strategy and it's because the people that we work with primarily are you know wanting that they work their entire life you've you've saved and everything and now you're retired and you're living on that money and you can't you know you got to preserve it\nAnd so our philosophy is is mostly defensive okay we want to preserve will be have to be able to grow it in the future\nAnd so you know with our by holding cells up last iffy we have certain criteria that says it's time to get out of the stock market and as I record this we haven't reached that yet so don't don't don't panic yet uh but this is very reminiscent to me of two thousand seven\nAnd what I mean by that is that you know one of the things that that kind of happens is that uh I guess I'm I'm human and I want to be a hundred percent accurate whenever we do something\nAnd so what happens is that you know when you get close to your cell signal where you're about to pull the trigger and say okay we're going to get out of the stock market you want to be right you know you don't like being wrong obviously\nA and if you're wrong you know we're in for example in two thousand Fifteen and two thousand eleven our strategy said to sell both of those were very very near to bear markets but they actually missed it by a little bit and where and\nAnd so technically those were you know bad calls if you will but if we had to do it again we would you know the market went down Nineteen percent in two thousand eleven so that's not too bad the ... the U.S and pay\n'em but be that as it may\nThose two which we call false alarms I was very convicted that that was the right thing I was like yes our strategy is right it's going to kill it we're going to be right this time perfect wonderful I'm Glad we're getting out and are those turned out to be near misses or they were close to a bear market but they weren't\nAnd the market rebounded quickly after that but in in uh in November of two thousand seven\nWhen that one came I was like oh no I Hope we don't you know I didn't want to sell because it felt like the economy was generally okay it felt like things were generally okay there wasn't a lot of bad news everywhere\nYou know it was the news wasn't great but it wasn't terrible and so I was very feeling that want to you know but of course we did and we we follow or discipline\nOf and in the same thing is how I feel now\nYou know you look at it we just got GDP numbers or look pretty good you've got a you know the consumers and this and that and generally the all the indicators tell you things are are looking good right now\nBut yet our indicators telling us that we are close to getting ready to sell and I don't want to sell when things are looking good you know I don't want to be wrong but what's interesting is that that's how I felt to two thousand seven and of course so maybe I have a contrary indicator when I think it's right and wrong and what I think it's wrong I'm right\nOr it's right anyway whatever\nPoint being ladies and gentlemen is that if you are retired are retiring soon do you even have a strategy to protect yourself from the next market crash what if this is the market crash what if we're about to go into a trade war with China which I think we are now I'll change my mind I think we're going there\nAnd if that happens we could see the market go down to another two or three thousand points from here or maybe more if it's an average bear market it could go down another seven thousand points from here and are you going to stay in for that you have a plan to address that if you don't you should be talking to one of our advisors are coming to one of our seminars to learn more about it okay I don't want you to get caught in this\nAnd so here's what you do you go to our website it's money matters

been a certified financial planner professionally for the last twenty marvelous wonderful and very exciting years and all of the ideas that we talk about on the show these are the same ideas that we talk about with our blood and most valued clients Satan lead do\nAnd uh you know we are a firm that specializes in retirement planning and us so we we primarily work with people who are over the age of fifty who are retired are retiring soon\nAnd we currently work with over a thousand four hundred families in forty three states we are blessed we are honored\nAnd in two thousand Fifteen Forbes named our financial advisory for money matters one of the top one hundred wealth managers\nAnd uh that's a thing we're proud of but without our clients we ... probably wouldn't even have noticed we were on the map so thank you all your clients that are listening to the show and those of you or not yeah there you go as well kissed\nFor those of you are not clients or if you're over fifty if you're retired or retiring soon\nI invite you to go to our website it as money matters dot net money matters dot net and when you're there we have a everything we can think of to put on the website to help you to plan your retirement okay so go their mind about Social Security estate planning all that kind of stuff\nWell this is a segment a show where I normally talk about Social Security so let's do that so here's a question uh can you enroll in Medicare at sixty five\nRefrain from claiming Social Security until Seventy and still receive delayed credits meaning you know if you wait till you're Seventy\nWhat happens is is that the amount of your benefit goes up each year that you wait by about eight percent so\nIf you're sixty six you wait till Seventy the benefit you're going to receive from Social Security of journals for years goes up about thirty two percent which is a pretty good increase\nSo the question is if I enroll in Medicare at sixty five but I don't collect so screwed I wait till I'm Seventy well I still get those eight percent delayed credits the answer is yes okay so you can take Medicare without Social Security but not\nThe other way around okay if you file for Social Security you must enroll in Medicare part a All right so a second question\n[noise] um this one is a a a a person who has never applied for Social Security and is eighty years old\nAnd he applied for retroactive benefits okay so you never applied you waited Fifteen escape twenty Fifteen Years okay so if you apply now well his benefit including adjustment to make up for the last benefits\nAnd the answer is that uh the you can get\nSix months of retroactive benefits but that's all okay so he's not going to be able to go back and get fourteen years' worth but he can get six six six months worth and it might come to it could be ten thousand dollars or more you know to think about it six months that age eighty um with all the delayed credits that went to late Seventy\nUm one more question we have time for yeah okay so can apply is kind of person born in Nineteen fifty to repay his Social Security benefits to ... or received to date and then re filed to obtain a higher current pay out\nOkay so it's my understanding that uh I can do so but ah I went to the local Social Security office and they said they didn't even understand my question [laughter]\nThat's good so here's the answer if it's been lasted twelve months since you filed\nYou can withdraw your application to repay your benefits and re file okay so there's no need to go down and asked the local Social Security administration worker okay you just file ss they form five Twenty one\nSo so if you're if you're if it's been less than twelve months since you filed you can get you can repay what they paid you and then re filed later alright\nSo uh that's funny I I asked them and they didn't even understand the question\nHas this talk with Tom I Am too so um as I mentioned uh we are a firm that specializes in retirement planning so all the things that ah that requires we want to help you with so uh we have seminars that I'd like for you to go to because\nAt the seminar we talk about do you

income taxes during your retirement\nWe're going to talk about how to maximize your cash flow alright so once you retire you want to get income from your investments where'd you get it from that kind of stuff\nOr we want to talk about should you roll over your four one K. um when should you take Social Security when you're sixty two when you're sixty six when you're Seventy when's the best time to do that we want to talk about the fact that the IRS\n[noise]\nMan she's afraid of that IRS guy [laughter] I Can't blame her or the IRS once attacked eighty five percent of your Social Security benefits did you know that eighty five percent\nSo we want to [noise] I agree\nAnd you know we want to show you how to beat that if it is a tall\nPossible we want to talk about diversification or how
