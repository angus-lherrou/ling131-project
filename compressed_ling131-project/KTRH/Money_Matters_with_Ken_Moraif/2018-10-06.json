here's\nMichael Moore about westbound Hi Ken it's\nAnd so this week I Want to talk with you about a by whole myth that is a I heard or I've called because I've heard it and that is that if you sell\nYou know and we advocate if you sell your going to cash to protect your money a while you're in cash you're not going to make any money and if you don't make any money that's a bad thing\nAnd that's like the silliest thing I've ever heard but I ... well maybe not ever but I put it up there and I want to go with you why I think that one is just really dumb okay so we'll we'll talk about that now most shows would stop right there I mean most of us would say you know if we did all that we've\nDone more than our listening audience could possibly want from a financial shell joined very on beyond and buses right do we stop right there on the show no we don't we boldly go where no financial show has gone before and therefore at about ten till we will have our state tip of the week\nAnd this week the estate tip is called a Q tip okay so this is normally we talk about how to pass onto your greedy and washed undeserving airs the fruits of your labor but this week we're going to talk about how to pass it on to your uh not too you're very\nUh what's the opposite of greedy I'm giving [laughter]\nWashed and very deserving spouse okay and that's called a Q tip trust it's a special kind of trust designed to protect your spouse so we'll talk about that about ten to ... to dive in before we do I just got to have a quick update you know it's interesting Jack Jack is my producer extraordinary [noise]\nUm you know I I'm a kind of talked about we have this uh now seven month old puppy and just puppy now ways fifty pounds I mean this this is when you look at her she'd like a big dog and you forget that she's just a baby um and so you know but ah her name is noodle and she's a noodle so it's new\nOldest noodle and so the the update 'cause people apparently are interested in this I don't know why or is that a noodle house training has progressed okay we had a moment there where it wasn't going well so now she she doesn't ever poop in the house anymore okay so that's a big plus I Would say right\nHowever and she doesn't pee however what she does do is this the mission P. thing\nIt's awful it's like the first time she sees me she squats and boom a gallon a pee on the floor and I'm like what the heck\nYou know and I can't stop it it's like I've tried like being outside\nAnd opening the door so she comes out to me but then she peas right on the patio and his colleague I don't know how to stop this people tell me they they outgrow it eventually but I Hope so [laughter]\nAnyway so let's talk about interest rates the economy uh the jobs numbers that we saw this week uh looked pretty strong not as strong as some forecasts were expecting but still two hundred thousand jobs you know a month is what the economy is producing right now\nThere's some talk that the unemployment rate has rates so low that it can go lower that\nYou know the problem with that is that we always look at what we called the ... what's called the participants labor participation rate which is the number of people of working age that are actually working\nAnd that number is still very very low relative to history so therefore there are a lot of people that are now coming into the workforce that weren't in it and if you're not in the workforce you're not counted in the unemployment numbers\nSo that unemployment rate number the headline number is actually one that we don't really look at we look at the labor participation rate and it's still low so there's a lot of room for\nPeople to come in and start working still so the economy is strong and so the fed most likely is going to continue to raise interest rates and we've seen interest rates spike here in the last few days would that realization now we've been telling you that this is something you should be thinking about for several months now\nNow the the question I Would ask you is have you reviewed your bond portfolio if you have bonds and your portfolio and and we do we believe that bonds are part of a diversified portfolio\nUm you need to look at what's called the duration of your bond portfolio because longer term bonds bonds that are ten years Fifteen twenty thirty or bonds you no longer term bonds even longer than five years\nAs a Federal Reserve raises interest rates the value those bonds historically has gone down now that doesn't mean it will in the future but the likelihood is very very great that as the fed raises interest rates those kind of bonds are going to lose value\nSo you need to look at your portfolio and ask yourself what do you think rates are going to do over the next year or two and a so we believe that we are actually in a bond bear market the difference though is that bond markets are the death of a thousand cuts you know it's not like the stock market we're falls and crashes\nIt's like there's this general decline that lasts for several years and that's what we're seeing so as you know a ... a couple of months ago we\nReduce the direction of our bond portfolio we actually uh put half of our bond portfolio into government a cash equivalent because what happens with those is that as the fed raises interest rates the interest rate that you get in those kinds of accounts goes up\nAnd ... because it's directly correlated and your principal is very very safe so we want we want to make sure that we can\nMake money when you know as to the extent that we can make sure that we make money when the fed raises interest rates in our bonds and not lose money okay so one thing that you may want to do if you have not reviewed your bond portfolios talk to your advisor or better yet go on our website money matters dot net money matters dot net\nAnd there's a link on there that says meet with an advisor and if you click on that than oh you know we'll sit down with you and we'll talk about how to create a you know a plan for your future for your retirement okay and part of that is looking at your cash flow part of that

professional for the last twenty marvelous wonderful and very exciting years and all of the ideas that we talk about on the show these are the very same ideas we talk about with our ... and most valued clients\nAnd uh we are so thankful we not work with over eight thousand four hundred families in forty three states\nAnd we are a retirement planning specialist so we work primarily with people who are over the age of fifty who are retired are retiring soon and so that's you we would love to meet you and become your friend have you become a member of our family\nAnd help you to get through your retirement we call your retirement your second childhood without parental supervision so we want you to go play going to have fun and not worry about all of this boring financial stuff\nNow Financial Times named our financial advisory for money matters one of the top three hundred registered investment advisors for the second time this year so we're very proud of that\nBut again without our clients we would be nowhere so thank you thank you thank you so we're gonna talk now about a topic that comes up I Would say just about every conversation we have with our clients\nAnd even with people who are in our clients who are considering it and that is Social Security okay and so one of the big questions that if you haven't started collecting Social Security that you probably have is when should I start\nAnd then there's another which is how should I collect it and\nIt's very interesting but if you look at all of the different permutations of that decision whether you're widowed whether you're married difference in ages different state income different in health all those kinds of things there actually eight thousand combinations of\nThat the answer to that question how how and when I take my Social Security and what's crazy is that one of those is yours [laughter]\nSo how do you figure that oh well I mean I'm thinking right it could be just one maybe there's more than one but it seems to me there's only one that's right for you so you got to figure that one out and it's not easy it and I mean it's complicated\nYou know our advisors in our farm we put a we we have in fact the starting next week we're putting them through intensive training I mean it's it's someone who spend their time learning about Social Security still has to stay up on it the laws change I mean it's it's it's complicated\nAnd so for you and I'm Talking about you ladies and gentlemen listen to the show as a lay person that doesn't do this for a living you know I Would say that the odds are stacked against you that you're going to make the right decision so be that as it may\nI Want to help you to have some of the criteria you should be thinking about so one of the questions would be you know should I wait until I'm Seventy\nAnd start collect Social Security then now just to set the stage Social Security you can actually\nStart when you're sixty two assuming you qualify\nYou can take six or start taking Social Security at age sixty two but if you wait for every year that you wait the benefit that you're going to receive increases and from sixty six through Seventy it increases by eight percent per year\nThe benefit that you received us okay so\nIt there's an incentive there to wake because the benefit is larger however you're giving up the money while you're waiting so there's a disincentive to so there's some math involved in that\nBut let me give you generally what we believe to be the reasons why you may want to wait you're Seventy okay one big reason is that when you die your spouse has a choice of getting your Social Security or there's whichever is the higher okay\nSo if you are in bad health or or something where you have a low life expectancy\nThan it may make sense for you to wait till you're Seventy because then the benefit that you'll receive will be the highest and then upon your death your spouse will take over that benefit and get that highest amount and so that's one big reason why you may want to another reason that you may want to is that you know you don't need the money\nBut as I always tell clients when they say that as well if you don't need the money then started taking it a sixty six and just give it to me [laughter] if you don't want and I'll take it [laughter] but uh anyway yeah so if if you feel that the you know you don't need the money you may want to wait because also one of the things that can happen is that your spouse\nCan collect half of yours and if you both weight than the benefit that you get at Seventy could be a lot higher as well\nSo there are some reasons to wait till you're Seventy generally speaking though they are few there there's very few reasons why sixty six is normally the best time to take\nBut are there are reasons to take it at Seventy now if you are over fifty if you are retired or retiring soon if you are within five years of retirement or five years after retirement that ten year period\nThan we want to talk with you OK we want to help you to build your plan we want to help you to look at your cash flow we want to help you to make important decisions that you need to make with your retirement so\nHere you got two options won it and they all start with going to our website which is money matters dot net okay so the website is money matters dot net now while you're there you can either decide you want to visit directly with an advisor and if you click on meat with an advisor we'll call you will scheduled time to visit\nAnd we want to look at a your entire financial life we want to look at from ages eat and we want to help you make the decisions that uh you know we don't advise you on that and help you to make those decisions and if you if you like what you see and you want to work with us fantastic and if you don't that's that's great I mean that's fine too there's no problem no charge no obligation and we will part friends\nHow to say I think we except they thank you\nAnd you know what Frankie you are welcome we would love to do\nThat now also if you don't want to visit directly with an adviser you can go to one of our seminars and I'm going to give you what I perceived to be the biggest reason why you should go to one of our seminars and that is that at the seminars we will have are now world famous oatmeal raisin in chocolate chunk cookies\nAnd these cookies they're happening stick their six inches in diameter plump juicy yellow raisins with send them in the batter oh my gosh they're so good you will learn about your
