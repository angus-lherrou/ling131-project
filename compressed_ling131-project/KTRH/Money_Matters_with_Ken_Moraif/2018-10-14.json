{"month": "10", "state": "TX", "station": "KTRH", "content": "Carrie thanks for your question um yes you can reasonably expect that further increases in interest rates will create further declines in the value of bombs now a couple of caviar to this number one\nYes the markets do in his toupee\nActions by the government in other words if it is clear if the government has sent messages which they sometimes do that they are going to do things the market's doing to dissipate that and they adjust securities prices based on that\nIn other words this is called a leading economic indicator and that's what the financial markets are they are leading indicators in other words they are pricing securities today based on what they think is going to happen as opposed to a lagging indicator\nThat occurs when prices are based on what already happened so the market as a leading indicator not all lagging indicator so yes to some degree prices are based on what everybody collectively things is going to happen but having said that\nWe are never really shore truly what is going to happen or when so while many people believe that the fed will continue to raise rates nobody's really sure when the fed will raise rates next or by how much and therefore bond prices are not fully baked end\nOn that answer so for that reason you can expect that there will be further declines in the bond market if there are further increases in interest rates second\nBonds react differently to interest rate increases depending on the maturity date the duration of the bond a thirty year bond\nWill have a much bigger decline than a thirty day bond\nSo that makes sense longer the duration the longer the maturity date the greater the swing in value due to changes in interest rates so if you're fearful that there will be more rate increases then you should\nProbably not own long term bonds\nUnless you plan to hold them to maturity if you hold on a maturity and have to worry about it you'll get your money back at maturity regardless of what interest rates are doing but if you're thinking it might sell your bond prior to maturity meaning you'll be subject to whatever market prices are being offered at that time\nThen you would probably want to own shorter term bonds rather than longer term bombs in our case we tend to recommend three or five years seven year majorities rather than twenty and thirty year majorities or for that reason\nSo yes you do need to be aware of this and this was something new and different for investors most folks are comfortable with unfamiliar with unaccustomed to\nInterest rate risk\nFor the past forty years if we go back to the early Nineteen eighties interest rates have pretty much done nothing but go down\nAnd when rates go down bond prices go up so for a generation many people have grown up in an environment not realizing that rates could go up not just down\nAnd they haven't been used to the fact that bombs could lose value because for the past since Nineteen eighty bombs are pretty much done nothing but go up in value because when rates go down bond prices go up or down a different environment\nGenerationally so a lot of folks are unfamiliar with us and that's why I'm Glad you raised your question because a lot of folks at the very same question don't buy a bond unless you plan to hold her to maturity if you're going to own a bond fund you should probably on bombs in that sons that are shorter in maturity rather than longer\nAnd to know exactly what kind of bonds are best for you\nAnd how much of your money you should be placing into them\nYou should talk with a financial advisor and we're happy to help you AAA to plan Rick to tackle that question for you\nHere's another question and we got this on a lot of people's minds that comes from Mick here it is\nIraq is Mick more prone to answer\nA question about terrorists we're hearing a lot about additional tariffs being applied to all kinds of products and the fact that this is likely going to lead to an increase in price is for a number of the products that we can to purchase my question is where does all that tariff money go\nDoes it go straight to the government coffers does is in essence become an indirect tax for the people the U.S thanks for taking my question\nYeah Mick the terrorists are getting a lot of attention and rightfully so and yes you are you are correct a tariff is essentially attacks\nIt's attacks targeted on a foreign company that is selling goods and services in the U.S and it's a way for the government to tell American consumers don't buy that foreign product instead by a domestically manufactured provided product or service instead\nSo yeah terrorists are essentially taxes and the money essentially does go into government coffers I'm\nThrowing that simple foreign governments retaliate by doing the same thing you know when one government you know throws a punch but the other governments throw equal punches and uh and there you are so yes the terrorists um make products and services more expensive\nAnd the money goes into the government in taxes which is good news right we've got a massive deficit right the government is spending more money than it is receiving this helps to solve that problem but uh the burden is paid by American consumers\nWho a foot the bill so yeah that's what terrorists are terrified his synonym for tax\nRevenue generation protocol right I mean they come up with all kinds of you ever noticed that you know longer right your taxes at the end of the year to the IRS they

still looking like a war zone I'm Sally Adams won a Clinton use radio seven forty Katie our age we\nTried to weather together you're Stevens [noise] direct we had working on the inbound\nAnd so uh we're gonna talk about that or this week we're going to have a a segment on went to apply for Social Security\nAnd uh we may not be able to get through all the questions that have lined up that I think you might be interested in so if we don't we'll continue it next week as well now one of the things I mentioned at the top of this show was that uh you know we work as I said with people who are retired are retiring soon for the most part\nAnd so we believe that maintaining what you've spent your life\nBuilding your investments your your net worth is job number one if we're going to be able to generate the income to give you the the lifestyle that you want okay so therefore we believe that by hold which is you buy a bunch of investments high quality stop and you create a great portfolio you re balance it and your job is done\nOur view of that is that it's it's an incomplete strategy\nYou need to have a third part to that which is you need to have a cell strategy and that's why you know as I said we told our clients to sell the November of ... to stay out for all of two thousand and eight and then even half of all night we didn't say to buy until June up all night\nSo we're we're we're by holding cell\nSo this week I Want to talk given to drop that we saw last week and how dramatically it happened and how quickly um I Want to address the hey you don't have to worry about it because you're a long term investor everything takes care of itself overtime\nI'm time heals all wounds and all that good stuff your long term investor by hold through thick and thin [noise]\nWell I Want to talk about that one with you because I think that is one of the most dangerous things that people tell you if you are the aforementioned retired are retiring so now most shows jak would stop right there most of those who say you know what if we did just that we have done more than our listening audience could possibly want from a financial show\nSomebody don't you dare stopped me because on this show do we stop there no we don't we boldly go where no financial show has gone before\nAnd therefore at about ten tell we all have our state tip of the week this is the part of the show is on where we talk about how to pass onto your greedy and washed undeserving airs the fruits of your labor and this week we're going to talk about my favorite trust is called a dynasty trust\nAnd this is where you can protect which you leave your heirs from lawsuits divorce and the state taxes for potentially one hundred years it's a terrific thing and we'll talk about that about ten ... so we've got a ton of get to but I Want to just quickly\nGive a shout out to a ... a listener\nLaura if you're listening to talk about you [noise] um I mentioned last week that we have a a puppy and the puppy uh she had this submissive pink thing that she does you know it's like the mom and she sees me\nYou know when I first come home from work or in the morning or whatever it is first time she sees me bam a gallon a ... right there she just squats and peace and it's like oh my gosh\nAnd so the lord I heard this and she sent me an email to ... we had the best\nI can tell you it's it's awesome thank you Laura she says it's a retired veterinarian so if anybody knows it's her right [noise]\nWell I don't know I have to call her she gave me your phone numbers you said call me and Laura I'm going to call you okay I just haven't had time this week but I'll tell you this weekend if if that's OK anyway let's talk about is this a thousand and eight all over again okay so you know I Want to go back\nTo a you know two thousand and seven the end of two thousand seven October issue and all that and at that time\nYou know there were some clouds there were some dark clouds or the unemployment numbers were starting to get weaker\nOr there was a inflation was picking up the economy was slowing down a little bit I mean there was no signs of what was to come but there were signs there were some dark cloud let's say that it wasn't raining but they were dark clouds\nAnd uh and there was a lot of volatility the market was dropping dramatically and then a rising dramatically than dropping dramatically and at\nThat time people were saying this is a buying opportunity you know when the market fell and by the way that's almost exactly what happened in Y. two K. and October of two thousand August through October same thing the market was going up and down the same way before I finally fell off a cliff\nSo is this like that I'm no\nIn my view okay first of all the economy right now is not showing signs of weakening in fact it's the opposite is showing signs of strength unemployment is showing signs of strength inflation is is is in good shape so we got a lot of signs that no this is not two thousand and eight all over again so what is it\nWell basically it's the calibration okay so in other words the Federal Reserve raised interest rates the market finally has come to terms with that and said oh my gosh interest rates are going up if interest rates go up people buy fewer houses pure cars\nCompanies it costs more to borrow money profits go down so it's a re calibration is just adjusting to the new paradigm that's all so I don't think what happened last week is the beginning of a new bear market recession all that\nKind of stuff but you know what it does do in my view it should be a wakeup call to you because did you did you see how fast it fell I mean it was like what eleven hundred points in two days I mean that's fast\nThe market when it goes down it goes down very fast and you can lose your retirement very quickly I mean you can you if you if you're about to retire and it goes down thirty or forty percent like it did in Y. two K. U. and two thousand eight and you'd write it down like that\nWhat would that do to your ability to retire or if you are retired what would that do to your ability to generate income from your investments so that's why you know as I said we don't believe that by and hold is is sufficient okay it's great you should do that you should buy you should hold you should diversify all those things we believe that but it's not sufficient\nYou need to have a third part of that which is a protection mechanism and if if you're over fifty and you are contemplating your retirement or you are retired\nWe want you to be a client of ours we want to help you plan your retirement make those decisions all the stuff that it takes we want to be there with you that there was no doubt so here's what I recommend\nIf you go to our website or website is money matters dot net okay and when you go there money matters dot net now when you go there you'll find we have videos on a variety of topics that have to do with retirement we have\nPodcasts this bill passed in the past podcast about all the different segments we got I'm categorized you can find if you want Social Security if you want income if you want your ... informational whatever those topics are we've categorize it on our website you can find it\nThere we have articles on there we have videos on there we have podcasts on there we have information that you can learn okay so we want to give that to you and and help you if we can\nWhile you're at the website you have two options also uh well actually three one is you can sign up for my ... ... email which we send out weekly\nAnd you can get that no charge or the other two options are you can come in and visit with one of our financial advisors and they would love to talk about your retirement planning with you if you're over fifty and you're retired or retiring soon then uh you know we would love to sit down\nAnd go through your entire a plant and build for you a cash flow a analysis to see where you'll be in the future and if you can afford to retire and that kind of thing also you can sign up for one of our seminars if you'd like so there's all kinds of information there still go to our website is money matters dot net money matters dot net\nAnd we would love to be able to help you if we can All right we are going to take a break and when it come back we're going to talk about risk number six of the Eighteen\nRisks that you face in retirement yeah there are Eighteen of them and we're talking about number six when we come back so stay tuned this money matters and I and ... all your life you're told what to do any trash\nTo get under way will now it's your turn time your home telling likes to play K.

advisory for money matters one of the top three hundred registered investment advisors for the second time this year okay so that's and\nThat's quite an honor and we're very proud of that but you know what without our clients we would be nowhere so I give that to them and we are affirmed that specializes in working with people who are over the age of fifty who are retired or retiring soon so we we look at retirement planning is our primary focus and us so that's\nYou we love to help you'll be could and you can go to our website to find out all about us and we have tons of stuff on there for you we have podcasts and videos and articles all about the topics of a retirement planning and ah the website is money matters dot net okay so you can find it there\nSo let's talk about Social Security and one of the uh areas are probably the most important of decision that you make when it comes to Social Security is\nWhen do you apply for benefits okay and if not sixty five anymore full retirement age for baby boomers now is sixty six or sixty seven but Social Security benefits can be claimed anytime between the ages of sixty two in Seventy\nSo it's crucial for you baby boomers out there to understand how claiming early benefits will reduce your benefits for life\nAnd how delaying benefits will increase it and how to coordinate spousal benefits as well and that's an area all by itself that requires a lot of studying knowledge and all that and so let me answer some questions that are that are the\nThat was looking at here so first of all why would you delay claiming your benefits\nIf the average person will get the same amount from Social Security regardless of when they claim\nSo the way Social Security is designed just so you know is that they're going to pay out the same dollar amount to you regardless of when you start okay so if you start at sixty two they're going to pay you a lower amount for a longer period of time\nYou start when you're sixty six they'll pay you a higher amount of money but for a shorter period of time do you like you're Seventy they'll do that even again so what happens is they actually\nEnd up paying you the same total amount okay it's just depending on the time zone so therefore why would you want to take a ... why would you want to delay it why would you take when you're sixty two\n[noise] the problem is that most people will not outlive will not live out an average life okay so uh you have to look at your life expectancy\nSo an average life means you live to be eighty six currently I think is the uh is is is the life expectancy\nSo you know I was talking to a client just the other day who whose mother is Ninety eight years old and she still drives her own car I mean she's healthy and his his brother is a eighty you know and he's healthy and fine so so in his case you know we got to look at longevity and how long it's going to be\nSo the first thing you want to look is is a is longevity\nAnd by delaying you lock up\nPermanently increased benefits for the remainder of your life and your spouse's life the second reason is if you're married as I said because then your spouse will get that higher benefit because they have the choice of whether to take their own or yours whichever is higher okay so if you delay does a higher amount that will be paid to you're surviving spouse\nSo there are reasons why you might want to delay even though the amount that you'll get in total dollars if you live to life expectancy is the same\nOkay so something for you to consider now as I've mentioned do we do specialize in in in working with people who are retired are retiring soon and we look at ah we we primarily do work in the area of retirement planning so if you are over fifty if you are
