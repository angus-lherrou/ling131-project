about Kavanaugh confirmation process\n[noise] then I have most any political issue in quite some time going back to the two thousand sixteen primaries actually\nOne of the things I noticed was how many women it's actually over half of the women with whom I talked about the Kavanaugh hearings\nClaimed to be a victim of sexual assault not just sexual harassment sexual assault\nAnd\nThat's an interesting phenomenon I'm not saying it's not true I'm not saying even one of them made it up I'm saying\nThat if it is true if it is true ah first of all it's a real problem\nIn our society here's the problem here is the conundrum the dilemma this is a very difficult discussion to have by design\nThere are people who have complicated this conversation\nAnd made it difficult to talk openly about it and it is unhealthy as a society\nTo put your head in the sand and say well we just won't talk about it because it will upset people so I'm going to do my best to do so and I'm going to share with you my perception as to what has happened\n\nFirst of all some women\nPerceived the Kavanaugh case not as the evidence\nAs it was presented but they perceived it through the lens of their own case which they only wanted\nTo focus on [noise]\nAnd if you didn't relieve Christine forward then that would mean you don't believe them\nSo\nAir go they have to believe Christine Ford in order to ensure that they will be bullied when they tell their story now to a woman every woman who's told me this story\nHas told me they did not report it they did not tell anyone they didn't share it with other people it's simply happened\nAnd\nThey moved on and now they're angry about it\nAnd they look back and they wished at the time they had done something about it but here is the problem\n[noise]\n[noise] I'm not sure all of those cases necessarily were sexual assault in the sense that we referred to it in\nAnd several of these cases women have explained to me this is what happened this is how it happened this is where it happened they can always tell you the details about it\nBut in some cases it is\nHighly pressured sexual activity in I think every case that I heard about\nIf not every case I'm racking my brain to ... to think if there was one that for which this was not the case there was alcohol involved at as often happens right alcohol redo reduces inhibitions it reduces a man's inhibitions\nThan I recall in my lifetime in my lifetime\nAnd and I think that includes a during Watergate in my lifetime I mean I I I don't claim I could process what

congressional investigation into the\nWhole Trump Russia thing still been going on\nIt seems though that some of the Democrats during the investigation have outsourced those responsibilities to a former Senate staffer with links to George Soros and fusion GPS\nOur friends at the Daily Caller I have gotten very thorough in their investigations of fusion GPS Christopher Steele the former British spy and the ... gallery of assorted hangers on that they seem to boast\nThe New Yorker reports that some identified sorry some other than a fad senator\nHired a man named Doug Jones a ... not the senator from Alabama a former Senate intelligence committee staffer who also worked for Dianne Feinstein\nIn March of two thousand seven team that's when this Doug Jones was hired to review data regarding a possible link between the computer servers of the Trump Organization and a Russian Bank called alpha bank\nWhen he left the service of the Senate Jones founded a left wing group called the democracy integrity project\nThis group worked closely with fusion GPS and former British spy Christopher Steele the tag team duo that produce the Democrat funded dusty a accusing the Trump campaign of colluding with the Kremlin\nJones's operation was also funded by a small group of billionaires including left wing philanthropist George Soros\nJones told the ap yeah in March of Seventeen so that's a few months after Trump is warn him that between seven and ten billionaires had put up fifty million dollars five zero to continue and investigation into Russian\nEd Link in elections the goal was to provide information to the press the FBI and the Senate goal in other words was to try to harm the Trump regime so George Soros was putting up some big money to ensure that the Russian collusion story stay alive\nOr why would he want to do that [noise] the alpha bank allegations first saw the light of day October thirty first two thousand sixteen it's a week before the election when Franklin for of slate\nMagazine suggested that the communications between a server in Trump Tower an alpha bank was part of a back door communication apparatus to coordinate Russian interference\nIn the article received heavy criticism from cybersecurity experts and tech reporters who said the server communications appeared to have an innocent explanation such as either spammer mass marketing email traffic\nAccording to the New Yorker a handful of Democrats pursued the alpha bank theory one was Virginia Senator Mark Warner the top Democrat on the Senate intelligence panel\nA second Democrat Senator was also exploring the angle and approached Jones\nNow Sandy Peterson our research director who's been doing the work researching the story has a theory that this is Dianne Feinstein the other senator which would make her a busy it'll it'll be a\nMind you during this time she had a Chinese spy on her payroll who was driving her around and had been for years\nAccording to the New Yorker Jones the former staffer who also runs a consulting firm called the Penn Quarter group he's a busy little fella too it's it's hard work trying to bring down the president\nSo Mr Jones hired two teams of computer scientists to analyze Web traffic from the alpha bank the Russian Bank and the Trump Organization servers\nThe experts who've held top cyber security jobs in the White House Pentagon and intelligence services were unable to definitively say that the server communications were part of a back channel communications system with the Trump campaign\nBut according to the New Yorker they believe the server communications could still been have been part of a nefarious operation as they a niche initially described in these slate article", "year": "2018", "show_name": "Michael Berry",
