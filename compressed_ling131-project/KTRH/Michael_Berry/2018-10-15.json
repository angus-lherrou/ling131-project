answer ready for that question\nNone at all points me\nSatire [laughter] in the twenty plus years she\nDoesn't come up with a better answer the she's had no time to have an answer ready for that question\nNone at all\nAnd leap post but yes she got over two decades\nLater I don't think you I don't think you're well this was Hillary's comment\nIn retrospect do you think\nShould've resigned in the wake of the Monica Lewinsky scan absolutely not it wasn't an abuse of power now now there are people who\nThe incidence of the nineties and they say a president of the United states cannot have a consensual relationship with an intern the power imbalance as to what an adult\nBut let me ask you this is where the investigation of the current incumbent against to numerous allegations have been made and what shape dismisses denies and ridicules\n... no allegations\nBeen made regarding sex since he was the president\nI'm actually um I don't think an investigation as an order if there's not even a ... of evidence\nThere is no one who has alleged same they will I feel pretty certain they're going to find a Democrat who found herself in the room with him at some point and they're going to accuse him\nOf something sexual or I feel certain because that would that would excite their base it doesn't have to be true we we already know you could make these things up and still make the news President Trump was on sixty minutes yesterday\nAnd I dare say it was a pretty good showing for him\nFirst president to the United states who never had a political posts before\nWe're never served in the military you come up here you've been here for almost two years what's the biggest surprise and what have you learned since you've been present\nOkay so I always used to say the toughest people or Manhattan real estate guys and Bob but\nNow he's saying they're babies who have that has the political people this is the most deceptive vicious world\nIt is and vicious it's full of lies deceit and deception you make a deal with somebody and it's like making a deal with that table give me an example I don't want to give you an example I'm not looking at in the meantime nobody's been able to do what I've been able to do\nWhen you look at taxes you look at regulations you look at uh making deals with other countries nobody's been able to do anything like this actually most people don't even try because they knew that didn't have the ability to do it but\nIt's a very deceptive well the other thing I really learned is I never knew how dishonest the media was I I I really made it I'm not saying that as a sound bite I now have you have to change the subject to get well no but even the way you ask me questions about separation yeah\nWhen I say Obama did it you don't want to talk about I Know when I was making my going around your answer but you did it for time I'm just telling you said you treated me much differently on the subject I disagree but I don't want to have that fight with you hey All right okay not if I look at the time I'm president and you're not\n[noise]\nHere he's talking about general mad dog Mattis a possibly leaving um\nThe White House which is perfectly normal you have during the course of a president's I mean it's it's\nIt's a grind and you know it it's sort of like playing professional football times a hundred you don't play every play every down every game guys\nHe's not in fact where he is still the darling of the left they would have embraced him\nIt would have been courageous bowl that he came out\nAnd\n\nDiscussed openly his struggles with mental health problems instead they call them crazy because he\nReally likes Donald Trump I think it's going to backfire I think\nThere's going to be a surprising number of blacks who are going to break from the plantation party and begin to see for themselves hey you might not like every Republican\nAnd yeah there are some folks who are Republicans who don't like black people as you know if you're black there's some black people who don't like white people and there was some white people the Democrat Party who don't like black people\nUm these sorts of things happen [noise]\nOne of the things it's been used to keep blacks Democrat for so many years\nTo find some fringe guy who is supposedly Republican an All right guy the alt right is much closer to the left than they are conservatism if you look at their actual policies\nBut you find the guy who is a fringe element and you make him in to that to the Republicans are and you keep telling Democrats that in reaffirming it through all of their\nAll of their indices there pasture they're elected official their media their TV their movie stars there rappers and the echo chamber confirms this by us so much so that it sets\nAnd then it's almost\nIt's entrenched you can't break it loose because it becomes something someone knows to be true and not just something that they suspect will be true once you decide you know something to be true it's very hard to change people's opinions\nVery hard it's why you're seeing this landslide of\nA money being thrown at marijuana now that it's been increasingly if not legalized in at least decriminalized\nAnd you wonder where all these people who are smoking marijuana I'm had more people come up to me in the last couple of years and confessed to their recreational users and they're professionals\nWell you've never told me this before well you know opinions are changing on it\nSo you waited until everybody else okay All right and there is a huge upside to a investing in a marijuana\nAccording to folks that that follow this kind of money I don't claim to and I don't have a single investment in marijuana not that I Would be opposed to some of my best friends are marijuana um\nBut the point of this is\nI think what you're going to see and I think something that Trump's going to usher in because he uses culture very effectively\nIs a change in how blacks perceive the parties and the positions these things always happen do these things are happening before we realize they're happening [noise]\nAnd they're happening on a broader scale than his picked up because by the time someone noticed as ... comments on it it's no longer a trend it's just a fact Trump\nWas on sixty minutes yesterday he also talked about the leader of North Korea and then we fell in love\nMe a beautiful letter [noise] and then\n[noise] we fell in love\nI Want to read you his resume okay presides over a cruel kingdom of repression\nGulag starvation reports that he

with him [noise] look at the horrible threats or man\nNo more threats\n\nYou know I don't recall them hammering Morocco bomber in this fashion and the reason is because they didn't bronco bomber was Billy de Williams she was the coolest cats over\n[noise] one commentator posted sixty minutes interviewed President Trump for twenty six minutes in the process he was interrupted sixty four times mid sentence sixty four times in twenty six minutes\nPresident Obama did two similar interviews on CBS over the span of forty six minutes and was interrupted four times\nSo twice as long he was interviewed and one's sixteen the number\nOf interruptions\nWhich means one thirty second the number of interruptions if you measure per number of minutes that means two and a half times per minute Trump was interrupted once every twelve minutes\nMorocco bottle was interrupt so two and a half times per minute\nIs every twenty five seconds more or less\nVersus every twelve minutes if you're ...

very good weekend [noise]\nJohn Ratcliffe was a Republican\nIs not surprised that Glenn Simpson is pleading the fifth\nDuring an interview with Fox News Ratcliffe says that Simpsons testimony is at odds with the testimony that Bruce or with the department of justice gave last month quote the reason for that is it Glen Simpson had previously testify under oath to the house intelligence committee\nThat he never met with Bruce or or discussed with Bruce or the Steele dossier prior to the October application that defies that application in two thousand sixteen or the two thousand sixteen presidential election\n[noise] that is in direct contradiction to what Bruce or told me under oath last month I Am not surprised Mr Sampson is taking the fifth he probably should\nHe's in real legal jeopardy very clearly someone is not telling the truth Nelly or Bruce or his wife certainly can shed some light Nelly or course works for a fusion GPS\nSimpsons not the only one in the hot seat here deputy attorney general Rod Rosenstein failed to appear before the house last week and Bob Goodlatte the chairman of the committee has threatened to subpoena him as well\nI Hope they stay on these cases like a dog on a bone because if these individuals even though they were not successful in winning the election if they did what I think they did it\nDid what I suspect they did they committed high crimes they committed crimes at such a level that they threaten our republic and I don't say that lightly\nThey committed crimes that must be punished to the full extent of the law\n[noise] and I hope they are let's get to the president on sixty minutes over the weekend I think he had a very good weekend and I think he's become very very good at this\nI'm going to play for you some clips of his interview with Leslie stall and I want you to see how on message he remains\nSome people when they get into a meeting like this Leslie stall is a very talented journalist she's very good\nShe will mix one part familiarity with another part respect and almost sort of a false I'm\nA false praise and then come back with a short of overbearing school farm attitude that demands you tell the truth it would be a mistake to underestimate how good she is that what she does\nNevertheless Donald Trump went into that meeting absolutely kept his cool that she tried she really wanted him to lose his cool\nAnd he didn't and he stayed focused and where it matters I don't think that that Donald Trump won you know Dianne Feinstein over to his side I don't think he wanted to ... the Democrat Party over to his side\nBut I Do think among his base in middle America\nI think it comes off very strong during this interview let's go through some clips of it she begins by asking him these sort of deep questions that that Morocco bomb it used to love\nYou know what what do you dream about what is your fear she's trying to make a headline out of this interview and Trump looks are dead in the eye and basically says you people are liars the cheats your knaves I don't trust you\nAnd I don't think most Americans do here's what he said\nFirst president to the United states who never had a political post or for worse never served in the military you come up here and you've been here for almost two years what's the biggest surprise and what have you learned since you've been\nPressing okay so I always used to say the toughest people or Manhattan real estate guys and blah blah [noise]\nNow I say their babies who hit that has the political people this is the most deceptive vicious world it is and vicious it's full of lies deceit and deception you make a deal with somebody and it's like making a deal with at that table give me an example I don't want to give you an example I'm not looking at\nDuring Ohio rally calling the Confederate leader quote incredible in quote\nWell even liberals in the media came out and criticized what they had done even liberals in the media came out and\nDistance themselves from what NBC had done here is the president's comments now I happen to think as many military historians do that Robert really was a very effective general\nAnd I think one of the factors in his favor on that subject is the fact that President Lincoln sought to employ him in a senior position within the union army\nIn fact he was invited to the ... to the White House so that the case could be made that he not break off and lead his fellow Virginian which he did the ...\nBut that he lead the union\nHe had a lineage at West point which\nWas nothing short of spectacular um and in a union wanted his services and be the one to keep them away from the Confederate\nHe's been regarded throughout history by military who's historians as a very bright effective successful tactician [noise]\nNow there's been in the last Twenty years and attempt to discredit his military actor maintenance and that's fine it's based in the fact that\nIt's based in the sort of revisionist some of the confederacy was awful therefore anything that went on there if they developed a cure for cancer\nIn a Confederate a I'm a medical tent they would have declared that it wasn't such a great I'm a discovery after all that it's it's that bad but the point\nI'm making here is the militaries attempt to smear the president by taking words that I said military the media's attempt to smear the president by taking words out of context is backfiring\nOver and over and over again\nBecause increasingly Americans don't believe them and increasingly they give Americans every reason not to believe that here is the president's actual statement and I\nWould I Would beg to find anyone who could disagree\nWith anything he says here you're free to have your own opinions but there's certainly nothing he says here\nThat that speaks to white supremacy or anything of of of the store and NBC had the ... had to come back and do something they rarely do and correct their article and admit that what they said he said he didn't say here's what he did say\nOh I say that gave us\nGreat president who has been properly recognized OK\nWilliam McKinley has not been properly racket [noise] what he did and in terms of fray in terms of war but in terms of trade and I hate to say it in terms of being smart and tariffs William McKinley has not\nI've been properly recognized but maybe someday he will [noise]\nIt also gave you [noise]\n\nA general who is incredible he drank a little bit too much [noise]\nYou know what I'm Talking about [noise]\nSo Robert really it was a great general [noise] ads Abraham Lincoln\nDevelop a phobia he couldn't be Robert Ley he was going crazy I don't know if you do this or but Robert Daly was winning battles after battles after battles and Abraham Lincoln mommy's that I can pick Robert Daly and they had these generals\nThey look great they were the top of that class at West point they were the greatest people\nThere's only one problem\nThey didn't know how to held a when they didn't know how to fight [noise] they didn't know how and one day it was looking really bad and Lincoln just said you hardly knew his name and they said don't take him he's got a drinking problem [noise]\nAnd like is that I don't care what probably as you guys aren't winning [noise]\nAnd his name was grant general [noise]\n\nAnd he went in and hey knock the hell out of everyone\n[noise]\nAnd you know the story they said the Lincoln\nYou can use your money more he's an alcoholic\nAnd Lincoln said [noise] I don't care if he's an alcoholic frankly give me six or seven more just like a [noise]\nHe started to win\nGrant really did he had a serious problem a serious ... but men was he a good general and he's finally being recognized as a great general but [noise]\nHad\nAlmost developed a phobia 'cause he was having a hard time was\nA true great fighter and a great General Robert Italy but grant figured it out and grab is a great general and grand came from right here [noise]\nSo they took him out of context but what is more studying that Robert ... was a great general in order to build up this victory that that grant and executed above him\nIn just a moment I'm going to read to you\nFrom some presidents of the past Republicans and Democrats [noise]\nOver the last almost a hundred years as to how they described Robert anyway [noise] I'll tell you what if today we're supposed to believe he was an awful general we sure have had a lot of presidents\nWho went out of their way to tell us how great a general he was [noise] but that's my point President Trump was praising grant NBC took on Trump they lied and they lost [noise]\n\nSeveral different types of foundations in our part of the country\nOne of them as a
