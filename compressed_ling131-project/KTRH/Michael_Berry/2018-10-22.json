[noise] I agree\nSo let's go back to the issue of Obamacare as a governance issue and not a campaign issue\n... one of the last votes that John McCain cast was voting against remember he did the famous thumbs down he held out in the very end amount was what was known as skinny repeal [laughter] and the reason for that was it was not a complete repeal of Obamacare but\nIt was a repeal of the the worst elements of it\nGo and we simply didn't get the votes to repeal it\nMcCain voted against us I think Susan column voted against cultural against us\nRight [laughter]\nIn just the same way that you're dealing with the Jeff Flake I'm On the Kavanaugh hearings if we can't get that swing Republican voter to cast a vote then we can't repeal it\nBut when you say that health care is the number one issue facing twenty eight percent of Americans it's important to understand\nThat is the number of Americans who say it's the most important issue\nYou're assuming that everyone feels the way you do and that is small business owner I'm spending money that this is not a wise use of this was a disproportionate amount of money I'm spending on health care and health insurance is not healthcare itself do iris right right\nAnd I understand the reverse of that though is that you have all of these Democrats including bacteria that are saying we want to fix health care to the extreme of making it you know universal or or free and I mean where we you know\nRepublicans are are almost to that point that we're ready to jump that ship because it's so everything is so expensive everything\nIs ready to jump what show\nTo kill agreed with the Democrats that you almost are you're you're almost to a point where you need a blanket minimum level of care just just as part of the taxes and and\nCovering covering basic care as opposed to paying all this money and still not receiving basic care\nHow would that help the [laughter] again it's it's a messaging is here for the Democrats that they're they're promising all of these things\nI don't know it's a policy issue it it's it's forget the campaign if\nYou're actually going to enact policies to peel back Obamacare ... it's not simply\nSo here's here's where they get us is that people go well hell if\nThe government's going to run it anyway then let's just go ahead and let the government running and less run it more efficiently from the government\nAt that point they warn you down at that point is not about winning and losing elections anymore now you take health care off the table but more important than what wins or loses elections how the issue was framed to win or lose elections\nNow you've hurt healthcare now you've hurt your people and that matters\nAnd and whether you can use the fact that people's lives are worse to get them to vote for change is the secondary function\nBecause you have hurt your fellow American and that can never be acceptable we can never say take one for the team in hopes we can win an election because that means that people are you\nVisit your relative in the hospital and you see public policy at play and the doctors tell you we\nCan't deliver health care as efficiently as effectively as we could in the longer the nurses tells you that the uh people who are long term care patients who were before and after\nTell you that\nYou had to take away people's insurance\nBecause some people didn't have insurance which they just we now know they just didn't choose to buy it so you took everybody off their insurance started them over\nSo that you could over insure them I mean look it's it's a seemingly complicated issue that can be reduced to this point in order to provide insurance for people who were choosing not to buy it\nYou had to force people who were paying for insurance already to pay for more insurance you had to charge them for things that they'll never pay for\nThat is why you're charging men for for osteopathic care that they themselves can't use\nIt while you're ... you're charging old people for pregnancy care you know they'll never used it what you're doing is packing on a cafeteria plan a set of requirements and costs to offset the expense over here\nAnd then what did we do to the people who didn't pay for health care would just said you got to pay for health care or you pay more in taxes so all these young people who thought that all of a sudden they were going to get ... to give them more money\nBecause they didn't have health care and now they were going to have health care health insurance they found out that they were punished for not buying health care they could have bought health care in the first place but here's to the more important question\nYou save Republicans are losing the messaging on on Obamacare on health care and I agree because the left offers everything to everybody but never forget we are the adults in the room\nWe are not the people who win liar loans are are ramp but we're not the people who say there are no consequences\nFor your for for your actions a conservative is someone who stands up toward history yelling stop at a time when no one is inclined to do so for to have much patience with those who so urgent [noise]\nWhen the world or at least our fellow countrymen lose their minds [noise] it's not our role to jump in with them it's our role to be the one set of
