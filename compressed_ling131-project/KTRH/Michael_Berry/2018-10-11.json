weren't a lot of people that were just like you don't\nOvertly coming out the sport now as the as the lights went on you know kind of hard to determine and he went on the attack was the show you know ever since you don't hear I\nRemember when he ran for my [laughter] anyway\nWhen you know you're you're a march made it work what do you feel like in this upcoming election that they're folks like yourself\nThat you don't make the things that he'd be that great I'm Fred ... turning around drain the swamp all that what's your what's your opinion on it [noise]\nAh you know here's the problem\nUm\nIt's hard to have that conversation\nI have come to the conclusion that my opinion\nOf Donald Trump is not particularly important\nIs just not [noise] um and\nMe to express what is a very complicated\nA\nI Believe that he would be sort of a Jeff Flake a guy who got elected as a Republican governor as a Democrat I believed that in good faith based on his past\nI didn't it wasn't that I was ignorant of the life of Donald Trump I had done a lot of research and I believed that he would be awful but I hoped he would be good\nAnd the reason is I don't let my ego get in the way of the much bigger issue I'm going to be dead and gone and my children are going to be my age and I want them to live in a great country\nAnd I don't think that that's a fait accompli I don't think that it's naturally the case that this country will be great thirty five years from now just because we've always been great I think we have to make good decisions\nI think that it's hard work just stay at the top you see countries that rise and fall if if you look at the the change in fortunes in China\nIn India for instance\nIf you look at where Japan was in currently is or\nVietnam for that matter or Cambodia\nCountry's rise and fall based on decisions that they make\nAnd I want our country it'd be great I'm fine I'm financially secure I have a great job or I get to do what I loved to do my

means thugs who tried to kill cops shouldn't be killed by the cops who defend themselves\nWhy can't we all just said what is the truth and stop worrying if the leftist mad\nMost people believe Christine Ford lied\nAnd they know that the Democrats were going to do anything to destroy this guy\nMost people know that most not every most every black guy gets killed by a cop was himself trying
