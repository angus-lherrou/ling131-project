Antonio and Austin have passed sick leave ordinances as I said going into the break here I mean it's one thing if you want to\nDo that for city workers and the voters support you for doing nothing when you want to do with the private businesses Joyce was talking about is the director of the center for the American future at the Texas Public policy foundation they're suing to block the Austin ordinance Rob had a gate Rob\n... is it just does it seem like a lot of city council members these days they think they think the state legislators\nWell that that's a great point and so much of that issue here is that the people in Austin San Antonio getting out of their lane not doing what they're supposed to do to the government and thinking that their state legislators are members of Congress and wanting\nTo pass all of these big regulation and regulatory packages they don't have the power to do and that's a big cause of our last year\nAnd a parent lander our workforce requirements any way you do have to offer paid leave to employees right under state law\nWell no state law or the one of the orange sweaters for law arty ... nature and Texas has a state law called the ... minimum wage act\nWhich regulates the payment of wages it doesn't require\n... paid leave but uh it does governor paying the wages and basically the city ordinance record or that the city is coming in mandating the types of wages that private employers have to pay their employees and they just go do that because the cities are quick state law\nThat also making a distinction only for non union workers\nRight and that really shows a lot of what's going on with this and the city ordinance is that have been supported by the national you Sam progressive organizations that completely exempt it out union recorders so they want to come in and micromanage the operation of just non unionized and lawyers\nI think it's a way of trying to it at our status their right to work state yeah as part of the agenda on this\nNegatively see that it's so are we seeing in what kind of push back I guess are we seeing for businesses in San Antonio and Austin or they threatening to leave these cities as a result\nWe've

gotten the appellate court enter a day stopping Austin ordinance before it goes into effect while the appeal is pending and then in addition to that\nA dozen of trade associations chamber of commerce groups legislators all filed a brief supporting our law suit saying this is not the proper role city to do and the court will be correct strike down\nYou know it's always interesting to be on Texas is always at the very top we've released one of the top few states ... states for business and one of the reason is because we don't try to over regulate our businesses here we lead business business

be any regarding Nikki Haley's resignation from the United nations [noise]\nThere is scant\nSpeculation as to why she has stepped down\nI'm\nI'm sure at some point someone is going to um\n[noise] offer a theory because\nThe um\nIntelligentsia the commentary it is flailing around looking for some scoop\nAnd whoever first floats a theory is going to get a lot of clicks so someone's going to float a theory but that doesn't make it correct\nAnd I say that because at a moment like this one I don't offer a theory I Will get emails ... this region say just raise right here\nWell no that's not the reason that someone who duped you into doing exactly what they wanted which is forwarding an article an opinion that they posted hastily so that they could be the first person to post something more often than not\nIn a situation like this where the news story is developing and it's organic\nThere will be multiple updates and revisions to the story such that by the time the truth emerges\nIt bears absolutely no resemblance to where the story started so there's no point in trafficking that nonsense not All right Robert I'm going to have him in a pot you up Robert from San atone but as soon as the president or a start speaking I'll put you on hold so go ahead\nYeah I'm\nA question of what the confirmation of a cabin or texting Cavanaugh I'm drawn to the national issues in the Senate races the over people aren't just voted basically on what President it's been a ...\nImplement keeping the Democrats control and so he's not happy with more than winning it going to do for I'm not sure I understand the question\nDo the things that are are are they all blown now based on where people are going to vote based on what Trump's gonna keep doing as far as the frame court nomination future yep\nWell you know it just I Can't remember who I was reading last night Robert but somebody offered the theory and I think there's merit to this\n[noise] that the Kavanaugh issue has nationalized the Senate elections by which I mean each of\nThe Senate races these are these are not state Senate races technically because a state Senate race would be a race to be a state senator which should be a senator in each of those individual states in their state Capitol in their state legislature these are federal races\nThat are elected state by state so not to quibble but just so we're all talking about the same thing the Ted Cruz versus Beto O'Rourke raise for instance\nWhat the Democrats strategy was and it was clearly stated was to take each of these states and focus on local issues\nThe Democrats tend to do better on localized issues in states where it's purple where it's a fifty fifty they tend to do better on personality take the case of ... for instance ... is running completely on personality\n[noise] if you listen to what he says there's never a policy position if you listen carefully to what he says he says things like you know we have to be better\nWe after we're all working in this together and and you know I'm here with you and your with me and if you look at his accomplishments it is visiting every county in the state well when it came time to vote for or against the cabinet nominations\nAnd we were trying to cobble together enough votes to get him confirmed did you ever think to yourself well I don't I don't know how Susan Collins is going to vote but what I really like to know is how many counties in that state has she has she visited\nAnd she is ambitious in the sense that I think Nikki Haley\nLooks out for Nikki Haley but I think she did that when she was the governor of South Carolina I think she did that during the presidential\nElection when she managed to insert herself and I think that she has shown a propensity to do that as the UN ambassador however I think that Trump in his own unique way\nUnderstood that she was a good face for America and his administration because she's independent she does not look like she's a puppet of him and yet she's fearless and she's fierce\nAnd it's not an easy thing to walk into the United nations where the knives are out for you knowing that this president is making some of the statements he has made a bold statements to the world\nAnnouncing that we're going to pursue our own national interest in it to the extent that you get in the way of that there's going to be a problem and you're going to be punished\nThe United nations is not accustomed to hearing an American president speak in this manner they have not heard an American president speak in this manner [noise] they've heard the soft\nElegant a language of flourish is\nThat the diplomats who typically occupy the White House um will use\nBut Trump doesn't speak in those tones and he doesn't speak with that message and he has managed to back it up and I think that that's probably not an easy thing for Nikki Haley I don't know there there is a there is really no speculation to speak of as to why she has resigned\nIt the timing of this is rather odd it it appears hasty\nComing as it does just before\nThe midterms\nAnd I'm going to say this I I Can't imagine\nWell\nI don't want to speak and then regret my words this sort of distraction\nThis close to the midterms is not healthy it's not helpful\nAnd it suggests again\nThat Nikki Haley is not a team player which has been my suspicion all alone [noise] I have noticed some times in political and corporate life that there will be individuals\nLike her who are so self absorbed and\nGod help you if you have to work for one of them are who are\nAnd I have no knowledge of how she treats her staff\nBut I Would not be shocked if she's one of those whose abusive I've been around her type before and I have seen how they are everything is about them all the time [laughter] everything is about them\nEverything is about their when their wishes everything is related to what's the next step up I can take\nAnd they are they are not the types of individuals who make for good\nI'm number twos they're not the types of individuals who make for good teammates in the sense that they make a sacrifice for the good of the organization or the group or the campaign or whatever else a it is all related to what's in it for me\nAnd I I have a I've had this conversation the number of times by people who are quite bowled over by\nNikki Haley um and I I think that some of the reason they're bowled over by Nikki Haley is she's a non white woman who is a Republican and Republicans have almost a fetish for that sort of thing they get so excited\nAnd part of that is because Republicans are so wounded when they're called racist\nThat they grasping at straws they they they go inserts\nThis panicked desperate search for a non white non mail a person who can be pushed out front and they can be the face of the Republican Party\nI think that's part of why Ben Carson's campaign got as much support as it did Ben Carson had absolutely positively no business none zero\nNone he had no business being in a conversation about who should be president none\nBut he did and I would argue for all the wrong reasons and I know that because you didn't have to talk very long to a white male Ben Carson supporter until they worked into the conversation how great it was that he's black\nHis race should have nothing to do with it and I think that the Democrats have so beleaguered Republicans over a period of time that they've created this this sort of a natural desire to lift up from our ranks\nA non white non mail\nRepublican who could be the face of the party because then the idea is always been yeah see see now you can't say were racist any more so now you you can't say were racist anymore [noise]\nWell that's probably more than I should have revealed about Nikki Haley I Hope it's not that she has a a health crisis or some sort of a personal crisis 'cause then I'd feel a little bit bad but I still stand by the comments made I suspect it's not that\nI suspect that this is classic Nikki Haley if\nYou actually look into her past and that this was an opportunity for her to get a lot of attention right before the midterms coming as it does I Hope that's not the case\nBut I guess we'll know here shortly after president reveals why she has stepped out he's going to be speaking at any moment he's delayed by half an hour I'd I don't know why it could be last minute conversations they could be\nMassaging the message and how this is going to be handled it might not even be anything negative well it might not be anything negative
