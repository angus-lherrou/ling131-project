who in two thousand five had some serious sexual harassment allegations in his office\nAnd she did this just after the Kavanaugh hearings so that's kind of an odd choice and by the way the guy she went for said he would have voted yes for Kavanaugh because he sees riding on the wall he's looking at the same polling number we are except he's looking at a lot more polling numbers\nRemember these guys have a lot more polling\nData up to date sooner than you do so by the time you see a poll that says hey Heidi Heitkamp losing in North Carolina I mean in in North Dakota Heidi Heitkamp the Democrat incumbent is losing in North Dakota\nAnd the people of North Dakota want Kavanaugh by the time you see it she's had it for days she's had time to change her opinion or change our public positions\nNever forget how much polling data these people have access to in real time they pay people a lot of money to do focus groups and see where they should come down on these issues\nAnd they don't make a statement on it before that and I'll tell you this I'm Glad Susan Collins went with with a Kevin all but I guarantee you Susan Collins was looking at polling data\nThat showed that the people in her state wanted Kavanaugh\nThat doesn't minimize how difficult it was for her as a woman to come out in favor of him especially when she was targeted so heavily\nBut it\nDoes mean that the support is there and and that they're going to talk about Susan Rice running against or they can run Taylor Swift or Susan Rice or a Lena Dunham or whoever else they want to drag out\nThe fact is\nThe fact is Susan Collins is popular in Maine Susan Collins voted with the conservatives and the state of Maine has a fierce streak of independence and they don't like to be bullied by other folks\nSo when Susan Collins comes out and says they tried to illegally bribe me\nWith stories appear about them sending three thousand coat hangers to her\nWhen she has to take back alley entrances to get into the Capitol when she talks about how awful it is man and she's been intimidated and threatened\nMaybe Susan Collins is paying people to do that because you are absolutely positively ensuring that
