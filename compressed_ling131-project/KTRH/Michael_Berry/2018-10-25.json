to talk radio with clever ways to deal with it should not require minutemen National Guard troops military troops are the seizure of assets\nIt's a problem that other governments need to solve and if they can't solve it we should use our diplomatic ties there's a reason we have embassies there's a reason we spend so much on the state department there is a region reason we expand so many\nThere's
