dubbed Miller who played for seven hours with just a little tiny amp up on a little\nPedestal basically on the day that we were not even opened yet we were waiting on folks folks were coming in and just touring the place and we just had some rendering and they set up and cooked in the parking lot and\nA lot has transpired in those five years a lot of learning experience for me it's it is\nA lot harder than I thought to run a restaurant a lot harder to run a bar it's in our ... ... a lot harder to run a concert venue it's easy to go to a show and think to yourself wow I this is as easy I I like music I could do this [noise]\nUm but it's hard I mean this is true that aren't in his humbling how hard it is but a lot of people worked very hard to get us to this point\nAnd most important to me is that we've done a lot of good we've literally raise millions of dollars for camp pope over the years\nWe've brought more veterans and we have provided more date nights we have been a place where people have rekindled their marital romance after years\nOf never having a date night we've allowed a lot of people to meet their musical uh stars and he rose and get pictures and get things sign and have an intimate concert experience we've made a lot of friends out of a lot of people\nWhere people come to a show a husband wife comes to his show they made another couple at the show and two years later they go on a cruise together\nUm a lot of good people came together over the years I find that I Am generally a disappointment to most people because some people come to the red neck country club thinking that we're going to hang out every evening when I'm not able to do that I'm a bad person\nBut I've also come to the conclusion that that kind of goes with the territory some people come to the written that country club to meet me because they listen to the show and they think I'm going to be interesting and the truth is\nAnd I'm not being demolished and I'm not being a\nUnduly modest there's not much left to me after the show whatever their resume you hear on the radio program\nBut we've created a community I feel like we've done a lot of good city a Stafford absolutely loves us city of Webster is offering us the world to uh to build a location and Webster ah we're looking at a location we've finally found a location that I think might possibly work with my friend ... ...\nI'm Out on the north west side um which we're going to be looking finally at some environmental and seeing if that\nCan work out we can get our liquor permit but\nThat is my goal that has been a

be able to have outdoor events will be able to do outdoor concerts will be able to have half of the property open to the public so that the indoors will be open to members only\nBut the outside will be open to the public where they can come and eat at a restaurant lunch or dinner so it'll allow us to be open more days more hours to do more things to make it easier to get in and out easier to get

combined\nShould they are going to run the union so we're always going to be in the minority\nIf we go about population Virginia has way more New York has way more people than we do Pennsylvania\nSo the Connecticut Compromise allowed\nFor a lower house based on population abortion\nSo Virginia dominated that lower house New York dominated that lower house and the upper chamber of our Congress the

funeral\nFor all the talk about his linked the careers of senator what did the media to tell you he was a hero for he walked up and gave the thumbs down on repealing Obamacare\nAnd so the people who write the modern history not the long term historian the modern history writers the New York Times columnist the Washington Post columnist\nWhat did they say he was a maverick who wasn't a maverick he was the swamp but why they called him a maverick they called him a maverick\nBecause he went against the Republican Party he went against the people who voted for him he went against the Tea Party he win against the base he basically voted to continue Obamacare he voted to continue the signature piece of legislation of the guy who defeated him in two thousand eight\n\nThe single most unifying political issue for Republicans from the spring of two thousand ten when it passed\n\nUp through the end of two thousand fourteen was repealing Obamacare the residual passion for repealing Obamacare was still high enough\nThat Ted Cruz and the Republicans led the charge to repeal it McCain put the thumbs down for flake he understands that if he votes with Republicans the woman who who uh accosted him\nIn the elevator Sheila she's the head of a four of us are George Soros funded\nLiberal activist organization out of New York she wasn't a member of the general public she wasn't a rape victim

who the weak link class they knew who was the one that the herd would shed they knew the one most likely to be taken down and that's just like\nEven if Republicans lose flake the public opinion over the next couple of days this thing is being battled not for the votes of the senators the senators opinions are derivative of the public\nRather than their own sewage embarrass opinions that they arrived at\nHeidi Heitkamp gotta look at polling data and the one thing politicians care about more than anything else is staying in office\nAnd then once they're leaving office the one thing they care about is being able to get paid after they leave office if flake was up for reelection we wouldn't have to worry about his vote\nBut because he's stepping out we do the Democrats have\nThree
