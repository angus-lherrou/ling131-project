they'll say oh well they they very rarely say to me but they'll go on social media sites\nGod Margot bearing the only reason he says all those things about illegal immigration or crime or a desert as for ratings\nLet's unpack that for a moment\nIf the reason I Do what I Do is because a lot of people will listen if I Do does that mean that it's popular\nLet's just assume for a moment that I don't say anything actually mean I just pay under for more people to listen right well if that's the case couldn't anybody do that\nAnd more importantly don't we subscribe to the theory\nThat that which a lot of people consume whether they pay for it or not 'cause you don't pay to listen to the show but you do listen and that does drive up the ratings if that's the case doesn't that mean it's a product people what that's like saying\nYou know tied they only make their detergent because people want to buy it and you know water burger and eating out and McDonalds and Burger King ... the only reason they're putting\nCheese and sesame seed buns just because people like to eat it ... well yeah that's kinda this how that works I mean do you say of a company that goes out of business\nYeah yeah ... no there there were great they regret nobody bought they're proud of what they were great they were true to their mission batted sell anything and then their investors lost their their high eighties but they were they were great\nBecause they didn't give people what they wanted they gave people what they didn't want and therefore people chose not to purchase their product is dumb every body wants ratings every body wants ratings make no mistake about it but let me explain for a moment and again I don't mean to patronize if you understand\nAnd that's it seems pretty straightforward but it's important to understand why ratings are important to CNN ratings are more important than CNN than they are to me and let me explain why\nFirst stations like CNN or for music stage stations on the radio [noise]\nMost of the advertising which is where the money is made right you don't pay to consume the show you get it free but the trick is if we can get a bunch of you to listen\nThen companies will pay to have their names said all of you so that while you're in the middle of listening you'll hear their name right\nNo matter what the radio that's how it works so they pay the station so the station puts this product out to you free and the station receives money to in addition to the content to throw in some references to car dealers or a electricians or whatever restaurants whatever that may be\nThe higher the ratings are more listeners the more listeners the more they'll pay because you pay more to get to talk to a hundred thousand people then to talk to a thousand people so sure every station every show wants to have the highest ratings\nHigher the ratings are more of the money and it's purchased in terms of water called points and I don't want to go too far into the weeds here\nBut the more listeners viewers for TV stations you have the more you can sell your ad to tide or Chevrolet or Ford or whatever food packaging company or anything else\nSo of course they share the same thirty second ad on CNN [noise] the same at the same created the whole deal\nThat runs during the super bowl will sell for a hundred times more I don't know how much more it's probably a hundred times do you know why because there is a hundred times more people watching the super bowl and seeing and the more people that watch\nThe more you can charge for the same exact thirty seconds you see a TV station only has so many hours in the day they can sell advertising on they only have so many spots at some point you stretch that you can't go any further so the more people that are viewing or in radio listening well the reason I care less about it\nIs I don't have to have ratings we do but I don't have to because I have qualitative I don't have quantitative you see stations that are talking to people that are Eighteen to thirty for what are you selling those people\nDiapers and Coca Cola\nMaybe some beer\nThe people that are listening our show have money you're older you're more financially secure hats\nWho the advertisers want\nIf you're trying to sell a roof to somebody or an eye surgery or most anything else you go where the money yes right\nWhy do you Rob banks that's random mommy years so I don't have to worry how many people are listening because we have qualitative but enough of that John Stewart talking about the president and what exactly he does the gets their goat and this is from a guy who's not his fan stay tuned we'll talk about it\nTo do anything because obviously we're all caught up in this sort of daily fast I mean every single newspaper every radio station every bit of social media\nTo make money too well and you got those got electric bills you got food you know this guy is he's giving all\nCash cash flow and the Trump era for uh for the Syrian stations over\nThere I think that might have been an issue and maybe instead of the nation for the people who are the bean counters that we're in the journal is where we I think that our job is to\nNavigate the truth than to do the fact checking in all the rest of this I think that's what most of the\nCountry for\nWomen to\nBuy this baby them and they dive in and what he's
