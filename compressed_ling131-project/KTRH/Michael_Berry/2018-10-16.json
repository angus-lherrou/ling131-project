sort of awkward they have an openly communist member of the uh Seattle city is a communist or social side with as a matter openly is important part\nWell after Seattle did that and then rescinded at San Francisco's having their whole ... next month the city will vote on proposition ...\nWhich will raise over three hundred million dollars to add to the already three hundred eighty million dollars per year the city spends on their homeless problem\nHowever instead of a levy on the number of employees proposition C is essentially another income tax for companies that called the city home\nThe new mayor of San Francisco London Breed has said she has problems with the lack of accountability and the measure apparently the proposition does not provide enough checks and balances on how to account for the three hundred million dollars raised oh don't worry how the money spent just make sure\nWe got a law that nobody ever looks at how we spend the money on the homeless it's all how we can get more of it quote\nBy dramatically increasing our homelessness spending without working with neighboring counties proposition C could put us in the ... tenable she says the untenable inexpensive position of funding services for residents from other counties [noise]\nSan Francisco cannot solve homelessness simply by writing ever larger checks\nItself there is a limit to what we should and can spend ...\n... what you can spend on the homeless oh no this can't happen there can never be a limit to what you spend\nOn the children on the homeless on the environment there is an unlimited amount because rich people [noise] apparently\nUm mayor breed is figured out that the more money you spend on homelessness which by the way this is true\nThe more homeless you have I've told the story on air before so forgive me if you've heard this multiple times but Ted Koppel did especially used in a few years ago the whole city council at the time we have to be there [noise]\nAnd it was comparing homelessness in Houston to homelessness in San Francisco\nAnd they took to people who were homeless in San Francisco and two people who were homeless in Houston and they compared the resources [noise]\nIf you're homeless in Houston you can sleep on the street which violates our vacancy loss or you can go to one of the I'm a non profit organizations like star of hope great organization that will take you in and\nPut you give you a three ... caught you can eat and keep the rain and cold\nOff of you [noise] um\nAnd it's the basics right you're homeless but it it's enough to keep you alive at its it's humane it's compassionate [noise] it is Christian literally it is a Christian based organization that there are some others but star hope is probably the most prominent in ... I think probably the most effective\nIn the greater Houston community so the homeless gas in in Houston they get a place to stay and they get food\nUm and that's that's it right because we were not big believe you know we're not going to\nBuild a castle for you [noise] and then they went to the to homeless people they chose at random in San Francisco and life was really good they were getting so much more\nIn fact the homeless outreach there it's almost as if they make homelessness inducted into a job being homeless is like your career can live pretty well off of it\nBut I don't tell you that the point that out because you would have expected\nCity of San Francisco rather than spending on roads and police and the things that matter it's going to have higher taxes and more goodies for the ...\nWell is in fact so many goodies for the homeless that some people\nWho were homeless end up moving from places like Houston to San Francisco for a better job if you will the job of being homeless\nThe two people they chose well from Houston\nThey were homeless from Houston the homeless like every other community has their network they pass information the kittens good in San Francisco\nSo they hop a greyhound bus and they get to San Francisco and they immediately show up signing up no questions asked and they have a whole new career and beautiful San Francisco\nAnd what we learn from it\nIs that you can become what is known in the law as an attractive nuisance you can you can induce the very behaviors you don't want by subsidizing them\nThere's a famous public policy study known as the Indian cobra effect [noise]\nThey had a problem in an Indian Village with cobra is so they paid you to bring in for every cobra you brought in they found that the more they paid out the more ... they seem to have\nYeah because people went into cobra farming started raising cobra and getting paid for bringing them in so instead of reducing the cobra population by paying people you gave them a perverse incentive to make the problem worse [noise] and\nThere is liberalism in a nutshell [noise]\n\n\n\n\nServed a pro C.
