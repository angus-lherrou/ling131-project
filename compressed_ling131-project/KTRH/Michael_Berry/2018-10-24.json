probably thirty eight year old black woman\nUm she she wasn't talking to anybody though unfortunately we kept trying to make her ride make small talk um the other was the what do you think that role was Hispanic\nWoman that was too in front of us\nYeah um she was very attractive and and for some reason I said something inappropriate that Ramon chest asked me for I noted to him that she had

is true that it's a tricky little machine\nAnd it is true that you need to go slowly I admit I get a bit of anxiety when it comes to the machine because I Want to make sure that my vote is cast

find that to be a very important Mike Europe\nYeah hey Michael area good hey let me tell you what I\nWas thinking about this most of the day before I went to vote\nAnd I'm telling you I think this whole situation is just a little bit to clean it's almost like a part of a psychological operations plan where it's one of those it then that thanks so if the caravan didn't work now they try this you know everyone is very prominent and they all ended\nUp they're supposed to target at the same time but what concerns me about all this is this is not effective I I I fear that it might be a Democrat offered it where they you know knocked a prominent people that know about this but\nI think this is not effective Nancy Pelosi said it a week ago you know some there's going to be some collateral damage I fear somebody's going to get hurt at some point and this is the same party they tried to blame then got on a video tape for a while [noise]\nInteresting so do you think it is a Democrat operative who's doing this but not for NATO and at the highest levels\nI think that's exactly right I think there's some ... ability to kind of built in and I think that it's probably somebody who's young and likes to think they're big on strategy but those of us who've lived a long time and seeing how some of these things work is\nIt fear I fear that there's always the next step in the plant that doesn't work then something else is already lined up and it's just\nTo clean to have these individual and twelve days before election day getting these packages all the same time and I I think that if in fact\nWas so I'm not out there it will happen in Iraq on Monday because the police and the law enforcement people looking at that are really I think they're that yet and coming from the military background as myself I really think they're that good but in fact an operative where political\nA game of some short where no one would ever intended to get hurt I don't think anyone is going to get arrested don't they don't find out\nDo you think that they would say that last line\nWell I I think that if I think the first responders and the Alcohol Tobacco and firearms people in the ... I think they're really good such that if this was in fact intended to hurt somebody and we're really a real threat I think they'll have an arrest by next week\nDo you think that okay so so they're they're let me unpack that you think this was orchestrated by a Democrat operative do you think that anybody was intended to be harmed\nNo sir I don't know I'm just not this time but what I what I fear is that if this plan\nOr if this story does not played a way that they wanted it to a I think that I'm fearful that they might her one of their own and call it collateral damage him and blame it on Trump I mean I don't think any language actually done any more harmony in than what some of the other people have said you know you stack it up and people are so\nRight yeah no no and and I got I don't mean to suggest your opinions on important now I'm really want to get to your thoughts on who did this and what you what you believe they did what what they intended to do so you think they meant to frighten America\nAnd and maybe get an immediate boost in the polls the sympathy vote a but not have to actually harm anyone because they would be supporters of these people that that's what I think and a very interesting my very interesting [noise]\n\n\n\nFor\nOver thirty eight years Gulf Coast windows has been the trusted replacement window provider an installer and the greater Houston area seven one\nThree eight or nine fifty four fifty for\nJimmy Gulf Coast windows a plus rating with a better Business Bureau since Nineteen eighty four that say and some settled on three eight\nOr nine fifty four fifty for seven won three eight or nine fifty four fifty cats uh [noise]\nI don't think so buddy my back is release or I'm afraid I Can't\nThat's third time you said no because you're back ...
