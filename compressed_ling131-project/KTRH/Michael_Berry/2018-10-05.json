turn out to be a much much more influential and consequential jurist um especially for conservatives\nI think that he will be a more distinguished U.S Supreme court justice than Kevin all was we will just remember the Kavanaugh a process because of what we had to go through\nBut is am I excited about Brett Kavanaugh because he's the finest a judicial appointment made by President Trump no I actually wasn't a big fan of Kavanaugh as a judge I'm Still not a big fan of Kavanaugh's a judge he is a Kevin ... is more in\nBush model which is a much more moderate wing of the party [noise] um I Am more of the Scalia Clarence Thomas I'm model however\nAs I Know many of you feel when you attempt to disrupt the process than it no longer is about the quality of judge a Kavanaugh will be is about a the a a constitutional empowerment\nThat the president will be able to nominate a ... and that the Senate fulfill their constitutional requirement to pass judgment only on his fitness to serve\nYou know these idiots you're talking about he doesn't have the temperament because they've heard the word temperament it's always cute when non lawyers tried to play law because they watched Perry Mason or matlock he doesn't have the judicial temperament Michael he doesn't have the judicial temperament that's what they're writing all over the Internet\nYou don't know what judicial temperament means don't use big words that you don't know what they mean I find it interesting that people will feel so comfortable attempting to Wade into the waters of of a deep\nTechnical legal jargon and concepts

proportion or architecture or a civil engineering or electrical engineering or most any other thing but for some reason they hear a word and they think if I use that they weren't I sound like an lawyers I Will\nHe don't have the judicial temperament you don't even know what that means\nJudicial temperament as not referred to the fact that you don't get angry does not refer to the fact that you're not offended when you were accused\nOf rape does not refer to the fact that your family is receiving death threats and that in response your voice rises or lowers or a tear my form or you ... your teeth and\nAnd as with a stiff upper lip\nMake a veiled threat that it needs to stop those aren't\nIssues of judicial temperament\nI Confess today is a great day [noise] it is a great day ...
