already I don't know I don't know why\nI don't really enjoy that so it was rare for me to go to sit in the audience at an event like this but I decided\nIn what President Trump called his biggest audience for a speech almost twenty thousand inside about that number outside the numbers Barry every the media makes it smaller than it is Trump\nMakes it bigger than it is I don't know that it matters he says it's the biggest crowd he's ever drawn I don't know why he would need to make that up now\nSo I decided to study the crowd who aren't these people I started watching and listening\nAnd one of the things I noticed was this is quite a different crowd than you typically see for a Republican candidate now this crowd was there\nThe event was billed as Donald Trump during a rally for Ted Cruz\nAnd Donald Trump made very clear in his words it was not to be misunderstood he wants Ted Cruz back in the Senate he said nobody has done more to help him\nAdvance or repealing Obamacare tax cuts securing the border and Ted Cruz and there were a lot of other elected officials there but he made that very clear\nYou made very clear that that's the guy he wants and he addressed the fact he said look and and people forget this\nSaid look Ted Cruz and I had a bond during the campaign even did a rally together and the two of them were rising through the ranks of polling and then as the crowd than that and he said look we're gonna have to go after each other and he addressed that\nAnd the crowd seemed to appreciate the fact that that elephant in the room was addressed in and put to rest and the only people now worried about the bad blood that happened between Donald Trump Ted Cruz\nAre Democrats who keep saying I Can't respect their craze opposite Matt thanks to him and and they can support well you don't like Ted Cruz anyway why don't you just say you want people to vote for ... and not\nWorry about the rest but that while that event was designed\nTo take the Donald Trump supporter and say look guys I Need help in the Senate I Can't get my Supreme Court justices through I Can't get my tax reform through I Can't get the state or the death tax repeal done the way I Want I Can't build my well I got to have Ted Cruz there and I'm asking for you guys\nWho support me to support him and I think that message was made loud and clear\nBut what I noticed\nAnd this is the reason Trump won when two years ago today Nate Silver said there was an eighty six percent chance that Hillary Clinton\nWins the presidency two weeks from\n\nWhen an individual at that high level is allowed to get away with what I think she got away with\nBut to scream lock her up while the president is talking about the various planks of his platform was at a minimum distracting\nEveryone around me would turn and look at the guy he's having a great time he's under the influence of nothing because they didn't sell in the alcohol and he's been waiting all day for the seat\nAnd I kinda giggled inwardly thinking to myself that gosh probably felt shut out by the political process his entire life to the extent even had an interest in by God he feels empowered tonight\nNow do I wish he'd quit screaming yeah I'd actually like to hear what the president has to say but I can also recognize that\nHe's pretty excited maybe he's all jacked up all Mountain Dew\nHe fell at that moment that that guy up there on the stage speaks for him and I bet you he's never felt that way before in his entire life\nHe felt in bold and empowered he felt comfortable being able to screen things out\nSome of the other things he screamed out some F bombs totally inappropriate in a place like that awful nobody stopped him 'cause nobody wanted to kill the moment he was haven't\nNo I Would tell you when I hear things like that I cringe cringe because I don't want that to be projected as what Republicans are not because I'm embarrassed that he's got awful\nTeeth a cheap hair cut\nIs obviously worked outside his entire life he's probably aged far more than his number of years he's not had an easy life you can see it on his face you could tell it in his countenance but at this moment\nHe's proud of who in what he is and he knows what he is and what he's not\nWhat has tended to happen in the past is that the media has cast that guy in a light\nAs if he is nothing as if he is useless as if he is a\nBad person and truthfully the Republican Party is very discreetly kept him at a distance because he's the embarrassing cousin he's an uncle who drinks a little too much\nSo he was allowed to vote but never be too close to the stage because he might scream out enough bum\nMy friend Nick Searcy fantastic actor director has compared Trump\nUsing or has has explained Trump\nI guess somebody will

understands\nHow to put on the show he understands how to excite had an insight and ... he understands how to rally people there were people screaming at that rally last night that I bet you have never screamed at a political rally before last night\nRepublicans have traditionally typically put up candidates who talk about guns and gun and patriotism and how the Democrats are bad people and completely bored to tears\nTrump understands what moves that guy\nNow wherever you are on the educational totem pole socio economic manners culture which are put in quotes high culture refinement sophistication civil civilized behavior whatever you want to call it\nI Will posed this question why is it that American politics has celebrated the efforts by the Democrats to reach out to poor blacks\nTo reach out to poor Hispanics and bring\nThem into the political process and make offers to them not always on the basis of the most high minded ambition not always on a visionary aspirational basis sometimes on the basis that don't you hate widely 'cause he sure hate you\nBut it's okay because these are poor black people that we're finally getting excited about the political process\nSo why is it wrong to reach out to poor white people why is it wrong to reach out to the working class white guy\nWhy is it wrong when he feels good about himself because the media are white liberal elites and some of them come from some of those families that they're making fun of they have to destroy the poor uncouth white voters\nBecause they embarrass them\n\n\n\nWould it be great to
