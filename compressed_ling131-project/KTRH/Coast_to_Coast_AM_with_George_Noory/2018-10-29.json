{"month": "10", "state": "TX", "station": "KTRH", "content": "Well I ... a very big company and they can take care of themselves but I have to tell you this subject just infuriates me\nAnd it's it's ... mainly because a company I worked for years ago with a similar kind of abusive process this is harassed by pure and simple at this point\nFour years ago more than four years ago now at the urging of a bunch of climate activists like Al Gore and Bill McKibben in Sierra Club [noise]\nBitterness general Democrat attorneys general in my take fourteen different states got together ensued eggs on mobile\nA over a theory that they have known about climate change way back in the seventies that to some scientist or that they employed had written some memo that got uncovered and\nYou know indicating that he thought that the you know there is a case to be made for global warming blah blah blah anyway so they filed a lawsuit\nThey spent the last four years making all sorts of a document requests from eggs on costing the company tens of millions of dollars in legal fees by now I'm sure a they produce millions and millions of documents in in these various court cases that have been brought\nUp the the these attorneys general have been thrown out to different courts now on summary judgments for any lack of merit to their case previous cases and the the how they keep getting us into court\nAnd it will certainly make me go these are the attorneys state attorney general and they you know they have a lot of discretion in the party to conduct investigations but the presiding judge and all of this uh up in New York gave them until this week\nTo bring a case are there he was going to an order and an end to this investigation and the state attorney general of New York to replace their Schneiderman if you remember Mr Schneiderman of course was forced to resign earlier this year when it was revealed her alleged\nThat he has a serial woman abuser so this this lady and took his place\nDecided to bring this new law suit which is\nIs a joke like frankly in and her it's the securities fraud Lawson basically that claims a that ExxonMobil misled its investor by using a one proxy price for the cost of future\nPricing of carbon in in other words\nIs speculating about future carbon taxes being an active or cap and trade system at whatever cost they use long proxy prize\nFor investors and another proxy price for some of their internal reporting for certain entities and the company well the problem with is is\nThat the price they were reporting to the investors first of all was higher than the war and they were reporting internally so if they were they the the state attorney general claims they're misleading investors about the real cost of climate change will if anything\nTo their investors they were overstating it because they're using a higher proxy price\nBan what they were using in ... so that\nThey empower basis for lawsuit makes no sense in the second thing is this whole lawsuit has already been brought and been thrown out of court\nOr by a group of eggs on former employees to sue the company what the exact same rationale a few years ago and we're also thrown out of court on some re judgment so I'm Sorry I got emotional about that but it just makes me angry [laughter]\nOkay we know it's going to happen it's just unfortunate that Exxon Mobil going through this let's go into our news segment\nCalled\nThe David let's talk about the Trump effect and you know Trump is doing so much to a\nReally affect positively the oil and gas and I guess because he supports and believe that he gets an ... and something happened today that he actually issued a permit today for the state of Alaska tell me a little bit about the Trump effect what's going on\nYeah so previously um there has been drilling in the Beaufort Sea which is above the north shore of Alaska way up in the Arctic Circle\nThe Beaufort Sea in the church ISI are up there and there has been drilling in the state martyrs which are within three miles of the coast up there but there's never been any drilling production facilities\nIn federal waters which are further out in three miles a much deeper and this week yeah the the interior of our but uh for the first time ever an issue\nBut for an oil and gas production facility and the federal waters in the Beaufort Sea so this is just another example as you say the Trump Administration has had a very heavy focus on\nA strengthening the oil and gas industry here in the United states uh for a lot of different reasons national security being one of them and this is just another example of the kinds of things that are doing to it because there is a vast amount of oil underneath the Beaufort Sea\nThat companies have never been able to for far before so Al Gore was the company that is permanent Houston based company was the biggest most active drillers in the United states and uh you know it's just a big deal is first time a discount of permits ever been an issue\nWell very interesting and every week we're going to cover something new on our segment called Trump effect until next week David when we bring you

to watch out for [noise]\nHouston sounds good everywhere he okay Google Play Katie our age and I are draining out\n[noise]\n\nWelcome back to coast to coast George ... with us we'll get to your calls to George tell me about ruled pioneer what's going on there\nWell I've decided that this is the year to put a little more effort into rural pioneer a friend of mine who uh is an oil rig engineer and yet there are still oil rigs I yeah there are many [laughter]\n... and ... goes back up which is one of those left field possibility\nA yeah things will be cooking in Houston again although they're not write out a pioneer uh started gosh a long time ago um I I was looking for a little different voice and urban survival\nUh urban survival was my capstone project in my MBA program back in the mid nineties\nAnd um the problem with urban survival inside it not trade market and so if you do a Google Search on the word urban and survival\nUh you'll get something like seven million ... and and and it really was you know it's a lot of fun and uh between that and um the\nPeople ... dot com website uh I I feel like we actually had a major contribution to the starting at the prep or movement\nIn the ah two thousand two thousand two period when I was living on a sailboat and we really were ready to sail around the world at one point [noise] um but rural pioneer is a little different rural pioneer actually did trademark\nA and that website is about being a modern subversive in a nice legal way and what I mean by a modern subversive or somebody who actually tries to do a little bit of recycled re purpose for use\nA a place where we can talk about things that really kicks off a I don't like to buy things twice\nAnd one of the problems we have in America is that there are certain items that you almost have to buy every six months every year every two years five years or things like plastic gas cans\nOr oil man who is is his moniker because he he he doesn't want to use his real name in public\nUh but uh he he wrote a devastating a piece of we've been we've been complaining about how bad plastics are you know plastics are everywhere and they're not really the right product\nFor things like consumer consumable almost every country in the world use of class because it's cleaner it doesn't have partying compound it doesn't break down in the sun\nIt doesn't float around the Pacific you know all of those things and and and yet there's that there really are either extremes of environmentalism or there are extremes of plastic ... and and what real pioneers is about\nIs trying to find the rational way to recycle rip purpose for use\nA and make a life that is not in the box for being put into there's a there there's a major downsizing of America remember we were talking earlier about the\nUh the migration in virtual space sure part and parcel of that is a new housing is coming online that is designed around the concept of three hundred fifty a square feet\nPer person and people are expected to use that square footage to live most of their life in except when they go to public places where there is a different way you can you can find inexpensive rural property\nYou can put a little cabin on it you can have\nYou know some basic gardening some basic survival ah goods and lower property taxes because you get taxed on the improvements on property as much as anything else in in in and in fact just to give you an idea of comparison\nFriend of mine up in Seattle uh the Seattle area this year he and his wife are paying almost three thousand dollars a property tax and that's nothing I mean seven eight thousand\nOr even ten twelve thousand is not uncommon in Southern California\nAnd and yet out here and what I call the outback\nOr art total tax bill this year on twenty nine acres was eight hundred a eight hundred eighty seven dollars or so\nSo so there there are different ways to live and uh we we don't honor thrift like we used to in America or when you and I were young we were our grandparents talking about\nIn our day yeah in the day oh gosh I mean it\nWas it was saving stamps it was you know building your own you know\nPaying things off they like doing it with cash\nYeah you you you live the cash lifestyle you buy quality and if something breaks what'd your grandpa to\nSix to ... exactly well you know that's the kind of thing that that that\nWe we don't care about too much on the prepping websites we don't hear about a American inventiveness\nI have a I have a really nice riding lawnmower and it's got a twenty three horse power the twin engine on it and a couple of years ago the starter gear broke so I tore apart to fix it\nAnd it was plastic I called the manufacturing and said what the hell are you doing why are you using a ... you know plastic starter gear and I got you know Fifteen minutes of run around when the fact of the matter is you know starting years on cars are virtually all metal\nBecause plastic just doesn't cut it but these guys in the small engines world have made a fortune for themselves\nSelling twenty dollar replacement gears every three years when ... you know start five hundred times there you go you've got to buy something so you know I take a certain amount of pride\nIn flying a fifty year old airplane driving a Fifteen year old truck and a ten year old car\nOr a George let's think calls for his little lining up my friend let's go to Tom in riverside California Tom Europe with us\nYeah I'd like your guest George or the or you know a thing that bothers me you know one of the things you said was a migration into this country or the uh what I look at it as a some sort of program of forced or immigration or not or they're being forced but\nIt's reinforced on the American people\nAnd uh we're losing a our identity really I feel that uh over the last thirty five forty years\nAnd uh all that that is being forced you can see it you know a well being forced to accept these people and to this country and what about other people that are standing on the street corners\nWhy are they being given job I Would think that if you were in charge of anything you want to be creating a reviving Detroit\nA reviving our industries and seeing that a vocational programs are in the high school\nAnd then we can get our our act together not bringing people in and where do these people I Can't get enough money to get out of this country where these people coming from war torn country and El Salvador Honduras or the middle east\nAnd Africa where are they getting the money to buy houses and buy cars I you know I just throw that out there and I'll take your\nOkay you know he's right I I have always been docile how people from some of these poverty stricken nations in in you know I feel sorry for them for all of them but I mean how do they buy things here so quickly\n... because they they have a a very high level\nOf incentive and we don't have that same entrepreneurial core because it's been largely bread out of us in our public education system that we need to go to work for somebody else rather than becoming responsible for starting our own business\nTo generate local products don't get me wrong on the immigration thing I have I have written Rand after rant after rant a on urban survival ant and also I looked at the economics of it over on the people ... side\nI don't like it it is not what we sent people to Washington to do we did not send them to bring\nIn foreign people who um are ... many of whom may not even

inside I I'll be ... now with my phone number okay I'll be practical\nTo NPR angle but we love you\nAnd I I have a two part question and I'll let him over there at first I like to hear more I thanked me for the new English of young method I Am looking at ... and ... and ... part of my concern now is that we have ...\n... ... what a heated down Scott called beat ... meaning that\nNothing on the eastern philosophy say it's my and nothing is what it means no here who um look who say trying T I in a day\n... and pick up on the most dangerous book in the world and nine eleven is now the ... and Peter ...\nTraveling the finish their forces or Glenn law of American political ... crap another way beds I and I guess the clicking around ... because it seems that if no ...\nIn a way heading toward ... as you said a again good Twenty one or the new law or that and at AOL ... had to ... and I ... in the theater with the\nFourth life continue rent so what is your ...\nAnd about the current it with people understanding that if not what it seems to be an outlet in over there and thank you put a bogus\nOkay good well first\nOf all a little bit on methods ah methods that I use are literally all over the board because not all problems can be looked at the same way uh one approach is a basic financial modeling\nA sitting down with a spreadsheet or another approach is to look at charts of the stock market from the present day\nUh and from past periods of American history and look for similar policies and market performances ah another approach that I use is called the aggregate index approach\nAh that's based on the uh the notion that on any day of the week there is only so much money in the world\nAnd by noticing uh the total performance of global markets one can infer whether money is being made or being lost global\nSo that's that's a a a real basic look at that now as to nine eleven glad you brought that want to um the reason for that is this\nWe were in a position where we could have slid\nInto a greater depression\nIn the fall of two thousand one\nNow a hybrid extensively about this at the time the charge were all lining up nicely\nThe Internet collapse took about ... depending on which number you use but five point a trillion dollars for about one third of an entire year's GDP off the table in about a twelve month period of time\nSo um when you talk about ritual and consciousness I don't think there's as much weight should be given to the notion of consciousness so much and it should be given the cash flow and people's financial interest\nBecause you see what happened with nine eleven is is it is a a it is a large enough economic stimulus\nSad it becomes highly suspicious or economic stimulus in that it gave us an incentive to go to war\nA economic stimulus because we hired initially I think it was fifty thousand a additional personnel for TSA a there was a huge a stimulus in terms of I hate to call it the terrorism industry but let's face it\nIt's a it's an industry a terrorism has become an institution\nAnd huge profits have been made by consulting fees and by contractors a full body scanner developers not seeing any of this is bad but\nUh from a forensic economic standpoint my my it sure is coincidental that when we're about to drop into hey Great Depression along comes I'm massive economic stimulus\nAnd that was followed by Alan Greenspan a\nLack of diligence that led to the no dock mound\nSomebody who was sleeping at the ... but\nBut not necessarily I mean you know the the bad news yeah uh it looks like a suspicious coincident but you know the good news is the unemployment rate is still not as bad as it would have been\nAnd and by having cereal bubbles what's happened since two thousand is a we have this economic Gulch out in front of it's called the greater depression\nAnd we're kind of building a bridge of surreal bubbles and wars to get across that go to the problem is that as we're doing that\nUh the dynamics of the the money flows in the world politics are such the coach keeps getting bigger so every time we think we're getting close to the other side with the new ... new bubble and this is that\nWhat happens is we actually just push the problem out kick the can down the road and when the depression get charity enemy it us depression which the Nineteen thirties and that was largely a U.S and European this one's going to be global it'll take down and it'll take down trying it'll take down your up\nWe'll probably be the last ... go simply because of dollar a Gemini\nWhich so far seems

year when you hit that five mark\nFive or six when you go\nOh well I have what they had been injured\nAnd you didn't tell when I did tell well I'm\nI'm a bad person or\nCulpable or whatever you phew new night\nYeah and then that hit me like this could have been\nAwful you know what and I and so my mom after I Can't shut up\nDid you use this growing up for your own life\nAbsolutely even though it's sometimes I you know the funny part as I say you know sometimes I don't listen I like everybody else I'm human it\nI wouldn't know the right thing to do and be stubborn and turn around and do the wrong thing course it didn't work out of course\nI've never done you know but then you know you you live and learn\nSo how did this evolution or curfew you where you started helping law enforcement\n[noise] um [noise]\nI was I'm not fully bow\nSeventeen years old\nI'm ... and there was an incident that that took place I'm prior to this home that we moved into 'em and and the kid was actually missing now mind you at seven years old I told my mother this is what I was going to do with my life\nI was kind of the color blue there was somebody that went missing and television and pay and I said oh that's what I'm going to do my mother was like OK yeah\nYou know like no big deal right um by the time I I I reached the stage where we had moved into a home and the boy had\nBeen missing and he used\nTo live in that house [noise] I didn't know this at first\nBut I kept seeing him and he kept talking to me and\nAt this point I didn't know exactly what to do I did know here where his parents lived but I'm not going to say anything\nYou know um stir up problems [noise] so I kind of ... and ended up I had a few friends that I could talk to thank goodness and\nUm they understood you to the\nYeah the few that I had and what you you don't have a lot of friends when you're like that both parents tell the kids to stay away from you [laughter] you know that that gets so that's part of life I'm\nTrying to get under ... notch me away from my mom\nWould tell their kids that I was which was a strange time back then okay [laughter] um and I I'm like okay you know\nWhat I Would have been burned up the state to remind them do they\nHand so afraid of that some days [laughter] [laughter] you never know but\nYou know I I was when I got this information and I absolutely didn't know what to do well a friend um well actually was a police officer and she's ... can you you know can you tell my dad any of this I'm\nLike I I don't know it's kind of you know maybe a little embarrassing or you know he's going to think bad she goes no my dad's a really open person\nSo I did I tell them what happened\nLo and behold a month later they did find his body oh and\nWhat was the murder or was murdered was murdered okay uh-huh Fifteen Years old that they will find the killer did you help them find the killer\nIn that case I I did not help find the killer but the body was exactly as I had\nA drive and where no one location but let me ask\nYou this deal because I've known a lot of law enforcement who don't believe the psychic world\nAnd so I'm asking if you were considered as a suspect when you tell some police officers information but only you and the killer no and they know\nThey kind of look at you differently there's no question about whole\nAbsolutely I was called in and\nI'm On a case and and and I talk about this case uh in in the book I'm\nMissing and presumed\nMhm and I'm the king of the one we're close is the chapter but I was pulled in on that case\nUh when I got to the police station after making the location of the body and police were notified they sat me down and I'm I'm assuming they just want to say hey you know okay what went on ... where ... what did you see around any you know\nAll of a sudden they're in my face go why did you do it\nWon't just like a\nJust like that I'm like so um because I thought I I I ... I was kind of you know taken back on Fox okay you're being very rude and the ... the a rude is not much you know what\nSide and I'm thinking okay I I enjoy that group of people I ... I have a site that's kind of a you know cocky so um you know I said well I thought I'd take somebody out that I didn't know\nI say you're kidding me I had no I never met these people before I certainly never met this person\nIf you have been doing your job you would have found in six months ago\nSo the back down\nUm and he kept saying he goes well we know you had something to do with us\nSee they don't they don't believe you that's why\nNo absolutely not and I ... I I think sometimes and I tell people this when you're I'm Upset sometimes it actually can enhance your ability sometimes good sometimes bad um\nAnd at that moment I just blurted out the responsible party\nI mean I just I just was spirited all out and it's like [noise] and then I thought okay I don't even know where that\nThat was actually at a forecast clear skies Los ... eighty or excuse me in the sixties for the rest of the overnight tomorrow so they started to work we planned on hides in the mid eighties right now is that many to clear to keep the our age west side nor side likes this twenty four hour weather center ... ten thirty\nOne our top story while the suspected shooter accused of murdering eleven worshippers at a synagogue in Pittsburgh will be in court tomorrow Robert Ballard is facing numerous charges including federal hate crime counts\nIt could be given the death penalty if convicted at least eight hours under the tree of life synagogue yesterday boarding and opened fire with those soap ... three handguns\nIsrael is showing Jewish American support in the aftermath of the deadly shooting at the synagogue in Pittsburgh Jerusalem's old city walls were lit up last night and display the message with Israeli at us flags along with the message we're with you Pittsburgh\nAnd the Boston Red Sox or World Series champions after five to ... over the Dodgers in game five in Los Angeles just about a half an hour ago busted one of the best of seven ... four games to one it's the fourth championship since two thousand for for the red Sox in their ninth overall\nNews on the band and Katie outrage dot com or next updates that Lebanon breaking information as it happened to us down for more than ... coast to coast they get with George Nouri either I'd sharpened used in news weather in traffic station news radio seven forty Katie our age\nThat holiday movie my family economy my job to the White House Houston's morning news with Jimmy marriage and share a prior tomorrow by the way to live your life your life\nWhy news radio seven forty Katie\nR.

where she is you get older no okay I went\nWith okay I can I can try to help you with us\nAll right so you're playing a straight absolutely All right so um\nI ended up going to the area\nWhere this case took place which happened to be quite a few states away [noise] um I was very uncomfortable or riding around with with the killer [laughter]\nDo you call or did you call a law enforcement first\nI did not because\nI Know that's dangerous\nYeah but you can't do that I'm a I'll tell you why [noise] so the phone call goes sort of like Hi I'm a psychic and I and I think this guy killed people and I'm going I'm going out and vehicle with them but I Want to tell you you know that I think he did this and that go up next\nI said so when he comes back we all have everything together\nSo we did all that well lo and behold\nThe officer was right the area describes he recognized it being from that area of course they're going to and they did find her\nThey found her within what a day or two\nOh a few hours a few hours long and I ran out and he took off how long has she been altered deal\n[noise] I Believe at that point\nIt was like sixty days\nOr somewhere decomposed oh yeah and there were\nOf course they perform an autopsy but how did I Do he fainted when he found out he did very well how ... how she murdered 'em strangled shoestring above zero mhm so now we go back to him she means a lot of these phone in front of the officers fence legitimately\nOh and I don't think so are you seeing anybody\nCatch themselves as they fall\nInto that and I'm like oh\nHe gently kinda he went down but it was like hand went back to you know you're you know so\nAt what point did he become the suspect in get arrested or is he free\nAt that point he's free ... now\nAnd I was now at that point of having to go home and I tell the detective I I have to return to my area but I you know here's some stuff that I did see whether you want to believe it or not you know he goes oh I'm starting to really think something's going on here I went well thank you\nUm are you are legitimate were the part of it though I was a legitimate or\nAnd I said and and this is what I saw and this is what I I I see where he was\nI also look at the person that gave him the alibi the problem is they left the paper trail so they couldn't have been he couldn't have been with them at the certain location because this person was here\nAnd another area and if you pull the cell phone records and other stuff\nYou're going to find out that they weren't even in this state when they gave it to my farm\n\nOr going to be checking things out six weeks later though he was arrested\nShowing these arrested why did they call you did they have the courtesy to let you know what was going on\nNow to do that show

emailed you\nYeah mistake\nYou might have well I still think you would have been as such but but yeah you do we ever get a motive for\n[noise] you know not really I'm a ... and everything that was said and read there the police ever really came up\nWith a mode of 'em\nI honestly felt that it was because um he had someone else\nAnd was thinking that he needed to end it with\nThe wife and and she had a huge insurance policy\nHe had gone insurance in about a year and a half prior to that of course he's the beneficiary right oh of course that makes some suspect right there too well no the only got\n... with that murder the little twist on that case is their child died six years prior\nWell what's the time with that other than it was so I really believe he murdered the child\nOh my God are you kidding this gardens they didn't hit him with it\nBut I mean his life in prison but you know\nYeah I understand no justice for the child\nDoes the victim of the dead person do the shoals or the

remember reporting blizzard man as a as a newscaster back when those stories were unfolding and seemed like every couple of days or be a new citing or a a new angle on it\nAnd it was kind of fun it was like an oddity almost like a circus ... kind of a a story or something to put somebody in a costume or\nA ... an oddity like that as opposed to something that really raised the goose bumps such as the story you tell them this book about something called the wind man it's a story from staffordshire England in two thousand nine you remember the details\n[noise] oh yeah ... ironically um that was at a place called the kind of chase in central England only about five miles from where I grew up as a kid so I Know the area very well and it's a it's a large area of a woodland ...\nAnd I'm like certain places around the world that seem to be to the hot spots for power normal phenomena the kind of chase he's just the same you know they become known as window areas where it seems every fit in each brother come through you know at various times\nAnd this was a particularly weird case but what was intriguing about it was it was taken very seriously by the local newspaper the chase post\nAnd somebody had seen this um what looked like a humanoid figure sort of literally flying or a soaring would be a better term to use over the woods are at high speed um you know kind of a\nLike a flying mine I'm not unlike I guess the you know the stories coming out of point platforms\nIn the sixties or with a ... something you know kind of power outage in that respect and there were there were a number of independent witnesses who came forward and spoke to the press and one of them even spoke to the local police older I don't really know what the police could have done about it it's um [noise]\nBut it was intriguing that you know you have this spate of weird activity in this area which he's already notorious for sightings of things interesting enough light the dog mine and ah the find some black dogs and also the large black cats as well\nYou know they should they should just say ... or ... or or possibility um\nYou know I'm not going to tell people they're big forty some strange creature that come from the far side of\nThe moon which I don't believe that date by the way [laughter] but um\nYou know for someone to specifically states something along those lines is is not the way to go you know\nYeah there's a story in the monster book about something you go that's called that squash and you share that with us\n[noise] well yeah the the the ... is he's a really strange one and again it's sort of falls into one of the cats agrees the more than anything else is something that's\nSort of pops up is not singing again and just kind of I'm just sort of baffles paper that there are a lot of cases like that where um you know something pops up and people who like want to know was that\nAnd then he's never seen again but um this particular case is an interesting one I'm cutting I pull Nineteen sixty four and Buckley, Washington and I'm actually quite close to my ... on the witness in mind I'm young man named Brian Khan failed\nUm he sold the strange creatures while he was driving along the road\nAnd it was sort of humanoid with this huge wings\nBut it was kind of Harry as well [noise] scares me and had the shining a yellow eyes\nBut they sort of the ... the hair angle combined with the large wings um you know the the the Harry body and the wings kind of people said oh it's not you know it's not sasquatch because he's got wings but he kind of looks a bit like\n... ... and um and for a while in Nineteen Ninety four it was actually quite big using that area and then like a lot of other these\nYou know there's other cases he just sort of became part of the local legend them you know the areas folklore and so\nYou've got a lot of men in black stories women in black story you and I'm Talking about that before a that might be a ... year than the men in black and and then some of those cases you know they seem otherworldly just out of place\nUh you you know we we've been accustomed because of the movies or do you think that maybe there are some secret government agents but have you ever had any indications that maybe some of them are\nSort of very human government type operatives who are operating under the umbrella of something like a men in black trying to emulate the the real mystery and figuring they can get away with it that no one will believe the witnesses who see them\nYeah well I've got to be honest with you Georgia I'm doing fine books now I'm On this phenomena foreign demand in black and one of the women in black and I have to say that the vast majority of all the reports I get don't send anything like you know they stepped out of the Pentagon the CIA all the FBI and I say\nI'm a you know nothing like the the concept in the movies that typically are described as looking\n... you know go on and the skins live ... white white um um people talk about how vaccines have the ability to mind control the personal hypnotized them\nThey were they even talked about when they're in close proximity to them that by full and sick afterwards almost like a like a soup and actually infection or something along those lines\nAnd um there are cases when the men in black and the women in black and turned up in homes right after paper being using wager boards which puts another angle to its um but there's no doubt in my mind again um that's you know this is a real phenomenon but it's not like it's\nPortrayed in the movies it's more sort of like a you know like a golf a horror story mixed in with the X files you know you put those two issues together that's that's how I Would sort of describe this the ... street it's far beyond you know just guys in a black suits walk\nIn and you know\nI'm asking it into contact sort of like with\nOr mutilation is I think you know there's there's a lot of evidence that the these animal relations are carried out by something other than just um um humans in helicopters or that some of them are truly inexplicable and then you have a whole other wave of them that\nSurely seemed like they are humans that are carrying out the same kind of thing for whatever reasons um this is sort of leading us to where we are going in the next hour to talk about your other book on the alien abduction files but where in human agencies and that doesn't mean government agencies but humans\nOr pretend to be something paranormal get away with something that's really weird and they they do it in a way that so that there isn't a lot of serious scrutiny by people like you are people like me or or other investigators\n[noise] well I mean I think you know when you talk about Academy of tuition is you know you've got a really weird and exploit couple and then some which are apps to explain\nThere is a parallel with demanding black but you know in some cases I think government agencies are responsible for the paper I think it's a very small degree they January unexplained ones and the way it was\nWhat I think it happened on a few occasions and there is some evidence to support\nIs over the years agencies may actually unemployed the legends of the men in black I was amazed to cover their tracks in other words\nIt might be able to think government no men in black radio but I don't know what they are but it doesn't even them from using the legend among hey\nToo quiet April or may not want to have them talking about that I see so the

George Burns hassle\nTrue and bathroom ...\nAll of them had FBI falls out putting on them one of the main reasons pain was because they claimed when I'm interviewed by the FBI that yes they ... they are and see Israel eons\nBut they told the FBI that they the Iranians had a government or governments very different two hours and bordering on\nCommunism and I'm so that really opened the eyes of the FBI to the extent that for example George finds hassles FBI file 'em is extremely extensively about an inch thick um Georgia ... is about a hundred and fifty pages\nI'm over ... was about four to and so on so you know we have a precedent for the abduction phenomenon with the contact tape painful now\nIn the fifties excuse me in the early sixties\nThings really kicked off I'm with the Iranian abduction phenomenon in September sixty one I'm with the bacterium Bonnie hill case which is I guess he's a defining moments you follow gee when it wasn't the first abduction case on record but he was certainly the one that really opened people's eyes when\nJohn full of wrote his book on the case they interrupted journey\nNow in the story of basketball and a hill that coming back from a vacation in Canada they say the strange lights in the sky\nAnd then things kind of get weighed a they don't fail rights they you know everything seems a bit surreal and strange\nAnd I get back home and then they start having these weird dreams and nightmares of being taken on board the strange craft would they be strange creatures\nAnd being subjected to a stranger and intrusive\nExperiments now what's potentially intriguing\nIs that I found a file in the British national archive on it revolved around among Ronald wild man who was a delivering a vehicle in the south of England and it was like the early hours of the morning about to I Am an essay was driving these vehicles to the location\nThey the lights on the call when I was on the cars started in time to a halt\nAnd they should they should become known as the the vehicle interference phenomenon where they knew follow Jake what's intriguing\nIs that they they ah British police force actually handed over the investigation because they report to the police found it over to a group within the British royal Airforce caused pulled a a promise to security services are sort of like the\nThe James Bond they feel like of the of the royal Airforce they sort of get involved in espionage and counter intelligence things like that\nWhat's interesting is that in the file it talks about how the they the they promised them security services interviewed Ronald wild man by this encounter with a with a ... to a halt and the UFOs in front of him and the most telling an intriguing aspect\nIs that he told the police and this is a direct quotes\nThat he was modeled about the time\nWhich is an interesting thing because that's sort of sounds just like you know the whole missing time on goal of abduction low in today's world that Ronald ... in the fall actually refers to him saying that yes he sold his UFO calmed down lights went out of his vehicle\nAnd then he kind of fell to ... strange checked his watch and there was something about states it's actually you know portrayed completely and the file but he says he was much older by the time which I think you know you put all those aspects together that has the potential for being a significant abduction case\nI think about the contact D's and I remember reading about them when I first got into this subject and thinking sort of amused meant well there were there were a interesting colorful harmless sort of weirdos um but the more you read about um the more interesting they become a course people like a dam ski\nThen you realize that these guys showing these crazy stories some some of them would say you know they they met these women and went to Venus and things like that and you you you you have a hard time taking the literally but when you realized that the government is really does followed them around and takes it seriously for whatever reason\nIt makes me think of like the Roberts and men or that the CIA scientists study the UFO topic and they include the UFOs themselves are not a threat to national security but reporting you up those might be because maybe the Russians could somehow manipulate a public opinion\nIs that a justification for going around people like a dam ski bathroom those folks\nOh yeah because I mean George ... is a first book flying saucers have landed published in the early fifties that that's sold him huge figures are gigantic numbers of books were sold\n'em on and a damn ski went on the lecture circuits are all around the country and he was talking about how the aisle and supposedly have this sort of a communist type\nOf governments um the communism was the way of the future and the FBI open that file on a damn ... um predominantly because he was someone you're talking about a controversial subject namely UFOs and contact with ... bucks\nThe FBI was more concerned as to how painful reading these books and go into his lectures\nAll the accused synagogue a shooter will be in court later today Eric sharp

you know of course there are many different kinds of animals that are carved up in the same manner cattle and horses and\nDeer and other other kinds of creatures but a channel or the the ones we know about that have been publicized most I Can't imagine what the total dollar amount of losses for a livestock losses for ranchers and farmers could be but it's a pretty substantial\nAnd when you look at how the government has responded the FBI\nHad some ... agents who looked at it a very cursory examination investigation that really didn't get to the bottom of it and then nothing so what do you make of that and and combined with the the black helicopter phenomena that you discuss in this book\nWell yeah I think you know the the black helicopter phenomena and um he's clearly a real one and it does seem to be tied to both capital mutilation\nAnd um [noise] the idea and abduction phenomena and one of the things it's as being no taste and I think there's probably some truth to this is the idea that these whoever's flying these helicopters\nPotentially I think is part of an organization that operates outside of government you know my actually my sort of do research and work for the government but it's not you know like the CIA or anybody like that fly helicopters I don't think I think it is sort of um\nSo she took them in and raised in Missouri on and uh they uh when they got into their teens\nAnd that is that they didn't have any hair on their head on or anything but it wasn't a bond movie where they had moved on the rise in it that she took them then it went to school and we were fourteen years old they a duck out of school because they love each stream the calendar\nAs a matter of fact that he built a cabin Adams there's reform\nRape violate German and um they um you know like you say very intelligent on boys both with twins well then you then went on when he was about sixteen Seventeen years old got a very bad a cut on his own ... to ...\nWell they couldn't pin local hospital and\nThey ah it felt like they will have to lead transfer you can cook it lost so much but when when they took his my tight they couldn't find any type of matched anyway and they check the place and then he checked his twin brother and he had the same lead type\nSo any of that they had to use his blood transfusions lean rated went back to the phones and nothing happened and they went into the army they drafted in young the Nineteen forties to when\nWhen they came back from the army they went out in the swamp and am when Kevin was they live there and they grew in town maybe once a month for supplies and so forth but then then they had set up a ... I'm ... I'm ...\nI think you told us the story before on the air to learn about getting burned down yeah then you get burned down\nNo nothing but now that I'm really\nNot what happened to these guys because we're running out of time here would next on the road\nThey um they like you say I swam and or some people went after seeing because they hadn't seen in town any of that they were missing they get they couldn't find anywhere and the only thing they could find was wrong it shatters the cabin with some had a good thing or something for them wrong\nAnd they called they put this college women very came out like that and he couldn't figure out any of them are they missing and they they never heard anything from even want to\nThank you for sharing that story I'm going to get next to take on that Thanks John appreciate your calling neck beard that one before anything like\nThat story but what I have had a\nKind of similar situations where you know ... in within the family was now but um you know one of the grandmother you know back in the thirties or forties long before you know the whole modern era of you followed you took off\nThat there were abduction like experience his body fat in

odd circumstances and I'm reminded him ... to this day I mean there's everything from like violent big foot type creatures\nTo kill them you have sort of Russian military experiments you despite all the race and the several books written on the subject there's no one hundred percent consensus on what actually happened it remains\nYou know it may be but there are a lot of weight aspects to this

I was wondering the first thing I was wondering when I finished this book was how do you get away with this you are a seemingly respectable guy teaching at a grade school and I wonder if you're if you're going to catch Greece for doing it\n[laughter] it gives me um [noise]\nNo it's um yeah how do I get away get away with it it's um you know a lot of people and cultural studies or people who are interested in the study of religion or you know we do we do get a pass to study really cool fantastic things right on people's um unusual experiences and unusual states have consciousness religious experiences\nPeak experiences what whatever you want to call them so yeah it is kind of a privilege to be to be a professor and and get a chance to just kind of follow my interests and that's really ... how this book came along um\nIt came out of an earlier book I was working on that look that sort of the science of religious experience and spirituality um but as you know this one movement in New directions by thinking about\nScience and physics and cosmology and how it's sort of fantastic scientific ideas have led to um have led to at least a new vocabulary that people are using now to talk about your death experiences and and the parents is and and even after life experiences and so on\nYou mentioned in the in the beginning uh and of course as a as somebody who studies\nReligious studies and religion and how it interacts with the world in popular culture you mentioned in the beginning how a believer in church um a formal religion organized religion is sort of\n... around the western world but interest and spiritual and spirituality topics or has has remain strong or you may increase that that's a that's kind of a challenge for somebody in your line of work to figure out why that's happening\nYeah I think it is I think it is and um you know that's why a lot of us are trying to study these these new forms of spirituality I mean that that was really as you say that was really how I began to book with this puzzle you know the problem which is you know people still in America seem to have a lot of\nGuess we'll be called spiritual beliefs they ... him pretty high numbers in America I'm believing and goes for believing spirits or believe in God I'm and yet on the other hand as you say\nA participation and traditional religious congregations are affiliation in traditional really with traditional religious congregations those things seem to be going down\nUm how how can we think about is how can we talk about those you know how how is it the case that people seem to have a very robust\nSense of belief and other world um and spirituality and the abdomen are really in the absence of participation and traditional congregation so that's what I tried to think about and\nTry to think well where where people getting that these ideas you know where where people getting their beliefs their ideas about other world and\nI'm kind of a big science documentary person and I'm I'm real you know I'm kind of like a science nerd and in a sense and interested in pop science pop science book and I think there is there's a lot of sort of fantastic scientific concepts that circulate now in our culture and\nI think uh you know concepts like\nDark matter dark energy or even thinking about infinity a or thinking about the the multiverse with thinking about higher dimension I think all of these fantastic scientific concepts which I think scientists themselves embrace with ... with a sense of odd mystery and and wonder\nI think those concepts are sort of uh the seed bed for for a new spiritual infections and I and that's and that's what I Try to look at it in the book\nWell you know we we I don't imagine you listen to the program all that often but on this program we talk about some pretty wild stuff and I think that scientists will die hard time to ignore me George it's\nToo late [laughter] yeah I was pretty wild stuff that I think mainstream scientists generally have a tough time getting their head around a near death experiences out of body experiences encounters with other realities um you know time slips things of that sort\nOf that you you'd sort of reached out to look for a way to maybe\nMake a bridge between science and those kinds of subjects with this understanding of\nParallel realities other dimensions higher dimensions we talk about that those kinds of concepts on the program all the time and as if it's a given a they're a given but we don't really I don't think many of us know I Can't get my head around other dimensions and\nUm it it's it hurts even think about it but you take a deep dive into a sort of why those kinds of concepts are so commonly held so um\nThat one that was important not only to reach out to people like us to discuss these crazy things but also to science right\nYeah I think so yeah I think so I mean one thing I Try to do in the book is\nUm I Try to try to demystify a little bit the discussion about other dimensions and the and the first couple of chapters the book I I you know I asked the question of what it what is an extra dimension um and I talk a bit about uh I talk a bit about that and maybe I can just say a word about that for for the listeners tonight yes yeah I'm also\nA another demand the idea of another dimension is not that I'm not that after ... after all I mean we have we know we have we have three directions or dimension three spatial dimensions that we live in and that's linked with and hide\nAnd those are are are three directions or or dimensions if there's an additional dimension that we sometimes talk about is the fourth dimension I'm fin Feinstein in that time so we live in a a four dimensional space time a world and I'm fine I spoke about this but\nSome of the people I talk about in my book talk about an additional spatial dimensions ah a direction and space or a dimension in space that different from the other three so you know we could think of like we could we could draw the line on a piece of paper or a line of a one dimensional objects that has length\nIf you then draw flask where on that same piece of paper and has two directions or dimensions that has links and with\nAnd then you could you could draw cube I'm On the paper or you could hold a Rubik's Cube in your hand and that would be a three dimensional object has three spatial dimensions are linked with and hide\nAnd then the then the question becomes is okay what about a fourth direction\nUm or a fourth dimension and this would be a you know this would be an object that has links with\nHeight and something else and that there's something else as the tricky part something else is the is the direction that we cannot perceive so if there is such a direction to reality or dimension to reality it's it's evidently not something that we can we can see 'em or perceive [laughter]\nUm so this this is the possibility raised by math mathematician and actually others from philosophers I'm In the\nGoing back to the Eighteenth century but really in the nineteenth century mathematicians raised the possibility for it seems like kind of a strange thing to think about what ... how could there be another direction or dimension to reality\nUm you know and why would there be one well mathematicians in the nineteenth century start to use this idea within the context of their mathematical equations and the reason they do is they want to want to make the mathematics of of the universe of its forces in laws more simple and more elegant 'em and they find

back with Christopher white a Christopher I at one of the great things about the book is is how you\nTell the story about other worlds and our our modern perception of other worlds and how it developed a through by personalizing it you tell the story of people who've struggled with getting their own hands around the world Charles hitting as one of those who\nI I guess a brilliant mathematician who went into a deep depression when his scientific use came into conflict with his religious and spiritual views tell his story\nYeah yeah yeah yeah his his wife is is quite a story um but you're right there there's Hinton and there's many others in the book who sort of struggle with the\nUm you know sort of like a habit being raised religious in a scientific time and feeling that they can no longer or an or maybe not sure that they can any longer embrace the religion of their childhood and still feeling spiritual for sure and and having a spiritual and tuition and his ... am\nAnd wanting to find wanting to seek out other ways of of being religious and many of them turned to these you know fantastic scientific concepts like higher dimension that has a new as a new more scientific way of thinking about\nUm you know the existence of other spiritual up levels are worlds to reality um hinted intends an interesting story as you say he he grows up he goes Oxford he he falls into this kind of depression he's not sure about anything anymore and then he\nHe makes he makes a move that I think not a lot of people would make it right and the situation as he he embraces map Madison geometry as a kind of a and he kinda hangs onto that as the only sure thing that there's a way in which the map provide certainty 'em to him\nBut I think is his story is a little bit unusual in that sense but then he developed\nAs I say in the book he developed the whole way of thinking about higher spatial dimensions and he gets very interested in the end the mathematics of higher dimensions which I mentioned earlier in our conversation\nBe able to have these powers and be able to lift itself off of our timeline and see\nSee I'm into the future and you write these ideas have been a book called an experiment with time the book is from Nineteen twenty seven it becomes a kind of a best seller and a lot of people\nA lot of people in Europe and America read the book and get interested in thinking about their dreams as somehow predicting the future and you know I sometimes give talks about this in different places and I always have audience members come up to me I always have people emailing me saying oh I'd had dreams like that\nUm so you know it seems to be a fairly common experience actually that people in dreams seem to get glimpses of things that then happened or didn't happen in real life\nAnd then you have experiences where people are not sleeping there not dreaming and they happened in a while they're awake at time slips or day job blue or were they seem to be in some other reality and then they come back to this one sided audio ... what's the how do you how does that fit into the framework that you explore in this book\nYeah yeah exactly I talk about some of those experiences as well so in that chapter six I'm\nNot a little bit in the chapter on C. S. Lewis I'm as well and then I have a chapter on Madeleine L'Engle right who's a famous writer of wrinkle in time just recently a movie made a ...\nOf that book but she talks about time slips um and and time travel um and so on and some of her books so yeah how do they make sense of that um\nWhat time is not linear right my like my presence could be somebody else's future\nYeah well for sure I mean I think one thing that one thing that done picks up on his as you say that Einstein has a new way of talking about what time is which is really\nCounter intuitive and weird right I mean before Einstein people thought about time as just linear as something that just flowed out of uniform rate right we we have a sense of prime flowing and we have this kind of intuitive sense at time flows forward\nUm in fact though you know Einstein had a number of counter intuitive things to say but one of them was that\nOf the ways that we experience time is probably just an illusion and the product of the limitations of our own consciousness that Einstein's equations for for the universe really lay out something that looks a little bit different but they really lay out a universe that could be called a block universe\nUniverse that already exist\nSo um you know all locations in the universe and all times in the universe\nI'm already exist and they're all laid out in this big block\nWe are we are kind of a passing through passing through that that block right are we occupy a little portion of that block but every moment in our past in in our in our president and in our future and in the earth's future and in our son's future\nAnd and all of our defendants future's all of those moments are already laid out in the block at least according to the\nThe laws of physics um and and this is actually discussions to discuss if anyone wants to look at it it's disgusting my book but you could also look at Brian Greene's books he's a professor of physics at Columbia He wrote a new book called the fabric of the cosmos where he talks about this kind of block universe so I'm\nDone and I was laid out what does that say about destiny and free will and yeah that sort of questions that you as a professor religious studies back all the time\nYou're right you're right at least it lays out these big philosophical issues right like um faith in destiny and human free will and how freer to make choices um and so on\nHum so and we can definitely talk about those issues I mean one thing that done did um and some of the other people in my book did as they thought through these problems was they said you know I'm I think what ... what's happening is that\nYou know the fact that these future moments are already laid out somehow in the block universe makes it\nMore possible or makes it more possible that you know maybe the dreaming self it somehow lifted up above our\nThree dimensional world ... world right to exist spatial dimensions and one temporal dimension the dreaming felt he said and lift up out of that block universe and peek into future moment\nAnd Don believe that um you know you're in a bit of Einstein here and a bit of you know him thin and higher space law for their um that's what he believed to happen in some other dreaming consciousness had an additional\nA degree of freedom an additional direction that it could move in\n'em and and if we can talk about that as an additional spatial dimension or we could talk about that is\nNow maybe consciousness somehow can move with an additional degree of freedom but that's what he thought and he got everybody everybody sleeping so had this degree of freedom and he also believe that every one of the cabin kept a journal by their bed of their dreams and and that he had a couple of recommendations for how to how to do a dream journal\nHe believes that everyone did they would be able to see that all of all of our dreams contain bits and pieces of future events and half the time I'm sort of mixed up together\nWell I guess the central question for me about higher dimensions is are there people there and can they interact with us or is it us that's over there we're going to get into that uh those topics as well as near death experiences or to talk about science as a sharman remote viewers\nHow some of those ideas that we have discussed on this program before my fit into our discussion of other world so the book

in the example of bought land where this uh summer hire dimension being reaches down and grabbed somebody from to the world and pull them up\nUm could someone from sixty or Seventy or Seventy reached out and grab Boston pull us up so we can understand the true nature of reality what do you think\nOh sure I mean I think that you know it depends on how you think about those dimension and what's in them but I mean you certainly have had you know religious and spiritual people over the last hundred years\nThings just like that right I mean in fact you've had\nPeople um even even cs Lewis talk about you know God in Christ as higher dimensional um and as beans that calmed down and insert themselves into our lower dimensional world just like the sphere did that in in a an Abbott spoken flat land so\nYes people have definitely thought about um\nWhat we say thought about visitors from from higher rounds or ... or spiritual beings are angels or whatever\nAs higher dimensional hum and as I was kind of the higher dimensional objects that inserts themselves entire world\nThat sounds perilously close to saying the science and religion could go exist that uh you know that the paranormal bleeps good coexist with a scientific yeah ... is scientifically acceptable version of reality\nYeah yeah I think so I mean in my book I Try to put you know a number of different people\nIn the story so I have you know people who have let's say these kinds of moments of inspiration or who experience like a near death experience um and then I have them talking about their experience and then I also\nHave scientists in the book as well and some skeptics so I have different voices in the book um\nYou know talking about what the meaning of these events are and and you know there's not just one story in the book there's a lot of different voices they're trying to interpret what's happening but you definitely have you know the the through line in the book is is are these people who have these kinds of uncanny experiences are remarkable experiences\nMoments of insider intuition or near death experiences are out of body experiences um and so on and and that they are ... than using scientific concepts to to understand what what could be happening and I think that you know figures in my book like like all of us today I mean I think that\nWe all want to use science you know I think we I think science is for the authoritative\nI'm set up this courses that we used to talk about to talk about reality so I think I think that's what they're doing I think you know just like Jay W done right who have these dreams that seem to predict the future where did he go you know he didn't he didn't actually go to the Bible at that point to figure it out he went to Einstein and he went to\nHe went to sort of like popular science book um and I think that you know that's one point I tried to make in the book that I think a lot of us are sort of inspired by\nA man interested and fantastic scientific concepts um\nWell I mean humans humans have been trying to reach a other higher dimensions rather realities for a long time prayer would be an example are reaching out to some invisible world there I'm\nAbsolutely yeah I Know the remote viewing\nYeah yeah yeah there's there's all kinds of things that would fit into that you're right and people have been trying to to reach the transcendent uh ever since there have been humans on earth right I'm ... reaching for something else reaching beyond\nOur own subjectivity um and we talked about dreams earlier I think\nA through dreams and you know in the sixties and at other times you know Americans use psychedelic drugs to open up a what they believe it was like a doorway of consciousness into another realm and in other cultures you might use other plants or substances are losing the gyms to\nTo reach a transcendent but prayer meditation absolutely there they're all different\nAll different different methods\nAre so I'm Wondering if the example of remote viewing where people project or consciousness over space and time seemingly independent of space and time to access information that they shouldn't be able to get that that doesn't that make sense because of the idea of other worlds higher dimensions\nWell um let's see I think I think people have certainly talked about remote viewing and other a pair of an ... ... has\nHigher dimensional because uh you know maybe we can go back to Abbott's book flat land for a minute because\nYou know flat line what happens is you know you can imagine a two dimensional world of characters of very flat right sliding around the surface of your desk they don't they know a lengthy than wet but they don't know that third direction or dimension which is\nWhich is um up or down so when you're if you're a figure in in flatland and let's say you're just a flat square and you're sliding around on the surface of your flat world and let's say you look out um you know you look around and and what do you see well\nIf you're a flat square sliding around on a flat world you you actually don't see her whole world you just see a line right let's say a friend comes toward you and he's a triangle\nAnd he's fighting towards your what do you see what you just see a line on every everyone and flat land can just see a one dimensional line but what happens when the flat square gets pulled\nOff of this two dimensional world up into a higher space a three dimensional space in the story is suddenly he can see the full dimension ... of his flat world so he looks\nHe looks and he sees flat land before him all laid out and he can suddenly a he suddenly has powers of vision and he never had right he can look down at flat land he can see for the first time not just lines that he can see\nA People's homes he can see into their homes right 'cause he's looking down on the whole flat world so you can see he can see all of his friends whether they're triangles or squares or lines\nHe can see all of their dimensions he can see even inside ride it say let's say he has a friend who's a triangle 'em all he saw before was their line coming towards them but now he can see the whole triangle he could even see inside the tri leading the inside homes\nSo I raise this as an example because\nSome people have used to say aha you know um well if we were raised somehow in consciousness up into a higher spatial dimensions maybe we could look back on our three dimensional world and have amazing power as a vision\nSo um you know maybe we are just like the square right wing raised to hire dimension we would look back on our world and what we see we would see all sides of everything at once you could look\nDown on your home for instance and see all the rooms laid out now you can see the insides of everyone's bodies you could see the outside of everyone's body you can see the top of the house and the bottom of the house um\nSo you would have a kind of a higher dimensional vision um and so people do indeed use these ideas to talk about things like remote viewing right um or or they use these ideas actually to talk about near death experiences because sometimes people have near death experiences they talk about\nHaving this kind of um having this kind of special vision I where they can see things I never saw before [noise]\nSo so yeah and so maybe remote viewing is a a you know is a higher dimensional phenomena but I don't know you know I'm certainly\nPeople have talked about it I'm that way and I in my book and especially in the later chapters and an epilogue um is where I talk about sort of near near death experiences and some parents parents psychological phenomena like like feeling\nYeah Raymond Moody is somebody I've met in a ... person and interviewed and just you know he's a trailblazer in in discussing that those experiences in so many people had and trying to put it in context and this I think this kind of idea makes it easier to understand those experience yeah\nI looked at his his books to ah he's he's really interesting I Love the book\nUm I looked at as books too because I was studying um near death experiences for like the epilogue of the book in the last couple of chapters of the book and you know what you do find or what I found\nIs that people do use this kind of language you know they it's almost like they talk like the square and flat land as as a character you know as a character that suddenly lifted off of\nYou know they're limited world they're they're lower dimensional world into some sort of higher dimensional space and many of them use language like um\nYou know suddenly there I saw an altered geometry before me I'm an end the dimensions of the room changed and shifted and\nOthers talk about being able to see like in a hospital setting right if someone had a near death experience in a hospital setting others talked about rising up above the hospitals and being able to see into different rooms in the hospital so once again at another case in which\nUm you know you you're raised into a higher spiritual dimension and then you can suddenly have this these incredible powers the vision that you didn't have before right you can see through walls right\n... rich Gulf Coast windows dot com twenty four hour traffic center [noise]\nWeather Channel for cash to study these guys to set up
