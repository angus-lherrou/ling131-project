I. dot com call now\n[noise]\n\n\nAnd welcome back to coast to coast will take your calls next hour regardless of your thoughts on whether there's global warming climate change we don't muscle you because people have different views Steve the book outside the green box told me about the title first of all\n... this is a book that tells you what your green consultant doesn't tell you a written for general audiences and businesses and a one popular business a phrase use over and over and think outside the box so the title was think outside the green box\nBecause businesses today are are really trapped in the green boxes sustainable development there they are forced to do many things ah that don't really do anything for the environment\nAnd so I go through a what I call first before horsemen of environmental apocalypse a which are overpopulation\nThe idea that humans are growing too fast and and populating the planet too fast or the second one is global pollution the idea that we're increasingly polluting the environment\nIn in my presentations should I say this is the or the third station the United states has man since Nineteen fifty do you know what happened the other two stations\nAnd occasionally somebody to come up with the right answer the answer is the other two were buried by snow\nUp and they knew\nThey built this last station on stilts it's southern modular buildings and they they Jack up each building every year over accumulating snow and that's where Ninety percent of the world's ice is and the south pole climate models cannot explain why the ISIS getting thicker in the south pole\nBut on that we've lost a little bit um if you add it all up but there's there's really no concern or that we're losing large amounts of ice\nIt's a ... it's incredible when these stories come out saying that huge sheets of ice and have fallen off the shelves melting away and everything else yeah\nI mean well you know it's a new a new west\nAntarctic ice sheet but but usually what they don't mention is there are about a hundred volcanoes under that ice sheet so it is possible that west Antarctic ice sheet could melt if we have big volcanic eruptions there but uh this is not being caused by carbon dioxide it's another natural factor\nWhat about the city's not one renewal energy [noise] plus or minus you\nYeah this hundred percent renewables thing as I was as I was mentioning the the biggest problem with the wind and solar\nIs their intermittent and they can't ... if you're going to maintain continuity of electricity supply they can't replace traditional\nNuclear gas or coal ... when you put in solar wind a you\nOnly get about ten percent of the total capacity as far as adding to the capacity of your system so if you want eighty percent of renewables or a hundred percent renewables you have to build a vast amount of wind and solar\nAnd people are saying batteries vast amounts of batteries so this means you you've just added a huge expense to your electricity infrastructure\nOr some of the studies say that uh in California for example they're going to triple\nA the cost of a wholesale electricity and that's going to probably double or or or two and a half times or your total electricity on top so this hundred percent renewable energy sounds good uh practically it's going to be very very very expensive\nLet's talk for a moment Steve again about pollution how bad is the pollution I'll\nIt's a pretty good news story as I talk about in my book I talked about landfills landfills used to be a mess yes on now they are all modern landfills and in Europe and the U.S are lined with a with a a waterproof barrier to keep things from leaking out they're covered with dirt every day to keep a\nA rats another room in or out of the way\nUm our air is very much a a cleaner since Nineteen eighty\nAre six major air pollutants are all down at a combined Seventy percent those are the ones I mentioned the carbon monoxide ... sulfur dioxide or water is is a is not where it ought to be but the the Great Lakes have been cleaned up many of the offshore areas have been cleaned up\nIn Europe the ... the Rhine River is making a comeback the Daniel rivers is making a comeback as a matter of fact the interesting thing is people say well energy use as a big problem but it's funny the nations that use the most energy per person\nHave the lowest levels of air and water pollution today and those levels are declining so this idea that using energy causing ... causes pollution really is not accurate the nations that are not able to put energy use effectively\nUm can't use it to reduce their air and water pollution and so they're they're in the worst state\nSo it's really a good news story what we need to do is get get a nations have become more wealthy\nAnd then they will start cleaning up there and start cleaning up their water and uh so it it really is a good news story a from a pollution point of view\nNow what's going on Steve because regardless what side of the fence you people are on with climate change why is it so bitter as opposed to dialogue and hey this is my opinion and I appreciate yours it's screaming match is\nYeah it is kind of remarkable I have a I've spoken at a couple of universities and done a couple of debates but I get turned down about ten times the one I'm going to be up at a grand Valley State Michigan on the twenty fifth of October imminent a little thing but it's fairly rare now that that a university will invite\nA climate skeptic took climate discussion [noise] um so it has become very polarized then\nDo you get booted no I've\nNever had a disruptive situation and you know I'm always very respectful and the theory is plausible it man made climate change and\nWe do have a greenhouse effect\nBut it was the last Thirty years the data showing that the climate models are wrong they made some assumptions which are wrong so so a natural factors dominate um and we need to go on reducing real pollutants but not not carbon dioxide\nWell see that's what's so important people really need to distinguish the difference between pollution and climate change brought on by cycles this the sun is heating up the solar system itself is warmer than it used to be\nAbsolutely there are the earth is dominated by long term cycles called them a lot of it just cycles which are uh\nThe tilt of earth's axis changes over time the procession of earth's axis are are they orbit around the sun changes and these are like twenty thousand to a hundred thousand years cycles they cause the ice ages then we have medium term cycles every Fifteen hundred years or so that a scientist believe the sun causes\nAnd those are they're they fluctuating temperatures so we've had the medieval warm period a thousand years ago when I was very warm um the little ice age in Europe uh about five hundred years ago when they were actually burning people at the stake they thought they were which isn't there causing the cold weather\nAnd our modern warming and then we have short term cycles as well El Nino is an example in their regular cycle every three to seven years\nCycles in the Pacific cycle so the and the Atlantic so the statement climate change is real is like saying water is wet\nLet's come back in a moment Steven open up the phone lines and what people participate with you\nSign

Streever wrote a book\nCalled the coming global superstar and that inspired a movie called\nThe day after tomorrow and what I was wondering was or is it remotely possible that if things are keep going the way they are or with art and uh what is predictions\nIt very well happen that the events portrayed in that movie as well as the events portrayed in the movie two thousand twelve with Yellowstone popping the cork in blowing Wyoming in Kentucky or is it very possible that the fans in both of those movies that very well happen\n[noise] [noise] yeah I don't know about the two thousand twelve of Yellowstone and that full Cain although I understand there's a big went under there\nYou have to call during the day after\nTomorrow is based on the idea that um manmade warming would would stop the Gulf Stream basically slow down the Gulf Stream which is part of a of the uh a global uh uh overturning a circulation there's this huge ocean current\nAh which which carries a millions of square miles of water or the gulfstream goes north goes up to Iceland and then it sinks and it it slows down deep and then it goes down into the deep underneath that goes down to the south Atlantic Indian and the Pacific the\nThe theory basically was that are warming would cause a cause or water to melt up there the ice caps to melt would stop the current and it would cause a U.S move us in the next the ice age\nUm I think most scientists know realize that that that is very unlikely we just don't have enough ice up there um to to affect the current so are there ... there was a fair though a number of years back that that was slowing down but after they looked at the data they found that the no the gulfstream wasn't slowing down is really not happening\nIt was a good movie though [noise] yeah okay this whole thing right\nSo let's go next to John in Hawaii west of the Rockies John I'm not hearing much about the volcano these days what so what can you give us an update on that\nAnd they'll make it\nStill doing its thing well okay go ahead John\n... but in order to uh to quiet down I just want to stay you we're\nWe're talking about wind field ... when I when I was living in Oregon okay and I used to drive by the wind mills that they had and I could see out in the field that they had a big fat\nAnd it was about a twenty four foot booth Wayne\nYou know they were were voting off\nThe methane gas were asking now why don't you put a generator on that and we'll do\n... you know Christianity they'll come back and they said no no no it's going to cost to my kid have anything out now that can't be the only way you know in the United states we know that\nAnd they're all going to be burning off methane gas now I Wonder why hasn't there been anything done about that\nWell I think they're recapturing that are in some place as a matter of fact that's a big push in California they talk about they talk about that being renewable gas [noise]\nAh they also want to get methane from water treatment plants and even a dairy operations and and uh uh agriculture\nUm the problem is though it is really more expensive um gas from landfill is about twice as much as our natural gas regularly and it goes up from there um water treatment of three times as much I think there he gets up to about ten times as much\nSo they are capturing that and some in some places are capturing the gas from landfills\nA but it does tend to it does tend to add to the expense of things that's that's the only issue\nNext stop let's go to Michael in Virginia Beach I'm Michael\nHi are you arguing thank you for having Steve von Loor spoken to spoken to him several times are\nHurting on many shows and he has a breath of fresh air and inside and that accuracy a there is one point that ah other guests on coast to coast have brought up in the past and I think we should warn are good friends the\nNot the same mistake that these are climate gay hopes there's a are using a ...

are stable force so there are some good science the trends are good but yeah we're not going to go back to\nThe days when most of the world was uninhabited we at all forest and we had all the vice and that just won't happen\nWhat's happening with rising sea levels\nSo sea levels have been rising for the last twenty thousand years you can go to [noise] to NASA or their website and ... and see that data they've written a three hundred and Ninety feet a hundred and twenty meters since the last ice age\nNo scientists can tell you when natural sea level rise stopped and man made sea level rise began\nUm right now the rice is about seven inches per century that's been going for the last a couple of hundred years or any politician who tells you he knows how to stop sea level rise I hold onto your wallet\nOh we need to adapt to rising oceans oh we're not going to be able to stop that and that is a largely driven by natural factors\nThat obviously has happened in the past because there were discovering the ancient cities that are under water\n[noise] um there have been some well yeah there are\nIf you look at a I think it's emphasis in Turkey or if you look at a a piece of both of those cities are about\nUm\nUh there are some some um indications that the seas were higher at one point in time as well um those are about five miles from the coast but the story all accounts peas are used to be a big court or a big port on in in the\nNorthwest Italy an excuse to be a port as well so there was some times when the oceans were higher\nBut again this is something we need to adapt to a we're not going to stop the sea level rise so matter what the what they think in California\nBruce in woodland hills California is with us Hi Bruce go ahead\nHi George thank you for taking my call Hi Steve I'm Bruce you know before I ah I Want to talk about the word climate change but before I get into I just kind of like to mention I perhaps where a lot of listeners that aren't aware\nIs a global elites that run this country who are masters at keeping us completely oblivious and gun what's really going on\nThe word climate change is a narrative we hear all the time to weather stations a news article scientists that is not the proper word the word is\nAbrupt climate collapse and we never hear about the word climate engineering these are programs now that have been in effect for over seven years and even ramped up over the last Twenty years and this is the aerosol injections\nThey're spraying God Knows how many millions of tons of aerosols anyone could just look up in the sky they no doubt this\nA lot of general resemble heart technology is and you know if anyone wants to prove this to themself I can tell you how to do it\nFirst of all any time you watch the news you are watching at him manufactured why you're not seeing the real no weather satellite mats that we used to the many years ago where see an animated cartoon\nThere's a site I it's a YouTube one Pacific redwood that this guy is obviously a former meteorologist she keeps anonymous his name but he is showing actual weather satellite map but here's the thing that's interesting\nYou can see storm fronts hurricanes tropical storms low pressure zones coming directly in the California and they're being blocked and is being blocked by heart technology which our ground based atmosphere heaters anyone could look this up\nThey're very powerful I Believe they can play out as much as three billion watts of power\nAnd can have the upper atmosphere to Fifteen hundred degrees that can steer hurricanes they can stall hurricanes\nThey can blast thunder heads they can break up low pressure zones and this is what's happening this is not an act of nature it's an act of the military industrial complex what's having our with our weather ... wasn't the only hear about it in the new\nLuskin Steve's reaction to that Bruce\nThank you Bruce some I'd have to research I'm really not up on that I Know there's been some quotes eating attempts but to\nThe rest of it it's not something I've run across um and there's been a lot of discussion about climate engineering but to my knowledge there's not been anything done on a large scale that something I'd have to look look into further\nLet's take one more caller may be too if we have some time in in Tulsa, Oklahoma he said go ahead\nWell go ahead man just exactly right I Want you can sort of it happens to believe\nThat the way to Adam is being gay oh engineered the Kim trails or a proven fact even the discovery channel show now George said recently that gentleman on his show talking about can't drill team put out a video of Franken's guy\nAnd the idea behind it was to create a canopy over the body out son well people have so much you have\nAbout the fact that they're doing this so they're going to back off of it now what they were telling us that they said they were going to back off the trail we don't have the weather's going to get real radical now they have they have the ability to geo engineering this weather\nDown to science I mean it's it's to the point now you can go to the street and on\nThe stock market on the weather they want or again that they want to intensify the hurricane through the A's park\nAnd now on top of that and you got the geo engineering of the story on crops which is destroying the honeybees are almost becoming extinct\nAnd if they you know that's pretty much gonna destroy everything now I Do agree with you about the nuclear power plant that was ... it may never come up with man is not smart enough to harness that power safely okay now I Do agree with that but here's the thing\nWith Trump I'm proud of him he got out of that climate accord 'cause it's a sham meant that what they were doing a stripping the oil um industrial nations away\nDistributing it into the pockets of the global elite\nAnd laying out trying to do with their sky completely with collusion not paying a dime into it either is Russia but the United states of America was going to fight all the I don't blame a Trump one bit I agree with that I was proud of him for backing us out of that sham\nLonger he somebody had

gather and report on big foot sightings and findings\nFrom all corners of North America and his series big foot terror in the woods sightings and encounters with ... with us now when you walk into the program\nGeorge thank you so much for having me I feel like after the living room with an old friend\nYou half my friend just as I'm looking forward to this you got to tell us about this a young age encounter with big for what happened\nWell I never had an encounter with big what uh my first realization of the character came with um the Patty so I'm probably somewhere in the late sixties early seventies ha ha and um I've had other encounters in my life but not ...\nUh the hairy men and after I saw that\nI said to myself my God this type of thing is roaming around North America and uh I'm like other people who thought it was a hoax and still do to this day\nI was a I was sold on it from the beginning I just said to myself this thing is real it's out there and are these federal is ah have seen it and got in on film\nYou I'm convinced people William are seeing something very strange and unusual they're not making up the stories some things out there and there's some kind of creature\nI have no doubt about it George and are based on um the encounters into testimonies if you think about it\nWhat would make a husband and wife silver home that they love if they hadn't had something that scared them off the land exact uh what makes a hunter sellers\nGun collection and vowed that he'll never enter into the woods again if they're having encountered a something in the forest [noise] uh to me is everybody or lying is everybody out of their mind I don't think so I think these people are having real\nUh encounters or in most cases they've been frightened test either their wits\nAnd uh for as far as everybody else is concerned everything's a hoax right from the get go\nWell will come up with a number of different theories on what we all think big foot might be we'll take calls next hour I'm gonna ask you this because I was raised Catholic what is the Catholic blogger where do you do\n[noise] well basically I uh talk about the things that I Believe a troubling mankind and uh try to get to the bottom of the heart of the matter if you will um [noise]\nUh the things that plague us you know the things that are troubling people in life and living in marriage and and work and uh [noise] try to expose these truths to the individuals by using my book\nAnd I I don't blog I'm a you know I'm not on the blog every day I kind of blog is I'm inspired to do so\nI'm I'm getting some good feedback from you know people seem to enjoy it and um and pretty much that that you know I mean I think we all have a responsibility to have a voice in this life uh especially if it's for the good\nOf you know what I mean that's why you appreciate the coast to coast you know I've been in and inside for a long time well thank you and I'm when I'm at my desk at work I have a little light part and one of my abs is coast\nOr what is he listening to [laughter]\nExactly you know people are always ah getting your near what is that what are you listening to over there and uh I I tell them so I tried to promote the show as much as I can almost\nThink he is a tough being a blogger on religion and spirituality and also a believer that there's a creature out there we all ...\nNo not at all to me um\nAs as far as a big foot goes as far as you of phones go as far as angels go you can\nPick the topic [noise] um\nI Believe all of these things for me for the both of my faith you look at the universe is just a vast and wonder is thing\nAnd ah even our own planet continues to amazing baffle us with the discovery is being made day in and day out and if you just think about something like the dinosaurs for a moment\nOr if it wasn't for one guy who is out there looking around and places where you normal person does not seeing a bone hanging out of a hillside\nMhm we wouldn't really know about them but we know from even books like Michael ... book forbid knock ...\nHave been a people of civilizations around them all life here will be for us and yet when given the account ... from Adam and Eve on wood so to me it's a test of faith uh what\nDo you believe what I've given you from this point forward in spite of knowing what we're going to discover after the fact\nSpeaking of books I got from you too volumes of books he was on amazing but I was afraid that you sent me originals\nWell here's what happened in Georgia in this kind of humor is\nUm when you produce had contacted me uh I had an order and for for that actually made to order on Amazon and I had given all of the copies out I had and I had what I mean I I had in the water and fruit punch bowl [laughter]\nSit a I have nothing to send George\n[laughter] so I said I could make up some copies or and put them in folders and send them out there and she said oh that'll be fine\nOn as I was telling Tom tonight and I said Tom oh my God I think I think bill sent me his original book before you got it wrong [laughter]\nNo no have I have no fear I have no fear\nIn China didn't want to send it back\nNo no that's okay and as a matter of fact ah probably within the next few days I'll have some and I'm going to send them out to you and the a ... and the crew to a festival around and ah enjoy them\nWhat is your instincts tell you based on your war that big foot might be because this is what I hear I hear it could be an extraterrestrial it could be physical creature you could be an ape it could be dimensional we hear all kinds of things what do you think\n[noise] well [noise] uh [noise] my my own personal theories are on that or to fold\nA number one in the physical realm this is a creation this is a creature that out there\nUh how many of them all day or we don't know nobody knows but based on the fact that they leave prints from both hands into the\nUh according to some testimonies they bleed having been shot a and they die as well getting into a little later on a which to me make them a living breathing entity like any other creature a B the greater small on the planet\nA I have no doubt whatsoever in my heart any way that they do exist and that people have every walk of life or in countering them uh having said that uh we\nWill get into a little story later that are hand picked for the coastal audience\nAh and I have a couple of them are that do involve a ... the UFO phenomena and\nMy take on that is that there may be some mimicking going on here of\nThe natural okay\nThe UFO suit so I think I think it's too I think one's almost like an imposter and one is the real deal\nHas anybody reportedly ever been hurt by one of these creatures\n[noise] physically hurt\nWell or not to my knowledge I don't have I have people that had been a scared out of their wits I have people that had been rushed by these things are but not attacked [noise]\nUm you know things of this nature they um they seem to be creatures of habit or I Will say this getting back to human no non human dimensional on non dimensional\nOr you hear again and again uh and it's not just me but many people are have heard from individuals that when they saw this thing\nBasically was grinning at me a like a demon\nMhm in other words some people have

standing there and the noise or the falls and on the opposite bank of the creek which was wounded with toll kind of pointing spruce has inspired a pines\nHe sees something going up and down in the trees that he described as like a chimpanzee\nSo he's watching this thing going up and down and think you can self what on earth is a monkey or a chimpanzee doing up here\nNow he couldn't cross the river\nAnd when the thing came down on the tree it went into the the trees the surrounding it and vote in other words there were like low growth ten Fifteen feet and then this big tall tree standing in the middle so when it was up in the high tree he could see it\nAnd when it climbed down we couldn't see it so obviously you're out there this thing has your attention when he's watching this thing going up and down and at one point it comes up sits there and one position and staring at him\nSo now he's looking at it it's looking at him and then it rolls down again rope moments later\nHe sees the ... in the bushes on the other bank which kind of came down a hill alongside the pools\nAnd here is this little big foot sitting on the shoulder out daddy coming along the bank and going out of sight in front of him into the woods so you had one carrying the other one\nWho knows it's anybody's guess what this little critter was doing maybe it was like you know I I Know it sounds ridiculous but I think of it in human terms like when we used to go down to the monkey bars or something and play with your kid in the park you know\nAnd that's right now you mentioned earlier about a couple that moved on to their house to get away from big what happened there\n[noise] [noise] well I've had a ... there's been a number of people that moved houses are a United assume they're out in the rural areas right ... yeah for the most part are people who have backed\nUp against a wilderness areas or for instance when we talk about I mean this is a very interesting a story\nA involving no sighting but evidence like it's nobody's business are these people and when you talk about Maine George I don't know if people really realize this Maine is the size of the risk of New England combined\nAnd you're Ninety percent of it is on inhabited so when you talk about wilderness it's not just the Pacific northwest British Columbia Canada here we have a lot of wilderness in Maine we have a lot of wilderness right here in New York state\nAnd so these people had moved from one house to another house in northern Maine\nOr the money was right the property was right the people I had lived there before them we're gardeners they will gardeners this was like a match made in heaven well as it turns out over time they found they were accusing each other\nOf losing the gardening tools the wife is seeing the husband was to shovel where's the rate was this so finally the husband get the idea\nThat they're going to gather together all the tools they have do an inventory and then they were going to keep the mole locked up with the exception of two small hands spades\nSobbing accomplish that they realize they were missing some tools\nThey started they left to hand spades on what she called the the wife pulled the bistro table on the patio and they were using them for partying plants\nAnd no sooner had they left them out there a couple of days went by and now these hand spades withdrawn they actually called the police report that the property of you know tools and this and that number could understand who would come on their land has the tools\nAnd take two of them is ridiculous\nYou're going to go to jail for taking a shovel you gonna run the place Rob the place well [laughter] bright he ... and things like that [laughter]\nSo they actually went out into the property in the woods [noise]\nThey found want to be a shovel leaning on a tree and the wife scope doubt nine feet off the ground one of the one hand garden trial where the rubber handle on it\nShowed into the side of a tree nine feet up nine feet up\nSo they went back to doubt they got a ... that gets an iPhone or something took pictures of it they brought the latter route the husband couldn't butch drifting buried in a tree several inches couldn't budget [noise]\nSo they had recalled the police and told them the story about finding the shop window would show the cop shoveling the tri ... everybody was baffled by you know the current events [noise]\nAnyways the long and short of it was the cop told them look if you have any other problems get back to us I'm not sure what happened here I'm going to play a lot to the detectives [noise]\nWell\nI think that the long and short of it was a couple of days later they came outside and the guardian behind the house\nHad been trampled down there were huge footprint in bed or made those were taken the head of lettuce one mashed\nWhatever had done this which was obviously a big sport I stepped right over the fence not using the gate to gate on the garden and it just kept right over the wire\nWinning at it's full of feed and then left they recalled the uh the police over the what had happened that what transpired\nAnd he actually told them that this was pretty much the best evidence he had ever seen a and that they had had reports periodically of people saying they show these big ... creatures coming in the property of walking here now so it\nJust comes on convincing\nYeah it's not like\nNot like these things on being seen it and not being talked about which is a very\nOdd thing you don't you know George think back to us

is that the same as the big ... we talk about here in North America\nI don't believe so uh although I'll tell you something really interesting uh I had an account of cold to me by all things a Russian professor was out hiking with his landscaper that he had befriended because of the best knowledge of things but time nickel\nAnd they formed the unlikely friendship and turned that into a hiking partnership\nAnd they had run across a couple of big foot messing around with them\nHe's a in the woods and they got close enough to them where they could hear them ... and the professor said that it sounded like a Siberian dialect that he was unfamiliar with now this is a Russian speaking immigrant\nSaying that what he was hearing sounded like some type of Russian that he was unfamiliar with [noise]\nSo when you talk about the the ... or the abominable snowman\nIt's hard not to think of the land bridge that was once they're above the bearing you see\nAnd it did these things or or had these things go back and forth I have no idea but it was just really unusual to hear this gentleman\nOr speak about this on dialect that other people have said they've heard a voice as I had a couple that uh was canoeing in Minnesota and they talked on a pulled the canoe up on a piece of the lake where they throw into look clear and they could sit there and rest for a little while\nAnd they ran across some sasquatch and the trees structure in there\nOr they will unseen by them they walk blaze through the trees they heard them ...\nAnd they said it sounded like when you stand at the counter and the Chinese restaurant and they're shouting orders back and forth to each other so it's very very odd but as far as the uh the eh yeah any any abominable below\nSnowman I have no idea uh I have a ... book the abominable a snowman come to life and uh you know that thing is like reading uh an encyclopedia on the creature\nA and yet getting back to what I said earlier none of this stuff means anything to the majority of people around the globe that book is a hoax all of my stuff is a hoax all of the conversations about Bigfoot or a hoax\nThe film is a hoax or the or a a durable ridges on the footprint steak and everything's a hoax to them so you know we have to just keep doing what we do\nA in spite of uh what the majority of the people out there I think about it and that's one of the things I Love about coached [noise] you know uh we all tune in because we're hearing things that we can't get\nIn Oklahoma cases nobody's talking about what you're talking about us who's in big could encounters where's the ...\n[noise] well I've had a couple of them are one of them are called the dead falls incident but one night I'll share with you a was named the orb\nAnd it's really interesting uh these three scout leaders had four young boys ... working on their uh Eagle Scout badge\nAnd they decided to take them or to this mountain in a mountainous area or in uh Pennsylvania to do a weekend of survival training\nOr on the first day they were pretty much focusing on building huts lean twos and and different things like that and and the second day or the focus was on that of ah getting attention being paid so they were\nSpending their time in an open area spelling out the words help and SOS uh using branches and bows and then they were making smoking for years using a green\nA green bows\nAnd that night they decided to go on a night hike to see what it was like a navigating around in the dark\nA now during the day they had climbed up the side of the mountain to look down and see what they had made to see what it looked like from a higher elevation and they had gone up into the same area or at night for the ICC\nBut when they got up there it turns out that the one scout leader was a UFO enthusiast which was very bizarre considering what you're about to hear he had a pair of military grade night vision or by knock your ...\nOr that he had brought along now when they get up into the trail one of the kid says hey what's that and they noticed in the distance or white moving around in the woods\nNow of course the first instinct was it somebody with a flashlight or a battery operated lantern but then they realized that this thing started to daughter around in a crazy fashion which immediately told all of them this is no human being and what it is we don't know so they started moving closer\nAnd they got closer they got the night vision on it and they could see now that was in or around bluish white light moving around and the forest\nAnd now this really had their attention so they got even closer they were trying to get ever closer to it they didn't know how big it was because they didn't know how far away they were from it finally they got to a place where they believe they were about Seventy five yards away from it and when they put the night vision on\nIt they could see that it was about two feet wide bluish white or but\nIt was about uh ten or twelve feet off the ground and it was a looming eating the trees around it\nSo that the parents and the it was that bright yeah I mean it it it it's a glowing light darting around in the forest and now it's stationary and what happens next is absolutely out of this world\nThe one scout is holding it and he says to the leader hey Mr so and so you better take a look at this thing it's doing something really weird\nHe described a picture this George a two inch wide let's just say beach ball a two foot wide beach ball he described egg law ... coming out of the size of this thing\nAs being like when you blow a bubble through want as a child care so this thing is coming out of the side of this or and making its way down to the ground [noise]\nAnd what blew their mind was the fact that what was coming out and go into the ground was like twenty times are thirty times the volume of the orbit self and yet the war was on changed and this thing was attached to it\nNow they don't want to see a big foot appearing in the second ... job coming down and they described it as being like in his state of suspended animation that wasn't moving whatsoever but there were certain to what they were looking at [noise]\nAt some point the glob separates from the org and now you have like this tower of blue and white like with this big foot in it and the orbit sitting separately [noise]\nIt was then that they said\nThe bluish white light that were surrounding the big foot starts to dissipate\nWhere now the creature was left standing in the light of the circular warp and then they said it started to move at that point they got out of dodge written\nOn the trail can't blame them yeah I Can't blame the broke camp and while they were breaking down the tents and everything just to get out of the place looking up on the mountain they saw that the war which had originally seen was back to ... around in the woods\nOr which got their attention initially and what had happened to this big what they had no idea and nor did they care through you know go shake hands with it so it's very very bizarre and yet you're talking you know\nSeven scouts for boys three men you
