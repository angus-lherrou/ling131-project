a\nAnd I don't want to jump to conclusions because it could be a left wing conspirator doing is to try to make Republicans good look bad but on the surface it looks like and I know everybody's saying you know Trump and his rhetoric has made\nYou know thing he's created an environment or somebody would be induced to do this you don't know that you don't know that we need to wait\nAnd get the official verdict\nFrom our authorities and the intelligence communities in the United states and then the American people can chew on it but bottom line you and me both know that the rhetoric in this country I'm Talking about the grass roots level I'm not talking about leadership because these guys have always been you know at one another stroke\nBut we have to understand that at the grassroots level America is best when we can debate ideas vigorously debate these ideas\nAnd then you know come up with a viable solution to whatever problem that we're facing to try to assassinate former presidents\nAnd leaders in government is not the way to solve this problem and whoever whoever it they're not\nBenefiting this country they're hurting the United states of America and George I'm so glad you guys let me way on that way in on this because I Love my country I Love it with all my heart I told you once on this there that will get my life for the United states of America and I and I will but George\nThis right here it's got to come to win and hopefully this a wake up call for all of us for all of us to realize that if you're a Republican don't look at a Democrat is your enemy if you're a Democrat don't look at the Republican\nYour enemy as an opponent yes but not an enemy we're all on the same tune and the media\nNot not coast to coast but the media has definitely because George you giving everybody a platform you giving everybody a platform and you've been reasonable you bid on it I've heard your commercials saying listen you know just because I let a person to say what he wants to say don't think that I'm On one side or the other\nAnd that's a proper and healthy way to look at it but George\nThe media has exacerbated this problem I Do believe that the media bears as you know a little culpability in this we've got to stop demonizing\nAnd looking at one another as we are enemies were all on the same team the only people that are clapping than I our our adversaries overseas\nAnd those on and the individual or the group that sent these packages exactly George\nTed Kaczynski the Unabomber killed three people injured twenty three others he was caught because his manifesto was publicly let go in his brother recognized it as Ted Kaczynski he's turned him into the FBI\nAre we going to happen hopefully some kind of a person because I'm convinced Andre that one person always tells another person somebody knows something about who sent these packages out maybe they'll go to the public or if\nThis is a conspiracy I don't think that this conspiracy will hold wax too much longer\nYou cannot have a conspiracy like this and everybody keep those keeps their mouth shut I think that if this is a conspiracy we will get a resolution to this we'll find out the truth a whole lot faster than if this is one lone but I Am convinced\nThat our law enforcement uh individuals and are individuals in institutions and in the intelligence community entire US intelligence apparatus they will get to the bottom of this and it won't ever did this\nWhether it was somebody on the left or to somebody on the right because I Will say again I Will say again because I Know you've got people on the right thing this could be a false flag it'd\nBe somebody on the left that did this and you got most of the media thing that President Trump still this weight shut out wait let the intelligence officials doing their job then wants their job is completed and they've determined who'd done this\nThen we can begin as a nation to try to put the pieces back together and come together as one country we are the United states of America\nYou know every group has you know had their time to be stepped on that's just the way empires are established and America is an empire and people are going to get stepped on but\nYou have to wait and do things proper in order I'm thinking about the Tuskegee Airman right now who President Roosevelt said well they can't fly on a piece for the one less thing but they flew it and\nThey flew it most six more successfully and they protected more bombers than anybody in front\nOf they sure did in in ... in when they landed white pilots went up to them and hugged them\nExactly George exactly you know we all want to contribute to the greatness of America and we're on a good path right now let this path continue LS stop this rhetoric that drives us apart\nAnd and I'm not talking about Trump I'm Talking about individuals the guy at a gas station your best friend the guy who you talk to on the phone you know stop it realize we're all in the same boat together we're all Americans\nAll right bye ... ... or we will talk this week\nAnd see the rest of the story unfold hopefully Saudi Arabia's crown prince Mohammed bin Salman as

we'll take calls from our listeners to what their ghost stories so we're ready to go there ready to go to ship out to be a fun show we're going to honor okay Thanks Tom okay so let's open up the first secret doors\nI tell them the oil that thing and they just haven't done that yet so come on and then let's see who you are hello there\nAnd how you doing oh boy this is going to be tough I'm fine how are you\nKnow not bad for the fall of ... a month\nOh I don't know I got older things get tough for\nIts didn't want to eat in a more Stanton Friedman\nBoy am I allowed the\nHeightened I you know what you've got that little tiny accent that I picked up stand how are you and how you're feeling\nWell it's in the middle of the night but I'm I'm a before I'm going to limit the male hunger\nAnd yes you are an ID we need we need you on this program my friend die heard these rumors that you were retiring no way right\nAh well I Am sort of retiring or I Am a much wider scheduled for the first time in ... teen years I have no engagements and these um January November and December I Can't believe it two months of outgoing and they wear\nA fence my nature [laughter]\nWell I tell you we love your stand that I'm going to tell everybody who might be brand new to the program when I was a Twenty one year old reporter\nIn Detroit Michigan my very first interview was with a fellow named Stanton Friedman I saw little slipping in the Detroit News\nHe was going to be speaking before a group\nOr at Oakland University and I told my news director I Want to go out there and interviewed this guy who's you know nuclear physicist expert in UFOs and my news director said I'm not paying for this this is not going to be an overtime for this you want to go out there and interview this guy you do it on your own time so I took my Sony tape recorder\nOut I went to interview stance and Friedman had a great interview\nAnd I've known him ever since then when I eventually\nMatured and did my night talk show in St Louis who's the gas and then when I replaced art on coast to coast stance was a staple of the program anyways and we continued and he's been at some libel dense with me I think I'm going to be with you at alien fest the end of January up near a big beer\nAnd I think so at least that's what the plans were assuming there is no getting away you know [laughter]\nSo ... tell me tell me what's going on in the field if you follow gee these days I mean you you were out there way in the beginning telling people about you ... talking about the Benny and Barney he'll case you've got books out\nWhat's the latest based on your work your research\nWell I think there's been a much wider except I think the biggest thing that's happened\nAs we've come to realize that our vision of the world was not quite right when Frank Drake talked about there might be aliens out there if there might be eight thousand places in the galaxy or were they going to be sending a signal the latest word\nAgainst it looks like there was about one point six climates per star upper galaxy star and our galaxy the Milky Way has had a hundred\nBillion stars all that means one hundred and sixty billion on it so they're all over the\nPlace and you know and that changes our picture we used to think ah we're pretty special you know there's only a few civilization ... around and we're at the top of the heap well roll over the place\nAnd that changed our perception of how important we are of course from the most important things around because we haven't been around very long\nAnd leave plenty of room in other words for others and we've come to realize that you know getting here from ... not quite the big deal we used to think it was\nA hell of a ... farmers comes from doing things differently [noise]\nSo the notion that the you know it's going to take a very long time many years to get between stars and that I Can't be much crepes and back and forth now we're ... we're fusion for example ... you\nCan get ... or we also realize that the country a\nSixteen fifty I guess a special bus or in the world was created and four thousand ... see that's right it can be ... beings around you know well he was on for a little bit four billion be\nJust a little the little\nUh our ... natural we were not as important I I hate to say this to people but we're not as important as we might think we are in the larger scheme of things [laughter] the ultimate you know her family [noise] um we're beginning to realize the busy place out there and\nThere should be no surprise that the people see others coming here because apparently they seem to be all over the place ... as a result of\nSpontaneous generation of life everywhere or migration colonization of people are being exiled and all you do you find out is saying that the mirror throwing some climate that they put an incarcerated people you know\nLike yeah like a ... boy guy's been brought on earth [laughter]\nThere you never know the way they've been treating people ... it's it's really stand to you or one of the first if not the first to break the Roswell New Mexico story nationwide\nBut in ... have you changed your thoughts in views at all about that case over the years or you pretty steadfast that what we've been talking about would you especially is still what it was\nI think it's early in the visitors and as a matter of ... kind of the notion of wired tried to tell you a first time I was on that a while we think there's one point six planets for stars so I guess like a huge number of planets and\nYou know they're probably coming here uh I I I'd have been left that there's only a few thousand points you know if\nThere are life out there and we see it ... you know they would make contact them on the white\nHouse lawn and all kinds of crazy so\nNow I think uh if it's more like realizing but at North America has more than a few people on the east coast is jammed full of people all over the place\nAnd we wrote makes us less important than we'd like to think we are and are still people thinking that the world is only a few thousand years old so what's the big\nWe're still slapped [laughter]\nAnd and so uh what most of us have learned that if it's a more complex place for them we thought it was and we hate to admit it but you know what we're not the most advanced\nAnd shouldn't be surprising again because we know now we measured the age of planning and the stars and things like that and uh hey we're not number ... oh no\nNo and so what\nWe can tell from another thing or the military budget unemployment for about a trillion dollars this year so we haven't changed much have we\nKnow that it'll have\nDon't get the goodies of are on their work or we take for leaving because we're stocking up on on ways to kill them from people\nAnd it seems I I don't want to say that's human nature a lot it appears to be close to what it is [laughter]\nI'm not going to try to explain why or how what

but it throw you off\nHow have you been wants to know you still investigating big foot and everything else\nWell I'm doing great and I'm Still on stop\nComing to the fences an extra systems for people and I've just written this new book that does include big foot ... some ... like a stump owning a ... a retired police officer\nIn white whole New York that back in Nineteen Seventy six\nHad a near face to face encounter with a a seven foot tall gigantic bipedal creature\nSaid he was thirty feet away from it and uh he'll never forget it and it has affected the rest of his life and I'm actually going to be going to see that individual in white home New York very soon his name's officer Brian golf one\nAnd so it's got to be an interesting book George I'll make sure that you have a copy\nAnd thank you for already endorsing the book yes uh it it's something that a little different for me because I'm used to writing about my own experiences that and I'm covering a broader spectrum and writing about some other folks\nAre absolutely and and build this ... this officer of course has no reason to lie has nothing to gain these are the kinds of credible witness is you have to have Harter\nI totally agree and I didn't know about this matter it was my good friend Mike super who also is a former police officer he lives in Carmel New York\nAnd he um somehow got connected with officer Gosselin\nAnd went and actually interviewed him so that's how this all came about and and then I've had dialogue with officer ... cents and he's very credible and it was not only him\nBut seven other officers are over a two nights band that actually solve this creature so it was the original two witnesses that reported hearing just God awful shrieking sounds coming out of the woods\nAnd they reported it to the local police and\nSo the first night there were I Believe five police officers present and then the second night there were two more present and had these I Witness accounts of this gigantic big foot creature in the area\nSome people believe that big bill might be dimensional other people believe it's tied to the U.S does ah I tend to think it's it's a creature of this planet ... what's your take\nWell I have to say you know again based on research and my feeling about it and we're dealing with this creature I'll I'll tell you a story in a second here but I Believe that it's both George I think [noise]\nBiblical a now or if you're reading things like uh of course you know if you're reading a knock which isn't in the Bible but if you read the book would be knock it talks about the ... the son of God coming down a taking human women which produced a hybrid offspring of giants called the ...\nThose natural um had unnatural sex acts with the beast those field now if this is true\nThen perhaps these big foot soft watch creatures are a part angel part human and then part a bear or whatever it is that you know that these ... ah\nYou know made it with\n... and I find it it can be\nTo now think about this\nIn a lot of these cases there seems to only be\nOne foot friends there's never really very rare that you hear about a lengthy trail of of these types of friends and I've thought about that and I thought okay\nIf if it's not a hoax then perhaps this\nCreature may take one step before it becomes invisible as crazy as that may sound but they're sure seems to be a pattern here of investigators or eyewitnesses that only find one track\nThat's a good point what do you think of the old Patterson give them all and so\n[noise] well I've seen it and I was kind of on the fence I thought [noise] I don't know it ... I'll say this though if that was a fake\nIt was a darn good one a darn good one and it would have to be someone you would think\nWould be gargantuan to fit in to that type of a outfit to be able to make that come off as real and another thing George if you think about this\nAs you watch the creature walk away you see the arms swinging and the arms look very long they certainly look longer than ... in my opinion what human arms would look like\nSo it is very compelling\nWhen when the ... website is not linked up the coast to coast am dot com bill being dot net for you he was the second person behind the secret door I did not get it right so I'm One for one so far\nGosh I ...

George\nParker Parker I'm thinking of the ... board with Parker Brothers\nYou're right did I Know it's got to be you have you been Karen\nI have been doing great Georgia how about you I'm great together we just didn't act like\nColor everything sure enough for people who need to know who you are curing doormen is the weed you board person is that fair to say\nI think that's fair to say we need you Portland tools I like to use and as you know I'm now director of the\nTalking board Historical Society ... so we diversify and all things talking boards ... board\nMarla a more moral Martinson believes the you're the greatest ... personnel to her\nWell she's very kind of let's say up that way she's very ...\nKnow Geron dome and maybe one of the only people we know who loves the weeds you board folks as you know I'm opposed to it I don't want to use it but Karen feels very secure with a I guess one could say Karen it has to do with who the user right\nGeorge it has to do with\nThe use your your intention that has to do with the reason why are you the number one and also what people forget it has to do with your own perceptions beliefs and what you think about\nAnd how you view yourself within the world I mean if you have a lot of\nFears that you're going to drop to you but when you're you have common sense about yourself and uses tool for\nThe place of love from the place of light from a place of wanting to explore to discover then the whole the whole atmosphere around the school changes\nSome people believe that the ... board Karen opens up a portal to allow the evil spirits and entities to come through what's your thoughts on that\n[noise] you sure ... and this goes back to what you believe or your perceptions of the world and Sullivan will believe and that they're earning power that they're just a pawn to their world\nAnd when my work really is about beyond the board it really is about teaching people to find their empowerment their core strength then and that is found by remembering recalling who they are the divine bean and that they are an extension of sorts in ... when you come from a place of that\nKind of ... and beyond that kind of belief system those kinds of intentions then you get what you desire you get you get a whole different\nWay of communicating and communion with the unseen dimensions I mean the work that I Do with this tool is no different than somebody who channels or works with a K. two meter and paranormal investigations or read stroke cars are using ... to name a few it's really a similar principle you have your intention set\nYou use it only as a tool you have ... there's no hidden spirits in view or power inside of these chunk of wood or of cardboard or glass or whatever they're made out of its within yourself the board is strictly a permission to allow yourself to access your own internal abilities to work in Israel\nHave you ever had a bad ... no I haven't had\nBad the worst I've ever had with somebody cussing at me once and the more and this is many years ago this back in Nineteen\nEighty screw through the board they were costing the\nBoard but let me tell you this George I people write to me and asked this question all the time you don't continue to engage\nIf somebody in life if I'm if I'm standing in line you know maybe get a check out the grocery store and somebody gets really rude I'm going to not engage with that person I'm going to move away walk away or not engage 'cause you don't you just make it worse and so the same thing with this tool you don't engage and all I did was say you can't talk to me that way I'm bored he might have board\nOn our dog had\nGoing good and going and that's it and it works that way now works that way because of my own beliefs about where this energy these efforts are coming from they're coming from me if I Believe everything's negative and I'm fearful\nOf everything that's one of the draw to me I mean there are lower energy is out there and once I realized I had the empowerment with me that I could really a strict in myself internally then everything changed from Nineteen eighty six on it's been just wonderful beautiful experiences\nWho's moving in the plant ya urine is at the individual ... spirit behind it who's moving\nWell let me answer that from a few different directions one as many people believe is India motor effect which really basically means your\nMind as controlling the movement and so the subtle movements of your muscles are the power suggestion is making the plants shut move okay that's one possibility\nAnother one is is that it's some kind of animal magnetism or ... that's occurring through your body and these are some old thoughts that go way back to the Eighteen hundreds\nThat's one thing about it to a third one is a is that you were actually connecting with some energy outside of yourself and it's working with you for that plant shut the moving spell out messages\nTo Beijing worked with a bunch of ...\nThe amazing and I will say this\nThe group of beans I've been working with and I've talked to him before I talked about um before on your show than work with with this group since Nineteen Ninety four I call them the guides they've explained it to me that's what they say when you come to the plant chat you set your intentions and whether you with a partner or by yourself I prefer to work with a partner I just get better results that way\nOur energy combines together reaches up to a level of vibrations like tuning the frequency to get the vibration I Want to connect with and they lower there is to reach our frequency so we can connect in the middle somewhere and that energy is what allows the messages the flow the plan to move and for the for all the communications to happen\nWe're going to take your phone calls or the half with Karen ... your questions and maybe your review board stories if you want to share them with us a I've never I've never known you the cure and to put somebody down if they don't like to read you board that I appreciate\nWell I I you know that's that's the way I mean that's what life is I mean he's one of your earlier guest was talking about the divisiveness and this tool creates a lot of controversy which can create divisiveness ocean I'm not\nFor that I'm for having a discussion about it I'm for people having different opinions\nThis tool is not for everybody I'm an even doing this work is not for everybody whether you use the tool this kind of floor are different one so I think it's great that we come together have a discussion we all different points of view and not that one's rider one's wrong with that we can exist now now I Will say this George\nIn the group the talking board Historical Society there is a great diversity of a among stuff\nWith all of us believe it doesn't work some as some of the leaves it works because of eating motor and a few of my believe it works because we're actually connect with an energy outside of herself but we can all exist together have love for this board for the history of the board and share that and the public with people and it doesn't matter if we believe on the opposite ends of the spectrum so\nWe weren't at war group that actually shows that you can get along [laughter] have different opinions without condemning each other\nOn the board start and and how how long ago\nWell there's there's there's a what Gene Gene Orlando has termed ... he owns the museum of talking boards dot com check it out um he turns it we just fish is because people say the board started back in ancient China and Greece\nThat is not true there's a different detonation tool that started back then\nThe first board that we have a we have an understanding that because we have history of it we have documents that talk about it is a board it's Eighteen eighty six known as the which board now we know this board existed and was made by a company called the ws
