Martin also working people get your book garage with the robots\nWell it's the bailing bookstores and also on Amazon and an online bookseller\nSuper super now we were talking right before the break about the emotional robots robots that would show emotion anger frustration happiness love crying is that all going to be possible\nWell there there's a lot of research and to entity area social and emotional robots and motivated here in terms of\nYou know building robots or machines are over the debt can interact with people in different ways um we were just talking about the example of the robotic sci fi and as I said in in Japan they're often used to\nHeat elderly people company you know people that would otherwise be lonely and and basically they're machine to do that then you know something of a debate about that on on the one hand it may be a positive thing for a person it would otherwise be Lolita\nRobotic pet but many people see that as kind of appalling the idea that we would take an elderly person and and dumped them into the hands of a machine because there are no actual human being that have you know the time or\nOr or interest in in in you know keeping that come that person company um so do you know there there are issues there in terms of whether or not that's really the right thing to do um another good example of of social robots is in the area of chat box which are becoming more popular especially in China and these are just software that\nWould interact with you through your phone and and people are basically having conversations with the robotic entities and even developing relationships um and again you have to ask you that healthy thing and you know it may it may not be um but it's something that again is going to get better and better definitely\nThere's a lot of research into this a Facebook for example it's got an artificial intelligence lab where they're specifically looking at\nBuilding systems that are capable of carrying on conversation so robots and artificial intelligence are going to get more and more social more and more capable of interacting with people are in terms of conversation and also in terms of emotion\nWell with emotion too I mean the ... not to get the\nUm very graphic here but I I mean people have looked in robots for companionship a in more ways than one reading between the lines here and as these robots get more and more sophisticated this is weird stuff Martin but people are going to be doing this\n[noise] yeah I mean the you know they're definitely going to be people that that you know have physical relationships with robots and so I mean I suppose that's already happened and definitely there's there's you know an industry that's going to emerge there no no doubt about it and again there's\nUm a debate about that you know many people think that it's [noise] objectify toward women for example to build robots the you know\nI mean I could see die taken a robotic woman out to dinner yeah we'll hunker down and [laughter] yeah so that\nThere are a lot of friends here that many people will find disturbing um it's going to happen yeah and it's going to happen and you know we're totally not even\nPrepared for the debate that probably needs to having about all of this and all the different ramifications up another kind of related area to robotic is is virtual reality where you're going to have\nUm you you're seeing the emergence just did hear these devices like the Oculus Rift where people will\nBe able to withstand the enter a virtual environment that might in many ways the almost real I'm so a lot of these technologies are going to hit kind of in parallel over\nThe next few years and you know right now they're really at their infancy they're just taking off and and we're going to see just dramatic progress and I think it's going to raise a whole bunch of issues are open a real can of worms in terms of\nUm what all this means for individuals and also for society well\n... you know about virtual reality ... years ago when we just started talking about virtual reality and we were thought to those possibilities in concepts I mean I really can see the day where you go to some maybe even do it at home but you go to some virtual reality a store\nAnd maybe you want to put yourself in a setting in the jungle or maybe you want to be on Mars or you want to be in a war zone or whatever but you're literally going to be as if you're there and I I see that happening really soon\nYeah I mean that's definitely that's what they're working on with with um the products that are just now coming out I mean like you said this is something you know virtual reality idea it's been around for a long time but\nWhat's really happening now both in terms of virtual reality and robotics and artificial intelligence is this stuff is really arriving now you know it's happening I mean it's really becoming practical we're really going to start to see it in our everyday lives that's that's what's different and it's it's coming at it\nAnd no one's really sure what what the implications of all of this is going to be\nAll right let's take some calls here with marching for the summer is going to go by fast as we talk about robotics\nAnd again the subtitle of his book the name of the tunnel is rise of the robots but the subtitle technology and the threat of a jobless future think about that let's go to mark his truck driving in Kentucky one day Marcus they'll have robots driving trucks who knows right\nUm I was calling because I'm I have three young kids and I'm always have a problem with the school system because\nI Believe we're headed for the new economy and the fear of our future being jobless I can understand the underlying me\nWhy aren't school was using the computer technology\nThey're trying to you double speak and say that Archie is work with computers every day but those are basically virtual classrooms and not actually teaching our kids out of program or how to ... um use robotic or how to be engineers or they're really the only thing that might be left\nAs people who are good engineering and you know what I mean\nWell I agree go ahead Martin right I mean I think\nThe real challenge in terms of adapting to all of this I mean part of it you know realistically\nTeachers that have been trained in traditional areas are not going to be equipped to teach robotics I mean you know schools are not going to be able to find enough people to teach all the kids\nUm these technologies and and you know ... it's also important to note that not everyone is going to be a computer programmer and this is not you know something that everyone is going to have that particular talent so [noise]\nUm well I think it's definitely important to do everything we can in terms of making our education system better so that you know kids can can have better prospects um we also need to think the bigger picture as a society how are you going to adapt to all of this as well\nWho is ahead countrywide in terms of robotics China U.S India Pakistan who's the leader\nWell you know the United states is probably in general the leader because a lot a lot of this is not specifically robotic but it's artificial intelligence and I think that in that it's a big area we're certainly the leader I mean you've got companies like Google for example that are really on the leading edge of this uh\nBut there is tremendous competition I mean China is God by do for example a huge company that that very very into this there have there they've got an emerging robotics industry of Japan and Germany are also very very advanced and robotic so I mean you know\nThey're just going to be terrific competition between all kinds of countries to really be on the leading edge of this and that's one of the things that's going to make it happen that's one of the reasons that it's gonna really begin to unfold and very rapid rate\nExplain the difference of a AI to robotics\nWell in general when we think of a robot we think of a mechanical thing something that can move the physical world you know machine or artificial intelligence is you know the ability of computers and software to to begin to approach the kind of thinking that human beings can do to solve problems and learn and [noise]\nUm you know basically to figure things out and and you know computers are beginning to do that in a very limited specialize sense but artificial intelligence is of course the thing that powers the robotic it's what gives the the robot its brain so he can\nYou know it has very broad based at application they may it may turn up in a robot you know in terms of a shame that can app actually manipulated environment or in other cases it may be just running on the computer and doing you know intellectual type work you know solving information problems\nWho is the leader you know I'm always looking at the companies that will become the next apple who is the leader in terms of companies public or otherwise\nThat you know is really a head of the game in terms of robotics were were you'll get the robotic soldier and things like\nWell there are a number of

our rates with here's meteorologist Jeff mar\nTemperatures will say below average wrapping up the weekend on this Sunday will be partly to most exotic and away the ... this morning in the afternoon with a high Seventy three cloudy skies that I lost fifty four and most exotic into Monday with an occasional shower behind you're Seventy right on the crease in coverage on Tuesday with a highly reaching the mid sixties meteorologist Jeff Mara from the weather channel\nWing creatures we're will says well he's written several books including encounters what's line humanoid monsters of Texas and big bird in Erie is back on coast to coast been a while but can't it's good to have you with us how are ya\nI'm George an honor to be on here with you tonight\nYou would even over the last couple of years are you still been doing a lot of research with the scripted seven chew\nA lot of really cool an amazing opportunity to investigate hold your ears creatures\nAnd most recently I Am hosting a new series on the History Channel called missing them yup we're actually up there in the state of Alaska these fabulous creatures among other things\nKind of reminds me a little bit of that movie the fourth ... what do you think\nOut of the premise you know what's really fascinating and I I\nSo you know others Georgia's how many people actually do go missing in Alaska um her capital has\nA twice as many missing persons cases as a second a closest state um for example ah since Nineteen eighty eight there have been I I think more than fifty three thousand missing person cases\nAnd ah in two thousand seven a statewide clearance house listed two thousand three hundred missing person cases just for that year so it it varies but on average\nWe have you know anywhere from from five hundred to a few thousand uh cases of missing people in Alaska a which is pretty remarkable when you consider that the entire state only both the population of about six hundred thousand people so that's about four and every thousand people that go missing without a trace\nThat's ... that's huge and theories about this Ken what do you think what the what did they come up with\nWell of course you have to acknowledge the obvious joy which which is a you know laugh is a very foreboding places I learnt myself or you know six hundred thousand square miles of\nOf a pretty intense wilderness area um you know there's obviously\nDangerous animals and all kinds of reasons that people might ah die of hypothermia get lost in the wilderness and so far\nSo you know you certainly have to take that into consideration or what would I didn't know is that Alaska does posed a number of um [noise]\nJust fabulous legends or that relate to all manner of really strange and and somewhat menacing creatures some of those that we investigated in a field trip is while edgy\nAnd all those are acknowledged in the different native legends up there you know you have different for different a major native groups the Athabaskan the you ... you know it's and so forth and they all have legends of these kind of horrible creatures are so we investigated some of those and\nIn addition to that um Alaska apparently also has a lot of UFO activity I'm sure you've probably heard that here on your show\nA lot of UFOs sightings up there as well and I guess that kinda ties into the to the the forest kind a little bit um you know so they're they're all kinds of a foreboding mysteries kind of fitting of the the great state of Alaska\nDoes Alaska can have its own Bermuda Triangle\nIt does a it's known as the Alaska triangle and it's a large swath of land that ranges all the way from the very northern part of the state or in a Barrow which is right up there in the Arctic Circle all the way down cutting through the city of Anchorage and all the way down to a Juno\nAnd it it it is an actual triangle um you can find some pretty cool diagrams of it on line and so forth and it is within this triangle area than most of these disappearances have occurred\nSo very similar to the Bermuda Triangle in that respect\nPeople picked up any strange readings in this triangle any kind of more Texas anything like that\nWell that's you know one of the ... one of the first episodes we investigated the vortex theory um there are in addition to missing people cases are actually some cases of missing aircraft\nAnd we're not talking about just small flow planes here in Georgia and there's a there's a famous case from Nineteen fifty where a military they craft with forty\nFour people aboard went missing completely vanished last transmission was over the town of snack Yukon right after it passed over the border from Alaska and I'm\nDespite an intensive search that included like three hundred military planes hundreds of personnel and spam thirty nine days they to this\nDay and we're talking you know sixty five years later they've still not found a trace it this is pretty sizable aircraft and that's just one example are there are other cases on record\nThat's bizarre yeah I'm In the early seventies and Nineteen Seventy two I Believe the speaker of the house of representatives\nHale Boggs was and I have a plane and he disappeared along with a state senator Nick baggage and and the pilot\nAnd the same thing they did an intensive search they use the you know the uh style spy ... version of the style spy planes I guess that they had in the early seventies and ah ah\nYou know they still never found any sign of that plane either so you know the theory comes up that perhaps um if you buy into the theory that there are these for taxes\nAnd I'm a voter says I guess would be the the ... the proper for old for that um you know I haven't Sanderson or the great forty and researcher had this theory that there are actually a series of a dozen\nFlorida says for what he called ... says all over the world including to Bermuda Triangle and eleven others that actually all lined up in different lines of latitude and longitude\nAnd these particular areas window areas had increased numbers of disappearances of you know people aircraft ships and so forth [noise] um so you know you certainly have to recognize the possibility\nYou know if you look at a hyper spatial hyper dimension no realities that there are these perhaps for taxes are windows portals whatever you want to call them and ah you know perhaps that is how these are the people are disappearing\nRaleigh now let's say alien crafted duct people are and we'll get into that of course or taking craft\nThese more taxes that could be there these energy forces that are like the Bermuda Triangle [laughter] how do you think if they exist Ken how do they how did they work how did they function\n[noise] well um I\nI think the best theory is that there they they have to do it has to do with a electromagnetic geo magnetic uh anomalies um you know of course the the earth itself as a giant magnet and you know that it's a\nA you have the magnetized polls you have the ah the molten corn and essentially acts as as a giant magnet but you have um magnetic fields\nAll over the planet and you know the magnetic fields affect everything\nParticularly life forces you know we have for example uh many animal species use these magnetic fields in order to navigate and travel thousands of miles um we as humans have a a ... minute amount of magnetic uh matter within our bodies\nAre so you know magnetic energy really is kind of a life force of this planet any ways ah so the theory is uh that we explore in the in this particular episode is that you know you have these vortex areas that are somehow tied into these\nA magnetic anomalies and that\nOccasionally these vortex is for whatever reasons and it will actually open up and that these massive amounts of magnetic energy will pass through and um you know essentially that you know the obviously you have to say you know that would cause of\nEquipment to malfunction if you were flying a plane for example you could imagine your compass going haywire and other things like that that would possibly cause you to crash but you know a more um I think dubious\nAnd the ferry is a possibility is that these for taxes are wormholes\nTo other dimensions ah you know two other realities in our in our hyper dimensional universe and at this magnetic energy

talking about these various things we're talking about right now specifically around the Alaska triangle and we've talked about the extraterrestrials or for tax\nNow we're talking about big put how have people can described big foot in Alaska\nGeorge this as an investigator one of the most compelling things to me is that description of the big ... or you know yesterday over\nIn Asia among snowman they're all very very similar very consistent that's very compelling to me as as a researcher but in Alaska specifically\nAh they describe a big foot or Harry man is standing about seven eight feet tall a very broad and mosques are completely covered in here from head to foot I'm very broad shoulders known neck\nI'm leaving footprints about Fifteen to sixteen inches long\nUm so it kinda fits the archetype of the traditional thaw squash your big foot or that or is recorded in Washington state California and elsewhere but what's interesting too that we picked up on and I was fortunate to hook up with a lot is a pre eminent expert on big but a man named Jay Robert alley\nAnd he's collected a number of sightings from the state of Alaska and actually told me that he has\nSome descriptions that actually characterize these creatures is standing anywhere from twelve\nTo Fifteen feet all while which is\nI think we went to ... you really you really would be frightening were you there's nothing you can do can just stop something like this\nYeah and again going back to the last guy I mean because of the remoteness\nOf some of these villages and communities in Alaska you know there's not a really good system of working roads there a lot of people that are living in coastal areas have to get around by boat\nUh you know a lot of people flying in small airplanes and so forth but ah theoretically if extraterrestrials were abducted humans or it it would make sense that they would go to a place like Alaska where they could perhaps\nA operates under a veil of secrecy\nLet's talk about what are your books encounters with flying humanoid what could they be\nWell flying humanize is the name implies is a a a creature that combines the characteristics of a human with\nWings and and uh you know essentially flies and ... and his airborne um the most famous of these of course is the mosque man I'm the mosque man of West Virginia which is a kind of become an iconic creature um [noise]\nUh had the great honor and pleasure of being up at the ah the ... festival in point pleasant West Virginia earlier this year or last year I should say and uh you know ma man is this\nStrange creature that's been reported a by hundreds of eyewitnesses standing about six and a half feet tall a bat like wings sturdy man like legs in and the most shocking and chilling feature of them off manner these giant red\nHypnotic guys that everyone says that in all the eyewitnesses claimed this creature has these giant red glowing eyes and us certainly doesn't sound like anything of this earth\nUm but um my book encounters with flying humanoid I'm kind of chronicles the mosque man a history of it in addition to that I I kind of took a global look at similar\nCreatures around the world and I found that uh there are in fact creatures like them off man there that have been reporting from from every comment from different cultures all over the world and that these descriptions literally date back thousands of years if you look at the ancient\nA ... and the Syrians and some of these really old cultures they actually are how depictions and portrayals of these flying humanoid types of creatures in their artwork and so forth [noise]\nAh so as far as what they are uh you know I I Would really be speculating George but ah I certainly don't think that they were [noise] ah I don't think that they evolved on this planet as natural living creatures I think\nThere will probably dealing with something inner dimensional or or spectral in nature\nYou even have tossed gargoyles into this batch issue\nI did I did a chapter on gargoyles I wanted to or I Want to read the book to encompass some of these other weird flying creatures like the Jersey devil of course which is very well known or a or urban American legend I'm\nI have collected accounts of seemingly gargoyles creatures not humanoid in nature or almost some people have described them as looking like a\nKind of like creatures I guess about like wings and and more animal listed type of characteristics as opposed to a human ah some people have described them as looking like flying dogs are are Griffin's from Greek mythology I'm\nSo that the descriptions very to some extent but there again\nThey're not talking about a bird we're not talking about a giant out here we're talking about something that combines characteristics from different animals and you know we creatures as well\n[noise] of all the creatures you've investigated cat from Alaska to Texas to all the places you've been which is the one creature that still basketball shoes to most\n[noise] wow that's a I mean they're they're a field trip to zoology is actually pretty darn\nVast inch wide open as an yeah people\nOften talk about big foot in a locker Matias over and I guess um I've done a lot of investigation into the trooper Cabrera which ah courses vampire like creature that's been recorded from Latin America\nAnd in fact last year I travel down to Mexico to the state of crab law where there had been literally hundreds of goats\nKilled by some unseen creditor in one night a we're talking about in higher anecdotes about a hundred vista rated one night and the according to the livestock owners I didn't get to examine the bodies of fortune ... happened back in two thousand ten but according to the livestock owners ranchers that I interviewed these these\nGoats were essentially rendered bloodless\nUh they were completely uh X. sanguine ate it of all their blood\nAnd the only tell tale fine left behind virtue puncture wound in the neck\nA so now you're talking about a modern day vampire if you will\nAnd the descriptions of the ... very but in Mexico they describe it often is looking kind of like a reptilian type creature\nA similar to man and that these glowing red eyes very sharp cheese course and and fangs and claws um but in some cases they also describe it as kind of being a wing creature as well as like a giant vampire\nBat she's there is so much on this planet can that we just don't understand or half full knowledge of yet so much but with these creatures [noise]\nEither everybody's lying\nOr they're all telling the truth and that is what keeps me pushing and driving a in investigating as you do because I think people are experiencing something I think they're seen something that they cannot explain there are things out there\n[noise] yeah and you know skeptics will often out her that I witnessed testimony for example is is not tangible physical evidence it's anecdotal evidence which is true I'm respect\nBut when you look at the consistency of the descriptions from people that are seemingly unrelated\nUm you know it it becomes a very compelling when you have these kind of a consistent theme in motif popping up from different eyewitnesses that have encountered these things and I got to tell your George I interviewed many people and I've I'm always very skeptical going in particularly up the story doesn't ring true right off the bat\nBut when you look at someone's eyes you can actually see the emotional and yep he's experienced\nYou're absolutely right get

missing in Alaska series season one did you encounter any weird stuff any stories you want to talk about\nWell I'm actually the ah probably the most dramatic thing that happened\nIs I fractured my ankle ouch yeah and this was\nActually and within a location where we're investigating an evil spirit known as the ... kind of a demonic spirit that said to haunt this particular area a particularly those who go prospecting for gold and so forth so we were in this little isolated area\nA near a creek and a waterfall and I I you know\nGeorge I got to tell you man I'm you know I'm happy like I'll happily take on big foot or locked a sponsorship of coverage and all that stuff really bothers me but when it's when you start dealing with ghosts and spirits and stuff\nThat ah it's pretty unnerving so it was kind of a kind of a weird\nAh how how I kind of happened it was a kind of a silly accident a and it put the whole production on hiatus for three months but the fact that I fractured my ankle or when we were essentially in this protected kind of sacred area where we weren't supposed to be intruding a that was\nPretty unnerving or how they get you out of there it was a it was quite an experience actually God\nThey had to build a they built they made a splint out of a drift would to kinda keep my ankle in place they had to build a makeshift stretcher out of all their jak gets\nIn several guys had to carry me down the side of a mountain a to a rescue boats so that was quite an ordeal and I feel very fortunate that I had the uh\nUh the guys there that were capable of doing that and getting out of their\nSurgeons will say orthopedic surgeons fracture is worse than a clean break\nHave you healed\nYeah I've I've I appreciate it man I've I've healed a it was a pretty bad ah it was it was pretty badly separated so three months of a sense of being off my feet I had an excellent\nSurgeon and Alaska who are kind of put some hardware in there a couple of days after the incident and a half for about nine months away from that a particular incident now so I I still have a lot of pain still very painful I have a painful reminder of my\nA judge or you're sure welcome to

but\nHe got out of World War two are not entered in basic training pretty bad he had a medical discharge Connor honorable discharge medical conditions\nAt a nervous breakdown hospital for ... for about six months recovering from the accent that he hadn't in boot camp\nUm [noise] so uh that was like forty fourth Nineteen forty eight forty nine I think it was the winner forty nine I was a baby that and I was a year old ... actually\nWe had a neighbor a man this is on the planes less than the brass go farm country in the middle of nowhere and those time farm for quite a ways apart and ah this old neighbor was a guy that used to ride to town on a tractor there's there's\nStill some old fellows out there that do that they don't have a car and they just sit in the tractor seat and they cover themselves up with big blankets and live in a town well there's this guy was one of those one of the neighbors and we had that big blizzard that hit the western us back and forty nine and it was huge\nAnyways my dad was outside watching his cows or that point he was a farmer as were among all of his family pet time\nAnd bringing in taking care of the cattle that were inside the corral and Barnes and everything else it could keep them in close to the house and he saw from that distance on a large main water Dutch bank a main water supply ditch it's supply and a lot of the farms are in that area you solve figure\nA looked like his old member of the old sweet are out there in the distance a covered up with the wind gets you couldn't see us had though and it looks look like he's describing like I'm I'm I'm a Native American that you would see with large blankets on them and to be walking\nBut it was quite a ways away so it was a couple of three hundred yards away\nAny uh God has been offers that was ... he couldn't really see any detail so I'm\nTold my mom about it\nAnd he says I think that's all men are the old man I won't name names you know my own son so you should go check on him and she said it was a blizzard out but you can't be going across the farm country out there to find him or take care of and\nJust keep an eye on them no telephones at that point in time call anybody so I watched him for just\nA moment after went back outside and still didn't see his head and it's like his back was to them and then he said his arms went out kind of what he was going to reach shuffle those you don't fight it looked like a big barrier rug that he had around them\nAnd uh he said it went off to large wingspan and he said he couldn't swallow he couldn't believe what he was saying he still couldn't see it yet but he said it was like a large wean span\nAnd then it took off just to barely above ground level like a bird\nIn was flying in the blizzard went away from I Believe and back in the house and he says you know I Can't tell anybody about what I just saw I'm going to tell you but you know based on my history nobody in the family or believe what I'm just about to tell you\nThree told my mom that and he kept that inside him for\nProbably a good a five to ten years before he told his next oldest brother wow look at him with a critical Whitey says why didn't you say something a long time ago and they have to wrestle with us and he said well no one would have believed me and said what does it look like he said look like a giant black bird\nYou know you're going to San Diego or or something with a very defined wingspan but I couldn't see a hat on it it it flew away from me where it was perched on a bitch bank\nAnd ah the best he can describe but he said uh you know one looking at ten to twenty feet of wing span and he said I thought was going to go climbing up an altitude but it got just high enough and then\nWe moved just wanes and then I flew away in the opposite direction and he said he watched it in the ... for a few seconds and then best\nHorse in the day died um passed away a ten years ago or so he uh\nHe still never resolve that in his mind as you can try to figure it out there was nobody back then that would listen to him anyway and if they don't have any thought he was accused of same things\nSo that's the story long and short and that he used to tell me and my younger sister is about that all the time and every time we would be outside as youngsters and ... and the farm area especially we lived up there at that time\nEven watched the surrounding area constantly and bothered him so he gave up farming that's one of those\nThat is the story that he walked away from 'em kinda fearful in a way a buddy said he was awestruck by what he saw any that's the best way you could describe but that's about all I can tell you about it\nI Love that story and hearing typical Thunderbird story\nYeah you know most people would be shocked by that story George but I'm not I've interviewed dozens and dozens of people many of them farmers through the years that I've seen it almost something identical to that\nI don't we know they're not con doors\nWell I'm con doors are a very ah they're adapted to a very specific environment charged they obviously they they need those high craggy peaks their very heavy birds\nAnd are

monsters giant spiders giant and how big are the spiders skin\nOh this is a great story so I I was contacted by a fireman and EMS worker in Georgia who swore to me that he was out mowing his backyard and he saw a ... a spider as big as a house cat he said it looked like a wolf spider but it was about as big as a house cat with about a twelve inch\nSpan ah and ah it\nBasically crawled up a tree in his backyard and he didn't know whether to uh to run away 'cause he was afraid that might jump on him or or to you know running grab a camera and yet he alternately went for a camera but by the time

mentioned the cheaper Cobb earlier of course all of those cases involve a mutilation is a small farm animals\nUm but moreover or some of the Thunderbird sightings and accounts or for example here in Texas we have a Thunderbird known as the big bird there were a number of sightings back in the in the Nineteen Seventy six\nI write about this time of year and right before sightings at this enormous bird like creature began to make make newspapers there were a number of calories relations that were taking place in that same exact area we're talking about the Rio Grande valley of taxes\nSo I've I've never personally examined the remains of a mutilated animal ah but I have collected a anecdotal accounts of mutilated animal carcasses and in fact I've had people\nTell me that they believe there's a link between these mutilation and some of these weird flying freed these enormous flying creatures like thunderbirds well\nAs we come up to a few more questions here for your heart as we

like a creature that saw land dish that you have to look at it and\nI and I'm thinking maybe that might have something to do with the accounts of the lack of a physical evidence for these things because you know like a I'm Sorry what was your name Gary\n... says his name was ...\nUm you know the lack of evidence on one of those people that you know I I Need I Need to be able to touch it the

wrap up here Kenny but the fact that there's really never any hard evidence that can is baffling\nAnd that's why I always tell people that I'm not a hundred percent that any of these things you want with my own eyes and I haven't seen the physical evidence and neither the scientists\nDeclare declared things to be real there's certainly a there's room for a little bit of skepticism there\nIndeed

George thanks again for having me a\nAbsolutely no good\nTimes on the show and I appreciate it [noise]\nSo returning to work on big what does this feel like you're dating your ex\n[laughter] it's a kind of odd like you said it's it's always been doing in the background and it's something that's always had my interest I think it's an elusive topic that uh there's a lot of conjecture out there but not a lot of facts\nYou'd never stopped working on it does you know what I mean your focus may have been elsewhere but it's always been sort of a you kept an eye out for articles and information\nYou know I Can't say that I've committed much energy to it in the last seven eight years focused on missing people but\nWhen you're going through the archives and you're trying to pull out articles about missing people I'm always reading about all kinds of things that I see on these first pages of news news articles and such and\nI started to come across these ah these stories about\nUm something that looked like it when you read the articles but when you read the title like Ninety percent of the time it will say wild man and I hadn't done a lot of archived work on the topic before but [noise]\nYou know eight years of digging through these archives for missing people articles I just started to pull them and put them in a folder and over the years that got large\nAnd eventually I said you know this is pretty intriguing I I think even if you're an optimist or a pessimist on the topic it's it's convincing that something over the years has been around us and it's been documented and and it shows the historical aspect that most people don't understand\nUm ... we're going to get into the specifics articles about big Wildman and giants and sometimes do the same and sometimes they're different but I wanted to just for those who were not listening ten years ago a when you were first year you recap the ... project how you got started on that what you learned\nAnd how it's kind of got its hooks into you are all these years later\nSo I I never had a dog in the fight uh I was working for a technology company I was getting ready to retire and raise a couple of kids and\nTo the guys I was working with that were super wealthy came to me and they sent me in this room and they tell the story that independently without knowing each other when they were kids they had a big for the encounter in the mountains of the the earth\nAnd they found each other later in business and you know we're sort of set a coincidence I started talking about Bigfoot and they found each other and and were shocked\nThat they each had a similar encounter and they said you know if you have Twenty years of a police officer ... years investigating an HR you're the guy really to give it that independent what will finance you go about it at your own pace you know your kids to raise that\nHelp us out with this we really we really want to find out and initially said no and they kept coming back coming back and they said at your own pace you can do it\nSo I I Wonder about looking for an area that had a few things first of all I wanted Internet I needed a hotel and I knew that there was Native American history with the topic that ran deep and I needed it within say six to eight hour driving location from where I Lived at the time in Los Gatos California\nAnd I coordinate on the area to ... which is about thirty miles south of bluff creek where the Paterson given one film was made sixty seven\nSo I started to do some geographical research some topic graphical some weather\nAnd I started to bring this together and then I went up there and make contact with Hooper police that a police background I approached them and I said hey maybe you can break down from doors for me I'm not going to not going to stretch the truth I'm going to tell the truth\nAnd every witness to come forward they're going to have to write an affidavit to what they saw under penalty of perjury\nAnd I wanted to raise the bar on the topic a little bit so that that would be no question about what was stated because they sign it and there'd be no question about it for the story was fabricated because

I don't know anybody that's claimed to have studied them in the wild walking into the wilderness and found a spot and study them year after year\nSo they have intelligence that's quite a bit different than the average animal quote unquote that you see in the woods\nAnd even the animals on the eighth gorilla et cetera side of the equation totally different they they act different they walk different they look different\nAnd one thing that everyone has to think about it's never in North America have there been any wild ape gorilla bones found ever but we have how odd while or giant human bones found\nIn ... that you really make you think\nYou know some of the descriptions any articles are ... are made me chuckle a little bit\nBecause the writers who have no ... but the topic of course because it's new to them they're they're explaining it must have been old Fred ... who disappeared into the forest a couple of years ago and now he's grown here all over his body\nThat I [laughter] I traveled with you on those and I think people are scratching to bring in some rationality to an irrational observation\nUm and and the parts of the country where these things are seen you know get way way below zero it snows huh how's Fred that decided to leave his farm going to live and that type of environment\nAnd and grow hair all over his body like that or think long hair you mentioned in the in the clip that I was reading there from a middle aged Seventeen hundreds you had a notation at the bottom that\nSaid maybe this is what Daniel Boone saw ah I didn't see the Daniel Boone any Daniel Boone story in here other than that reference that you made but he had an encounter is a fairly famous encounter right\nThat's correct and uh I I couldn't find in our car news article about it but I saw other secondary in third level things that were written about what Daniel called I I think it was a Yahoo\nYeah and\nThe description was pretty close and I don't know it's it sure seemed possible but again if you went into the quote unquote credible archives you're really not going to find that you have to do really deep and and find out what maybe some experts\nHe wrote about that they hurt in which he encountered so but again and tribal Bigfoot I've written about things where an ex or from the Watergate church was coming across country on a horse and he wrote in his explore note that\nThing came up to him while he's on his worst and look I actually spoke to him\nLarge hairy bike he'd never seen before that matched the description of a wild man or ... and it came from the

at your ... your original book Hooper project that it's still all these years later I don't think there's anything quite like it in in the field and you look at these drawings by Harvey Pratt\nAt these look like human faces these are individual faces that he's drawn a forensic drawings based on witness descriptions are\nThey looked like a people are just big hairy people but people\nNo I I think that's a general consensus\nSort of match what other tribes dated all across the U.S and uh\nWhen you try to find a group of people that have been here hundreds and hundreds of years and occupy the land to find a group or an animal I never could find it and you know again I have no dog in the fight I'm willing to listen to anything but that just isn't there\nYou look back at the Patterson gambling film I and it's you know people can argue about it all they want as far as I'm concerned it has not been debunked but that that being in that film looks closer to a gorilla or eight\nNot exactly a match but it's closer to it than some of the creatures or the the being is that that that you're you have drawings of and this and the beings that are described in the in in the uh the new book as well I mean I'm\nYou know they're very close to human like just much larger\nSo when I did with ah the\nGive them on film it and one thing Harvey has the ability yet\nIs let's say somebody goes into a bank robbed the bank has a beard on has a hat on and they're caught on camera leaving larvae have this innate ability to take the beard off the face\nSo you can see what the face looks like so you can identify the suspect\nSo apply that to the Paterson given one film Harvey took the hair off the face of the Paterson given by pad it's in tribal Bigfoot and it's stunning it looks like a Native American man\nI guess the argument could be made and probably has been made there are different types there are different tribes which is why some of the descriptions are so different I mean you have\nYou know in the history of the phenomena you have reports of different colors different sizes in your ... accounts and news clippings from over the last couple of centuries there are male and clearly distinctions between male and female specimens that are seen right\nWell I I think people forget how different humans are\nAre in my presentations at conferences they sometimes will take a variety of photos of Amazon tribal members of people from northern Ukraine of people from China\nAnd I put these pictures up there and it's it's phenomenal how different humans look if they are some type of human as I think they are then it it just fall was with ... with what we understand about our own people\nYeah your ... your game here and and went back home and describe what humans looked like a ...\nYou know you might have some trouble or they can't all look like that you know from its 'cause we we buried so differently in these clips you have some of them that are pretty short I don't remember where it is in the in the book but\nThere was an incident where somebody's camp fire their camp kept being messed with while they're out in the woods somewhere\nSo they they waited in a work in the bushes to wait to see what came and did it and the as I recall the creatures that came it was one or two they were short they were like fibers five or six feet tall not to ten or twelve feet tall but covered with hair and they were just signed up playing with fire\nSo think about\nUh let's say a twelve year old kid who doesn't have much association with fire not grown adult comes into the fire is playing with it because they have this unique opportunity that's kinda what I was thinking as I read that article from California\nUh I think from the mid Eighteen hundreds and I think it was a hunter that knew something was messing around but he couldn't figure it out so he waited on originally and they came in and he saw this\nAnd the um it's not unusual that\nHunters and campers and other things in the woods of seeing these things do an unusual things other times or they're seeing them awake playing like kids in the water um it's again the behavior that you read about reminds you sometimes have children and especially when the sizes\nMatch proportionally a smaller Bigfoot you think well it must be a young kid\nThe attitudes are different in different reports to a generally not hostile shy want to get away from people when they encounter him but they can be pretty nasty when provoked a there's a phenomenon it's reported in several these clubs where they throw rocks big rocks that humans do sort of chase them off\nA and there's one report I think it's I I forget where it is in the book I'll have to look for a of a big put that supposedly killed a hunter right that was the first one you've found\nOh it was and you know sometimes I question the credibility of some of these articles because who saw it how did they get to those conclusions um was there any evidence left behind these older articles or sometimes tough to get to the root of where they came from or how they came to those conclusions [noise]\nAnd I don't I don't put a lot of emphasis on that but\nIn the near term I've never found a big foot nowadays that's\nConclusively killed anybody and\nWhen I started writing the missing for one one books there's a lot of erroneous information that I have associated this topic on big for with missing for one one I never have I've never stayed at that I thought the big for was involved in these things [noise]\nWhy because I've never read a credible article implying that they did\nAnd since the fall on on books came out all of a sudden people have started saying oh yeah you know this campsite these campers were killed this was happening and I get these once a year or say and every time I followed up I find that it's not a credible source it never happened yet the myth\nKeep perpetuating on the Internet and they're not true and\nSome people believe all you know it's a cover up\nBut as someone who has spent an enormous amount of time in these rural areas with these rural sheriff's deputies\nOf people did not give a damn about what the federal government thinks about their behavior and trying to convince them to keep their mouth shut that's never going to happen they will tell the truth and you're the feds aren't going to be able to keep 'em clamped up\nSo when you hear these stories all these campers were killed by something really mysterious if it was happening I'd hear about it from these guys and they say half the time they say if it never happened it's a completely phony story so\nI get emails I I can imagine what your emails or like but I get a ... ah just because people know that we know each other or why doesn't ... go ahead and admitted big with its kidnapping people\nAnd I I wouldn't have to say this a day there are some accounts in this book these newspaper clippings where there are references to these huge wild men carrying all women and children\nYou know there was never any names attached to it though you know no no and that's a that's\nThe tough part of it how can you how can you leverage it as credible if supposedly they were getting carried off who saw it and why aren't the names there and if somebody's writing about it and say it\nSeems to be a there are instances where in in these accounts where\nA humans who are not aggressive and don't take shots at these animals are not only did they described them as a I think it's it's gay they describe ... gay and I don't think it's in the context to gay as we used the term these days but gay humor is what they said like a friendly\nAnd the number of times I have heard a hunter say there's no way I could shoot it it looked to human it ... I I have never heard of a hunter say\nOh yeah I had to kill this thing I shot it in the head or it it looked like an animal I've not heard that and I've heard the human side of it from a fireman\nA policeman credible credible sources that continually say the same thing and it isn't just one time in history goes way back in history or so there's something to this they got gotta skew where they said they started looking like him or apes and animals and\nAs you know Georgia's this segment of the big world that wants to go out and kill one and\nI don't have any idea why they think they need to kill one may be some kind of over loaded on testosterone but they they should wake up to the reality they're never going to kill one it's not going to happen\nThere are some reports of where these people claimed to have killed one or they've captured a wild man and they brought him back somewhere on the ship or they've got him in jail and they invariably he gets away or the evidence disappears however\nNo delays out on the roadways right now but we do have construction sixty nine southwest freeway southbound train I forty five and two eighty eight is going to be closed off due to pavement repair that's going to be going on until five AM then would you have modern construction I ten freeway westbound after Sheldon\nThis is going to add about a minute or two to your travels ...

world's leading experts on the USS Indianapolis he became obsessed with the story at the age of Thirteen\nAnd over the next two decades she met and interviewed one hundred and seven of the ships survivors she produced an award winning documentary film about the disaster\nAnd a has a lot of other research still researching this story Lynn Vincent is the number one New York times best selling writer of Lebanon non fiction books with more than sixteen million copies in print\nShe's a veteran journalist and author of more than a thousand articles has done investigative pieces that have been so I did before Congress and the U.S Supreme Court\nI'm Sarah and Lynn welcome to the program ah I I'm blown away by your book grey tabby here\nRight here is dark\nAbout Sarah I'd like to start with you how did you get hooked on the story at age Thirteen ah most ah teenagers at Thirteen or not reading about the USS Indianapolis\nWell actually it was a documentary that I saw um I was watching it with my dad it was about the Pacific war and they reduced the story of this ship to a single line which was it was a ship that carry the bomb and sunk\nAnd add to know more about it and so you know at the time there was no Google or anything like that so I actually had to go to the library\n[laughter] imagine that and you know through looking to what was available at the library I still really couldn't find anything so I thought oh someone's got to tell the story you know from what I did learn about it it was very interesting and I think there was a lot of mystery surrounding it and so I\nYou know I thought out what I could but thought you know someone will tell the story before I'm old enough to do it and yeah flash forward graduated from college and then well no one told the story and you know the right way\nSo I sought out the survivors and found Paul Murphy who was the chairman of the survivors organization at the time and he invited me to a reunion\nAnd that's where I actually got to meet the men who survived Indianapolis and I mean you know I was\nA kid who was a meeting her heroes for the first time and\nThey exceeded all expectations and they took me and kind of became like family so you know they have a couple of years later after I spent time with them and visited them at their homes they asked me to be their story teller and that kind of the cliff notes version of it\nAnd Lynn for you how did you uh hook up with zero on working on this project you've done so many other books I I Would imagine that being able to write the true story and correct\nWide and greet misperceptions a and strike a blow for justice for the for some of the key characters would be an amazing draw for you\nWell it was a very exciting project from either way I got involved when I had actually been praying I'm I pray that my work and I had been praying to have an opportunity to work on an iconic for over a two story\nAnd all of a sudden in two thousand eleven additive blue I get this\nEmail from this young filmmaker named Sarah glad it\nWell what there it didn't say about her journey with Indianapolis with that I'm In Indianapolis the storyteller she wanted to render the story as the screenplay and she actually did that she wrote a an eight part Lenny theory then she fits the two major\nProduction company and they said hey this is the best thing we can find a brother\nThat we only they many theories on foot\nSo you're going to need right if both she and a screenwriter I don't know how to write stuff so very family and friends she read that and and they've contact with me\nAnd um she didn't know number one that I and then maybe veterans who didn't know that I had been praying for an opportunity to do a story that's like this one um\nAnd\nMy only problem was is that all she was wanting to fight and I wanted to help her write the book [laughter] so um I\n... that I had to figure out how to manipulate or in a way to help her but uh eventually over the course of several\nMonths we finally met and then ah\nWe agreed to work on it together and we didn't really get started in earnest until twenty four and um and then when we did it like a project pick a three and a half\nTo ... where you are on a campaign to right or wrong that the story had been wrong that a lot of the the people who who are key players had been treated unfairly is that how you started or you didn't know about that when you started\nI didn't you know I ... I knew a small part of that um that was definitely\nPart of what I wanted to tell but really I mean the major objective of it was to tell the whole story of this ship you know she'd been reduced to thinking story or shark story\nAnd no one knew she was this incredible ship that admiral sprint commanded you know most of the Pacific war and the campaign that have participated in from her deck or that Roosevelt took her on the first cruise\nYou know us acting president ever left the country on so it was so much more like well you know everyone's got to know what an incredible shift this was in what she did a besides being sent [noise]\nBut I'll tell you you grab ... my father was a at open now and he ... he drove a landing a craft from uh the ships took us troops on the shores so of course you know the the fact that the Indianapolis was involved in those conflicts grab my attention I'm imagining him being there and some of the scenes that you describe\nI'm Lynn why don't we start with you describe in a sort of the ... the capitalize version of what the world knows about the the USS Indianapolis and then we'll go to Sarah to uh give us the version that that you guys have helped uncover\nOkay that would be great um Indianapolis as Sarah mentioned ... ... ... ... and I'm a small park that a lot of people don't know is that she with the facts if at the battle of half an hour where your father drove the\nWrong and craft and I'm\nIn the weeks leading up to the actual invasion she with his depending on the shore of environment and during that time and march thirty first Nineteen forty five\nShe was hit by kamikaze nine men were killed twenty sick injured and that was what really that are on the fateful journey had that not happened she might have gone down in history as victorious flagship of the world war two at the theater\nI'm Victoria that have now as well as nine other major battle\nBut instead she went back to their island California for repairs and that's where she\nThat ... has been put up but they're still working on the clean up that closure will be in effect for a while that is also got the exit ramp closed off his wealth construction is on going forty five southbound at sixty nine to south bound connect ramped east takes will be closed until five AM ...

Lynn Vincent I interrupted you before the break we you're about to tell me about the uh Japanese commander a little bit\nYeah a commander ... lieutenant commander ... and everything we tried to present the Japanese point of view in a sympathetic way I'm meaning that they were\nActing out of there since their conscience and conviction and so um we were able to make great use the ... um\nWell it was it and then more for that we've published after the war who first published in Nineteen fifty two and Japanese language and it was later published by Henry Holt in the fifties or here in America in English and it was really an examination of Japanese submarine warfare in World War two\nWritten from men or how he met his point of view and there was a chapter on is devoted to Indianapolis\nBut because we were looking at the larger Pacific War in the end of the world war two in general we were able to really develop his personality a lot he was the commander who cared for his men\nHe was the commander who was very very frustrated with the state of technology and Japanese submarines and really against protocol at the time because Japanese had a very autocratic top down military\nUm he went around banging on doors asking for radar and more technology for his that Marines because that means that Marines didn't have radar right up until the end of the war and so he was very frustrated because he was saying a lot of his brothers that commanders\nAbout Fifteen men on a floater net and those are the kinds of nets that had the cork pieces throughout the net to keep it afloat and men were spread out on this and just this huge frenzy of sharks attacked\nThere was nothing left and so reports like this were coming in the you know and even all the way until rescue I mean part of\nThe rescuers accounts because by the time that the rescue arrived the men were really incoherent they were able to tell or know what was happening by that point in the story but\nYou know the rescuers are reporting that they're fighting off sharks are literally punching sharks in the face to be able to pull men bored\nBecause the shark attacks increased as the I guess you know I don't know\nHow much sharks ... things but they said it seemed as they were pulling the men from the water the shirts\nUm the attacks increased and you know this is I Can't imagine how horrifying that would be I think seeing one shark would give me a heart attack and imagine hundreds of them you know one of the sailors reported there were so sick they could walk on their backs you know from shark to shark\nThat we're underneath them just swimming there they\nCould stand on them\nThere's want to kill you have the sailor you sort of go becoming delirious and he's looking things drugs they oh there's food just reached out and grab some food right\nMhm [noise] yeah I'm young and some by the name of John ... and he actually took his socks off\nAnd thinking he was gonna wiggling toes as bait to learn the sharks in and catch one and then if you know he kind of came to a sense is that the last minute and realized oh this is probably not a good idea but you know he was nearly out of his head at this point and put a sock back on quickly and\nManaged to stay safe you know so they\nWere doing the worst thing [laughter] so some of the worst effects Lynn are happened to those people who drink the water there just wasn't completely crazy\nYeah that was really chilling to me because you know here you know if you can imagine they're they're on their ship ah the everyone knows it's almost the end of the war they were having this leisurely\nA sale they think across the Philippines see 'em and then you know the next thing they know they're trying to survive this horrible ordeal these these young sailors who were just playing pranks on each other the day before\nAnd then by the second day forty eight hours then now we were talking about the hoarding of water but as Sarah mentioned there were only a sixteen wraps between there were there were four groups was it three groups are there were four groups of four rap\nOr three groups of four rats in any case there were four groups\nOf four raft but then the one group split apart on the second day\nThat's right so so there were so any water that was available was only available on the raft and so there were only about forty men among all these hundreds and hundreds of men who had any water at all and so by you know second day in and the third day and\nThey were starting to get very desperate from dehydration and so\nThere were some men who absolutely knew not to drink the salt water no matter how Thursday they got that there were others\nWho although they knew that the sun and the exposure and the dehydration itself was perversely causing them to lose their faculties lose their ability to reason\nSo some of them to come to the idea that they could strain the salt out of the water and so you see one sailor holding up a torn piece of his shirt\nA while the other one poured the water through it into this into his mouth and thinking that that would strain the salt out well of course that didn't\nAnd then others would you know take small for it is that it's the water I'm hoping that no one would see them and talk them out of it but then eventually they would just begin gulping it like they were gold\nYou get out of a mountain stream and what happened with that is a condition called hyper ...\nAnd bled for\nBlood cell ... from the brain um brain short circuit just like when a tree branch falls on a high voltage line and they would just go out of their head and um they die very horrible that I'm drinking the water\nYou know you have the the Japanese commander who decides oh let's get outta here because he figures there's no way the ship is here by itself something else has to be around either that or it without a site all of a sudden and he thinks oh that must have gone away or\nHe couldn't imagine I guess in immediately that it did sunk that quickly so he leaves I'm which is I guess fortunate because they could have surfaced and finished them off\nYou have a somewhere I was a pilot who ends up testifying at the court marshal later\nA un American pilot who saw what he thought was a battle he ended up telling somebody about it but no one paid attention uh we got to go to a break in about a minute maybe a ... Sarah you want to talk about that guy\nYeah there was a gentleman by the name of Richard ... and he was an army pilot he was transporting a general who wanted and you know that the general death in the cockpit with him and it's the late night patrol you know it's just after midnight\nAnd they see that you know kind of explosion coming from Milo and there's now report coming in saying that there is any kind of enemy action so he thinks well maybe this is drills or something of that nature but yeah I guess than any kind of out of sorts for him so he said well you know report it\nAnd he did actually try to report it a couple of times\nAnd yet the army side of things that will let the navy do whatever they're doing just ignore it\nAnd he's still want to hear and maybe personnel in Guam I Believe you know hey I saw the genuine look into it and they said no there's nothing report in that area don't worry about it\nAnd so you know\nThere's actually more to the story with that where you know they have a son\nWho you know this gentleman Richard ... to have passed away but it's then carried on a story and you know there he actually had diary entries of the time and at the ... father and it didn't line up with it but he didn't find out and tell a few days after when were released about it that he when\nWe're talking about ... about Indianapolis the true story of the worst disaster in us naval history in a moment we'll talk about sort of the aftermath it's amazing that anyone survive but there were survivors and what came next is equally amazing we'll be right back\nFind out more about tonight's gifts to log on to coast to coast am dot com fads me\nWe have\nWas and what the hell is\nGoing on good thing we know what's going on just on this year use radio seven forty Jaycee our age\nElizabeth Warren make them smoke signals scare away white men but Elizabeth Warren you're not a Native American\nYes I Am one thousand to\nNative American well whenever you are you're getting ... from the smoke signals all over your ... you're\nClean you should call the\nClean Air Act the clean air ducts carpets rugs upholstery tiny one stone and you could visit them online hoop steam dot com me chip Warren run for voters in twenty twenty yeah good luck with\nThis report is brought to you by e verify use e verify the enhanced employment eligibility verification tool that can confidently confirmed ... they've got a new law and the process has never been better check it out and get started it either by DACA slashed down is\nOctober twenty second what's new today on the free I her radio am I check out I was on her radio resentment inside the studio during a brand new episode with the legendary sir Paul McCartney no I'm In St Paul down when you're leaving to talk about his new album Egypt vision and of course some discussion about a little band\nCalled the Beatles we were ... when we were playing music I her radio present in the studio check it out now\nWe all have some pretty cool friends celebrating is a very good friend of mine some more than others like I was a friend of mine I like that she's in front of my hours a friend of mine that there is one person we really like to be\nFriends with you have so many friends\nA friend joining us on Facebook and Twitter and you'll get used to use the worst and all kinds of guys you'll never year on the air last you'll be the kind of friend he can bring to my friend of mine just click on the link Katie R.

it's three o'clock news radio seven forty Katie our age trafficking whether together here is that killing two accidents\n[noise]\n\n\nWhen Vincent I Wonder if you could discuss for me in a broad sort of strokes are the sequence of improbable events that seemingly combined or conspired to make things worse as if things just sort of drop through the cracks or that made their survival you've been more improbable\nWell at their mention there with the departure meant that didn't go through from Guam it looking there was a tenant I'm looking I who had read the the thing that\nI can get a ride to the report said well why don't the brightest guy in the world and as a matter of fact had received a report saying it's match that he thought well\nIf I don't have to report arrival that shit I guess that means I don't have to report non or ride over here and then you know heritage\nMaybe the entire focus was on the impending invasion of the Japanese home islands so all of these things along with the lack of a distress signals combine to make it says in Indianapolis slip through the cracks\nAnd it wasn't until a PD one venture a bomber piloted by lieutenant check when I'm just happened to be flying over the area that the survivors responded in the water\nThere is a very poignant story you tell in the books are uh uh about these pilots that they dropped all the supplies and try to get these uh guys in the water or something you hang onto their they can't do any more they're out of supplies they have to hit back then there was one guy whose wimpy way up\nIn the middle all by himself just swimming is a I I don't know where he was swimming do or what he was doing but there was nothing they could do for them\nI mean I imagine that being so\nTerrible to witness you know your did everything you could you find out there's no there's nothing left on your plane to help this little loan swimmer\nAnd you know and then I Believe when they got to land they actually found one more life jacket or something they could have thrown and you know speaking to in a leaves men reading\nTheir testimonies later on it affected them the rest of their lives like they were devastated about not being able to do more and that was really the sentiment and most of the rescuers you know they were out there feeling like they were playing God you know are these men alive or they\nYou know who do we take for you know shift for el CBP the landing craft is full what do we do if we can't say one more man and he's still alive and you know that was a burden they carried till the end of their lives\nYou know it's war time is when the focus is on you know Japan and ending the war and um there's a lot of big stuff going on so things did fall through the cracks but ah [noise] is it an accident that the story was kept out of the newspapers until BJ day well reporters\nAre reporting on at the at reporting on the incident at the times did not believe it was an accident so the rescue occurred beginning on August second\nUh Nineteen forty five and the war ended on August fourteenth that between the time zones fourteenth and fifteens Nineteen forty five\nAnd they did not announce that Indianapolis had been sunk the newspapers did not release it Washington not didn't Washington did not release it\nUntil v J day until they announced that Japan had surrendered and that the war was over so if you can imagine huge banner headlines on August fifteenth Nineteen forty five and Seventy two point headlines\nYou know Japan quit the war is over\nAnd then maybe below the fold in a very small article you with us Indianapolis cruiser sunk and reporters that time believed that Washington and the navy specifically did that to divert attention away from this disaster that was\nYou know resulted in the loss of almost nine hundred men on the very brink of the end of the war\nSyria talked to me about the captain McVeigh and what's going through his head and then was the court marshal inevitable let him slide given that the war just did or did they have to pursue this\nWill really there was an enormous pressure from the eight hundred and Seventy nine families who lost loved ones on the ship to have answers to have someone to point a finger at and so you know this is\nA tremendous loss for the navy and you know so many people and it was a very public you know\nLike Clinton said this was announced when the victory of Japan over Japan was announced to the world and people are out celebrating this in the streets but there are families now grieving that their son or their brother uncle is not coming home and people wanted answers and so\nYou know it wasn't obvious that a court martial would be taking place I think on the onset\nBut as the investigation started you know revealing things and who was involved in who knew what was happening and what did happen prior to the sinking and how it could have prevented and maybe not the sinking prevented but certainly the fact that no one knew they were missing and that they were left out there to die you know\nSomeone needed to be to blame and a lot of people got blamed right\nThere were there were a lot of people who were brought in for questioning there was a quarter of inquiry that was done and you know it's revealing that\nThese are pretty important people that had information that could have prevented the situation and so really you know at the time these names the you know admiral king and ... and all these these men who were\nEssentially the rock stars of the area you know we won the war and\nAnd the American public no holds these men on this high platform and we can and they are the same time are we supposed to bring them into a courtroom\nAnd have them testify in tarnish their name I don't think that the navy wanted to take that route and essentially you know the captain is responsible for the vessel so the moment that he was brought to court martial there was nothing to do but find him guilty even though it wasn't just\nA little let's talk about the court martial of our mentioned earlier the unusual step of bringing the the Japanese commanders to justify that had never happened before and then uh I guess the main thrust of the argument against the captain is that he failed to the exact the exact thing could have prevented the Japanese from sinking ship\nThat was one of the two charges on and not only was it unprecedented to bring in commander hashing voted to testify but it was unprecedented that a captain with the court martialed at all for having his shit sunk in World War two there were hundreds of vessels son\nCaptain Charles McVeigh was the only happened here was ever court martialed\n[noise] excuse me and I'm\nSo as he did have to charges against him one was and by the way the navy we we found in a records because we went to the national archives we went to the library of Congress Naval War college and so forth\nAnd we found these records where the navy was actually casting about to find that charge that they thought would stick\n'em and as Sarah mentioned there were all these leading lights of the Pacific war who were involved in this you know the the commander of the civic forces the commander in Guam and these were men who had really been the architects of this new global sea power\nAnd admiral Ernest King who was the fleet admiral\nOur theory is that he didn't want to see all these leading lights dragged into court and so that's why they were casting about for something that would stick with Nick day and so what they charged him with was failure to call a band and shit in a timely manner which was quickly disproven because there were a lot of witnesses who\nUm heard him call abandoned ship and then her to pass man demands the second shift as you are the second charge rather as you mentioned was failure to think that\n... was an anti submarine warfare tactic worship which they're back and forth across based course\nHoping to throw off the aim of the Japanese seven commander\nAnd indeed happened make they did the stick as the ... at evening twilight\nOr just before the ship was sunk but the standing orders of the military put that in his purview that was at his discretion and he chose to exercise that discretion um and then when commander ... testified at the trial he said that he would have socked McVeigh\nWhether he had been ... or not and then it didn't make a difference that he was testifying and Japanese through translator and the translator did not translate exactly what he said uh correctly and commander ... who could understand\nHas been cleared not seeing any delays in the area but we do have a new collision on the French who drove a forty five north freeway north bound to
