C. P. international limited\nIn Alexandria, Virginia based company where his primary duties include working on multinational programs for the department of army and since October of two thousand and two colonel McGinnis has been a member of security Donald Rumsfeld military analyst\nGroup and his brand new book is called an alliance of evil Russia China the United states and a new Cold War has the mystery of the end times finally arrived Bob McGinnis welcome back to coast to coast how are you\nI'm doing well Richard thank you for having me this evening\nMy pleasure let me throw a couple of items that you very quickly and one is that we are we are hearing that us national security\nAdviser John Bolton is reportedly up pushing the president to withdraw from a treaty designed to prevent a nuclear arms race between us and Russia that would be called the ion air for the intermediate range nuclear forces treaty which has been in place since Nineteen eighty seven your thoughts\nWell of course the Russians or suspected and I think I'm a lot of people would agree in violation of the Nineteen eighty seven ins treaty because they have\nA not only build practice the use of ballistic can cruise missiles that have a range of five hundred to fifty five hundred kilometers in violation of that a wave tractor cruise missile we called nine and seven to nine\nOr that has um you know not met the criteria is violated the criteria now of course John Bolton is on his way this coming week over to Moscow to talk about that but they're also Richard going to talk about\nThe possible renewal of twenty ten new start and you know President Trump said um you know weeks ago that perhaps we aren't going to renew it and that should be a a a really a a shot across the bow of Moscow cause of concern to solve it you know that has cut back dramatically\nA nuclear weapons and\nTo Fifteen hundred and fifty are deployed strategic warheads and about seven hundred vehicle\nSo you know this is important in a world\nThat I Believe has really cross the line to a new Cold War because the old Cold War is all about nuclear Holocaust and the threat posed by the Soviets in the U.S we're entering a new era right now\nI Want it also dial back to September when Russia began his largest ever military exercises with three hundred thousand just think of that three hundred thousand soldiers or this was a a a drill with China\nAs a rehearsal for some sort of large scale conflict it was called the Vostok twenty Eighteen drills just this kind of really illustrates how China and Russia are aligning themselves perhaps against the United states\nWell it does and in fact\nA really yesterday you had the two defense ministers from Russia and China met and they're getting ready to uh jointly head a commission on military technology that is of course being shared\nA significantly between the two we just sanction the Chinese for buying\nA fighter jets from the Russians and also the S. four hundred a surface to air missile system and the Vostok Eighteen exercises you indicate I had three hundred thousand\nA soldier's thirty six thousand\nA armored vehicles or at least a thousand bombers some of those strategic bombers um in fact flew off\nThe east coast of Russia straight at\nThe United states you know practicing what I Would consider bombing runs against show me a clear air force base and Fort Greely Fort Greely is where we have the mid range nuclear anti missile capability and we have and we're growing that mostly because of the\nNorth Korean threat but of course the Chinese have a rising capability and the Russians has never gone away\nI Want to ask you whether there was an opportunity last after the fall of the iron curtain the end of the Cold War\nWhen\nPresident Reagan had essentially vanquished\nOr when he called the the evil empire the Soviet Union a and then later assurances were given to the Soviets or the Russian Federation that NATO would not encroach one centimeter towards Moscow and of course that was violated some might suggest that the United states was poking the\nBear and given their\nTheir passion for for for a nationalism in in the former Russian Federation um coupled with the ascension to power of some who might some many who would suggest is perhaps the greatest Russian leaders since the great\nThat that this was an opportunity last that that ... that the United states provoked the Russians and they could have been our lives but now here we are what are your thoughts\nKnow I think you're correct Richard we did ... and of course we've continued to do that they considered a Ukraine or the breadbasket of Russia\nAnd of course they're continuing to fuel the anti key of a civil war which I call in the eastern part of the country and that's after having seized Crimea and of course two provinces in two thousand and eight from the republic of Georgia and they're pushing back\nAgainst the Baltics against Poland Hungary Romania or the entire a former Soviet satellite regimes\nAh that's something that I Know when Mr Yeltsin uh the new president after Gorbachev stepped down came to this country met with Bush Camp David\nWe had the opportunity to do more than just give them a few crumbs we could have brought them into the fold and I think that that really is you indicate fueled the rise of Vladimir putting\nAnd you know ... of course have captured the imagination of the Russian people and as a direct result has really fueled\nA nationalism and patriotism in a way that uh uh they're somewhat um I Would argue blind to perhaps what the West is looking at it because\nIt was jammed although it appeared on Nineteen eighty one tattoo he was actually recorded in late January or February Nineteen Seventy five during the black and blue sessions you may recall the black and blue album that was the first\nIn which I run it would appear to and I may be mistaken but I think I hear Billy Preston unlike a piano there and Pete Townsend on backing vocals [noise]\nAll right uh news casts an Argentine TV came to a screeching halt late last week when they anchor spotted and not identified flying objects soaring over the city of winners are a\nStrange citing reportedly occurred on the program but none is Argentina's last Wednesday as anchor Mary yellow Fernandez was standing in front of a giant screen which showed the

satellites of course the Chinese have an anti satellite capability they're\nShooting literally for the moon and they're building a capability to put a space station up very shortly now they're doing the types of things that maybe twenty Thirty years ago we as the United states we're\nWe're talking about I'm beginning to do while they're rapidly catching up and you know this is caught our attention that's why\nYou know the president and the Pentagon and wrote a national defense strategy that focus like a laser on Russia and China as untrue competitors are near peer competitors across the board and it's not not just\nThe military it's economic it's diplomatic\nIt's all these other areas that show national capability and national power and we're finding that our adversaries are are doing quite well thank you\nHow concerned should we be with the fact that Google arguably one of the most powerful companies in the world I knew a monopoly on the distribution of dissemination of information or appears to be in bed with the government of the People's Republic of China and it's helping them\nCensor information in that country\nAnd they're manipulating algorithms so that they can monitor your own population\nAnd of course they won't negotiate any longer with the Pentagon on you know those types of things on the use of the cloud et cetera\nUm that that's disturbing um you know they are a U.S company and you would think that uh they would have some allegiance to this country and and not become a part in\nThe hands of the communist leadership in Beijing and yet that's exactly what they're doing I suppose to a certain degree because they see a rising Chinese economic power and they want to be part of the success of that\nA country you know they will you know by a lot of estimates or be the world's leading economic powerhouse by twenty thirty five you know somewhere\nAround there and unless something dramatically happens in a very different way they're going to achieve that and they're going to have\nA leverage using what I outlined earlier the belt and road initiative which is pouring hundreds of billions you know maybe a trillion and a half\nAcross the world and arguably at least sixty eight countries where they're buying infrastructure and thereby markets and they're controlling information flow you know I see the the Internet and what can be used and what can be so they're strategically doing some very bright very smart things\nUh but when you look at their autocratic regimes and their president for life under President Xi and the amendment of their constitution and you're seeing something similar\nUnder putting with the possibility of ruling for a long period of time and the collaboration across all these friends\nSharing of technologies and kind of they kind of have to love one another because ah the rest of the world doesn't seem to like them except they're holding to them because they're being bought up to a certain degree by the Chinese\nI Want to ask you about\nSaudi Arabia and how important it is the United states to maintain this alliance with a bad actor in a bad neighborhood or given of course they could show the um the brutal slaying of of a ...\nUm [noise] and how that might\nMean there's there are dominoes at play here obviously I'm Wondering what your thoughts are on how we should proceed or how the United states or the Trump Administration should proceed\nAh with with Saudi Arabia and how that plays into all of this a sort of his little Cold War scenario\nYou know it's never simple as that and the cars so sugary a situation is is tragic\nBut if you've been watching Mohammed then psalm psalm and you know the crown prince uh you know he's probably been cut down a few notches here recently especially with\nAnd the so called Davos and the the desert which he was expecting all these\nUh donors and investors to come over and had him on the back and giving more money so they can develop a true economy that's not based solely upon petroleum\nUm we have a lot invested in the ... the Saudis we have a lot of Americans over there are a lot of technology they're totally dependent upon our arms of course\nThey could go to the Chinese or Russian but they don't want to because ours typically are much better I think the big question and that part of the world one is oil\nA and and how are they going to use dollars in the future but also Iran Iran is not to be a ... with then of course that their their major adversary against the Saudis\nAnd the Russians and Chinese are lined up with Iran and were lined up with a Riyadh a regime\nUm they're all ... they they've got um you know a way of doing things uh that uh certainly in the west where not all excited about uh but the reality is that um\nYou know a friend of my ... you know my friend you know what the expression Richard a friend of my enemy is my friend or something like that that\nThe idea being that we we have to have\nPartners

Decatur a\nDestroyer a in the grave and reefs and the south China Sea the Chinese warship came\nOnly a few meters away from it and just in the last day we've had a couple of B. fifty twos fed it flew over a you know the\nContested area in the south China Sea people need to understand that um these islets uh thirty four hundred acres that the Chinese have militarized with cruise missiles and here to fence weapons and [noise]\nYou know created not only harbors for their warships but also for the jet fighters and their bombers that they practice from\nThat these are claimed by the Vietnamese a Taiwanese as well as the Filipinos and there are six hundred and sixty miles or in that range south of China so this is not just\nYou know next door to them it's really in the middle of that to see but these confrontations are on the increase we've had a lot in the south China Sea East China sea\nOr the Russians are being very provocative at sea and in the air as I indicated and of course they have their neighbors\nTo the west are terrified to the point that the\nUh polish a prime minister is called for a given to us two billion dollars to Ford station armored brigades so that they can be prepared and case uh the Russians do what they did\nA in Ukraine or Crimea or the republic of Georgia which is a concern and you mentioned the mercenaries yes\nBack in February of this year we killed a couple of hundred and it's interesting we have a a hotline with the Russian military in Syria and we called him and said are these your troops and they said no and so we've\nKilled them um and that's the nature of mercenaries but they were there to represent a the Assad regime a and of course uh the Russians wife their hands of even though we know where they came from and what they did [noise]\n[noise] well Syria uh obviously that looms large in any time scenario uh is is is that the most likely flash point as far as you're concerned\nAt this point it certainly is a flash point I Would argue that ah you know if you've got into phase ... thirty eight that we're really talking\nUh the the dog and mad dog a and that mad dog could be the country of say turkey I Know it's interesting a friend of mine spoke with a\nA general now president of the sea of Egypt who told him less than a year ago that he thought that air to one who is the current president\nOf turkey is really a fix to be the collie and\nTo establish a count fat and his statements have been very very um conducive to that interpretation not only within the region but\nYou know the release of uh the American pastor Brunson here recently ah was after great pressure we put on him a air do on a to cooperate with us but yet\nWe find that he's traveling all over the world he was just two weeks ago in of all places current cologne Germany what was he doing there yeah he was doing a state visit but he was also dedicating a mosque\nNow that's not very typical of presidents of countries going across the world doing that sort of thing but this guy has a and he consistently has\nHad over the years a very ambitious thoughts about uh the re emergence of the Ottoman Empire he isn't Neal Ottoman and I don't think anyone that follows him closely would dispute that some\nOf these are issues Syria is you know clearly something that everyone is watching have collaborating with Russians who are of course uh even though there are some friction there they are working together\nAnd of course they're working against the likes of Riyadh but they're collaborating as well with Iran who has a\nLot of forces especially crude forces there near Damascus and operating even drones threatening northern Israel so when you kind of put the picture together\nYou see the Iranians are certainly the Turks are sort of our allies\nThe Russians and the Chinese and the Chinese Yasser ... beginning to show up and even Syria hoping to kind of look their chops and put together that country once a declaration of peace can be found and they can find a political solution so\nA lot of players here a confused battlefield uh but I clearly see Syria as part of this\nA long term agenda\nEven care to one and and I wanted to ask you about turkey\nDid they belong in NATO even at this point\nYou know it's a fair question I don't think so um my concern would be one you know if you go back to O. three we tried to

Bush draw Iraq Iran North Korea back the legal now your book is very well but we weren't perpetrate evil around the world where the weapons of destruction everywhere even inferior\nOr not did not do one you're going to try to get people you're with their lives during that he did the ... wrong there\n[noise] yeah well I sort of question in their\nRichard it it is it is perspective um yeah I think that the the history of the Russian a Soviet Union certainly where they killed millions a under mouth\nAnd China where they kill millions a and their foreign policy where they\nProvoked all sorts of proxy wars um the the types of values that they support uh yeah we do sell weapons are defense security cooperation agency you know has done a robust year this year double what we did last year\nWe we made mistakes with some of our alliances and the like\nUh we've helped topple governments perhaps in the past and and and did it for our own national interest so I think what you said moments ago Richard is absolutely correct and that is\nA we don't have any friends we just have interest and those interests are going to shift from time to time given what\nThe United states needs to secure itself and to prosper\nUm sometimes uh in the eyes of the beholder it is is evil or certainly in my perspective when I've you know label Russia and China as an alliance of evil I look at their history and I look at what they want today and it's certainly not what my country wants\nAnd I do believe a United States\nIs not perfect but it's doing you know some pretty good things around the world and I I tend to want to respect and care for our interests over there's\n[noise] particularly because you know people talk about democracy and and how that is really what protects a freedom but it's not really democracy it's it's the rule of law and we have the rule of law in North America thank God in western civilization which I look around at Seventy eighty percent of the rest of the world\nThey don't have rule of law it is the wild west and there are no protections afforded the individual you can be literally swept up the street in the middle of the night and executed\nFor for no reason in most places in the world\nAre and to me that's evil\nYou know you're you know there are a million Muslims that are incarcerated in West\nAnd a western China today and that's a un report or somebody can look it up here\nIn the last week or so why are they doing that because they they say that there are extremist well you know we don't do that the United states now yes we have a history of incarcerated in Japanese under FDR a that was wrong we've acknowledge that we do\nBad things but the rest of the world you know I I have I've gone through I think five passports have been all over the world I've seen some pretty bad places um\nAnd yet you know it's always wonderful to come back home to the United states where we enjoy the rule\nOf law we aren't afraid is Richard points out of being arrested pulled out of bed and shot and they had 'em for families being carted away and yet unfortunately we're seeing that elsewhere in the world and\nThe likes of the Chinese are doing some of that to their own people and so they're all\nGotta jump in here and thank you so much for spending two hours with this alliance and evil Russia China the United states in a new Cold War thank you so much

I don't happen to believe it that's just me but he was one of the things that sort of bothers me about that situation and that is if we in fact we choose our circumstances\nWhy would someone choose for example a to reincarnate into a life that leads ultimately to physical abuse doesn't that almost place the the the burden on the victim in that case you were you chose that life\nOkay there are certain experiences that we learn from and yes I I understand where you're going in and I and I really do feel for the people that do choose a life like that it is a way of learning certain things and please remember we do have free will\nAnd there are times when people will uh advice us in the end the physical to get out of those relationships\nThose relationships if it's a pattern that a person has to learn from [noise] then they may have to go through it but there's always the chance\nThat they can leave those relationships or we leave 'em I I I understand that when when a child is young but there's no place they could run into a because it's if it's parents ... and ... um and there are circumstances where they live on the most horrendous ...\nCircumstances yes it is a tragedy to begin with ... yet what we're learning what were overcoming and that's the whole key here\nIs to overcome those abuses and also it for the parents if it's apparent abuse or other types of accuse they have the opportunity to overcome that as well and usually if it's a long term relationship they might have agreed to do that both of them\nThat this is the role that they will take\nAnd it's up to those two people that come to some kind of resolution of their behavior that they have to rise above that particular pattern so we can see the negatives of it but there are cases where people watch a bum themselves\nAnd they become a hero and their own life because of the person that they may have been they've been abusing\nThey may have to take them somehow so there's always hope here and yes we do have guy an angel that do help us it is up that we is up to the individual to draw upon that help we need to call on that help our angels in guy\nAll right Joe thank you for that a friend is on the wild card line she's in Clearwater, Florida ...\nYes thank you for taking my call Richard\nUp three weeks ago I asked your help in winning a roof\nOh yes I Do a ...\nI'm calling back to thank you and the coach listeners there were so kind and calling and I got messages from them in a lot of votes in eight hours time after talking with you in eight hours I went from eleven percent to fifty one percent of the boat\nYou got the new rumors and a roof ran and got the new ruin you did yes I went out on\nThe twenty seventh of October which is just a week and a half of wealth barely a week away it's just wonderful and\nI I wanted to thank you for your generosity when I got nervous when you were interviewing me used according to what I was saying that well and so beautifully but I think it helped in the message getting across you are very very kind and very generous and how you handled it\nWell congratulations friend I'm I'm a police and of course you know those people that own the houses surrounding\nYou that didn't get a new roof I I pray that somebody will come into their come their way as well and they're also get new rules we don't want to we don't want winners and losers we want all winners\nI I I realize that but what about the fall and it really is a desperate situation and um\nYeah I remember the call and I remember you are you were in dire straits after caring for for parents and grandparents and so forth\nA ha so I'm I'm ...

expert on national security and foreign affairs\nHe currently serves as a national security and foreign affairs analysts for moody broadcasting radio network Salem Radio network in ... and as a regular on several other radio networks he recently completed a year as a Fox News military analyst he's a senior systems analyst with the CBP international limited\nIn Alexandria, Virginia based company where his primary duties include working on multinational programs for the department of army and since October of two thousand and two colonel McGinnis has been a member of security Donald Rumsfeld military analyst group and his brand new book is called\nAn alliance of evil Russia China the United states and a new Cold War has the mystery of the end times\nFinally arrived Bob McGinnis welcome back to coast to coast how are you\nI'm doing well Richard thank you for having me this evening\nMy pleasure let me throw a couple of items that you very quickly and one is that we are we are hearing that\nUs national security adviser John Bolton is reportedly up pushing the president to withdraw from a treaty designed to prevent a nuclear arms race between us and Russia that would be called the ion ... for the intermediate range nuclear forces treaty which has been in place since Nineteen eighty seven your thoughts\nWell of course the Russians are suspected and I think I'm a lot of people would agree in violation of the Nineteen eighty seven ins treaty because they have\nA not only build practice the use of ballistic can cruise missiles that have a range of five hundred to ... fifty five hundred kilometers in violation of that a wave tractor cruise missile we called nine and seven to nine\nThat has um you know not met the um the criteria is violated the criteria of course John Bolton is on his way this coming week over to Moscow to talk about that but they're also Richard going to talk about\nThe possible renewal of the twenty ten new start and you know President Trump said um you know weeks ago that perhaps we aren't going to renew it and that should be a a a really a a shot across the bow of Moscow because it it should concern to solve it you know that has cut back dramatically\nA nuclear weapons and\nTo Fifteen hundred and fifty a deployed strategic warheads and about seven hundred vehicle so you know this is important in a world that I Believe has\nReally cross the line to a new Cold War because the old Cold War is all about nuclear Holocaust and the threat posed by the Soviets in the U.S\nWe're entering a new era right now\nI Want to also dial back to September when Russia began his largest ever military exercises with three hundred thousand just think of that three hundred thousand soldiers or this was a a a drill with China as a rehearsal for some sort of large scale conflict it was called the Vostok\nTwenty Eighteen drills just this kind of really illustrates how China and Russia are aligning themselves perhaps against the United states\nWell it does and in fact a really yesterday you had the two defense ministers from Russia and China met and they're getting ready to uh jointly head a commission on military technology that is of course being shared\nA significantly between the two we just sanction the Chinese for buying\nA fighter jets from the Russians and also the S. four hundred\nA surface to air missile system and the Vostok Eighteen exercises you indicate I had three hundred thousand\nA soldier's thirty six thousand\nA armored vehicles or at least a thousand bombers some of those strategic bombers um in fact flew off the east coast of Russia straight at\nThe United states now practicing what I Would consider bombing runs against show me a clear air force base and Fort Greely Fort Greely is where we have the mid range nuclear anti missile capability and we have and we're growing that mostly because of the\nNorth Korean threat but of course the Chinese have a rising capability and the Russians has never gone away\nI Want to ask you whether there was an opportunity last after the fall of the iron curtain the end of the Cold War\nWhen\nPresident Reagan had essentially vanquished\nOr when he called the the evil empire the Soviet Union a and then later assurances were given to the Soviets or the Russian Federation that NATO would not encroach one centimeter towards Moscow and of
