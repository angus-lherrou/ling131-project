between a rock and I are [laughter] I understand that that's why I\nAsked it a shot\nUp later on or if you are obviously you you achieve great heights both in academia and in media and you are amongst I think in the elite group of science\nReporters people who actually write nonfiction about science in into very accessible way are we put you in the same category as Mary Roach are you a fan of hers\n[noise] you know I I I I'll be honest with you I'm not familiar with Mary\nRoach oh you're missing missing terrific tell me and you know she's a she's a frequent guest year and they're very very entertaining and she writes I'm always about science and so she lives to explore particular subjects and so her book on for example what happens to the body after we die called stiff\nOr ... or packing for Mars and when she talked she tried to learn what it'd be like to go to Mars and all the things that would happen if she is very I Love it\nYou know she's grey and you'd really like her and it's just very kind of ... it was reminiscent to me a little bit on how you were getting into the subject because you handle it with a very\nUm [noise] a very non scholastic approach it's the science is there but um anybody can follow these stories in everybody probably should if you want to get a glimpse into what the future is all about this when I was to be a great gift for\nFor Christmas if you if you have a a young scientist and you're on your list them urban old scientist for that matter but looking ahead you know I ... if you pardon the pun I was just talking about Larry King and he was he was talking about he he believes he's a big believer\nIn cryogenic [noise] yeah yeah a lot you know there's also that famous baseball connection with you Ted Williams family in ... and\nBut I mean I what what is the science these days on something like that and how realistic is this would disappear or for somebody like Larry King to hope that he would be able to come back again and take his place behind home plate and\nIf you are [laughter] well first of all thank you for the kind words I I have spent my entire life communicating science I Try to make it as interesting as I can you know I at fourteen years at\nA ABC News as you indicated good morning America honey honey Nightline and you know you have to have to make things interesting or they'll give you the hook basically [laughter] uh I kind of cut my teeth on that\nAs far as cryogenic is concerned you know it's interesting you bring that up and I covered the cryogenic story over the years ah you know they're in the stories that Walt Disney had his head\nA frozen and ah with with the hope one day of of being brought back to life\nThe head being the most important part because it carries our memories are thought and so forth and so on\nBut you know I got to be honest with you that like old school um [noise] what I ... in a in a sense that now with what's going on with robotics and so forth ... thought it's more likely that um\nWhat Larry King is going to want to do is you know before you kick the can\nUh you know he's going to want to upload all his thoughts and memories or onto a super computer and then downloaded onto a very realistic robot so that Larry King [laughter] can ah can remain behind home plate you know indefinitely into the future but I'm Serious\nYou know in in my book um the end of life you know what I deal with these four big topic areas or the first is the worldwide Web the second is an artificial intelligence robots that third has to do with privacy and surveillance technology and the fourth has to deal with genetic engineering so\nBetween genetic engineering and artificial intelligence robot man I'm telling you Larry King is going to be around for a long long\nAgo and I was reading some of those sections and I thought that was interesting because there really as you said when he was very I think you mentioned like ... once the book and there's not a big emphasis on it\nBut there is still this hope that people have about preserving their essence and and then that becomes of course a full debate about what we're is the seat of the essence of us you know we used to think the soul was the heart and the head contained all of the you know the the computer works but\nBut ... ... ... how realistic is it ever in any near future that we would be able to upload thoughts in dreams like you might expect from Minority Report being able to capture them and then put them into something else\nI think it's very real or in I mean you know and and and you indicated about the my book being about the future but but the truth of it is it's really about what's going on right here and right now even as we speak and ... and labs all over the world\nUh I tell

for ABC News on various shows and former instructor of physics at Harvard as well as the author and the new book is uh is this is great it's a the end of life as we know it and just before we went into the break we were talking about\nThat that space in discussions of what we should add on to do which\nMight be better informed by discussions of morality as much as ethics and and you know I think even Michael when you were talking about\n[noise] about the idea of preserving a physical life uh on this planet is like ... whether that was through uploading a brain putting it into something you know into a robot or something you know even that it makes me\nSo um the question then becomes do we I mean you know it's exciting it's it's interesting it's it's like science fiction come true but then when you get past all that kind of the bells and whistles of at all you have to ask you know do we really want to do this and\nThere's an even deeper questions that I raised in the book and that is with all the genetic engineering we are doing and you know the extent these the extinction efforts are do come under the category of genetic engineering what we're doing in is something that's never been done before and\nThat is we are elevating recessive trade\nAnd we're the John Lennon traits in other words we're flying in the face of the very forces that have created these species the evolutionary forces sure we're defining\nThe natural flow were to find the natural order of things and you kind of believe that when you take on Mother Nature member the commercial oil you know don't mess with Mother Nature or something like that\nYeah it's not nice to you and I was not nice to mother nature\nThat one yeah it's not nice I forget what it was the Marshall was margarine night it was very mired in for a merger in right yeah I Do know margarine is not so great for us right [laughter] but\nYou gotta wonder that because we are doing this we now have the ability of elevating recessive traits than suppressing dominance trait\nWere flying in the face of Mother Nature we had to pay a price and he had to do that you're you're you're fighting against you know a billion a cart into science you know billions of years of evolution right are we to do that if we take it on or who who's going to be the casualty I'm thinking we are\nYeah you know this is the ultimate question and I I mean you know I was reading the DEA extinction thing and I'm not sure that if they brought back quote unquote a wooly mammoth what we really wouldn't have is just a wooly your element\nYou know and but much in the same way that we have a sweeter orange right where we have a a a a juicy or beach or something that people do by\nFlipping genetic codes around here there and I'm not saying that that smart either but but I think I'm more worried about some of this idea about the ... the ... some of the robotics that you talk about and and what that what that really means who's gonna decide\nWhen robots have really gone far enough and are we going to be in a situation as crazy as it sounds words like sky nut and it'll be too late the robots will you know there'll be self teaching and we're out\nWell you know again that's a very real possibility I um\nI tell this story about a this guy I think his name as a Anthony ... is a former Google engineer a big into driverless cars I'm so he he he helped launch way mo which is the driverless car\nA division of of Google right and then went to Hoover and then got involved in this ugly lawsuit about stealing industrial secrets and so for the song but he recently applied to the IRS and was granted I'm a tax exempt status for what he's calling the church of artificial intelligence\nAnd you know on the surface that sounds a little bit crazy but when you look into what the thinking his thinking behind doing this he's he's basically saying this look if we continue in the trajectory we're now on\nIt ... it is inevitable that one day\nA artificial intelligence robots\nPowered by artificial intelligence will will become so much more intelligent than we that they really reached the level of a deity they they they are in effect God because\nThey know everything they see everything they they control everything if we give them that kind of freedom and so we may as well to start getting ready to worship it because it's\nWant to stay on its good side because God I did that this technology we're creating will run amok and you know you start thinking well okay it's a little crazy this guy but\nYou know it's not that far fetched because the rate at which artificial intelligence is\nIs developing you know I talk about how it beat the pants off of the chess champion and then the checkers champion and now it can beat the champs it to you know Texas hold them poker and the uh the gang go which is generally conceded to be the most complicated game most ancient game around go you\nKnow ...\nYou write an artificial and tell us now and beat the pants off her her you know the the goat champion and so it's printed that writing is on the wall in I mean it it's pretty clear that these computers and not just going to become ... they're no longer just fancy adding machine there no there are no longer just doing computations\nAh but they're they're becoming more adept at doing things that we both are we want spoke about being very good at that well you know like you they're ... buttoned up I think they're generally like he was still pretty small\nBut you know one day they're general like he was forced seem to be even greater than ours at the day of the singularity that's for the day and all and ... when they will have the equipment IQ of you know ten thousand two hundred and twenty five so yeah and that\nI think the interesting these are the two is it that the equation is with you you said a hundred and twenty five and we're using that as like a horizon line for human intelligence right we go with an IQ one twenty five\nBut at the smarter machines get and the more the takeover of our day to day activities\nAnd or the more they do things for us and we allow them to be in the driver's seat of our lives who's to say that that that average IQ isn't going to drop ten points\nSo we we'd like to think that we might stay but the more we get cushy our brains get ... and who knows it might be a lot we might be bringing on our own physical demise faster than right than we would have possibly the magic so\nLike that the cushy Murphy app yeah you're right because you know the old saying if you don't use it lose that you lose a yeah no but I talk about I think I caught one guy that said you know it may very well be that we are in the process\nOf creating our own conquers yes raising with at the right now

I Know several people who have a ...\nWho had a trouble walking or the lost their ability to walk in the spinal injuries and and that this to them as a dream I mean the I ... you just being able to walk across the room because of a of an ... skeleton that carries their body or ... their muscles are stimulates their muscles are all three\nUh I I Can't think of a downside to that other than the military application I guess a ... where are you with that one\n[noise] no I I agree with you I'm a and I I think that er yeah the the discussion that I have in the book about trans humanism and you know that's it there's actually a movement a call the trans human movement ...\nAs you say ... or the ideas to enhance ourselves one way or another using technology and I break it down into three categories as the usable or trends human augmentation there's so there's usable wearable and then there's implantable\nAnd I I agree with you I I ... this is an area where I see very little downside\nI mean I tell the story of this guy from Dayton, Tennessee who he was a power lines when he touched a a high voltage line that was lying on the ground and he lost both arms to the vet them right off now here's a guy who would have you know live the rest of his life you know of severely crippled\nAnd now scientists are creating for him what are called neuro prostheses prostheses\nBut see these are artificial arms but not like your grandfather's artificial arms you know that we are mechanical\nThat requires you to wear harness and you have to ... you know these\nAre these are arms that he can move with his thoughts so they're they're wired to his mind\nAnd I to me than fantastic oh yeah and\nAnother story that I tell about the woman who is a quadriplegic and now you know she she's able to have some level of independence and uh because of of some of the trans human augmentation um so I Know I I agree with you and even even in um [noise]\nEven in the military setting I mean if we if we can outfit our soldiers so that you know they're wearing an exoskeleton or talk about how on day has come up with some stuff there you know where you know write it just it just it you know so so or soldier who's out there and he's carrying you know what I fifty sixty pound backpack\nYou know if if if they if we can give them an extra fella Scott what's on the take some of that load off of their own skeletons I I think that's a I\nI I think it would be a stretch to find fault in something like that\nOr maybe but maybe I've seen robocop more times than you have I mean I think that\nMean and I do I'm not I'm not being facetious I think that's the only one I'm here's why it there's always this belief somehow that if we can if we could come up with the technology\nUm that saves our soldiers from from harm inevitably that that gets weaponized into and yeah we can invade without losing and he's soldiers and therefore there's no political consequence\nYeah from the ... and ... and ... you know back to 'em that idea about I'm\nAbout maybe some of our advancements should not be consequences free is that I think that that's you know I get worried a little bit and maybe that's the science fiction part of me then I see that\nPoliticians would rebel at the thought of not having to be accountable for anybody's death by having super soldiers that can go in and take whatever we want 'em until the embittered enemy that we've created does this one better [laughter] than inevitably the new arms race\nNo no you're absolutely right in and I again I talk about that but you know it's interesting as you look ahead to what this technology is pointing to\n[noise] and uh you know we're talking about an ... sold a human soldiers abilities but I think are equally realistic will be a you know a robot warriors and effect Terminator like warriors that will be our surrogates going into war and so we ...\nCould possibly go run there [laughter] yeah [laughter] and you know I called that sounds like a plan [laughter] yeah\nI Know and and now and and the ... group you know I caught them in the book in Russia is very upfront about them doing that they're I mean they're in the process of doing that and they're talking about unveiling\nSome other stuff soon or using neural net says it's just a fancy way of saying these are robot warriors that have human like brain\nThe question then becomes do you give such warriors the right to make the decision to shoot or not should in other words you give them complete autonomy and and that is called the Terminator conundrum right now yeah nations are thinking about well gee if we give our robot warriors complete autonomy then\nThat basically going to make Russians do the same thing and now we're going to be as you said a moment to go in\nWe're going to be now and another escalating arms race so right\nYeah ... it in some ways you know that I often I often think to myself you know\nAll this technology is brand new it's unprecedented\nBut we can't are just still the same you know so our faults in our foibles and our weaknesses and are downsides just get magnified by this technology the technology doesn't eliminate our weaknesses in our foibles and are downsides you you know what I'm saying to you\nYeah I Do and ... and ... and yet I Would propose to you may be the biggest problem we would face in the law of unintended consequences would dictate the Sarah Connor conundrum\nThat's uh Terminator conundrum but to Sarah Connor ... which means if you can't win a conventional war\nBecause you're over welcomed by the technology of the your opponent you go unconventional\nAnd Hugo gorilla end this creates more terrorism and you know you know I mean that's that's how eventually she was able to beat the I don't want to spoil the ending randomly and there was a terminal but you know I mean that's how that's how you know she will one is eventually learning to to\nYou know to go to grill her way out of it not to face the enemy but to be the enemy by you know going\nOr at his weaknesses\nBut but positive person because whenever you mentioned Russian scientist I'm reminded of the story about the the scientist that want to put a a a new had an old hat on a new body\nRight yeah yeah okay well we had transplants yeah yeah\nOkay so let's let's pick that up [laughter] that's one of those that's one of those Halloween he kind of moments right there were like All right now that\nThis is this is one of those nightmare dream things depending on where you are with it I can understand that somebody had um a body that was decaying but their brain was Brian and you wanted to put it on a new body but then\nWhere does that end in how far along are they in that pursuit [noise]\n[noise] yeah well you know what I've been reporting on that story for some years now and um it began with a small number of scientists um who experimented on monkeys and it gets a little grizzly but this being Halloween okay\nAh where they yeah they severed monkeys head and then they re attached it\nOr just to prove that they could so there's a lot of plumbing involved right I mean you have to sew up the the the the veins in the arteries and nerves and so forth and so on and they've they've scientists have achieved to a level of success with monkeys and so now embolden\nOr by that they are turning their attention to doing it to human and there's at least one guy in Russia who has been quoted a frequently\nOr who is a quadriplegic or you know otherwise mentally very alert and he says yeah come and do it to me

I had to cut you off but we're going to the bottom of the hour and it's a heartbreak so I couldn't pass on that\n[noise] oh yeah no I was just telling you the story of a\nA murder that happened to Connecticut and or the husband claimed one story and the police looked into it his wife was murdered and he claimed one story in\nWhat the police found was that the woman was wearing a that these women wearing a fit with one of these little smart watches that you know keeps track of your heart rate how are you walk and so forth and so they downloaded the data from the fit fit\nAnd they found out that the they could actually get this\nCalculate how many feet she walk and it didn't square with the story from the husband\nAnd I remember that yeah yeah they\nThey won't have soles God didn't make him they won't have soles there'll be like zombies there'll be like and I'm like no they weren't so I mean I think some of it as an education peas in and I think that's were great science writing and science journalism in a book like this\nIs really helpful because it really makes clear to people who how complicated these issues are but what's the great benefit or not for us in the long run that's the part I'm I'm focused on myself anyway [laughter] and I think\nIf you you're you're absolutely right and that is why I wrote the book people can have their own opinions but you have\nTo be well informed in order to have a sense right and you write up after you read this book you'll have you'll be well informed and then God Bless you with your opinion\nRight and and God Bless you in five years this book may be totally irrelevant right because by that time so the beds and you're gonna have to write a sequel the end of the world is end of life as we know what let me go to Jason in Portland for Michael Guillen on coast to coast Jason\nYeah they um playing God is kind of baked into our DNA when they say that we are created in the image of God that kind of you know is put into our sense\nThen ... now\nInto my question before I get I if I read the uh your schedule right are you going to be talking on the subject of immortality on Tuesday night\nOh coast may be\nYeah I Will yeah great little little give her a little plug for an up [laughter] thank you where you are\nTalking about immortality and I don't know exactly where it is but in the book of revelation I talk about your mortality and when the wrath of God is or out of a finance fine it says that they will pray that they would die\nAnd they're not able to and they asked for the ... mountains in stone to come down and in and cover them up\nAnd are they talking about this this period that you're talking what are we even chief get more\nOut of this is this is an interesting premise again is whether it's immortality would be a blessing or a curse a ... you know that uh that is the the portrait of Dorian Gray a ... what's your thought on that Michael\n[noise] well it's a it's a I have a couple of thoughts about that and that is number one uh you know obviously as a theoretical physicist and and as a serious minded Christian I'm fascinated by finding a references in the Bible that might give us some glimpse or some hint\nAs to what what's in store for us and how it jibes or doesn't jibe with what's going on in science I just find that just it's fascinating intellectually fascinating er and and so I I I'd love to think for about this reference to revelation [noise]\nI I think also my other thought is you know do does\nDoes a supercomputer and this is this is a kind of um of a mental a question or a medical experiment that people talk about a lot of it will we reach a point where we create an artificial intelligence being whether it's\nIn the form of a big computer server or it's in the in the body of a hunky Alyssa a kind of a role of human like robot but get so complex and so beyond\n\nThe you know has an existence that is beyond the human experience that you cannot unplug it you you know it's like the sky net running it's like running on on energy that it absorbs from the environment I mean that's\nThe word from saying also the crush souls of the people in stumps on ... you know getting I think you can it's of coffee yeah I get that I think\nThat happens with some of our technology now right have you haven't you ever been in a situation where you know you're you're like trying everything stop you know that that piece of machinery is going great stop stop stop and oh I don't like it and it still goes on you know [laughter]\n... tell me but I spent the last two weeks trying to get a Ken more elite dishwasher six so I knew that I was actually where I'm living and by the way to somebody\nBut the I mean I have a masters of divinity degree I Would just say\nIt's really interesting about the Bible in this the the only problem is the Bible is multi vocal on the subject\nOf immortality life after death et cetera so it's really great because it creates more conversations but it doesn't always resolve them so keep that in mind let me go to a let me go to a ... who is in Arizona and coast to coast am David\nYeah hey my question for a minute or so ago and the ethical and moral conflict created by June ... artificial intelligence\nAnd we want to be resolved\nYou keep breaking up dude you're killing me because it sounds like a really good question [laughter]\nYeah they do we just losing\nIt would just let them know alright Well James is in the in the Washington Let's try him well we still have a minute for Michael Steele and before we go to open lines coming up on coast to coast James\nI enjoy your show but um\nI've been I kicking machine going on forty five years yes or a bank and argue generation and like you know from your guest or where do you feel that the shoe\nWill be overcome Chris or or a a a ... I Would if I take my answer off the air and\nHang in there James hang in there James we need every one of you go ahead Michael\nYeah what what what kind of I didn't get what kind of machine as he's on dialysis is on kidding options and he has macular degeneration\nJust like my friend yeah no I think this is where the technology really is very helpful um they they are making enormous strides now or with restoring people fight with macular degeneration I've actually interviewed a woman\nWho had the operation and you know even though her fight is still not crystal clear she can she can make out fate and it's given her an enormous amount of independence but\nWe're making enormous strides they're already working there's this one company in particular in California I talk about\nThat or is already working on a second generation ah that will help actually restore\nSight and people who are born blind not never mind with macular degeneration so I see a lot of hope on that also and the kidney ... I don't think we need to create a merit a there's a lot of great research and I've reported\nOn for ABC News and elsewhere where they are now able to create using stem cell or ... it might\nCreate a artificial Oregon so\nThat are more tailored for the the person yeah yeah I'm In\nTheir brother is you know that that is really where the technology is very helpful\nAnd that's where we left ended with Michael deal in the book picks up the rest of the thank you so much for your time and for your joyful spirit and looking forward to carrying on a with open lines next on coast to coast am this dizzy and punish\nThem and that makes us caught in the middle\nWe talk about\nNews radio seven forty Katie R.

because we are not God that's all I have to say\nOh it's fair enough I mean I it thanks for calling you know I think the the issue of that sold peace though is a little more complicated\nSo a lot of people would say then it if it's a version if it's forty percent of who you were like we did have a soul if other people out there have you know\nUh other men if there are other people who have uh the problems with their mental capacity due to injury or disease you know we don't say it was suddenly they're less human or that they have less of a soul\nI'm so I'm not I'm with ya in theory well I'm with you in theology young soul um but I think it is much trickier question than just saying they wouldn't for sure because I used to be the thing that people said about\nTests to babies and I think we're we fortunately moved beyond that uh okay let's get to where we get a lot of people standing by which is always fun Aaron is in Richmond, Virginia on coast to coast Aaron\nHi um I'm In a world power guys first of all for not listening for five years I don't want to get too much into it but\nUm I feel I can I I have a couple of things to say on this whole and mark how he ... her saying I'm a reviving manner awarded a habit of things he couldn't that that word it survive\nI mean wouldn't even know what to do and that sort of firemen now and furthermore\nIn our current situation right now we have there are a lot of people storing up first survival situations and there are a religious groups such as the Mormons who are you know highly compiling surprise for\nThree years to come for for them is families with multiple wives with multiple shelter with multiple\nAnd um and we don't really we haven't really touch it whether or not these are ... of all wrong and we don't know even with\nTraining we don't know if\nThe supplies what's done some of them in a cave or in a whole or in a ditch or whatever I mean so I Would hurt at all you like to um volunteer myself not to\nA consuming somebody's supplies but just to ... myself and my child even I hesitate to say my child but I Would like to offer\nA myself to give a trial like for a year on one of the supplies without training without any\nKnowledge of how to use the supplies to just see somebody could even\nSaying then sell it to you don't really know even with the like Mormon families if there was a huge disaster you don't know who's going to survive it could be a child it could be a twelve year old kid\nWho hasn't had any training on how the year the supplies that are stored up in ... or or wherever I'm\nOkay well I think that's a really interesting proposal and I I I I just want to because there's a lot of listeners who are a latter day saints and so I just really be a clear\nFor people most LDS do not practice plural marriage ran the overwhelming number of them do but to her point I was watching on Netflix\nA there's a series called uh like the men with three wives or three wives club or something I don't know\nBut it's about a renegade a Mormon sect community and everybody generally in the community has more than one wife\nAnd then the following some of these and that's in Utah near Moab and um and that they they've already talked about saving up than having enough food for these big giant families to last for seven years that's a lot\nI mean and wouldn't even work Kennedy even work I don't know\nA ... but ah yeah so Aaron's willing to be volunteer but um I think the only thing I ever get to bring your kid\nA done is in a in Kent, Ohio I Know well on coast to coast am done\nRather a I'm happy to have a you\nKnow I got a kick out of your commercial market goes to the pawn shop in the court that was his name was Andy Gomez remember ... for the monsters\nYeah sure love do most of

looking [noise] what else is going to happen that we're missing we're missing all this on purpose or missing something what is your opinion on that\nWell it's an interesting claim that the the the marches on purpose or coordinated toward us I mean I\nI think that you'll always see migrations in the long history just to bring up the Bible again\nThis is that we're all immigrants read the Bible says that we we all move 'em and that would you know all of the stories you a lot of the stories revolve around people just trying to get food just trying to move to get food and begging people to allow them to live in in space has food\nSo I kind of see that as a perpetual thing not something new but you know ...\nIs there is there if it that's the smoke screen than what's behind it I guess we're supposed to wonder about or are you suggesting that something is going to come from the north um while we're so busy looking south and east is that was that part of your implication\nThat kind of my question I mean all this was happening at one show or something else going to happen that we're missing and all media concentrated in one direction and I just uh I\nWell I think that's something

times this first time I've gotten through this is such a great privilege\nIt if I can and I would like to share something a ... about the Bible a and there's a great truth that we need to realize in any discipline a\nIf any discipline that your study whether it be science or whether it be ah the Bible for instance uh you can't just take a sip if you go to the wealth of knowledge you need to take a big drink\nAnd the and the Bible is something to be studied and pondered over all three\nThe model the aesthetic religions from the middle east began their roots what the Bible and polluting the Korean the Korean has deep roots in the Old Testament and\n... and the nutrients in the new ... the the current New Testament yeah I mean\nThe the story the story of the prophet Jesus and the Koran is is significant it's a it's a big portion of the current\nThat try and even the story of the floods the story of Jesus in the car and all of that validates not counting the historical\nValues a historical cruise you know that that line up with a so many of the stores in the Bible a mini the many of the critics don't believe that it's even possible for Daniel to be real because\nOf the historical value of the book of Daniel is so accurate\nAnd ah and if it hadn't been found and the dead sea scrolls you know they ... they were you know people would have said well it was impossible for\nDaniel to know as much of the future is he is he did but\nThat that Cruz when you look at the courage there and you look at a big picture the heart the grace of the the Old Testament and the New Testament this\nHas done so much for humanity\nYou know oh I agree I agree we yeah we we stray\nAway from that and people and and people like to take two or three versus\nAn edge a whole right that's terrible whole book or you know and they'll a skilled in\n... it's called proved texting and it's a yeah it's there's a there's an old saying I've said it before I go to ... to the first in St learned in seminary was that some people\nUm some people rely on a an scripture I'm like a drunk leans on a lamppost not so much for illumination but for support and I think it's the illumination\nPart that I always go for another support I like I like it when I find new things that make me think differently and I'll tell you some interesting about the current I don't know if you know it just it sounds like you're a learned guy but\nI did a I'm a I was writing I wrote an article about um about the true crime texts I'm interested in how true crime stories are told [noise]\nAnd I was interested in how many troops um how many murder stories there are in the Bible\nAnd that the basis for true crime as we know it today the ... the popular genre on any platform\nThat the basis for that starts in the Bible and that these true crime stories really are these murders stories or or had the same effect they're teaching us a lesson which is what the murder stories still do what\nI found was when I looked at um the ways stories were told in the Koran they actually use the word murder with regard to Jesus\nThey where is the Bible says you know in in the Greek portion of the the ... of the Bible in the New Testament the Greek word says kill but actually the word that's often used uh the Arabic word is the Jesus who was murdered\nAnd I find that very a very interesting distinction that that Muslims see that and that's the way they look at it that he was murdered and I don't think murder comes up a lot when we think about it\nIn a Judeo Christian context but I'm just throwing that out yet I don't know if they find that interesting or not but I did\nThat that corporate I Want to be careful how I say this do you think that corporate Christianity\nHas a you know or Christianity for higher so to speak where people are wanting to build\nA legacies ... do you think that that has hurt us and gotten a so why do you uh from the central message of the Bible in a whole ah\nYeah I think I think your question answers that you know and I think that what we you know I think anytime there's always been been the big difference of shooting a bullet in the name of God or taking a bullet in the name of God and I'm I'm In the taking the bullet camp [laughter]\nI'll take the bullet and protecting somebody else I'm a ... you know people go way far out of their way to create these\nStructures were there shooting people killing other people in the name of God and I uh that's where I draw the line then join the conversation the rink and you've got a great town oh let's get back to work too but um

where you find that I I yeah there's a whole lot of wisdom in the Bible when if you read it it\nWas five ... uh I I don't be much value but if you look at it is how people were thinking two thousand four thousand years ago um it's fascinating I mean you read genesis and if you\nActually go back and look for you know the garden of Eden you're going to be disappointed but if you look at it is you know what separates humans from the animal knowledge of good and evil consciousness felt for blacks and\nYeah and how how people we're dealing with that that fundamental truth back then and um you

I'm more in line with like Quakers and I've had with the idea of um\nThe beginning of an age and when they get the current age began if their disagreement about\nThat and oh yeah ours is that because\nThey're throwing I'll go ahead I'm Sorry\nNo no no you're you're bringing I'm just commenting on your question is you go along ... yes I think there's a lot of debate about what age we're in or\nIn this is this comes at the same argument gets made about modernism and post modernism Marxism and Neal Marxism and you know all we could ever do is the arise 'cause we can't there's no there's no met a\nData somewhere that we can tap into that explains oh no no you tripped into the age of Aquarius in the year ... [noise] so yeah I think all we can do is we ... we I think we use that to try to make sense ... of of periods of history\nAnd it it just it makes it it gives us a frame for what something that otherwise would be completely ... he's a way for us to try to understand\nThe time period in which we live I I spend a lot I mean I can remember this conversation about the aquarium Bible cause I've looked it up several times and\nAnd it's very interesting I mean I don't I don't have any argument for or against it just sort of like it it sort of exists out there especially the part about that period of time they'll missing so called years I'm big 'cause there's a lot of different books that address I don't want that they all tell the same story though do you\nI don't know I'm not familiar with all the ... the only one I'm familiar with it covered right ... years I'm ...

as we know it ominous news from the frontiers of science is his new book but you might know him better from\nAn ABC News or from the History Channel where he hosts the show or from his other books including a novel they'll know prophecy a he's in LA guy or you are you a dodger's fan Michael\nWell uh you know what I grew up rooting for the Dodgers are but I spend a lotta years in Boston\nHarbor day of my son was born in ... and I don't know I'm kind of caught between a rock and I are [laughter] I understand that and that's why I asked ... uh uh\nUh later on or if you are obviously you you achieve great heights both in academia and in media and you are amongst I think in the lead group\nOf science\nReporters people who actually write nonfiction about science and into very accessible way or we put you in the same category as Mary Roach are you a fan of hers\n[noise] you know I I I I'll be honest with you I'm not familiar with Mary\nRoach oh you're missing missing terrific tell me and\nShe's a she's a frequent guest year and they're very very entertaining and she writes I'm always about science and so she lives to explore particular subjects and so her book on for example what happens to the body after we die called stiff\nOr ... or packing for Mars and was she talked she tried to learn what it'd be like to go to Mars and all the things that would happen is she is very I Love it you know she's grey and you'd really like her and it's just very kind of ... it was reminiscent to me a little bit on how you were getting into the subject because you handle it with a very\nUm [noise] a very non scholastic approach it's the science is there but anybody can follow these stories in everybody probably should if you want to get a glimpse into what the future is all about this what else to be a great gift for\nFor Christmas if you if you have a a young scientist and you're on your list some urban old scientist for that matter but looking ahead you know I ... if you'll pardon the pun I was just talking about Larry King and he was he was talking about he he believes he's a big believer\nIn cryogenic yeah a lot you know there's also that famous baseball connection with you Ted Williams family and ... and\nBut I mean I what what is the science these days on something like that and how realistic is this would disappear for somebody like Larry King do hope that he would be able to come back again and take his place behind home plate and if you are\n[laughter] well first of all thank you for the kind words I I have spent my entire life communicating science they try to make it as interesting as I can you know I at fourteen years at\nA ABC News as you indicated good morning America twenty twenty Nightline and you know you have to have to make things interesting or they'll give you the hook basically [laughter] uh I kind of cut my teeth on that\nAs far as cryogenic says concerned you know it's interesting you bring that up and I covered the cryogenic story over the years ah you know they're in the stories that Walt Disney had his head\nOf frozen and ah with with the hope one day of of being brought back to life\nThe head being the most important part because it carries our memories or thoughts and so forth and so on\nBut you know I got to be honest with you that's like old school um what I ... in a in a sense that now with what's going on with robotics and so forth and saw it more likely that um\nWhat Larry King is going to want to do is you know before he kicked the can\nUh you know he's going to want to upload all his thoughts and memories or onto a super computer and then downloaded onto a very realistic robot so that Larry King can ah can remain behind home plate you know indefinitely into the future but I'm Serious\nYou know in in my book um the end of life you know what I deal with the four big topic areas or the first is the worldwide Web the second is artificial intelligence robots that third has to do with privacy and surveillance technology and the Ford has to deal with genetic engineering so\nGenetic engineering and artificial intelligence robot man I'm telling you Larry King is going to be around for a long long\nAnd I was reading some of those sections and I thought that was interesting because there really as you said when he was very I think you mentioned like ... once the book and there's not a big emphasis on it but there is still this hope that people have about\nPreserving their accents and and then that becomes a course a full debate about what where is the seat of the essence of a you know we used to think the soul was the heart and the head contained all of the you know the the computer works but\nBut ... ... ... how realistic is it ever in any near future that we would be able to upload thoughts in dreams like you might expect from Minority Report being able to capture them and then put them into something else\n[laughter] I think it's very real or in I mean you know and and and you indicated about the my book being about the future but but the truth of it is it it's really about what's going on right here and right now even as we speak and ... and labs all over the world\nUh I tell for example the story of Iran ... are being very very involved well you know he's involved in driverless cars devolved in outer space and going to Mars and so forth and
