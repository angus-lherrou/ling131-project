New York stock exchange which is a chart that is used by a lot of astrologers goes back to ... Seventeen of Seventeen Ninety two and so not yet but in all five years\nThat as a sort of happy go lucky enthusiastic energy it's certainly good for anyone whose uh son signed ... in general the next year or so or by the way when you estimate the retrograde\nVenus goes retrograde this Friday I just mentioned that you know which could be the day of the vote up or down and Venus is in Scorpio and it's a ... I Want to tell people it's affecting anyone who's born around November second or third of any year so those people are going to get an extra dose of Venus over the next several weeks which is\nFocus on love relationship creative artistry social activities money money management and things like that\nMark why does it feel like this year has gone by so darn sure that\nIt does feel that way um well you know part of it might be well one of the things\nThat is happening this is definitely you know how the media is always there there there may is because of what's happening with with the president with the tweeting and all the information and so from the political realm it with people like yourself or myself people who are you know tuning into news reports a need to do it for our work\nOne of the things that's so weird there's so many events are happening much more so that they're being reported like liquor these split hour after hour\nAnd I think that you know people are tired of it and they're exhausted and then we've had like this whole thing about social networking where you know millions of people like their their passwords here and there\nAnd so it's kind of like a revolution every single day somewhere and I think that that's making the time go a little faster or maybe we want to make make it go faster to get away from some of the ... the weird problem\nCan you chart out asking logically I Know you were with me are back in July and you are always popping in on New Year's day with us right can you chat to chart the rest of the year for someone in the beginning of the year\n[noise] yeah well it's an interesting thing New Years in particular is very powerful I mean you could even do today it's October one and you could\nGeneral I mean these things are not usually done you can take a look at the whole month of November by looking at midnight in in the nation's capital here or wherever the capital is although particular country and do a truck for that moment now the big one is New Year's at midnight all around the world because\nAll be on the air with everybody\nWell yeah and what's interesting is at midnight everywhere around the world lever is always a rising\nAnd the son is in Capricorn at the bottom of the chart because it's midnight and so\nThere you have to feed and all the other plants like for instance midnight New Year's coming up on two thousand Nineteen the sun and Saturn are coming into a conjunction and Mars is going to enter its home sign of areas which doesn't actually look all that wonderful for the planet\nBecause Mars the traditional planet of war will go into its own sign actually late on December thirty one and then the sun and Saturn are together now there can be positive things like maybe for sports with with Mars\nAnd um exercise and engineering and different kinds of projects that are more martial but sunlit Saturn at the beginning of the year is often you know too many frustrations lotta blocks coming in but I guess it's going to be a testing year two thousand nine team for the world\nWhy does it work mark why does astrology war\nOkay because here's what's happening it isn't that the planets were throwing down raise this is what the old idea\nExactly what and why scientists would say you believe in that foolishness of pseudo science mumbo jumbo\nIt inside of us okay so in other words\nIf everything depends on something being born in a moment of time like with the person baby it's when you take your first breath it's not coming out of the womb\nIf the look of course still tight it's when that's why you know we've got to make the baby cry to make sure we know that it's breathing taking in the first spread like the declaration of independence is usually used to leave America's Choice because it was our first\nBreath we're we're saying guess wedding when we're independent of you were being born okay this is our beginning now not every astrologer works with that choice but most of them do\nSo the reason it works is that wherever the sun is the moon the various planet it's not that they're making things happen from outer space it's that whatever is born a person\nPresident take an oath of office you buy a new car you get a new job you do if you have the time uh that that happens you put everything into the horoscope and then you can attempt to interpret what is that saying about the potential\nOf my work at this job being president of the United states or baby being born\nOr with mark Lerner the astrologers website the new one great bear enterprises dot com we've got linked up for U.S Coast to coast am dot com when we come back in the moment we will take your phone calls and he'll do some personal astrological readings for you what do you need from people mark when they call you\nWill fundamentally month day in your birth if they know the time we can try and put that in and or wherever they were born\nDoes the time make it more accurate you are you\nWell look I could if somebody said to me I Know one on board ... you know what I don't have the time I Know the town or city actually month staying here I could do anything for that person not as exactly ... do it\nBecause timing allows us all kinds of things sunrise birds is is it your noon is at sunset is it\nA midnight we're ordered the planets falling at that point within twenty four hours most of the planet are going to be in the ... they're going to be in the same lines but the moon can change a lot and twenty four hours it can go\nHalf of the time and so the moon has a lot to do with our instinct or mood even reincarnation and looking back at who we may have been the qualities were bringing in this lifetime moon has what to do with personality the sun is more of the character and kind of the life force\nAnd a connection and a little bit more just spirituality but so polarizing find which is fine rising the east\nThat is the window to the world kind of on the highest level of or spirituality\nIn and tell me this march since you've been doing this we have thirty seconds before the break your what has been the most satisfying thing you've done\nEver

G of a a spent ski ... the Alice Bailey teachings and so on\n'em and I found my mentor day merge or who was one of the great astrologers of twentieth century and he studied not just astrology but philosophy psychology and metaphysics the thought but I read all of his books and cut it memorized everything and the reason which if their students out there\nUh the planet mercury withdrew mind thinking communication at the time of his birth Pisces was exactly the same spot where mine was and I knew what a chart was when I started reading this book that you asked me about psychic was as if I could hear his voice\nIn my head because we were born at the time with with the planet mercury which is very powerful and often underrated within the same spot but any rate I took it for a whole year and then I started doing some consultation work in New York City and but the point is people need quite a number of years to get really good and they've really got to study much\nThan just an astrology charts they because they have to learn what's called transits of progression with a plan to keep moving on different levels and be able to do that for their clients\nSince ... since you've been doing this ... and ... what was it that got you interested in it and invent something happened\nUm I started going medical or to Columbia University my dad had been doctor he got sick at one point I didn't know what it was going to do I could have\nStudied medicine in college at Michigan State I didn't do it I was into a all kinds of things like social science and he got ill and I thought well maybe I'll take chemistry physics I'll take all the prerequisites I went to Columbia University [noise]\nUh this is part of a psychic weird thing that you asked me about so it's the first date first day of chemistry class I'm living in the borough of queens where Donald Trump was born I go home and just before getting home ice stopping a bookstore and I find my first astrology book which I've mentioned TV for astrology the space age science\nAnd it's all about people like Isaac Newton Galileo chronic has all these great physicist and all these people have studied\nA more of astronomy telescope scale layer and so on they were all ... but when the biographers would write about is fantastic people they'd say oh by the way they had one fault they were all went to the\nPhony thing of astrology because they're biographers just thought it was foolish and wasteful and they couldn't understand you know why why was the greatest scientist before noon sir Isaac Newton studying astrology\nNow how could that possibly be what what's wrong with a guy\nBut what they didn't realize is who was the science was taught in the universities have Europe a thousand years ago and it goes way back to all these great ... nations perjure Egypt Rome great you know all over the world the ancient world and it was even taught in the universe is if you're up\nI'm going to make your work this hour mark so let's go to the calls we will pick it up by going to Bob in New Jersey hears Bob's birth the December\nTwenty nine Nineteen fifty seven twelve twenty nine Nineteen fifty seven okay born at one forty two in the afternoon now in Jersey\nCity now do you when you you want to know the city they were born in or do you want to know exactly the place they were born\nWell that helps I mean just what you just said you know what I'm doing is just for people out there and not putting in my head I'm actually type it into a computer [noise] and believe it or not I'm able to sort of get that information pretty quick in\nAnd you want them to ask you a question\nUm if they want I mean uh if they can say to you and say I'm interested in this area of my life and then I'll just see what I can\nTell them we're going to Bob in New Jersey Hi, Bob\nJudge is good welcome to the program turn your radio down a little bit okay thank you okay\nGreat you're you're on with mark learner and given mark your birth date you know your time go ahead mark\nOkay well if he's if he's not asking a particular question what I can say\nUh of course this individual is born with a Capricorn son and an areas moon and tourist rising and he's born very close to her first quarter of ... um ... as I said earlier on the other side of the hour\nPeople don't often study their moon enough because the moon has a lot to do with who we are instinctively so with an aries moon coming from other lives and like instinctual early this individual has a lot of assertiveness and forceful and this and kind of an aggressive\nPersonality and that's important for him to sort of live his life on a on a deep level where\nHe he has leadership qualities developed in other allies particularly in the last life and now with the sun a Capricorn is kind of to refine that not to be brash but the sort of\nDo things more um grounded more practically in order to sort of rise of the heights and the planet Saturn which rules Capricorn is in the process of Criss crossing over this individual son so it's an extra kind of\nA this year and the and coming into the fall of discipline responsibility being focused and\nHe should be make sure he strengthens his immune system and stays healthy that um he doesn't become pessimistic about things\nUm but he's also heading for um if he wants to develop this an another career cycle of the next several years as long as he stays healthy and focused and a has a good attitude about things\nBob do you have a question to uh yeah what what if I'm not I don't know [laughter] well if you're not held on now again\nYou want to kind of like um well my feeling is that people should\nStudy things like use your intuition if need be go to a used bookstore you're you're on the show tonight there's a reason why you got on another people didn't good on um go to our website see some of the you know read about my life the books the philosophies and so on and get into something like that philosophy metaphysics\nAstrology that the power of numbers numerology is connected to astrology as well and find something that you can kind of a steep yourself in for a while and that can make you accept inwardly excited and then maybe your health we'll get better\nThanks Bob good luck to you and everything you do would you believe in reincarnation mark\nAbsolutely and I study that longer than this and that's part of the whole psychic thing\nWill psychic world intuitive and we all live many lives now people are different levels so to speak I guess so how would work out of why we would see like an Einstein or gundy are different people or mother Theresa [noise]\nYou know how many times people have been around and when you study spiritual things and there's a whole field of esoteric astrology there's a whole other kind of idea like in the Casey Casey predictions I Know you've got a lot of people on we'll talk about the ... and Edgar Casey\nThere's a whole sort of spiritual science about humanity being part of the solar system like we're not just on earth I mean we live in the solar system we live in the galaxy we just don't live there physically but spiritually when we're asleep\nPsychic lead people who ... who can meditate and sort of leave their bodies you know Asheville traveling that kinda thing looser dreaming where are we were somewhere else\nSo that's all part of things and definitely that there are multiple lifetimes than I Do believe very strongly that we're all spirits and souls and\nOr incarnations like in the chart we're looking at that like I said the spiritual kind of genetic code of what our game plan of higher destiny is as a spirit or sold to accomplish something with the sun ... and the planets in the configuration that we have\n... under ... reincarnation I asked her logically speaking yeah we're the born the let's let's say the reincarnated person and the person before that will who they born during the same time period\nOh no no no ... there's a whole question about that kind of thing\nYou know people might in the old days I mean a lot of people thought people would reincarnate slowly like maybe once every century or once every couple of centuries or whatever it is according to the spiritual material I ever had my life [noise]\nCertain souls or spirits who are doing work like the work that you do okay light work are kind of work at this stage and twenty first century\nMight come back more quickly now everything depends on getting a body from fellow man and a woman being able to come into the world Eleanor suspicious time to take advantage of astrological vibration they're to me absolutely in other words the soul and spirit comes in and chooses\nParents and family based on family karma Dharma that kind of a thing and then you're actually choosing went to be born because there are spiritual forces angels teachers masters whoever you want to call it\nI Know you have a lot of people talk about that stuff hoard guiding and bringing in that entity and then you have your own guardian angel with you throughout your whole life I'm a firm believer and all of those things\nAre excellent let's go out to

I've been saying a lot to to everybody do a lot of deep study you are definitely in that camp because then you're going to have once in a lifetime Pluto\nA movement toward your son and the next like year or two and Saturn which rules Capricorn is heading is already in that Simon Saturn will then contact your son and then between two thousand Nineteen two thousand twenty Jupiter will be there so you're going to have three enormously important influences\nIn the Capricorn part of your chart which is your son sign your character your life force kind of the link to hire spirits so what the universe is saying is\nDo some big time study psychology philosophy authors or ... it doesn't have to be a study like that I mean it could be art it could be music anything a hobby a craft and activity though that as deep in significant\nSo that you don't get down on yourself are worried or stressed out and so on that you do have a wonderful moon in Virgo and on the line and called the trying which is flowing to your son to be an organizer this is what you you've done in the past\nEfficiency organization service to other people like possibly other lifetimes where you've been nurse or doctor were were a student or you know a libraries or things like that learning languages from the past so there are some skill sets that you have that are very strong from other allies but the big things next couple of years\nSo it kind of deep seated study penetrating into some kind of mysteries or involvements that like you stay really focused and that you learn a whole lot over the next couple of years\nOkay good luck to your car loan next one may fourth Nineteen sixty nine may fourth Nineteen sixty nine were going out to California so who is with us welcome to the program for good\nYeah I think you are my question is about Korea money and should I moved to a different state um when I was born in a quick city court\nNo where are you okay ... what's the city how do you spell it who wait city oh okay in a way of course in he's a\nI'm just putting six AM here unless you give me another time I put around sunrise ... do you know your time birth or no oh no okay no problem [noise] okay you said money yeah where what states\nThen what state deliver these I'm Kelly right now okay well first of all there is an even on my website it's called global hotspots ... where\nI Do part of mundane astrology but it's also individuals'\nWe there's been a science for forty plus years and astrology\nIt was originally called astro Qatar graffiti by a fellow named Jim Lewis too many years ago passed away and it's a it's a wonderful tool but you got to know your time of birth and then we can move around from like where you're born from Kuwait City to California or New York or somewhere in the planet's understand what's good and what isn't a California is\nAnd this is another big thing that people don't realize and astrology every state of the union as a chart like September nine Eighteen fifty California and to the union as the son signed Virgo state with a with a Scorpio moon\nSo you as a tourist son signed tourists\nThat's an earth sign and you match pretty well with with California okay so that is a match where your time and California's earth fine\nOr good okay you also have a good money aspect in your chart I'm not sure what you should use it for but you have mercury with Vesta which is one of the four main asteroid Vesta has a lot to do with investment\nSo it's not surprising that you would ask that question about what to do something with money investment so there is something that you're supposed to do with all that\nAnd you just have to figure that out the other thing is you have a moon trying to Venus which is another potential money making energy but the big but here is Venus which goes stationary in retrograde on friday\nIn Scorpio is making kind of an unusual Lima to NATO Venus therefore don't act precipitously\nOkay in in the near future um and because you're mysteries in its home signed a Gemini you want to avoid those mercury Richard ... times they can be good for review and reflection but you want to learn more about mercury its retrograde the power Venus which is your son find ruler and that will really help you\nMark if there is a planet X. out there in the solar system somewhere will that affect things\nIn fact uh the I have a whole thing about here is which has a five hundred sixty six year cycle which is on that note when President Trump took office it's an article on earth Aquarius news it was very strong at his inauguration it has a whole lot to do with what's been happening over the last year and a half\nAnd therefore outer planets even beyond Pluto have are now being used a whole lot just as there are a lot of asteroids and little plants like higher on the truck it's overpopulated that's part of the the complication but you want to use them judiciously not overwhelm the chart with a whole lot of them but sometimes they were very significant\n... mark keep in touch with us we'll probably talk with you on a New Year's eve and New Year's day to get predictions for two thousand Ninety two sons

Lived on the Chesapeake Bay the little town of Solomon's Maryland\nAnd uh I was when I walked out into the there was a long half mile here\nAll from the wrong to the Chesapeake biological laboratory where the protection early meets the Chesapeake Bay and I was sitting there late at night when I saw a larger light heading toward me\nThat was coming from the mouth of the Chesapeake then I noticed the outline of a large disc shaped object which suddenly dove into the water then rose back into the sky and headed straight for me\nAs it flew over me I saw a bottom panel open and New York post spray me with what I called in the book but toxin shower many rows straight up and disappeared and frankly the thanks scare the hell out of me\nAnd then the second citing occurred on April second Nineteen fifty eight\nI was returning home from Baltimore because I was a student at the Peabody Conservatory of music when I saw a large white light harboring over a barn and a few minutes later began blanking on and off and followed my car for most of the remaining miles Solomon's Ireland\nThen it stopped in horror Harvard over another barn than a minute or so later started to perform some fantastic maneuvers in an instant it appeared in one end of the sky than a split second later it would appear at the other hand\nIt does it did this for about half a dozen or so times\nThan the stuff and then suddenly I saw a brilliant large red light that came out of the sky and merged with a larger light at this point in my car radio admitted allowed screeching Sam because I opposed the protection wherever the light cross the river headed headed south and disappeared and then\nUh that same that same year on November twenty Nineteen fifty eight I was standing outside my father's hoist
