Martin yeah that was very\nVery chilling and very fascinating I think\nHe was right on on about a lot of stuff on when you ask them about the anti Christ and all that I was really my radio started fate and really bad in and out when they started answer that question started banging on my radio and everything really yeah said oh no I Want to hear this park because that was a really good question and a\nAnyway I wanted to ask you ... ... you know anything about that ah the Turkish government\nYou one day last week and I was a man on the subject of reincarnation and I got the impression you didn't want to talk about it\nI'm pleased to talk about\nOh well I'm\nA I I Wonder if you would get a guest on who would be opposed to it and you said you were going to have their priests on friday afternoon to the whole program it never came up the subject of reincarnation\nOh I see well I Would I Would have been obvious so I mean he was a Catholic priest\nOr what I Wonder yeah but I think there are pros and cons to the subject and I would like to hear somebody um has the argument against it\nI don't want to excuse me what why don't you go to make some now what do you think okay\nThe people who believe in it they say that we keep reincarnate ing and coming back because they said that the way we learn yes if\nYou remember they always say that they say that's how we learn yes and yet on the program friday night you and the priest both agreed that that we are a lot I don't know if you remember that but\nMy point I remember it clearly\nYeah well if if we came we incarnate and to come back at to learn at issue I think we would find our way by now we would not be alive\nAnd well in other words we would become wiser in wiser in ... which is that it that we're getting dumber and dumber and dumber\nMm there's another problem with the reincarnation and that is that there are constantly more people on the earth in other words yeah more souls yeah right\nSo maybe um those who are learning and becoming wise or because of reincarnation if it does exist are being in effect out voted by the ... coming along who don't know a damn thing\nI Do know that I like now\nWhen you first came on this radio station when you left the station I remember hearing you say that you intended to have a masters as a guest and I don't know maybe you changed your mind but I Would like to hear him talk about it\nFor no I haven't changed my mind at all I had the wrong several times as you know\nOh and then I must admit I hear you I I seldom mission program but I I never heard him on your program\nOh my oh no a boil then you must not catch 'em all well I can say 'cause I've had Roy and I would say over\nThe years probably at least a half dozen times I think you've been on this day and\nWell I don't know what station you're listening to the one year on now a among three hundred stations man well I Know I mean oh I'm In Las Vegas okay that helps you mean it'd be easy or maybe not since we've been on cable you gee that's right well that's what I mean\nYou know and uh I I Know you had him before that yeah home or would you consider having him of course I think he's very very interesting and ah or him or any any a guest and who would give the argument the guest reincarnation\nDo you think he does not believe in it\nI I'm not sure but I think he does not\n... what did surprise you if you uh found out he did\nA yeah yeah that would I\nI think I heard him out a lot I've that I've listened to him for Thirty years in a long time ago I heard him say something about that that this would be something that never would want\nBecause people could keep messing up their lives and each time and they say well I got another chance I'll reincarnate an opt out do better than the next time and they never do and then with an argument I heard him give a long time ago\nI see oh right um well maybe I'll have them on how about that\nI Am I'm going to make sure I never miss your Pakistan because I'm On my head at times\nYou announce it well I usually do announce guess ahead of time I thank you very much argue\nWelcome to care I'm Glad you called and uh that was Las Vegas I'm

on whether you were catching\nA guy label I mean it was it was right down to the tea but he said one thing they jumped out at night when we started talking about the anti Christ ... years you have to come or my all ready for a year right he'll be the one that will present the problem is tuition that might be show show the solution that's right and uh that was that was scary but\nI really enjoy the interview with ham I you know he did say that he would come back anytime but I'm Glad he said that I Hope you have you back more often\nMore like ... and and now they are the but but but the parallels there with what I I just can't wait to to look at times comes back after he is spent a month or two with putting our resources into this next round half full year\nYeah well it was so obvious are the things that just went click click click click not just the names but so many of my other guests yeah yeah and then to have somebody of the uh the church on who I just stopped me cold and I just I thought I don't even need to call attention to this uh they're all getting it\nBut I tell you what are and I turned fifty years old obviously first and I don't know whether this comes with getting older or what but\nI Know that something has changed in my life just in the last four or five years I think when you get older you get more spiritual\nMhm are you getting more introspective within you know looking into yourself and I've become aware of what a lot of things that are happening around me and around the world and I never have been concerned about before Santa hat or you know concern myself about them enough to put these things together\nNow I hear ya I hear the one years old and I have a gun to awaken to many of the same things that are\nMarried to an Israeli an adventure and I I

at the network on my mark are pleased rollerblade [noise]\n... [noise]\n\nRichard Nixon I what I'm saying is that on a morality level than the American people have decided that Bill Clinton is no angel but he's no Richard Nixon he's on the ice in between which is correct with what I that's about right\nAnd they've decided that that although it's not maybe\nWe are injured Nixon and an angel and there's a lot of territory in their\nExactly and they'll Clinton is acceptable on a morality scale and then has he done the job the answer to that if you\nLive in that lens out on on the you know if Richard Nixon was zero\nOkay and an angel is a ... where would you say Bill Clinton would be\nI Would put I Would put Bill Clinton ... port more toward the or the or you know toward the lack of morality is going to let me let me say this real fast\nI mean like ... when Reid is\nReal fast the best executives and and the psychologist or\nWait wait a minute I really want to be a journalist Charlie Charlie I Want to be clear on this is ... is easy closer to Richard Nixon or an ...\nIt's probably closer to Richard Nixon ... wrote that the best executives\nTend to be sociopath people with sociopathic personalities\nWho actually are actually be tend to be great to mass murder but they but the thing about it that people who are executives had it was to some extent the ruthless and be heartless and so if you look at some of our best friends that more morality thing then I haven't been very good people but they've been very good executive and that's why I think that actually helped Bill Clinton hurt and it helps it\nWould you like to be smoking cop oh what

anti abortion people we can get some we can get a lot of things done because those people even though I hate to cut\nThose people know know what to do we got some people out with signs who are willing to go and break into some of these are places and do some aggressive stuff than we rent that I think we can get something done on that anti on an anti smoking is that's what it's going to take\nAll

you know the second amendment has actually been repealed [noise]\nAh when did that occur\nOccurred when the Supreme Court quite hearing any cases I [noise]\nWell I'll tell you something it it may be well that they're not hearing cases on it because there are maybe a case\nTo suggest that it would be a state's rights issue and that the Supreme Court ah would say the second amendment only applies state by state but I wanted to ask I interviewed judge Bork and that's what he said that's what he said he believed\nIt could be the tenth amendment does give us that\nSo I wouldn't be too much of a hurry especially in the present climate\n[noise] yeah but\nFor for the last three years the Supreme Court has refused to hear any case on the second amendment\nThat's what I said you may you probably ought to be saying thank you because that leaves it in a gray area if it goes to the court that could be it\nYeah [noise] hey on a lighter note at that conference call you had the other day with a with a oh two or three people um that was that was really fascinating\nWhat what are you referring to all of the uh the conference call with um I was trying to think about the permits and

near term extremely important\nAnd um ... some people were disappointed they said well they want to talk about what was in there or not the politics of what was going to be done to get in there but it's so uh right on top of is that it was an important argument very important\nOh right but I had I had kind of a a philosophy question for you if you held a conference call and you had like Wayne

resentful welcome to coast to coast am how are you\nI'm well Richard thanks for having me on\nMy pleasure let's talk about Harry Houdini ease\nUm how should we described his I mean he was not just a skeptic\nOf after death communication he was an of vowed to bunker and I don't even think that is saying it strongly enough I mean he was almost a hatred for these people that he considered to be frauds where did that he knew why did that happen to come about\nThat that's a very interesting place to start 'em because you're absolutely right I mean he wrote two books as you mentioned and he really um [noise] he um\nWas not just on the side he his mother died in Nineteen Thirteen and at that point he tried to get in touch with her through some psychic but he could tell they were all faking what they were doing and so um\nThat kind of got him going and so as an excellent magician he was able to replicate some of the things that these fake mediums would do\nSo he was always looking for that and actually I think this is ultimately got him killed because I think that the people these fake psychics or talking amongst themselves and I think they want it to refer them up a little\nBit I don't think they wanted to kill him but I think\nThey wanted to say back off and we don't get in your way get out of our way and I think they might spend some money to get that um\nThat young student who had done the boxing team to punch him in the stomach which was a trick he did in public and as you know Richard he\nHe would pick someone out of the crowd pick someone like you or me you know right I mean I'd have them come up to the stage and he would make his muscles ready and you'd be ready for that but this time that\nThis guy came backstage and Harry wasn't expecting it at all his muscles aren't from this guy really late into him and the trauma in the abdomen was so intense that um you know you had those problems and his appendix burst and this is why it passed away\nRight and and had he had he gone to the doctor immediately to receive a medical uh help he probably would've lived but always the showman he the show must go on and he went on and he performed or four or five more shows and and then finally collapsed in Detroit\nYes he was doing little tiny handkerchief magic 'cause that was all he had the strength for 'em but one other point I on this subject about these fake comedian he would send his assistance out\nAnd they would find people and they would see the show and he would find a point in time where the show could be busted so to speak and he would even get the guy that was in control of the light and on the deal and Harry Reid show up with a photographer from the newspaper Harry would be wearing a disguise\nThe magician would be in the middle of his you know if a on the weather would ever with a hidden string making something fly to this guy or whatever and lights would come up and the photographer would take a picture and\nAnd uh you know fake medium would be totally surprise you and you say I'm Harry Houdini to pull off his mask and so these guys are very upset again\nFascinating I I had not heard the the theory that perhaps some of these a cabal of of disgruntled psychics and mediums had put this young student at McGill University up to the task of of uh\nYeah this writing on beating on Harry right under\nMy that's my own idea I haven't heard it from anyone else it seems to make sense a few phone calls hey you know I mean so I had nothing on Henry you know I mean he didn't have any kind of reason to go there or do anything right right I thought\nIt would just I just wanted to ask you about briefly about a ... sir Arthur Conan Doyle because they were area and and he were were good friends and yet\nA Doyle was a prominent spiritually so how did that how did that friendship survive as the fact that area was such an vowed to bunker didn't have time for spiritual is and yet he's good friend and his wife ah we're both very much into spiritualism movement\nYes yes the spirit was movement is not exactly out and find in some kind of permanent structure you know you can't say there's a leader but a lot of people did look to the oil as the leader of the spiritual as a matter of friendship starting in around Nineteen twenty for about two years\nAnd I think the friendship came about through fame just fan crossing pass and hey how are you and they enjoy the fact that they had a different perspective and they talked about it um but eventually um there was a little bit of\nA discord between them that got so much that they did break off their friendship\nWell I think they didn't dominate the planning for a long time until Seventeen Seventy six\nBecause the founding fathers decided to form a

P. line and sometimes it does break up is that a little better\nIt is okay I'm\nJames Pike this is the ... an Episcopal bishop his son had committed suicide of your earlier and now Ford is doing a say on a Canadian TV [noise] yes\nAnd and he does a little up front research brings it into the sounds as if he's getting it in a psychic way whereas in fact he got it from the conventional way this was discovered after Fort died and people went through his papers and found his research preparing for this ... and that's why people say this\nSo this is another black mark against or if they're bored and it's again muddy the water so this case the Houdini case\nAs fun as it is and as exciting as it is it it's not going to be the first break through convince all the hard no skeptics who just isn't\nRight but but okay so Ford is discredited because of the sense in Canada in Nineteen sixty seven but as you point out he had been taking morphine he had been drinking has a perhaps that had damaged his a medium Mm abilities does that necessarily discredited the work that he did on on the Houdini case\nYes yes that's the way I see it and it does or doesn't I I just it it's it puts a cloud over it but it doesn't necessarily directly bear on it\nNow despite basses\nRe catching and\nYou know saying no I I don't believe that Harry communicated with me nor could he then why did she continue to do these ... high profile public say ounces on the anniversary of Harry's death for the next ten years\n[noise] um she did it for ten years after his death but she didn't start them until a couple of years into that so she did about seven of them as my count but the point is still well taken and here's the way I look at it when she was with Harry um\nShe would be on stage at times and Harry was the one in the spotlight\nBut when Harry dies she's in the spotlight but she doesn't have anything to do\nYou know and so all of a sudden she's in an an unusual place and so by stepping into the spotlight only once a year for one night to do the ... and I think the last one was in LA\nI'm On the top of a building you know the first they were going to do it down into building but then they said let's do that on the Doppler will be higher closer to God and the spirits\nAnyway I think she knew these were going to be a failure because she was the one that was acting as the medium and she's not a medium so you're pretty much guaranteed they're gonna fail so she can say that statement at the end you know ten years is long enough to wait for any man and\nAnd that kind of thing and it kinda makes it safe for her to say well I tried I open minded I tried but it didn't work and so I'm going to go back\nWith my friends and embrace the standard mainstream believe\nBut you're inclined to believe that the origin\nThey don't statement released in the New York times in Nineteen twenty nine\nAffirming that she had been contacted through a Arthur forty been contacted by her beloved Harry that that that quite possibly happened\nYes yes I Do in the letter that she wrote a wind chill it also it has a fair amount of passion to it she's very strong you know and\nSo I'm not someone who would say well if she was tricked and didn't know ship is tricked she would still feel very strongly so I'm I'm open minded to that comment to\nYou you finish the essay with a I don't know if you have

economic chaos they know they have to get into this war for many reasons to the to spark the economy as well and uh it was just in the he had FDR was put in a real bad situation\nAnd you know in the first chapter of my book I paint FDR is kind of a villain and I have to do that to set up the murder so I Apologize in advance for anybody reads and gets her town when FDR had to sell\nOur country on this war and I believe he had to sacrifice Pearl Harbor and the lives that I Know it's a terrible thing to say but I uh I think that's that's how it happened\nIn order to galvanize public support\nRight yeah 'cause he he had already been saying this was Europe's war this is Europe's were well between the the ... the global economy which was not doing anything and the necessary time to get into the war coming through our spies and it was he knew it was time to break gut wrenching decision very gut wrenching decision\nSo that that's a that's how that came in to pass\nYou know before we get into the the us in World War two and FDR's relationship with Churchill and and then later style and\nI'm starting to be a little bit about sort of the enemies list that he had already cultivated through you know the overregulation and and and with with the big corporations in the United states\nOh boy uh\nThis guy had a you know there were enemy hated money he really didn't affect

Mussolini at first he was an author of Mussolini so Mussolini actually started the whole thing but\nYou know again I'm history books being what they are that tends to get the last um [noise] so America gets into the war in Britain is getting polarized ah being bombed at night for more\nThan a month every night um people are taking shelter in the tubes in the book I have a first hand account of that I actually my great aunt is still alive she lived through it through the ... bombings in Birmingham she watched the city's burn\n'em coverage of entry and in Birmingham a very interesting stuff so um that was really neat that I have that personal contact with with her and she's still alive and doing well by the way [noise] um anyway\nAh we get into the war and we're we don't have anything to do with stolen at the moment we're just trying to help Churchill and because they were really they have no people have no idea according to my end it was there\nHow close England cans are losing their island they were lined up\nOn the other side of the day being the Germans were lined up on the other side of the English Channel\nAnd this was what their MO was they used to go and lay down air strikes bomb them into oblivion and then just tape around your ground troops over and it worked exceedingly well especially France and they thought the same thing was going to work in a in in Britain and of course it didn't because of\nYou know church does resolve a and you know of course so we're going to the war and now we're there to help out Churchill so we're talking amongst ourselves now working hand in glove with a with the Brits now all of a sudden\nWe get the rainy idea to bring styling into the war and Churchill loses his mind he hates style and doesn't want anything to do with them never trust them I'm of course to admit previously and I'm sure she'll really masterminded the whole thing to be honest with the church shows the one who\nGot the two together but he he just hated the fact that the Americans\nBecause they were so similar at the time\nThat Stalin in America and the American president FDR were working in unison on the it was great for the war it was bad for the world because Stalin was a temporary ally he had his eye completely on the post war world he knew that after the war we weren't going to be from\nSo to answer your question around about fashion um Churchill like it for the war hated it for the world and I don't know if he completely trusted that FDR wasn't going to be homeless vowing only a less aggressive one\nWell at this point was FDR still a a huge fan of style needs to say that they called them uncle Joe\nOh yeah absolutely absolutely it was a there was\nOf course you have to understand\nWe weren't getting things from Russia we didn't know much about the great purge I think of FDR had known about the butchery and everything going on and he wouldn't have been his fan but of course we weren't getting that until decades and decades later\nRight here in New York Times wherever they were writing glowing a pieces about uncle Joe and how wonderful sure communism and listen\nThere's still a communist newspaper as far as I'm concerned and you know um they're right down the street from the the Communist Party of the United states of America so you know I mean they're still carrying or pieces are ...\nMillion FDR it seemed to get them from reading your book that FDR was very anxious to get a face to face with Allen I don't know if this was because he admired him or like that he was burns and Stalin was playing a little hard to get\nStoned in need us we need it's balanced island in the U.S\nHe was already you know when when the Nazis started to hit a pact with style and of course we know as Hitler and it's and spelling hit a pack well Hillary violated the pack and went after style in which completely blue silence mind\nAnd they were on the march to Moscow and they were doing good doing well with this march and then\nYou know Hitler's ego took over and he\nDecided he was going to go to Stalingrad because it held his namesake so now it was leading under the illusion right now that he's unstoppable is completely unstoppable so of course we didn't know anything about Hillary's drug habit at the\nTime he was on like thirty some odd different drugs so he was such a delusional\nDictator if at this time he thinks he's completely unstoppable so he decides to switch horses in midstream and go toward styling read um meanwhile the weather is changing a winter is following the Germans are ill equipped and he'll close to do this\nIt doesn't matter you know his generals are coming back saying it's a suicide mission and they were just says well I don't care I Want to do it so\nStalin is already beating him or he doesn't need us\nSo Hitler has he has the other hand here he has the opportunity to play a little a little hard to get in he certainly was so when we really had to go begging it is it's dollars table in which they get this done\nRight so there was a conference in Casablanca and\nAnd then later Iran I think in\nA was terrain in Nineteen forty three and a gang member forty three correct\nThey had even at this point they have their eye it sort of carving up the post war world\nA instill at this point you know I I see pictures Roosevelt still it's pretty robust or you know he you know by by the standards the Nineteen forties he was an older guy but by today's standards he was only like sixty years old we tend to think of him and you know in our mind that he was like eighty but he was he
