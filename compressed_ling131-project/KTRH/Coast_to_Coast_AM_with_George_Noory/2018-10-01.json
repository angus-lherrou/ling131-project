give my native teachers gave me was was to look at myself and see where I still held fear or anger or blame or shame\nAnd and to re can figure that to learn why did I Choose that as a lesson and how do I forgive myself and to have compassion for the person who taught me that lesson\nWhen you frame it like that you really learn to see the person that has caught cause you what you feel they did to you you begin to see them in a very different way\nDid these entities Sandy ever tell you where they were from\n[noise]\n'cause we've already talked about dimensions are planetary I mean did they ever say hey we're from ... or anything like that\nYeah they um some said they were from the ... some from our tourists many from Sarah I'm so I'm more into dimensional um Rocco Andromeda I mean there's a lot of life energy out there there's a lot of species out there\nThat no point did you feel as if you're going to be hurt\nOh yes I did\nOh you did have to do with\nThe grave with the graves initially and the the more mantis like ones there were some experiments that yeah that I felt I felt hurt I felt they'd taken my rights and my freedom I felt it wasn't up to them to do what they were doing um\nBut at some point later I realized that they were doing it for a reason and and talking with Graham trial or about it\nOne of the thought she had is that we had bread heart energy and um [noise] sacred sexuality out of ourselves and that they were coming back it from beyond our time to instruct us not to do that again\nI'm now that was her belief um as one thought I don't know if that's true but I Do feel that many times my freedoms who were taken away and that was very scary as a child\nThat would be scary ... you know little girl like that and how will begin were you when this started\nUm I can recall all the way back to three\nYears old wow now did your parents ever seen anything to you\nKnow I'm I Do believe my grandfather was probably a contact the just from different things that he and I talked about when I was a kid um is to you know when we would take walks he he would point out trees or [noise]\nOr animals and talk about how we were all one I didn't understand what he meant at the time\nI've always wondered if with these conduct these though if it's a physical thing where they kinda floated you into their craft do materialize you through the roof or something or if they're just taking like your mind in taking that and then they bring it back\nThat's a good question um you know a lot of times people in the groups who have asked me that is are are they external eyes manifestations or an internal process\nAnd I can't give you a direct answer for that though I Do feel that in some of my memories I Do remember being taken almost the materialized in remission\n... if you will um or at least the windows that I went through with the wall I went\nThrough what you felt you were in your physical body\nYes but I also felt that time that it's almost holographic and that it's my mind being instructed and\nNot my body being taken\nDid you hear others screaming at all on the craft\nI can say I never did okay\nThat's a good sign at least it wasn't a cookbook up there like this [laughter] you don't want that but this\nThis has been a life altering events for you know when you tell people you're contact the people who\nYou know obviously people listen to the show understand you and John Mack the late the psychiatrists understood you but what about other people what did they say they're going ... says there's a little off a little bit\nYeah I think it's still runs the gamut from this belief to orange to making fun of two excitement that uh you're bringing up the subject because maybe they can open up and start to talk about it I Know personally I didn't really come out to the public or colleagues until this book\nUm and when the book did come out\nI had never told my mother and she was here he is with me because she doesn't believe in it\nUm and I did have colleagues come in I I remember one doctor in particular she came into my office and she put the book on my desk and she said All right if it was anybody else I wouldn't believe them but I Know how grounded you are and I've worked with you for Twenty years can we talk about it so it runs the gamut\nDid they tell you these entities did they tell you anything about the future\nYeah what\nThe future could be if we can you tell us\nWent down certain path [noise] um [noise]\nYou sound a little hesitant how come [noise]\nWell because it's more of what we're seeing now only in a greater degree\nWell you have laid laid out for center what happens\nUm from my perspective uh again I just feel from some of the things they showed us and told us that\nWe had the potential to destroy ourselves as a planet and as a people and they would not allow that to happen to the planet but certainly um because we here on earth have free will um many had the potential to not survive this time of the times on the planet\nWhere I think lasers or nuclear a nuclear\nEquipment has been used before World War two\nI think um I think that a long time ago\nLong long time ago but um that I Believe how Mars went down because they show to when my kids to have water running um\nSome kind of a nuclear disaster on Mars\nYes coupled with a couple of also with something in the procession of the planet that might have caused me to come in but essentially the people did it to themselves\nLet's talk a little bit more about that Sandy when we come back plus I'm going to

and I are is radio station is\nLikely another week of drama head on Capitol Hill I'm Eric sharp it's eleven o'clock news radio seven forty ...\n[noise] okay I Want to I Want to say something about I think we're we put our focus is what\nWe can create and I do think that although\nAnd that he can end its existence I don't think the planet is going to explode I think the planet has gone through many cycles many changes\nOver millions of years um I Do think we can destroy ourselves as a species um I think that's really clear and I don't see it as a nuclear war per se\nI see it as more of the destruction of what helps us to survive like water like clean air like um [noise]\nVegetation I mean cutting down things like the rain forest we're cutting down our lungs because\nExchange carbon dioxide with with oxygen with us [noise] um so when I talk about the destruction of the planet it's more the destruction of humanity mhm than the destruction of the planet\nAnd thinking plan it will go on humanity may not\nExactly an and I think again it's where we put our focus that's why I don't want to put it into fear because everybody can jump on the bandwagon and fear that's easy but it takes a whole lot more to hold the stance\nAnd at some point it's going to end up having to deal with governments in in military complex is that are causing a lot of this\nAnd I believe that's what the consciousness is is that it can raise to a point where those things can't go on the way they've been allowed to be going on for pretty much the last fifty sixty years\nAnd before that if we're a testing ground for good and evil mean evil spelled backwards live you want to live a good life or do you want to bring that intent to life and that's what I think evil is\nDo these entities talking all about a guard or higher bean\nYes like like us many of them are trying to raise their consciousness to come back to what can be referred to as the one or the divine presence or the guard seed or\nThe absolute however you want to see that I think it's much more mingled with science almost than with a a specific religious base but if you want to talk spirit and higher consciousness\nI Do believe that there's something far greater than us from which we've all come in which we're all part of\nAnd I think many of them believe that too\nYou know each teased don't make you good it's like drunk uncle Harry sometimes\nSome [laughter] sometimes the party is good and sometimes the parties not\nAnd also I'm curious about these underground facilities that they show you what was the purpose what were they for ...\nI think I think from very early times we have had other species um Illinois species\nThat have come here and occupied underground cabins and tunnels um but I think the tunnel system has gotten much bigger based on the military ... underneath\nThe earth um and I think that's where there has been some conflict when some of those\nWere disturbed or disrupted that's only my personal belief\nInteresting techno who made though\nWho who made the caverns [noise] um I think the earth had caverns in it and that's where some of these humanoid type existed I mean\nAnd it's natural form then I I mean I was picturing underground cities and things like\nThat I think there have been underground cities I Know one of the places I was taking was an under ground uh underwater base I think there's a lot of bases underwater yeah um\nI Do too and and I think you know you look at\nDifferent um I Know when I've been improved as an island there called ... and uh the link to the

believe that when the last world came to an end they all had to go underground and they were saved by the ... people who brought them back up through a ... over ... breathing whole and that's what's in there he was now [laughter]\nSo a lot of\nUh indigenous people have records of the star nations coming here and at least from what I was told is they're waiting for us to ascending consciousness so we can come into what I used to call the legions of light with them um because they're still trying to get to a higher level of consciousness too and they need us\nSending what makes the Sherman's show in like what is it about them and what they've learned\nYou know they're they don't ever call themselves ... or medicine people we do we call we do we do but they they get their name based on\nTheir actions and how the people observe them so if they're healers or if they're dreamers or if they're um teachers it's the people that recognize them is that for their skill set\n'em and I

to conscious state yet\nI think there are definitely pre cognitive dream where you're being warned I don't always think possibly the person you're being warned about needs to\nHear that information from you sometimes they might not be ready unless you feel they're in danger when you have one about yourself and my sense is that would ever told you on some level everything in the dream is what it

actually concluded\nThe research is was simply making the point that some toxic free radicals that would ordinarily be neutralized by\nProtected nutrients can potentially have longevity inducing effect\nThe idea that substances that are toxic are poisonous may actually provide health benefits is based on science of or meet a tried and true theory that says a small amounts of ordinarily harmful material can actually promote how clearly there's lots of evidence to support the theory which for example explains the\nBodybuilding benefits associated with the stress of exercise induced muscle trauma\nAs well as homeopathic practices which involves giving really tiny doses a poison activate healing mechanism but while no one disputes the idea that some stresses whether they're in the form of exercise or\nHomeopathic medicine or free radicals can be beneficial and can stimulate helping longevity to make that obvious truth mean the antioxidants by virtue of their protective effect

than any other guest that I've experienced is I've been with the program for ten years and that's a that's because he always brings the goods I Am jazz that he always allows me to get the first interview when he unveiled a new book and like the other books this new one does not disappoint\nA Davis you probably know spent Twenty years in law enforcement then worked in the tech industry for a bit but found as true calling as an investigator of unusual disappearances and his work in that area has become a phenomenon known all over the world multiple books a documentary film\nAnd maybe some other surprises to come Dave great have you back\nGeorge I'm always humbled that anyone even wants to listen to listen to me though or appreciate the invite\nI wanted to say you know I noticed something as I was reading the new book today that you make some personal observations than I Am not a I haven't seen it you go this far in the other books I insights\nInto your own emotional reactions to some of these cases and it seems clear like the subject really gets to you and you've got I think eleven hundred and thirty five cases that you profiled over the years thousands more they'd be looked into\nSome of them really seemed to get into your head though I I think in part because of similarities some of the missing to your own life right\nYou know I think that's true um I've been very fortunate to me family of people who have been lost\nAnd when you meet these people it really brings brings home the emotion and there's a lot of parallels to my life with a lot of these families and I've written about people that remind me of myself a lot of times and uh [noise]\nI've put the in the book just recently ... probably because it's it's more of an evolution of my writing and\nHopefully people see that you know have these people are really really good people these are the Drake who is fighting these are the upper echelon and it's a conundrum to me why I don't find people that are down and out in life that are disappearing but it it\nSeems to me that it's always the high rollers but people that are high performers that are disappearing\nYou know one place in the new book you mentioned how as a rule you did not reach out to the families of the missing now sometimes you meet him ... due to various circumstances but in general you don't call somebody up out of the blue and say hey can I talk to you about your dad loved one or you're missing loved one because it seems like an invisible line that you don't want to cross over but I Wonder\nHas the success of your books help in the sense that these families now reach out to you that they're unsatisfied say with the the search effort or something and they're they're turning to you for some help her answers\nIt has happened and uh [noise] I don't want to inject myself into a search or into the turmoil that evolving with somebody disappearing now somebody reaches out want some help absolutely I'm going to be there I'll do everything I can\nAnd there have been cases just recently where that's happened and I've been ground to help and ah\nI've kinda guided them and it it seems that a lot of these families and covered the same sort of issues time and time again and frustrating as heck to sit back and hear the frustration and their voice a\nCommon one is is it seems as though when jurisdictions stops searching they get to a point seven to ten days and they say hey there's nothing else we can do there's no place else to search\nA we're running out of resources we've got to stop well many times families and friends rally at that point and they get a group together and they keep searching for what I tell these people is you've got to get a copy of those reports that the jurisdiction wrote search and rescue reports\nLaw enforcement report the who they interviewed who they talked to were they search the effectiveness of the search or the areas they completely eliminated in the in the areas that they thought that they still should search more because without that you're really searching blind\nAnd there's been instances just lately where people have said no they said they won't give us anything I find that baffling\nWell I mean that's how they treated you I was gonna ask you the same question about different agencies I Know how the national Park Service feels about you and that they are we should anybody who has not heard your earlier interviews or is not familiar with the books you might be listening tonight\nI'm maybe we start there where you can explain the history of your interaction with the national Park Service the forest service government entities in general because they've shut you out I mean I guess I I'm interested to learn that they're doing the same thing to the families of the missing but ah it's really\nKind of clear over the big picture that they don't want to help solve these mysteries\nYou know it's a sad note on humanity if that's the case but there is a lot of obstruction so when I started out I was told by a couple of Park Service rangers that they had found\nDisappearances and their parks where they had worked that bothered um didn't make sense when they tried to find information they couldn't and they thought somebody with an investigative background on to be looking into it [noise]\nAnd a sort of

gone further than that pretending to be you can you address that very moment before we jump into the cases\n[noise] so this is one of the most frustrating parts of you know in the public spotlight I go to conferences all the time people come up to me and they say so you said this or how did you come up with that and I'm thinking I never said that and there's a series of YouTube sites\nThat have the name David polite is missing for one one missing a national parks there all frauds they're not me there are people that have used my name to get innocent and listeners to get on and every time you click through they get paid by their Google Ads\nThe only site that has me is a kennel missing project YouTube site all the rest are not me in fact about eighty percent of them when you click in and you listen if you don't know it's somebody else talking about some other topic and it's not even me at all so\nI tried to tell us that people don't trust you to really don't even listen to him I'm less effect cannot missing project site that's the only real site that you're going to get honest information from\nAll right I'm not for a moment about search and rescue\nParameters because that that information becomes key to you picking the cases that use zero in on I mean there are metrics there are there's data\nUm for search and rescue 'em yeah how how they proceed and and I a huge database I Would think that gives clues about which cases stand out as being unusual\nSo that the data that you're trying to get to is really in the reports that they generate and the national Park Service for one won't volunteer up any of these reports now find name a specific date and a specific time and that\nPerson has been ruled to be a missing and presumed deceased\nThey're released the report most times times they want there was a case from eighty six\nAnd are found impossible distances away sometimes they're alive amazingly enough but I'm often sound impossible distances away and there is no way no way they could walk there on their own or talk about that than up and\nSo there's a couple of sites that talk about my work and talked about these cases and a couple of people have chimed in and said well you know Dave talks about people in this books that have been found and there's no mystery there they obviously haven't read the books and they don't understand the rationale behind why these stories are important\nSave you got a two year old child that's in the middle of the wilderness with their friends or their family and they disappear and that child found say three thousand feet higher in elevation and six miles away in a day and a half\nA well I don't know many parents think that there are two year old could make that track\nBut that's not it I mean when I started to accumulate the data on it in off the grid the book before this one I had a list that accumulated\nThat probably there's fifty a cases in their starts off with the case let's say a four year old missing in Australia found five days later forty five miles away across the desert\nOr four years old I'm there's other cases where two year old in Florida found twenty miles away through the swamps ah another two year olds in Australia found Fifteen miles away in three days two years old\nA three year old found Fifteen miles away twenty four hours not possible in my book but I mean there's a long long list of these and why did I start to accumulate that data\nBecause in search and rescue manuals that says that a two year old should be found Ninety five percent of the time in a radius of two miles or less from the point last scene with these numbers absolutely blown to smithereens\nIt's something search and rescue people don't want to talk about don't want to address that want to even think about\nAnd I can understand why because there's no way you could plan a search thirty\nMiles away for a two year old it just you don't have enough people to do it and you have to work for that Ninety five percent tile but the problem is in all these books they don't talk about the other five percent anywhere I'm probably the first person that's ever talked about it\nBut as you state how are these kids making this extraordinary distance and extraordinary heights\nWhen I go to a conference I always ask people how many people in the room or parents you know Ninety percent of people raised their hands and I said if I said okay you you're just going to set your child down in the dirt on a trail\nWalk away we'll watch the child with such child going to do for the next hour\nThey said well maybe it'll crawl under Bush and go to sleep maybe they'll play in the dirt for a while maybe they'll run down the trail for a little bit get upset cry and then go to sleep\nAnd I said how many how many parents and you think your kid would run up hill nobody raises their hand I mean it does happen but it's pretty rare\nBut I have all these examples where these heights have been achieved by these little kids\nOr they crossed a couple of mountain ranges or you know an incredibly difficult terrain sometimes without any shoes on\nWell yeah\nI mean we talked about a two year old boy that they guest he traveled nine to twelve miles in nine hours over two mountain ranges and he was found face down and snow the next morning unbelievably alive and we found that guy years later and interviewed him and he has no recollection of what happened\nIt's his mom said we couldn't believe we found them and we couldn't believe he was alive\nYou have a case in the new book ah in Southern California the Lucerne valley bill Hanks this was back in Nineteen fifty six is the child is five years old at the age of disappearance\nAnd you do the math on a bill I guess if he had walked nonstop for twenty four hours you have to go point six miles per hour\nA buddy kid's not going to walk for twenty four hours with no food or water\nUm it it seems just impossible\nUnless somebody pick them up or some some thing or someone picked him up and slumped him there\nWell and and the reason these cases have significant is that let's say you report on a child who's abducted in downtown Vegas and they're found in West Los Vegas three hours later six miles away\nYou know sure as somebody put them in the car and drove them there but when you're talking in the middle of the wilderness not happening and\nWhen you talk about this happening when the people in the party and anybody never talk to anybody and when they check the trail walks nobody else was there nobody saw any thing nobody saw any cars\nThere so how did that child make that difference in that time doesn't make\nA in the new book uh it's law L. A. W. land air and water and a land cases you've talked about before but you've got some new ones including one that happened in the organ pipe cactus national monument Arizona\nRather take a break now when we come back this one has really creepy and even some of the investigators who are working the case admitted it was really creepy I Will tell you why in just a moment talking with David polite is going to take a break the ...

national monument or part of the national Park Service their property and they patrol it their national park we are there\nWell there's an art location called Oregon or an organ pipe cactus national monument [noise]\nAnd it's in Arizona are southern part of the state right near the border with Mexico or February third Nineteen Seventy one a woman thirty two year old named Carol Turner who was a student at the University of New Mexico [noise]\nDrove there and was going to take a vacation and break\nSchool and kind of walk around and she was inquisitive smart athletic brilliant some people called her\nWell I stumbled onto this case and saw it and some archive somewhere\nAnd I immediately wrote to the Pima County sheriff and you ask them for any documents on that case I got the documents in my hand then I called the national Park Service at organ pipe and ask them for their reports amazed added a we don't have any I said have you heard of the case no\nWell this person's still missing\nSo she was a thirty two year old graduate student she had been a PE teacher with a master's degree in physical education decided she wanted to go back and get to more masters degrees\nAnd she ... she was just really admired by all of the faculty that she worked around and and studied under and all of the articles and all the reports said that they stated she was really smart\nWell she was about to graduate with a degree in sociology and biology and she was working and you're a university lab tech to earn some extra money [noise]\nShe loved the outdoors type regularly on January thirty first Seventy one she left her residence in southeast Albuquerque she was driving her white sixty eight Plymouth station wagon and she went about an eight hour drive to the monument and she slept in her car that first night\nFebruary first it was established that she attended an evening ranger presentation at the end of that presentation she went up to the ranger engage them in conversation he remembered it and said hey she asked really good questions and want smart\nFebruary second she went to the park visitors center spoke to a ranger they're stating she had just returned from a hike to bowl pasture and asked about a guy the trip to a place called dripping springs\nSubsequent investigation found she spoke to a ... a ranger an individual and Larry Henderson you said he she he remembers or ask good questions was interested in the environment wander nowhere to go to see more things\nIn February third she moved your car out of the campground nobody knew exactly why and on February forth at nine Fifteen and I am a ranger was patrolling and found chemicals car parked in s this Kenyan picnic site with a note taped inside the windshield\nAnd it said if I'm not backed by four thirty pm on February through these contact the ranger\nSmart smart thing to do\nExactly no I Wish everybody would do that\nBut then as I went through this I started to think she was going to a place and she was heading to a place that she went to earlier and I always wondered in the back of my mind did something happened that first trip and she was going back to the second time and just in case she was leaving the snow I wasn't sure\nSo he purchased patrol vehicle and he hiked the two miles up from bull pasture he saw nothing and decided to check the trail register and it was signed by Carol the first day she went on February second he notified park headquarters advise them that he has a missing hiker and this starts the search process\nFebruary fourth and fifth national park service and sending to Forman teams up that trail the search whether it was described and reports is cold and blustery they determined care was last seen eating an orange on the trail and they did find some spare orange peel scattered around\nThe Pima County sheriff was asked to join the search when the national Park Service start to get low on resources they also called in the border patrol and the tribal police US Customs\nMonth an air force base they brought in civilian helicopters was massive the search for three hundred ground searchers were on at any one time the\nPark superintendent again he met Ryan contacted turtles parents in North Carolina\nThe parents they did the Carol would never ever go off trail she was in ... outstanding athletic condition and she was supposed to be back in Albuquerque on February fifth February twenty second Matt Ryan told the Associated Press\nIt's almost becoming a search for the answer to a mystery march seventh one last push to locate curl rangers claim to\nSmell an odor of human decaying flesh up the trail\nMarch thirteenth national park service for the team into the area of the odor and found nothing\nAnd\nAgain they have no documentation on the incident anywhere now I did get this NPs report that was in the Pima County documents and it was written by the chief ranger Roswell boils and it was three type written pages that outlines of search for Carole\nAnd Ninety percent of it real boring real mundane for a review of what it says one additional ... was turned up on Monday February fifteenth too limited locations about four hundred yards the park on the south west facing of the host AJ last\nA very strong in distinct human odor was found but no other locations supervising ranger how cross of ... that's where our national monument\nAnd one other searchers who was recently involved in the recovery of the body had very strong and positive feelings on the ... than a vacation at the odor\nThe following day ranger cos after flying the area and a border patrol plane letting eat man search party back over this area again the order was observed at the same location but only occasionally and not as distinct\nOther members of the team described it as a very weird and scary all efforts were negative and search activities have been reduced intermittent patrols at this time\nI have never and thousands of reports\nSeen anything described in our national park service report of very weird and scary\nFlight guys yeah it's really strange just a feeling they had or the fact that they're smelling what they think is the human flesh but there is no source or the older\n\nWell here's what's as other members of the team described it as a very weird and scary so\nI'm sure all of us who spent time in the outdoors have spent have smelled the odor of dead flash decaying some time animals die smell it I don't know if that could be weird and scary\n[noise] but uh again\nThis was her second hike into that area which she nervous about making the trip is that why she left a note where she just smart about it they never found her there was never any subsequent follow ups after that

guy named Henry McCain and this is really pretty creepy\nThat is a creepy case and ah [noise] the new Brighton Minnesota it's a community just north of Minneapolis not very far almost the suburb September seven two thousand Fifteen to twenty eight am it happened [noise] McCabe was thirty two years old\nSo uh he was an immigrant from Liberia married to a woman named cream their two kids lived in a city called mounds view again just north of Minneapolis north side this is a cluster of missing people that I've written about in the past\nYou had a great job using auditor for the state of Minnesota for the department of revenue [noise]\nWell on September sixty thousand Fifteen his wife with kids or went to California and it was a planned vacation well on that Sunday night Henry went

and left the link the voicemail strange sounds screaming paintings growls et cetera\nPut together some very interesting factual side note\nAnd a guy from uh Finland did some amazing work sent me this booklet of things that he did and in there he said Dave did you know that there's six major disappearances in Bermuda Triangle that matched dates of disappearances and your books\n[laughter] I never even knew that and then went back through it and he was right and that got me to start paying attention to these triangles\nNow in the Nevada try and go down there by you it goes from Reno Las Vegas to Fresno that's the triangle and when I first got on to that I thought you know\nThis seems kinda hocus pocus I don't know if I should pay attention but then I put it on a map I said holy crap you know it's in the middle that try and go\nTo Sam in national park yes I go that's quite a\nCoincidence so you're Seventy kings canyon and sequoia national parks are there and I've got tons of disappearances and king canyon and sequoia as well [noise]\nAnd when I watched a documentary about the Nevada Triangle there's several thousand planes that have crashed and disappeared in this year is in that area\nAnd a lot of it can be explained by various meteorologist as strange air currents that things which seems reasonable\nBut when you bring into account that there is also many many people that have disappeared in that area under unexplained circumstances seems kind of a strange coincidence\nWell let's get into some or do you have any specifics from the ... were you when you get into or should we just go you jump into the cases of air disappearances in general\nAnd it was just go to air disappearances\nYou have a case in the books from Moffett Field Sunnyvale, California from Nineteen forty two what's the deal on that one\nSo that's a I grew up not far from Moffett Field uh in Sunnyvale I grew up ... you know and I had planes flying into Moffett Field going right over my house every day of the week and it had notoriety in the early forties for\nBeing a place where all the blimps that patrolled the coast of California that's where they were stationed in there and Treasure Island in the middle of the day [noise]\nLaw in August sixteen Nineteen forty two a blimp was getting are sent out a treasure island where they held the world's fair was man by the Senate earners Cody twenty seven years old and ... and Charles McAdams thirty eight years old [noise]\nAnd uh they left Treasure Island no big deal general patrol all the details on this came from the navy file under a freedom of Information Act I filed fascinating report on this well\nAs they depart\nThey ah start to head out over the Golden Gate and they start to go out over the Pacific towards the feral on islands in Cody was at the controls of an L. E. airship and this was originally taken by our military\nAnd it was owned by good year and they took it because there was a a needed for patrol\n[noise] we'll both men lived near Moffett Field in Mountain View but they drove up to a treasure island for the day to leave on their ship\nOr that night water vapor was in the air and it made the ship too heavy to carry a normal third person that would be in the bucket they only left with to\nThe first hundred and ten minutes of the flight was normal in fact there was no communication and then at seven fifty am the crew radio that they were investigating suspicious oil slick and there were five miles east of the Fairlawn islands\nAt eight oh five numerous attempts by radio to reach the crew but there was no luck\nAnd the navy scrambled to do is to you kingfisher aircraft out of Alameda naval air station to go track down the blimp\nWell the planes encountered cloudy weather with a ceiling five hundred feet they decided it was too dangerous to fly below the crowd so they flew above them\nAt ten forty five AM Moffett Field receives a call from Fort funds to near the Golden Gate stating that they had a Eli ship with two pilots and all we're fine well the navy made a huge sigh of relief\nAnd they felt that all was okay now this was a really really weird call but it was in a file and they couldn't explain why there [noise]\nAnd then in a weapon Fifteen for fun and cause Moffett Field again they didn't get that in LA had crashed in the hills of Daly city just south of San Francisco on the coast\nOr the navy response to Daly city and they find their airship on the ground with one bomb sniffing the gone to a near perfect condition both motors on a ship or off even though one trial was half open and the other was all the way open [noise]\nAnd the career which was required were white preserves over the water bowl of life preserver that they were supposed to be wearing were gone [noise] there\nWas a confidential maybe briefcase and each a airship and that was still intact cabin door was open plenty of fuel within the tank the radio in perfect condition no distress call\nFor fun and called back and say they they made a serious mistake know LA was present at the Fort they couldn't explain why they made that original call [noise]\nCentral coast of California had a major search started almost immediately the nanny found to fishing boat and and navy boat and the coast guard shipped to solve the blimp dip and drop wears on the oil slick\nThe point then gained altitude and disappeared into the crowd\nIs it all pure fairly normal but if you go into the crowd and disappear the crash happened at four thirty to bill you stream daily thirty three miles east of the Pacific ocean\nThe crew did not use parachutes and shoots that were in the craft were still there [noise]\nThere was a couple of theories that I'm Sorry to interrupt you there is a couple of theories that developed a and that the theories are just about as weird as the disappearances or we're going to go to a break and when we come back we're going to jump into the other details about this case and then I get your take on what might have happened to these two missing crew people\nEnded up break with journey wheel in the sky\nFind out more about tonight and get to log on to goes to goes day in ...\n\n\n\nPast one word saved lives and we\nKeep hearing\nAids hurricane season\nStay informed hurricane season would use radio seven\nKatie our age you want to\nGet really growing harbor gates oil ...\nBlend provided one two punch that simply works this powerful organic combo designed to specially for gardening success in our area will energize your dreams I'm like never before so him out to the armor gate located in Tom ball on FM twenty nine twenty a mile and a\nWest of our way to forty nine warm visit us online ad Arbor gate dot com\nThis report is brought you buy unbalance dot org right now there are young people across the world facing a tough choice continue their dream of education or drop out to help their family put food on the table you can help change their future in a single moment see how far your support can go at ... dot org\n... biggest music festival of the year and it's coming to their senior UCI already all music\nDon't miss the iconic performances\nMuch the Iranian music festival Sunday October seventh and Monday silver age seven pm\nOn the devil you thirty nine\n[noise] it's Monday October first wants new today on the free I heart radio as high\nShow sorry your week was all the best ... stations all in one at least a rock cup play last is Dr ...

coast to California and the blimp comes back crashes on land the crew is gone they pick up the story from there\n[noise] for the navy did their investigation and they said that uh there was no fire on board when it hit the beach originally when it hit land it drop one of its bombs accidentally that made the Olympic writer was able to take off again and crashing that Daly city neighborhood [noise]\nThere was a massive search off the coast that went on for days\nAnd they never found anything they review radio bar there was no call for help [noise]\nThey could never explained why the blimp went straight up and at the clouds after dropping the flyers and they thought that it would have stayed lower to watch are like that they were watching on the water there were lots of water craft in that area\nThey never found the crew and emergency survival equipment that they were wearing\nAnd the area outside the Golden Gate that I've written about many times before because just north of San Francisco [noise] yup point raised national park which you had several strange disappearances I documented\nAnd just fell the Golden Gate to a location called half moon bay in that area because I've written about other disappearances that are very very strange no part of the northern California coast north of that coin raise area [noise] and nothing immediately\nTop half moon bay so it's one area that have just strangeness attached to it and like you said that they came up with some explanation for to me that we are laughable\nWell like ah maybe they got into an argument and uh and both fell off or maybe one of them accidentally fell over and the other guy tried to save him and was pulled into the water or\nI mean could that could does not have happened\n... what do you think George [laughter]\nWell I'm just asking you did to respond to those stories that doesn't seem like a there was any kind of a disturbance sign of disturbance in the in what was left or the craft or a and if they were wearing their life jackets you'd think that they would still be had been floating around out there when the when the search was underway\n[noise] or even if they come out of their life jacket they would have recovered the jak\nRight because the area of the water that was searched out there with search so thoroughly and eventually those jackets are gonna wash up the shore and they would have recovered them on the beach so oh these explanations absolutely made no sense at all\nYou have another case from Scotland a that was held Nineteen Seventy five\nBefore I get into that if I Want to address something that you said just after the break and that was an explanation that fits the facts and I immediately thought of skin Walker ranch you know\nGive is going to bring this up at some point um you know as I read this book today um I notice that you you've ventured a little bit farther than you have in previous works or in the land in the air disappearances there's the Fred let Frederick Marilyn ditch case which is a famous UFO case\nThere's also a reference to a needs a National Institute for discovery science which was\nThe organization that was studying skin Walker ranch in and several of the cattle mutilation that had happened in the winter basin\nAnd the circumstances where it looked like these cows had been dropped from the sky some of them disappeared altogether but some of them or their their legs were broken as if they'd been dropped from the sky several of your cases I thought the same thing in multiple missing poor woman books that looks like people are snatched down to the off the ground\nAnd then some of them are dropped back into these are odd locations little kids that are suddenly miles and miles away I it it seems like I Know you don't want to commit to\nAny particular explanation because you don't have enough evidence to a to point to one in particular but some of this stuff\nCertainly ventures into the area of the paranormal and um I wanted to share this with the audience that I don't know David how how closely you follow the UFO a topic I Know you sometimes you get into those subjects but\nIt's been an amazing nine or ten months a where all these documents are coming out about government studies of UFOs the Pentagon's ongoing interest and one of the stories that I was able to break earlier this year was about skin Walker ranch that a program that have been created by the Pentagon\nOr to look at UFOs also went much further that it it studied what we would call paranormal events unexplained mysteries at places like skin Walker ranch and elsewhere\nAnd I'm at Jeremy core bell is made a film about it and I included in that film and is a reference to our book which had been read in Washington it turns out an earlier this year I was invited to go back by Senator Harry Reid to meet with some people whose names I cannot cannot make public\nBut they uh they gave me sort of a download on the UFO mystery and what some of the research had uncovered and um and ... as well as additional information and some of that has been made public but the one of these guys pulled me aside\nHe had a had an ongoing interest in skin Walker ranch and other mysteries related to it and he asked uh ask me some questions about the ranch and then he said\nYou know we think that that guy de ... that um that his mystery with these missing people might be related to the phenomena at the ranch\nAnd I asked a couple of questions it didn't seem to have a real solid answer or not one that they would share with me\nBut the idea that the phenomenon that's been seen there which is sometimes playful and sometimes dangerous might be related to yours startled me and I don't know how you react to that but maybe it makes you uncomfortable or being associated with anything as weird as that but you're stuff's pretty weird too\nSo how would you rank this person and integrity on a topic like this\nUm I'd say this person that I'm Talking about knows more about it than anyone and I don't mean just in the military I mean anyone uh he's this person has seen a lot of stuff that the the public has never seen so\nYou know he he has a very broad spectrum and a very broad knowledge base about what we would call paranormal including UFOs and alleged abductions and things of that sort so\nI don't know exactly how your a phenomena fit in with a larger picture but\nThe idea that somebody has been looking at it is a I think that's pretty interesting\n[noise] well that's a wakeup call [noise] I think so um [noise]\nSo you know way back when we first started to talk about the ranch I really put an emphasis on that area\nTo see if there was anything related to disappear if I could think might come into the can related to the activity there [noise]\nAnd you know there's really nothing around that ranch that I could say is related to missing people that I study but ethics seated before sometimes I think\nI I relate it to law enforcement and if you have a say a series of bank robberies\nThe bank robbers are ever going to do a bank robbery in their neighborhood\nBecause they don't want to draw attention to it and I've always stayed at that I think that this is related to the profile points I I gave you one of those is water and when you look at Mississippi and Louisiana say it's your filled with water\nI have no cases from there\n[laughter] that's our\n... isn't George isn't there a lake fairly near that ranch\nYeah it's ... it's a reservoir it's called bottle hollow\nUm it's a manmade lake but the was right in the middle of the ... reservation to the ... ah control and property and they allow camping and fishing and swimming and things of that sort but at that lake is a a\n... has a long history of really weird stuff creatures have been seeing there and the objects coming in and out of the water and there but a lot of drowning said that uh the the ... tribe believes that ah there's something in the water that pulls you down a lot of people at Brown there and ah\nSo ... you're right I get asked all the time if there's anybody in the vicinity the ranch you meet your criteria who's banished like that and I have to say no\nOther than animals livestock things of that sort but no people have a banished then I Know of course we haven't really uh dug into the historical archives or to the extent that you have but I think that some of that work is being done right now\nAnyway it's uh it it was a it struck me as a significant that that the person who told me that in D.C had brought them\nYour books and and your subject matter I Want to try to get one more of these air disappearances in before the bottom of the break because I'm I think I'm going to open

want you to know and my second point before I tell you my experiences\nI'm encouraging you to read about the the Buddhist or teaching about these different types of creatures that live in proximity different dimensions but they can interact even thousands of years ago they talked about abductions but the Buddha\nTalked about what they look like what the Romans were like what they did anyway so I just encourage you to do that but here's the story this is true it it was before nine teen Ninety six I used to live in Rochester\nBut I was living in California I drove across the country many times I went to visit some friends in Rochester ah I'll Try and find out the exact date but right now I Can't I'm going to send you an email by the way I'll say I spoke to you\nOn the Appalachian Trail from Rochester to Philadelphia you there's ways to drive in many places in the Appalachian Trail you can pull off the road and just walk and take a nice walk on the trail and one time I did that in the afternoon\nAnd there was a a man or woman and a boy and a couple of other people walk in one direction and we started talking and walking within five minutes another family came from around al ... similar to me out of nowhere\nAnd there were picnic tables right near there and the one woman who I was very suspicious of that just appeared\nSaid Hi to the other one and she had a girl and this can our kids play and the the the people that I had been walking with the mother said yeah and we sat down at a picnic table and the the strange woman said to the other lady that I had been walking with what's your name\nThey they tell him that name and the woman says that's our name too\nAnd then about three minutes later the lady looks into boys gone and she starts calling them and I got up and I walk around and I swear to God I Am not making this up there\nWas a close creature over the boy the boy had passed out or I don't know if the creature bump them but this is the part I Want you to know it had kinda futuristic very tight fitting clothes it jumped this creature looked humanoid\nBut not totally human it jumped at least twenty feet from the ground without running jumped up to the the middle of a tree where the you know the branches start coming out\nAnd then I just turned around and I went back I didn't say a word I was scared I thought the creature and those people that are pure were part of the same group I thought they were military people and this creature was a genetic hybrid this is what I Believe\nWell that that's quite a story a David any reaction to that no one interesting\nKnow you do have some uh ask\nWell thank you for calling with that and the the other folks who are on the phone hang on because in the next hour or I'm going to be here I'm interacting with our our listeners and um and so folks have you have your own stories and theories and I'm all in and we'll we'll have plenty of time to chat in the next hour\nIn some of your books David and I'm not sure I don't remember an example here you you reference it about an earlier book in his new book um about the boulders and\nI was always wondering well heck there's boulders all over the place how can that relate to the missing persons a mystery you have a couple of cases where witnesses tell you why it it relates that these things sort of come alive um or they move right\n[noise] yeah I wrote a story in my last book one right before the about a story a Spanish priest in Texas that was running from Native American thing came up on this giant piece of cake granted in Texas it's a state park [noise]\nAnd he said that after you ran up to the top of the granted it opened up and swallow them\nAnd he said that he was inside the older gifts committed for three days and then he said at the end of the third day it's that amount and that's the only story I've got like that and uh people probably don't notice but there are stories of Iceland\nThat they will ... road when they're building it or they will blow up a piece of granite or big Boulder because they have a ... a nurse or friday that things are living inside of those over\nDave a polite is a missing for one one land air water is the

working there and ah one of the physicians explained has several people felt this dread and depression and anxiety and almost like\nFeeling like they're being stopped and in most cases they had put these people on let's see him in order to control their sentence settled\nA they attributed that situation and the experiences to the clinic and whatever\nYou know a influence that it's having on the
