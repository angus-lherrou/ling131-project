of planetary astronomy at caltech in Pasadena\nHere now back in twenty sixteen that he was confident there was a huge object ten to twenty times the mass of earth moving in a big looping orbit all the way to the word cloud\nPreventive brown simply called the planet nine because he's the astronomer they got Pluto knocked down to a dwarf planet after it had been the historic ninth planet of our solar system for decades\nIt was twenty three and professor brown that year discovered another dwarf planet he called error out in the hype rebelled and it was more massive than Pluto\nSo it was professor brown who argue that Pluto should be downgraded from the ninth planet in our solar system to adore planted in the ... belt that surrounds our solar system and he even wrote a book in twenty ten that was called how I Killed Pluto\nAnd why it had it coming\nWell when I first interviewed professor brown about the massive but still unseen planet nine he told me back then quote it is like chasing I'd go whatever is out there it's math is so great that it's gravitational field pushes\nHalf a dozen other hyper belt object to cluster together on the opposite side of planet nine huge looping orbit or at least where they think it orbits close quote\nNow that is why so far it is an indirect discovery it's now late twenty Eighteen after several tries at the hacking Subaru observatories in Hawaii defined planet nine invisible light and or infrared professor brown\nSays that it is quote till like chasing a go after more refined computer calculations he has reduced the expected math of this unseen planet can be only seven times more massive than earth\nAnd just a couple of weeks ago I checked in with him for an update on his search for this lose have planet nine or planted act that he uh is\nIt still trying to mine and he told me that he is\nPlanning another trip to Hawaii November first just in a week and this time he thinks there is a chance that he'll finally be able\nTo visually get to this big mysterious math because they've been working on computer refinement and for example he told me in a recent interview that calculations place this unseen body\nAbout five hundred times further than the distance from the earth to the sun\nSo that is putting it in a spot that is something like twenty times further than Neptune all good way out there but they had narrowed down the focus so yeah there were only going on November first started another surge because the new calculations\nPredict that planet nine is close to a constellation that can only be seen by American eyes in the winter\nHere now from the California Institute of technology's planetary sciences department in Pasadena, California is astronomy professor Michael Brown\nOr predictions are that the planet is in the region of the sky close to the constellation Orion which is one that everybody knows the constellation of Orion is a winter constellation that's when it's up in the sky that's when you can observe it most so we have to wait until the constellations up until the winter\nBefore we can start looking to where we think it is\nAnd in November what date will you start to remember first\nThat's not very far away what frequencies will you be looking in\nThe best way to search for this is actually just a visible wavelengths just like your eyes because so far as the brightest part that we think it's going to have is just the sunlight reflected off of its upper atmosphere and so we're just going to look right at what you would see just taking pictures with ... what about him for rent\nInfrared is actually is not going to be a very good one for searching simply because\nWe don't have any telescopes with really massive infrared detectors that can look at big areas of the sky at once once we find planet no and looking at it in the in for a study of will be very important but not probably the best way to look for\nIsn't it amazing that on this impact on the solar system perturbations and even tilting the playing of the solar system six degrees to the sun that he would be caused by an object out in the ... cloud that we can't even yet\nI think it's pretty fun to think about it we just don't know where to look it it'll be easy to see once we know exactly where to look I suspect and then once we see it then we will study it in detail was probably you know every large telescope on the earth will suddenly swing another direction so it would be quite exciting when it's finally found\nThis new planet nine is hypothesized to be five thousand times more massive than Pluto that you've got knocked down to a dwarf planet\nYeah so it's a good reminder of the difference between\nThings that are not real planets like Pluto and real planets sometimes people say oh this new planet nine it's just a little bit bigger than Pluto right and like ... it's five thousand times more massive this is what we mean when we say a planet and the other part of the solutions to\nWhen we last talked I think you had two categories where might just have come from why use this massive object all the way out to the edge of the type about going into the or cloud\nAnd you talked about possibly being captured rogue planet or any ... inside of our solar system where Neptune and urine is our but then he got knocked out my Saturn or Jupiter what do you think today\nI still favor the explanation that it came from inside our solar system and got knocked out by Jupiter Saturn but into we find it and know exactly what its orbit isn't exactly what its composition has\nAll of this was just speculation you can probably come up with so many different ideas to explain how I got there but once you find it I Hope will really start to learn why it's there and what it's made out of\nYou've been living with just now for three years do you have any sort of intuitive sense of what you could look like\nMy best guess is that it will look sort of like Neptune\nWe think it's a ... tune like planets just a little bit less massive than up to him and so it will be a gaseous atmosphere it probably won't have clones\nProbably too cold to have any close up in the atmosphere so in fact it might be quite bland a mostly just kind of\nGray is white atmosphere with no features of it but it's easy to speculate that we're almost always surprised when we find real objects and so the one thing but I Know for sure is that there will be things about it that we never even thought about that are completely president\nExactly how far from earth to where you think this object is\nWe think is about five hundred times further distance than the distance from the earth to the sun so that puts it it's something like twenty times further than up to him for example so it's a good way out there\nAnd use that a quarter of a light year\nOh no it's not even close to a quarter like ... it's about two and a half light days\nTwo and a half light games from earth is that the border between the rebels and your cloud\nWell that's actually really good question to which we now don't know the answer before we realized that there is a planet out there we thought we knew about the ...\nBut now that there is a planet where that border we thought was now we're less sure because we don't know what is beyond that planet and we don't quite yet know how that planet is affecting what

extreme floods extreme key they become much more common in the future and can have devastating consequences\nRight now what her computer models showing to do is have you worked on the ... the report\nAbout what we can expect say in North America in just the next decade because we've already reached another half degree warmer and it's projected that we may go up to two\nIt could be substantially worse than even those the stuffed them\nBut the politics of the planet don't seem to be supporting dramatic reduction in the greenhouse gases in fact it seems that some of the larger nations the United states included\nMy adding poll now to an industry that we thought had ended\nThat we are going to be contributing ourselves to increasing amounts of greenhouse gases and accelerating the amount of warming so that we would be ourselves pushing the needle on the computer models in which there is even more rapid warming\n... unfortunately you've put your finger on my guess is that the politicians assume that the problems will only become more severe once they're out of office\nAnd so if they are thinking of the next two to four to six years which just or most of the political offices\nThan they are assuming that they can cope with that shorter period of time and it will be somebody else's problem I ... or two decades from now\nMeanwhile we're facing the fact that there will probably be a lot of people who are going to be forced out of homes and houses and what is the United states in the world going to do with what has to be future migration away from coastline\nCertainly there will be in fact already are places that are having to be abandoned both on the east coast around the Alaska due to rising sea levels and that will only continue to get worse we will have an increasing number of domestic migrants\nBut it's really the developing countries where their farm or people susceptible where they are likely to be enormous numbers affected by the level rise and forced to migrate as their\nCities become habitable and that's really one of the things that the report highlights where you've got ... of such migrants at one point five degrees but you had many tens of additional climate refugees as you grow up to two degrees\nAnd that will be a problem for all the wealthy countries because naturally wants to go somewhere where there are better prospects and so I think we can expect North America and Europe and parts of Asia to see lots of migrants coming from low on issues\nAnd in fact I think we've already been seeing that in Europe that part of the reasons for the Syrian civil war and intense drought all of the migrants that were coming up to Europe after that which led to\nA lot of the crises fair\nSo doesn't that mean that there

audience that is growing around the world from my work and they like um my YouTube channel\nWell three weeks ago and October third I was doing update on three category [laughter]\nHad it with a very distressing subject how cat had a cat\nAround the world like\nWeird and Scotland Yard trying to get away with announcing that it was closing down its investigations after three years because they were trying to force people to believe that it was thought in a car wreck kill and that wasn't going over well with the u._k. population at all\nAnd then I was also doing an update about the sunspot solar observatory shut down I had received a whistle blower email saying that are actually uh the child pornography was just funny deflection that he actually involve the Chinese infiltrate or who had hacked\nTo the observatories computers in order to spy on the sensitive white sands missile range in Harlem and air force base of the ... down below the solar observatories nine thousand two hundred foot peak and then the third update had evolved from my asking my profiles YouTube channel audience\nOn September twelfth if anyone had young childhood memories of floating out of body\nSpecifically I was asking for ages four to six approximately\nAnd I had received a huge number of emails\nAnd a lot of people were saying they never told anyone this before and this is what I was talking about\nWhen the next morning on October fourth Laurie Moriarty who manages my are filed social media emailed me that a fan saw something weird happened in the video of the a stream the live stream\n[noise] so I saw a video that Laurie sent me that was slowed down it was weird or I sent the puzzle to a photo shop a video and also I've worked with for years\nAt first I thought maybe it was an insect was over on a ... like something coming through the window up to the top of a book show\nAnd he did a video loop that you can see right now all of this at a my er files report what are the smoky fog sometimes linked to afterlife returns you can see the whole story and you can see these videos which are really strange\nAnd the reply that I got back from the photo shop analyst was that he thinks this is truly anonymous\nAnd uh then I asked a that second week I asked my earth files YouTube channel audience if anyone had ever seen smoky fog like what was in my office\nAnd believe it or not a second I'm One of these whatever they are came between my hands and up to my right shoulder\nOn October seventeenth adding to the mystery of what is coming in and out of my office and uh people began writing me emails about their own experiences with the smoky fog is it like ...\nI Do not know this is extremely a translucent and uh when I started reading the letters\nI began to see how heart felt that there were people who were telling me they had never mention any of this parrot to loved ones to children to parent\nNone they but but I started receiving these emails and one came from a a he had been a retired airline ticket agent and his name he gave me permission to use is Charles hazard\nAnd he uh let me say he said you can use my name and that I'm now from Sun City center Florida but what you're going to hear took place in Arkansas in two thousand and eight\nThinking about all of this is provoked by two episodes of a strange smoky fog\nIn my office when I was working in live stream and that's what provoked him and hear now is Charles hazard uh talking about what happened to him in two thousand and eight from his now Sun City center Florida ...\nThis was in the spring of two thousand in age and I was preparing that morning for a group to come in the next day I was mowing the lawn sure the camp area on a riding mower\nAnd cleaning up the facility things of that nature so\nAt the end of the day after dinner I was ready to go to bed as soon as the sun went down I was very tired\nSo after shower and I got into bed it was dark by that time I Can't remember about what time it was maybe eight thirty in the evening\nI got into bed with the poverty level my show and just lay there and looked outside the leaves on the trees were not fully out yet so I had a very good view of the night sky with stars that I can see\nAnd then suddenly I just I was getting ready to close my eyes and suddenly I opened them again and\nThrough the window I can see this misty gray ball drifting in through the window and I was just mesmerized but the thing about it was it in this dark bedroom it was luminous\nAnd I could see the light within it and it was three dimensional was swirling in slowly kept coming towards me it looks like it's coming right for my head\nAnd I was just frozen with fascination of I didn't know what to think and then as it reached my forehead I could see in my mind by three

like I was just super human genius or something that had all the answers to everything in the universe was indescribable\nIt's really difficult to explain it felt like to me it wasn't for now\nAt that

sort of an afterlife\nI Would like to share with you and our coasts audience an example of one of the many emails that I have been getting tonight and this is an indication\nTo the quality and the heart felt and the profound emails that I had been receiving and these various categories\nHaving to do with out of body or what the fog is and here I Want to read this came just a few minutes ago\nListening to you on the coast\nTo coast while writing this my father was very involved with World War two Pearl Harbor Hawaii survivors during his life\nHe passed away on December seventh two thousand and nine and was buried on December seventh before his burial I was sorting things out in his home office with his caregiver\nHe lived in this home for almost six years which I currently still on the news do not live there\nWhile sorting out his items I was looking through the open door\nIn the laundry area hallway adjacent back door I saw a very fast thin moving horizontal Smokey grey fog go straight through the back door without it being opened up it went through the door\nI did mention this to my wife son daughter in some close friends I Am an open minded conscious oriented person\nBut I Need it we feeling was my dad showed me his spirit was leaving the home for good I Would have never expected to see the gray color I would've normally thought it would have been associated with something negative but he was a very positive person\nI have come to the conclusion that whatever part or level of his body consciousness soul left the house may have been more like the gross more earthly matter in its purest form I had never heard the words smoky fog until you offered them\nLast night and this is what it's been in my own office and I have wondered if it relates to a beloved cat that I lost a year ago and that that to the young ones the big furry ones that everybody loves chocolate and fluffy now\nI just keep wondering that it had been that cat that I Love so much a or I have a cousin\nWho passed the about four months ago she was Ninety six years old sharpest attack even a passing it was her body they gave out a she always said that she would try to show me that she has survive\nOn my mom and dad have been gone for a long time but\nYou never know because I really do think that this foggy smoke that you can find Google when you start Googling foggy smoke you will see amazing photographs\nOr that resemble what has been in my office and if it is something from another dimension trying to come and get my attention and the YouTube channel I Wonder why have you ever encountered this George\nNo I haven't heard something like the ... these are magnificent stories in emails I but I Do get a lot of emails from people who have had similar experiences yeah there's something very strange going on and you can't\nYou cannot rule alone the fact that it's real yeah humor Lou don't\nYes and that profound I'm going to be doing an entire series and may one of my uh end of November coast\nI think it's going to be with at least two of the people who have had childhood uh separating body and that's the question is it the very soul that leaves the body how could that be\nIf it is not the sole that needs to animate the container organic body what part is it\nThat is moving out from the body in out of body travel\nAnd there are all kinds of explanation in ancient Egypt Egypt about there being nine parts to the body and the so complex but we don't even acknowledge our soul in the western world and it probably is the most important part of us\nAnd when you go back to your ages four or five and six and you read these extraordinary emails coming from people who say in their opening sentences\nI have never told a single human being in my life\nAnd I am now provoked from listening to your asking the question on your YouTube channel have any of you at age four to six\nDo remember an out of body because that is significant where was the learning\nThere was nobody teaching this is something that must be spontaneous training of the soul in a new body container\nWould you buy I sent you an email I think you've got to make sure you follow up for this

extraordinary thing twice\nThat it's come to the office\nI have not felt anything negative I Do think that people who have been saying that it falls more likely in the category of a loved one love down a little something coming back and then the issue is what\nWould be the conditions in the latter world that we live hand and all of our busy knows\nWhat would be the conditions that would provoke
