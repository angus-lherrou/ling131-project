{"month": "10", "state": "TX", "station": "KTRH", "content": "Pretty evident from the polling that has now come out is within days or so since all of that ... that process finished\nThat the polls are moving now or in the Republican's direction and a lot of these races around the country punch ample a real good example is in Tennessee but sort of toys\nIn Tennessee where a month ago the Democratic candidates a ... a former governor there or was leading in the ...\nUh against Marsha Blackburn a Republican congressman a Republican candidate for the Senate and he was ahead buck viewpoints and all the polls in that race this week you saw all of that the New York times to they'd had black or an Eighteen points I mean just a huge sea change in our yeah\nA North Dakota senatorial race Heidi Heitkamp as we are a little bit of a she was three or four points up last month and most of the old now she's to him talk which down a bit of it so that it's a big big shift\nThe other Senate races in Arizona Nevada and even here in Texas ball trending Republicans wiping Missouri\n... different than what is the what is the cabinet or a fact that you know what's the meat and potatoes that it is it\nThat often I it was a very negative public reaction to it all the protest you're standing up and screening during the hearing ... and all the\nCrazy protest actually what went on the go to the Supreme Court or a a big group of protesters occupy that should it all to the office building people getting arrested in ... screaming and yelling all over television for two weeks\nAnd how that can seem a little interest in Charlotte ... yeah well you know I mean we're we we are a country that you do have the right to do that but\nThere's also a decency factor and we're not that kind of country that you see those things going on and people are getting hurt and you know you it's okay to have that difference of opinion and we all should have the right to have a difference of opinion we do have that right but you do it in a respectful calm manner\nUm I I guess that's probably the best way of\nPutting that at all you did a legal better I mean a lot of people don't understand is it's it's a violation of federal law to the big group of people who go to a federal law which building is shut it down like they do that so\nIt it really is getting out of hand and it's it's definitely getting at ... ... ... it's getting to be a scary place so I'm hopefully everybody comes down\nThe elections um I Want to take two quick questions are only get two questions to you where's the balance going to and do you think in the election day in D.C who who comes out victorious on that and then is there a blue wave still coming to Texas [laughter] okay\nWell up out after the ... you know my outlook has managed their remains the Republicans are going to gain\nFour to five seats in the Senate ah lived up to fifty father fifty six shades majority in the Senate and that the Democrats will gain seats in the house but not enough to get a majority I could look you're going to gain\nA with a real tree hundred and five seats in the house of representatives will pick up to end the fifteenth street stole or the Republicans will still have a majority club here in Texas though there is no blue eye\nAnd are you sure because everybody's thinking there's a blue wave coming if you're listening to the Democratic party [laughter] yeah\nWell I Am of course a lot of the news media was dropping in there for the post nine months of the year but the kind of stop knowledge is there are a lot of them are

R. H. and I are draining out\n[noise] [noise]\nOkay welcome back to coast to coast that me tell you about our special guest tonight three hours Benjamin ... charted financial analyst a certified public accounting but\nHis professional backward includes not only money management for high net worth individuals and money management he is a noted author of the underground best seller the day of the lord is at hand Benjamin wrote\nIn Nineteen Ninety six as a warning to America\nThat a time of crisis was coming upon our nation including a stock market collapse currency collapse terrorism ultimately war and we're going to be talking with him about the new tactics of global war and then also the day of the lord is at hand\nWhich is biblical prophecy Benjamin welcome back it's been a long time\nWell thank you for them back if you counted that history of the topics of the my first appearance in two thousand and three twelve years ago George number of the topics are mainstream news or have now happened to America\nThey sure have as much promised each other Benjamin we're not going to let twelve years go by again before your back on\nWell I appreciate that because I really enjoy the program that was with our ballot back in in the olden days but it it's great to be back and we sure do have a lot to cover my\nGosh we should do when you look at what's happening in you know your title the show appropriate the new tactics of global war isn't that what ISIS is doing\nAnd right now Benjamin they are a piece on the chessboard George\nIt do you think about it there are a number of players that are on positioning for their piece\nOf the new world order they want their day in the sun and I see I Would say they're one of the pond is being moved and there's a lot of speculation are they why are they black or they read you know which color is ISIS today that's an interesting question we can get into in the interview\nAnd you know also who aren't they they just seem to be popping up all over the place\nWell it's a really interesting amalgamation of a essentially a number of tribal factions that are all radicalized Islam is who have come together to create the Islamic state of the violent you know ... is our um\nImposter and she would call them\nAnd yet they operate as a trained army\nAnd they're not just a bunch of uh unemployed\nOr Arabs from Syria and Iraq these guys are organized they've taken heavy weapons which were abandoned by Iraqi and American forces and they're operating them skillfully they produce and export oil this is a mini Mike Rowe state that has formed\nOut of what appeared to be a grass roots\nOrganization but the truth is nothing of this magnitude ever rises from the grassroots level there are states sponsors that are using ISIS\nLike a chess master would use a ... on on the chessboard\nAbsolutely and I wonder if ISIS most of them I Wonder if they even realized Benjamin you they know their pawns\n[noise] well I think the term is youthful idiot and I think [laughter]\nI unfortunately there are a lot of people fighting for various causes that are really under the illusion of propaganda you know they want to die for God king and country and they're really serving in the various agenda without realizing it because\nIt at the end of the day everybody does what they believe in so people first have to be convinced to believe in a lie\nAnd so it is with ISIS but they are very ... ferry is no doubt I mean have you seen such brutality it's almost any human the way they treat humanity\nThe latest report I saw just a few days ago that apparently they are harvesting human origins and selling them on the marketplace\nYeah I'm\nIn sometimes wonder if that's what you were being deceived and misled would that kind of propaganda I'm not sure sometimes\nWell there's no doubt a propaganda war that's in place between the various factions in you know you want to look bigger picture or who are the players involved in this game well in the west we have of course the United states\nAnd our allies in NATO Western Europe and there is a bit of a division or fracturing that's occurring at this point between the western alliance\nBut it's still led by the Americans\nAnd then of course you've got the Russians and the communist powers China's supporting Russia's military adventure in Syria there are obviously allies\nAnd then Russia is of course an ally of Iran and the Assad regime which is really a a sort of a puppet state of the Soviet former Soviet Union I should say\nYou know I never really was a very impressed with the name change George\nI'm because what happened in the former Soviet Union was um\nIn many ways a very well orchestrated it was a wag the dog kind of event ensure there was a reality to the collapse of the Warsaw Pact and and the disintegration of the evil empire\nBut if if the Soviet Union really did collapse and and became a legitimate democracy why was no one ever arrested\nFor all the crimes of humanity and why did the Communist Party stay in power and control of all the world and why was the KGB allowed to basically changed the name on the building to be\nA continuing operation as if nothing changed at all\nYou when you wrote in Ninety six Benjamin and warned America allowed to come in crises the stock market issue the collapse of the currency terrorism and we'll get into all war what did you see we're these events happened what did you see about terrorism stock market collapsed currency collapse\nWell I had seen in more of a global top level view all of these events and of course they didn't\nNobody could imagine the details of something like ISIS arising out of the crisis of the middle east\nBut I had understood through my professional career the geo political balance of power I was a money manager and part of being a money managers understanding the forces that are driving the\nEconomy and investment returns and the various sectors and you have to give some consideration to the geopolitics to the economic and ultimately the military balance of power because these things have an effect on the performance of the economy\nSo I had some insight in understanding into the players I'd also spent most of my life since a young teenager studying diligently Bible prophecy and reading everything I could get my hands on\nIn terms of the subject a Bible prophecy and so I was really trying to piece together ... together in my mind\nThe prophecies of the Bible which are pretty clear in terms of the events that would take place in what is called the end of the age\nAs well as an understanding of the the real players\nI'm In the current world system and I had spent a brief career in military intelligence I was an order of battles specialist trained to study the Russian military I was a specialist in the middle east sector I'd spent considerable time on the ground in the middle east\nI ended up going to graduate school in the middle east I studied the middle east conflict at the graduate level as well as his part of the intelligence community so you know I had a pretty good working knowledge of what was going on\nAnd I also understood the prophecies are the scripture to some degree so I I guess I I saw the big picture if you will I knew one day we would see a major war\nAnd as a financial analyst an expert in the housing space I knew we were a in a huge housing bubble I understood the and carry trade and they were doing this massive inflation and us financial assets that you know these bubbles\nUltimately pop sure\nIn two thousand three I was warning on this program we were going to see a major housing crash and at the time it seemed ludicrous because housing was\nThe only game in town\nYou were four years ahead of the game\nAnd that's one of the problems of being able to see the fundamental trends is there you know you always see these things a little bit early and who can ever really imagine or estimate how big the bubble can get\nWhen you when you went through ... years\nEarly but the housing market popped and today George we're in an economy that is supposedly six years into a recovery or an expansion in which we cannot raise interest rates\nActually had only lightly and getting by stopping traffic from Scarborough will be adding about two minutes to your troubles ... windows dot com twenty four hour

to coast to coast George ... would you along with Benjamin Benjamin we're talking about Russia and go back into the biblical process you with that in there that's always concerned me\nWell Russia is there and the beer is going to be used to attack there's prophecies in the Bible in his ... thirty eight that talk about an invasion of Israel is time at the end from a great power to the north along with an alliance many kings\nOf course north of Israel is Moscow in Russia\nAnd some would argue the prophecies of God get mad dog pertain to turkey or the Islamic countries\nBut the major terrorist states in the Arab world our satellites of Russia Iran and Syria are the main terrorists powers and\nSo Russia's been behind the scenes from the beginning George the KGB created Arab terrorism as a third wave sort of a a fifth column to be used against the west\nAnd\nThey stirred up the natural animosity for the\nArab world against Israel in America by publishing this information works in\n[noise] they were the authors and publishers of a book called the protocols of The Elders of Zion\nI remember that just pure propaganda\nAnd it out it presents the\nIsraeli and Jewish people is behind a world conspiracy to create a new world order and and bring all of Christian them under the control of the anti Christ as if it's all being orchestrated from Tel Aviv and that the United states\nOf America is just a puppet of Israel that men on the street in the Arab world this propaganda is acceptable to him and so you know it fanned the flames of\nOf the hatred of Israel and and the hatred of the United states and into the Russians were able to\nBasically shape and direct the various Arab terrorist organizations most and most of the leadership of al ... was trained by KGB ISIS today has military officers in it that are KGB officials\nBaked into the cake ... this is already in the oven it's only a question of when the financial crisis hits and it's not very far off\nWe bailed out a General Motors we bailed out a A R G insurance we bailed out many banks can we afford to do that again\nNo um we took the federal the national debt from well roughly about eight trillion to today's Seventeen Eighteen trillion dollars no we have um\nWe bankrupt the country and bailing out the criminals and you know the the whole thing was a sham because\nIt was a robbery was had to bail out it was a bank robbery\nThey literally Rob the American people blind and they're going to handle the American middle class but losses because you know there's a you run a short little pad as part of your um intro to the show and you talk about the coup d'etat around the murder of\nKennedy Kennedy and then the question is who really run this country and where are they taking us and it's true that's an excellent ad there was a coach top secret couldn't talk Kurd and who really rises country the shadow bankers the the elite behind the shadow banking system\nAre they in the ones making this the road to war at this\nPoint I was gonna say they're the ones that want us to go to war\nAbsolutely because they don't want you to the country George they want a global government they want the whole world\nAnd they would sacrifice some US cities to achieve that goal wouldn't they\nThey'll kill two hundred and fifty million Americans without even thinking about it\nAnd they no shame\n[noise] they view people as property they think we have five billion too many people on the planet anyway and the Americans are going to be a problem they have this idea of freedom and they're really not going to give it up\nOne wants to Benjamin that you saw which 'cause I I'm sure you went through school and college in training you didn't think this way something changed you what was\nWell candidly I met the Lord Jesus Christ when I was a fourteen years old and somebody told me you could actually meet him and I'm not talking about religion I really got saved and I met the real king of the universe and\nHe actually answered me when I pray and I heard him with my ears\nAnd I began to walk with the lord and circle forward by the mid eighties started explaining Bible prophecy to me and then circled forward again by the time I was running money I was a professional money manager in the mid nineties praying about the stock market because I had\nLarge dominant money I was responsible for George\nI ask the lord show me the end of this matter I was thinking about the stock market he\nTranslated me out of my living room into the future and I saw this coming upon America I've been there I've already seen it and then when he brought me back to my living room he changed my life if you got to show me\nHow it's all explained to tell revealed and Bible prophecy because the prophecies of scripture are sealed until the time at the end all of the man who tried to get the proper interpretation maybe they made their best guesses but they didn't\nPuns slowly but they're all probably should wait for the second half of the\nProgram we really need to get back to Russia and the road to World War three\nCouple of minutes we have been traveling out now how did I find out so much about the Russians strategies for World War three\nWell back in two thousand and one my book the damn lord of the hand became fairly popular I'd been a national tour\nA man named Jeffrey night quiz had read my book had contacted me and we'd be kind of dialogue by email and this was in the summer of two thousand and one and I had a dream\nUp in the middle of the night I saw the act by commercial aircraft from United in American Airlines and I thought we were hacked by four points to from United to from American and then I saw the nuclear war\nAnd I in this dream George I was catching the fall out of my hand I was in North of LA Southern California basically been destroyed\nA nuclear attack and I woke up and Jeff with on line and what a nightmare that is yeah\nI knew it was a prophetic dream he gave me it's on every call me and we got on the phone for the first time and I play in the dream and I asked him could Russia disguise or bombers to look like United in American airline\nYou know that that that can happen and I don't understand it but we're about to be attacked by United Airlines will start the next warning Benjamin that sounds rather crazy\nI Know it does but it's going to happen in and then I asked me if you ever seen far before no well you described it perfectly I had no idea what it looked like but I mean the real followed in my dream [noise]\nGeorge jak miss my dreams lots of people have dreams you know\nLater on the morning and nine eleven the first plane hit he remembered I told him or aircraft to harm United from American and as you go at a course my credibility with chap when we became very good friend in here twelve years later\nI'm after we both on a number of things trying to wake up the American people I call Jeff on the job we need to do a book but tell the American people exactly what's going to happen to them for the people that don't understand Bible prophecy or\nAre perhaps they're skeptical and couldn't rent a lot of Charlotte and adult ticket and most of them are looking for money or you know whatever their their own agenda and so there's a lot of fraud there's a lot of there's a lot of garbage\nAnd a lot of scare as the Bible so I understand people saying you know that's how I mean we can dismiss it let's talk about the reality on the ground what's really happening inside Russia and what is ahead for America and let's get them to prove your cat\nAnd the evidence of this book it's all geo political analysis\nAnd it's it's frightening if you're an American\nBenjamin we're going to come back in a

events which is our outlined in scripture\nSo let us you didn't do some of the biblical process you know the entire planet does it just for the United states which of downloads\nFor the whole world George although the United states is number one you know the greatest nation ever right\nWe're proud of the fact that we're number one and we know it so you know in many ways God's starts with a country on the top of the list good old USA Today which in times past ours was a great country we've sort of lost our way have and\nWe were sure\nYou know if you don't mind I'd like to take maybe two minutes and just put a rap on on Russia discussion of the global the new tactics of global war okay I was and it leads us right into the prophecies of of Russia and you know\nThis is just a brief acts are sort of the the spirit of the book\nThe Cold War officially ended in Nineteen Ninety One with the collapse of the Soviet Union the experts in the west were convinced\nThat America's economic might had exhausted the Soviets and the resolve of the Reagan Era had broken their will to fight capitalism had proved to the world both freedom and prosperity could be delivered America had withstood the challenge of communism\nAnd prevailed the lights of the shining city on a hill never glowed brighter\nThe west was exuberant in those days capitalism and the American way of life had triumph and the spoils of war would be divided among us all in the form of a peace dividend\nThe media joined the chorus fanning on national celebration we were told it was the end of history and the beginning of a new era of permanent peace and prosperity\nThere were dissenting voices that had warned all is not well but these warnings were marginalized and simply ignored the west was told\nA fake collapse of the Soviet Union had been planned for years but\nMainstream media discredited these warnings is merely conspiracy theory no one seemed to care the communist had given up the rotten little empire and that was all the west needed to know\nThe thought that the collapse of Russia was a clever chest move in a much larger strategic game seemed impossible\nBus the idea was simply derided\nEducated opinion in the west accepted the collapse of the Soviet Union as spontaneous an authentic what was going to happen at the end of this chess game could not be prevented\nOver twenty five years have passed since the fall of the Berlin Wall the vacuum of power which was created by the collapse of the Soviet Union has led our world rather than to an era of permanent peace and prosperity\nBut to the brink of an actual World War\nRussia merely appeared to embrace democracy but nothing of the sword ever really occurred instead Russia has developed an entirely new class of weapons which no other nation on earth possesses today and his arming itself to the teeth the reports of the demise of the Soviet Union\nAnd the end of the communist threat\nAppear now at best have been greatly exaggerated\nBut in truth there were an intentional deception of the west\nAlthough the intelligence services of the Soviet era the KGB was renamed\nFederal security service or FSB\nIt facilitated the rise of power a lot of ... former KGB officer proving the security service from is very much in power in the new Russia\nThe new tactics of global war present the truth of what really happened in Russia\nAnd the grand strategy of its leaders taking them inside the mind of the men who play this chess game of lives and deception and it's so doing revealing for you the mind of the beast and behold another piece the second like a bear raised itself up\nAnd it was set up into it a rise and devour much flash and George that is exactly the communist have done and what they're planning to do\nIt is a brutal evil empire as Ronald Reagan said this is an evil empire and they've relied primarily on lies and deception which have been very successful\nThey seem to be having Americans very sympathetic to them now let's just my impression\nWhy it it's part of the propaganda because they need to win the political war at this point the\nRussian communists alliance can just see the United states in an all out conventional war because we are basically vulnerable to a surprise attack\nOur land based ICBMs or not even armed with active warheads most Americans don't study military bounce power we stopped producing nuclear warheads back in the early Nineteen nineties because the Cold War was over in George we won or sold the Russians told us\nAnd so for almost Twenty years we didn't produce new nuclear warhead in this country well they have a shelf life\nAnd they're no longer reliable after Fifteen to Twenty years so we don't have enough nuclear warheads fraud delivery systems today all of our best stuff is on the tried and submarines our strategic air command bombers George there on three airbase as they can be liquidated in a matter of minutes\nAre treading submarines don't even have the launch codes\nThose schools have to be transmitted either the sub chapter surface or we have to use extreme long wave radio transmissions set of bounce off the ionosphere\nThe airplanes to broadcast that frequency are all on one island in the Indian Ocean those planes are taken out those subs have to surface to air their fleet can be eliminated by three air bases\nThe Glenn base ICBMs are sitting ducks and the ... don't have a trigger mechanism we we don't get off\nA shot George and they can launch cruise missiles off our coast there will be detonating over our coastal cities in a matter of minutes\nThey have X ray weapons that can detonate in space they will blackout how early distant warning satellite system all will know is nor at will see their computer screens go dark we won't know if it was a sunspot technical malfunction\nFor the next twenty two minutes there'll be scrambling ignored it trying to figure out what happened until the centers will register at ground based detonation inside the continental United States\nThey won't know if it was another act of Arab terrorism because the previous nuclear detonation on our soil using suitcase bombs we lived in blamed on Arab terrorists\nThey'll be trying to figure out who detonated the latest ground burst wouldn't NORAD will be vaporized in Seoul all the other remaining military assets of this country\nThan its toast the United states is going to be defeated but the American people will survive\nFollowing the defeat of the United states which is described in Bible prophecy in is he killed

an economic collapse\nThat will appreciate the war it will be followed by martial law once martial laws imposed no doubt there'll be some form of a gun grabbing some form of a national vaccination\nProgram that will be resisted in various regions will have something similar to the civil war occurring we may see several states attempt to secede from the union the dollar will begin to waver our ability to project to economic and military power will begin to erode\nAnd then the war will come\nAnd then the final phases George there's going to be a period known as great terror in which there would be a worry of terrorist incidents in a two or three maybe four week window of time\nThat will culminate in attacks against our communications infrastructure satellite up links will be disrupted the phones to go down the T. V. won't work the power will be out and it's not going to come back on for several days that your final warning people\nThat the ICBMs are ready to fly\nSo get ready but back to the gym for the lord George it's such a huge topic can you know men have been writing and talking and you know giving their best guess about Bible prophecy ever since the first prophetic books were written\nAnd we got on the phone and I began to speak with him on the telephone asking questions about climate change and George they kept answering me by saying I really can't discuss that on the telephone I had about a thirty minute phone call with this P. H. D. in which for the most part he told me he can't talk on the telephone\nI finally in frustration said look is there any way we can meet in person\nAre you ever in Southern California because I have business in in the Southern California region we ended up meeting in Los Angeles we spent ten hours in a conference room in downtown LA\nStarted at nine in the morning broke for lunch and dinner we finished nine at night I took pages and pages of notes they went through the detail of climate change this is classified science data here's basically what's happening George\nThere is an external energy source outside of our solar system\nIt is a neutron star it is in the vicinity of the Ryan constellation it is Thirteen hundred light years from our earth\nAnd its radiating our solar system with both cosmic and gamma radiation highest forms of radiation that radiation has weaken the heliosphere which is a protective shield around the entire solar system the heliosphere has shrunk about twenty five percent\nAllowing all of this X. journal radiation into the solar system the effect of which is destabilizing the sun and impacting every planet on the solar system every planet is experiencing a warming in its core\nThis radiation is actually heating up the core of our earth\nAs the core of the earth heats up the magma fields expand and\nAs the magma fields expand the pressure on the Titanic play is increasing as that pressure increases there's more and more volcanic activity and greater and greater earthquakes at the same time the molten core the\nLiquid iron in the core of our earth which is spinning creating the magnetic field around our earth which is a magnetic shield\nThat shield is weakening allowing even greater amounts of energy both solar energy from our son an external energy from outside the solar system even greater amounts are being absorbed in to the ecosystem of the earth causing a positive feedback mechanism\nChina's said during the Winter Olympics don't worry about the weather folks we can change that we can all through that wasn't that a governmental admission that they're playing around with the weather\n[noise] the the major world powers all have climate change technology I mean it's not that complicated when you can project high intensity beam energy we can you know it's like turning up the heat in the ... do\nThe climate system is a system that operates on storm all exchange you build a huge microwave generators\nYou can increase the heat and increase the volatility of the climate system yeah but at the same time there is ex journal energy that is affecting the solar system [laughter] George our moon is developing an atmosphere right now\nThey don't tell us these things but this is a scientific fact the moon is developing is sodium based atmosphere sodium gases accumulating around them\nOn earth\nChanges on our planet are simply incredible from the magnetic field weakening and there are actual breaches in the magnetic field\nThat over the African continent and and at times over the very south of South America there is a gaping hole opening up in the magnetic field where\nDangerous amounts of radiation are now coming through the sun\nIt's so it's your radiance level is noticeably increase [laughter] being measured\nBy our scientific community it's not being shared with the general public [noise]\nChange in our ecosystem is so profound George there's a new type of lightening\nThat is now beginning to her on the earth known as red Sprite or blue jet lightning and the lightning is occurring during hundred storms when conventional lightning generated by the thunder cloud and\nGo down there at the same time the bride and the blue jet lightning emanates from the top of the thunder cloud\nAnd goes all the way up to the eye on the air out playing with the cosmic gamma radiation that is emanating from our son\nBut if we're playing around with whether you're Russia's doing it if China's doing it in ... and maybe a few other countries right it's affecting the entire planet\nYes it is kind of like um [noise] you know a a while they're mad really\nI mean it's like Russian roulette with them because really in the end it become and or a box I mean this is so complex how do we know what we're going to unlock\nThe exact with you on a leash all kinds of things that way\nAnd and then he said we are we

calls Benjamin on the back of the book the day of the lord is at hand you're right about prophecy and nine eleven was September eleventh that tragedy the capitalist court and times do you think\nOh yeah it was a it was a mystical day it was all it is and and it was the beginning of a town of our costs\nKnow it's interesting George because eleven years prior on nine eleven in Nineteen Ninety then President George Bush\nStood up and this was in the context of Iraq's invasion of Kuwait\nAnd he declared a new world order was coming and these actions were part of a mystical mystery religion\nWhere they needed to act out the symbolic she of the new the temple of Hercules kind of an aircraft which will be built in following the war and the ... that they represent the three mystical numbers of eleven twenty to thirty three\nAnd the first number represents\nThe unveiling of what's hidden in the darkness and that's what President Bush did on September eleventh Nineteen Ninety nine eleven years later to the day of September eleventh two thousand and one flight eleven hit the twin towers in in in ... inaugurated the event\nThat was the beginning of the action representing the number twenty two and they're looking for the completion the calving of the cornerstone following twenty twelve and that work must be completed by twenty six team\nSo we're headed right into it it's these days really are about to come upon us\nI Wish we could change it stopped\nWell we can change we can change it in terms of the effect on our own lives\nThere will be people that are gonna be in a sense immune if you will or protected or we can't change what's going to happen because the Bible prophecy will come at the appointed time according to scripture and least time have been appointed they've been fixed this there is fixed as the rotation of the stars\nEllie sure okay let's take some calls here for your Benjamin they are lining up for you Scott as the first time caller Columbus, Montana Hi Scott thanks for calling go ahead\nOh thank you Mr nor a and a um stir broke I got to tell you I got into the a card and I'd come home from work and I heard the end of the signs you were saying to watch for a before the ICBMs coming\nI'm shaking I've been telling people about this for years especially the erosion from within and nobody seems to want to notice it\nAnd I personally live in Columbus, Montana which is about Ninety miles from Yellowstone so you don't have enough time to get on the front porch to watch the ... cloud come in if you know what I mean [noise] but um I Want to know\nWhat it is we can do in the meantime what can we do to protect ourselves I think that most of it's out of our hands as far as preventing but what can we do to help our own selves\nWell the more people wake up and the more people who take action\nThe better prepared our families in our communities will be the events that are coming are going to change the world as we know it and in many ways the the normal\nAmerican lifestyle will be over the we live in the days of ease they are ending soon so in the natural we can prepare by\nProvision ing and by by getting ready for a time of of national crisis of food shortages of water shortages and ultimately of war\nBut in the spiritual realm these events are in fact the judgment of almighty God so to ultimately prepare properly we have to\nTurn to the lord people have got to wake up to the reality we live in a spiritual world it's not just the material world there is a God in heaven who created\nThis university created this planet and he created mankind\nAnd we will all given account to him and the day of accounting is coming upon the earth the great day of God's judgment and it says in the book of revelation well under the inhabitants of the earth for the day of God's judgment is come but there's still a chance\nGod still hold out the author of peace in mercy and forgiveness to mankind provided were willing to repent of arson and turn to the lord and call and the name of Jesus Christ which is the one name whereby we may be safe\nYou know I've always told people you know put some ... way too for the future I don't know how long you can do it but you gotta have some water food just enough to hold on in case just in case\nA lot of this has to be prepared I just it's so here's another question Benjamin and may be the big one ...\nWhy is this such a hateful Maureen planet\nBecause of sin because of the evil of men because men would rather please themselves than love their neighbor\nAnd greed greed yes absolutely because of the evil that's in the heart of men I mean people prey upon each other\nPeople who are filled with darkness joins speak blacks of wicked in this and a lot of it is done in the name of God look at Islam and he ISIS and the rest of this darkness claimed to serve their God Allah who in reality is the moon God he's not the God of having these the God of how\nYou know what God would sanction the murder of innocent children only of God filled with evil\nAre gone to the back in the days of the uh Israel lights remember the lambs blood around your door\nWell sacrifice was was to\nPresent in to reveal to us that that are sitting require to sacrifice and it it was a foreshadowed to the sacrifice of Jesus on the cross but he never required the murder of innocent children\nSee I think all religions probably are skewed someone where they forgot I mean I don't think God is as evil as the early Bible depicted in terms of things that happened to me in time\nWell I Would agree that religion and all religious institutions ended up under the control of men who think they use these organizations for the protection of their own power George\nAnd so in the end and that's really all become\nCorrupted the religious leadership of Israel when Jesus first came was corrupt\nLook at the Vatican bank they talk about corruption I mean the Vatican bank ... is is loaded in corruption makes no sense doesn't\nWell the the rule of man brings nothing but tyranny and sorrow and pain and and that's why we really look for a return to the kingdom of God because\nGods the only one that can really rule the earth and and do so righteously all the men that have tried it ended up becoming death spots power corrupts men\nYou know do you believe that some higher power will step in and bail us all out\nAnd I believe that at the very end these days Jesus Christ will return but I don't know that will be bailed out a remnant will be saved the world will have demonstrated\nIts own evil by all the things that it's done I mean it's men doing all of this evil charge of course that's cool yeah\nExactly and they want to lay the blame at the doorstep of God but God didn't do all God didn't build these nuclear weapons\nIn God and create all of the sand and all of the sadness which is the sorry history of humanity and there's been goodness in this world no doubt and there's good news even today but that goodness came from God\nIt's good to mail server so the springs New York email your on with Benjamin go ahead\nThis morning Joe on the morning oh I've got a comment and question first of all

don't notice there's so much but when you go further away let's say you're in your hotel and you have a pyramid view you start noticing that there is a certain texture to the pyramid and\nUm ah the review or a who was it was very well known a job for a job here who don't we reviewed my paper\nOr he calls his waves um and I call it sort of a federal effect\nUm and so when you look at the details of that which was published by plane as petri a hundred and fifty years ago who actually measured each individual course as a function of total height\nYou then you actually see the numbers and so there is these uh you know you you start with really thick courses and as you get to the top of the courses get thinner but every once in a while there is a jump so uh you have a much thicker course\nAnd then the thickness tapers off and then it resumes the overall trend which is a thinning trend\nAnd then you have another sudden jump in to take this and this keeps on going and going for twenty three times as far as I'm as far as I see there's twenty three peaks like that [noise]\nUm and ah and then before each one of these jobs petri noted that uh if you calculate the surface area of course and you divide that surface area by the surface area at the base some of these peaks\nHave rounds fraction of twenty fifth so you know one twenty fifth to twenty three so you found that there are rounds fractions of twenty fifth associated with some of these pre ... courses and that was it uh it was not for interpreted what does it mean\nA it was just noted but uh it just sat there um until I took a look at it again\nNow how many layers total and in the forty two story great German how many rows\nYeah two hundred three left and probably two hundred ten\nUh originally two hundred and ten originally\nIs there and I have to have to immediately say there are some researchers who say the\nPyramid was not completed there was a they say that was there was a virtual top so it was actually ... at the top\nAnd the rest was a maybe a as fear and you know the one of the the most prominent researcher who was proposed this is Robert ... father John Paul will go out and the papers on I think it's on a Robert Duvall a\nAcademia a page and it's also in Cosby gloom uh his brother vote to attend these he's in the back of the book where he explains\nThis theory so there are some people that I think the pyramid was not coming to a peek\nA and now of course other people say it was ... and so theoretically at least you can say two hundred and of course\nNow we have is there a consistency to the ah repeating of the thicker layers\n[noise] um ...\nDoes it every ten steps that every twelve is there is some kind of ... you\nThat's a great question I I that was the first thing

in Egyptian the Egyptians designed their parents with or something called they called this\nAt which is the pyramid and go and it's a you know when you walk up a staircase basically for each amount that you go you go a certain amount forward and that's how it could step charged a German angle so I thought you know each course it should be the same amount like you're going up to the arcade each step is the same\nAnd and it's not and and uh and all of a sudden you know the steps gets much thicker\nAnd chew question again there's low regularity even to the thickness of someone you know it's it's completely positive but of course now I think I Know the answer it has to do with the interior architecture it has to do with spaces inside\nAnd we'll get to that uh after the break but what is most amazing to me about this is that with the different layers of which there are\nA couple of dozen that are decker yeah that the orientation for the pyramid that it's still ended up at the right angle on all four sides\nYeah a to complete the pyramid correctly without any errors well that's an engineering feat that is just beyond comprehension\nWhich which to me I wanted to correct something I said in a shaped black interview I I think I said that uh the ... to ... um shot a shop to ... and ... published that al ... was disappearing uh during\nThe twenty seventh century so I I wanted to correct that it wasn't all ... in a big dip her\nIt was a star Morocco\nSo it was starting to disappear in the southern part of the country and because of that because that constellation it so important to chip shows\nThat the authors propose that airport they began to oriented oriented monuments to another part of the of the big tipper and why the pyramid ended up in that in the north south uh orientation\nI gotta jump in right there that says coast to coast and we've got to take a break my knew this was ... church we'll be right back stay with us\n[noise] get Daily Show updates

and now I Know [noise]\n[noise]\n\nWelcome\nBack to coast to coast am I going to church or guessing I'm Manu save Saturday and we're talking about his paper that was published last week\nAnd again I Want everybody to go over and get the reference at my news website it is itchy ops pyramid dot com the links are at coast to coast am\nAnd go to the right side scroll down there's a list of published papers right there we're talking about the top one now my new I Want to jump ahead and let everybody know in that ...\nIf they scroll down to page three twenty six you that strike three hundred ... a scrawled on page three twenty six where you have an illustration there\nOf the layers and with a kind of way showing the grand gallery and of course the kings chamber and the queens chamber the descending passage way and the ascending passage way up to the grand gallery\nAnd so working from the bottom the first layer up a voyage we're talking about a road number eight Seventeen Twenty one and of course thirty for these must have been for you and I want you to take the audience through this\nBut these are game changing moments when you see these alignment these layers weren't they\nThat was a game changing moment you're right I'm I'm I'm listing all the peaks you know the total number of peaks was twenty three some of these peaks or worse the civically noted by peach tree\nTo have surfaced a ratios that were around ... a number of fractions of twenty fifth so you know six twenty fifty five twenty fifth\nI'm a and those are also this that and it turns out that those courses\nThat are associated with these round fractious tend to run a over ceilings in a in that of course we don't have a lot of feelings but the few that we have there seems to be a correlation us and thirty four is the most striking one it goes right across the queen\nA chamber and based\nOn this ... this observation that there is seems to be a correlation between round fraction twenty or you know those courses that have a surface area that is around a number of facts of twenty fifth I Am proposing that the top part of the pyramid what we don't know of any spaces\nAnd war but where we nevertheless also see these type of round fractions of twenty fifth that there must be space is just the same up there and I'm saying at least six if not then\nNow we're going to get to that are exactly that's on page three twenty eight yeah but staying on page three twenty six with this cut away yes you need to have if you are going to propose these extra chambers above the kings chamber where there\nIs supposed to be nothing right then you have to have some basis for this and clearly we have a I I'm just looking here one two three four five six seven\nEight absolute definitive uh\nMarks on these roads starting with the descending passage way all the way up to the top of the king's chamber\nRight so for example of course not a Twenty one which is a ... which has a surface\nArea that is around fraction of twenty fifth Nineteen twenty fifth that alliance with the uh the uh you know the ... ones that are that guard the entry of to the great pyramid show right that that cost on the Twenty one is right under the V.\nOr so it is in other words if a soldier with a feeling than the than the one that we just talked about is a course number thirty four also has a round fraction of twenty fifth sixteen in this case and it runs right over the ceiling of the queen chamber\nOr then the other courses don't don't have round fracture the twenty fifth and they're not associated with feelings so it works out very nicely and then we go to the top and then we have eight or we have eight twenty fifth\nUh and that goes across the ceiling of the um off the ground at tower I'm\nNow there are ... there are two courses nine twenty fifth and ten twenty fifth and those ... line up with a with a two of relieving chambers inside the tower\nUm and and then the final point I Want to make is that the possible avoid which I marked in here um that was found last year is also aligning with eight twenty fifth so it's possible that that causes marking not just that granted power but maybe also the possible avoid if it's for real\nWhich we are talking about a rose sixty eight\nA that would be a that would be row eighty four\nNo role eighty four is at the top of the king's chamber am I reading this correctly\nYeah you are at the top of the king chamber and that also happens to be um you know within the resolution of this scandal that they were publishing that also is approximately the top of the ... the big boys I got it yeah of course we don't\nKnow exactly we just it's kind of have the image so I just kind of like you know paint that that into this illustrations just to give a rough guide\nI Want to jump back a really quick I don't want this to get away from me there was a tweet earlier that is a pretty important and this is from eddy\nYeah and and he says does ah does my news see any connection between a dynastic Egyptian use of the lion and the use of the lion at go back ... happy\nAnd everybody's talking about going back lead tabby today and its relationship with ... and the great pyramid and and the other things throughout dynastic Egypt is\nThere a connection yeah that's a fantastic question um and I am actually I'm I'm currently looking into that uh with Robert shark we are um we're trying and but I'm not ready to make a statement yet\nOkay but the the use of the lion see this is what I find fascinating when we go back on these dates\nAnd we constantly land and ten thousand five hundred BC for a variety of reasons one of course uh what was going on with the stars we understand that but then we have all of the\nUh cataclysmic events the end of the ice age the construction of go back to lead tabby the erosion on those things all of these things and Leo Rising right all of these things happen at ten thousand five hundred BC yeah which makes go back to lead happy not an accident\nNo within references of course uh with lines too as well extraordinary\nYeah no absolutely it's a fantastic question and I don't want to you know jump the gun because I Can't really speak what authority yet I'm so maybe the next show um maybe we'll have something more but it's a great question\nLet's go to a I'm going to get to the

everywhere okay Google blind date DRA tonight hard radio [noise]\n\nWelcome back to the coast to coast am on this beautiful Sunday Now Monday morning\nHere in Southern California my new uh the phones have been amazing you ready to a head straight back to it let's do it let's go to speaking of Southern California let's go to let's go to Monique right here in someone right up the street Monique\nAnd some other features that the basic features that we know about the great pyramid\nYou can find them in the ... in the dimensions of the ... of him you know\nAnd you don't have time to get into it today but the papers on my website Go check it out and tell me what you think but I think the answer the question is yes I think that's the world's first example of an architect using his own to him as a blueprint for monuments\nAnd thank you for the call Joe and that paper is underneath the latest papers the second one listed over on my news website\nAnd one last question from Twitter before we had to the break this is from dino and do you know says are there any other pyramid in central and South America that carried the same traits as the ...\nTrade meaning\nBut it's just what it says in the winter\nWe don't know yeah\nUm\nI I assume there would be a couple of things I Do know is referencing here one would be size in orientation or to true north and may be uh something astrological ah with an alignment\nWell let me let me put it this way so I think I you know I've I've watched this documentary or which is intriguing they're basically saying is that all these monuments are lining up a across the globe and I find that fascinating I and I don't know how to explain that\nIf that is true that would definitely suggest that master plan that you know people were coordinating this this this is building activity and of course that's what Graham Hancock\nA has been writing about four years and uh so I I think it's possible yes but just specifically some of the trades I I Can't really comment because I don't know enough about it\nWell let me help you with this idea when we look at the the tops of the the the pyramids in Mexico in Mexico city and the mind structures throughout Guatemala and Honduras 'em and believes\nThat the tops of these pyramids there's always something there what about the top of the great pyramid is and what do not not the top top two there'd be a chamber\nOr something at the at the upper levels\nYeah well I think so I think that could be that that could be a space or that um connects that connected to the summit\nEr and of course the summit itself I'm you know like I said before John a\nDrop off ... has proposed that the summit of the great pyramid was not a peak was basically a virtual top and a and it would've been a you know as fear and it's interesting that the diameter of that fear is a meter\nA it's a very interesting a very interesting theory a and others have proposed similar things there's even a hero cliff I think I'm\nA this was first mentioned by a state Jeannie in a night in uh Nineteen Seventy one book by Peter Tompkins that there was this fear on top of the great pyramid so not up to your media and by the sphere so yes I I think I think those theories out there I but I don't know how you would otherwise prove I'm\nNo you've got to anomalies in a a and one is clearly defined edge row one Ninety six and do you do have a ratio there could there be a chamber at the very top\nI I think so how big would it be the way I'm looking at those upper rose or the dimensions of the pyramid at that high um how big could that chamber be\nI think a chamber like that would be\nHe may be no more than five feet something like that five feet by ... Hi I'm saying right you know\nMaybe maybe a five six courses or something like that\nUm and they would be it would be difficult to detect it may be on on the ... especially if you have a grand gallery in between which you know the ... was from the queen chamber so I think in order to protect these spaces you have to put the place up in a in the uh in the or the chamber of that's off limits right\nNow yeah and how would you how would you detect more than one chamber ... scan your show multiple chambers that were stacked up on top of each other\nYeah maybe not if they're stocked up maybe not but they might not be stacked up um they could be you know like the one for example I mentioned that a lot of gun shy and bring a is suspecting that will be a chamber that's in the southern part of the pyramid maybe close to the face\nYou know so they may not be stocked up I'm a one way you could do a Jimmy is by putting the plates into that knowledge that we talked about you know the one that uh who Don and fire investigated it up on the south it's on the north east side\nOf the northeast corner right in the\nNorth east corner it's a fairly sizable space you know I mean I I don't know how big the plates are but I Wonder if you could set up the place up there and then you might be able to actually discern different chambers they made it might be possible\nHow expensive is it to perform these ... studies\nIt seemed like it wouldn't be that expensive because you're just placing the the plates throughout the pyramid and then of course running a computer system it's not like there was any effort excavations or right right it's not that expensive but\nYeah they have I think they've already spent the main capitals already spent basically uh you know making the plates\nAnd then you know you have to pay the people to do the experiment I'm guessing multiple a million dollars I think maybe ten ten million or something like that to do this project I'm a and most of that money has maybe already been spent and now like you're saying you know and now it's just you know you just to repeat studies\nUm but I think if you do any kind of invasive a\nProject or in a project like this is spending several million dollars a which if we want to go back to the things and ... that's a kind of money that will need for a project like that\nThis is coast to coast am host Jimmy church it's been an all Egypt the great pyramid evening here going into Monday morning more with my news said Sunday after this short break stay with us or\nBoom boom\n\n\nBoom boom\n\nOh I'm just sitting in traffic waiting to die do last minute drive and do more living\nIn the morning every ten minutes on the news on the news radio seven forty T.

Egypt and our guest tonight my new save side they published a paper that you can read all of his papers over on his website Chiapas pyramid\nA dot com and the link to that are over ed coast to coast am now my new before we get back to the calls I have talked to before and I mentioned this in my opening little rant here tonight on coast to coast which is and knees you we seem to have amnesia\nAnd it's all over the place but\nIt's it's ... it's not represented any more plainly then what happened in Egypt after Cleopatra\nAnd we have that example of it but it was going on for a year she was the last pharaoh in Egypt before she committed suicide\nThe amnesia had already set in and what we need to and you mentioned this last week on my other show fade to black which is this that Cleopatra\nIs nearer to us\nThan she is to ancient Egypt there's three thousand years there there's only two thousand years on this side of of Cleopatra and that's an insane amount of time we don't really understand how old the Egypt is until you look at it in those terms right\nRight and then going back to go back to tip the and the time when we think the original stinks was built then you double that entire time period one more time\nAnd more\nWhy is it that we we are so quickly to forget the past\nWell I think because ah I ... as Graham Hancock a Robert shock I'm Robert Duvall and other office um you know have proposed that there was a catastrophe on earth and it wiped out or the evidence of\nThis uh these earlier people and uh the only thing that survive tour of some of these monuments\nUm and so uh I think that's probably why we've forgotten I I always remember this great movie planet of the apes the original one with ... uh you know when he lands on the planet that he thinks is another planet but it's actually earth\nAnd then you know at the end of the movie he finds out the hard way that ah that this earth has a major and that you see the statue of liberty bird in the sand and I just had such a profound impact on me that movie\nUm and I think that's sort of maybe that's the story that we're living in in reality\nLet's let's head back to the phones it's been an incredible my here with the with the audience and\nThey they are just as interested in finding the answers to these questions as you are I and let's go wild card is going to Dorothy in Carmichael, California Dorothy Europe next on coast\n... how um they'll pay them the and he can ... ... ... ... that can and cannot find suitable for all our\nCredit he had heart in my room ... like\nA ... a lot

that\nA portal opening hit hit these kids are you know found and we had something like ... they had in mind but he never ran that getting ready to get in there you know it it while you have to think\nOh you're talking about the Winchester House here in California\nYeah remember how we can get built on the other factor in there that they go get confused with his father her and you know the life that they're at the end but she had in mind went nowhere [laughter]\nYeah and the spirits we get lost\nIn there and get high and now I Know there and eat it again\nAnd maybe they ... you know they wanted the oil because they do that and they had a rat\nAnd maybe that's a great they ran their ... their parents don't live in a concert there for a long time than getting out that\nAre on maybe\nDorothy Dorothy I'm going to jump in in in and say that you are on the something my new and I have talked about this the\nThe blocks in their rooms in side of the great pyramid our acoustic sleep tuned\nThey resonate and a while many frequencies but one of the main ones is a four forty which resonates through out the great pyramid doesn't it Manu\nClare right and I was so they have a couple of comments about your question Dorothy so first of all Christopher done or when he was talking with Jimmy a few days ago um I think uh if you ask Christopher done if a if his model his theory\nMake has room for the you know extra space as the pure Mickey may say yes\nI'm a so I could because it because of these residences engine oil electromagnetic energy focusing and all those things so that's the first part of your ah one ounce or the other answer about me you were talking about the spirits of the game so I you know sort of the same vein I I think\nSo first of all the Egyptians did make rooms for spirits of the king and for a ... to receive offerings basically so we know that ... had a small room in front of his pyramid where a statue of him was placed\nAnd uh it was basically looking out to the little uh you know the cold um and ah him you know you ask about him you know so he you know or his must stop I actually had as a room a small room and the statue of him was placed in that room and then it was wild up and what was that for it was for spirit\nTo receive offerings of from you know his family and so I think you are I think you're absolutely right and in fact what you're asking is very much in line with what the Egyptians believed\nThat uh uh you know that are just the spirits were very much there there were very much present and they just have to be housed inside of either a mommy or statue and then it became alive and uh and it was still interacting with a family members with the friends\nGreat call tonight let's go west of the Rockies to
