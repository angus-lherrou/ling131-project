when we try to come up with all had I lodged top condition he's also the\nNot I think would be Fifteen twenty percent would be my guest George but important thing to remember is that there are there and they certainly believe that we exist\nAnd so the the old game is is that they don't want us to know that there is there they want us to think that this is our own feelings our own thoughts and some of it is\nAll of the violence author is not caused by demonic spirits and negative spirits are but certainly there are there to amplify and right now everybody's got a target on their back everybody\nHow did they possess how did they take over somebody's body\nAnd work on them for on people for a while usually these things happen over a period of time people who are depressed people who move into a home a and there's a lot of negative emotional\nEnergy drugs or something\nI practice something called modern ...\nAnd that that came out of the idea when I started going into people's homes I I found out many years ago that\n... homes because people have lived in there to generate both positive and negative emotional energies which are unseen but we feel um and it accumulates in the environment and demonic spirits actually feel stronger and become stronger and these kinds of environments and so do negative spirits\nAnd so they are attacked people and homes we don't take care of our homes we clean them wash windows when you move into a new place the carpets paint everything\nBut we don't clean the atmospheres and so essentially were living in other people's emotional energies and so demonic spirit's just play on that\nAnd they come into the our environments\nAnd generate huge amounts of energy that is negative and the air thickens with emotional energy especially negative energy at thickens and so it's easier to transmit negative emotional energy hatred\nThose kinds of negative thoughts and emotional feelings when the air is thick with emotional energy and so I get calls all the time from people who you know say hey I just moved into this new home apartment whenever it doesn't feel right\nI don't know why but you know the kids are crying the dogs are barking in a certain area or we're just getting into more arguments why is this happening and so modern exercises and deals with the idea of that first the negative emotional energy has\nTo be removed by\nSomebody like me from the atmosphere of the home that makes the spirit weaker then I deal with a negative spirit or that's the second thing that I Do that's modern exercises in different from traditional actresses and in that I don't always go after the spirit first\nSometimes I cleared the atmosphere to make them weaker and then I attack the negative spirits\nAnd you're not you're not ... you're not a priest is Adam ... would you do\nI Would not say that I'm not a priest I Would say that I'm an independent priest say sharman priest exorcist\nDon't belong to any particular religion because where I work with\nFrom all different religions or no religious at all people call me who are agnostic atheist everybody calls me and that's the thing you know you don't have to belong to a particular church to call me and a half of your home cleared\nAnd these days I Do it by distance as well because when I was going through homes and doing strictly in person and work\nFor the Internet ever came about um I wasn't touching anything anyways doing personal ... wasn't touching anybody anyways it's really it's not necessary there's no such thing as as a\nDistance on a non physical level it doesn't matter as long as you have focused each one of us is a complete individual and so anybody can be cleared from anywhere if you know how to do it and\nIt it it has to be done you know we we moved into apartments like I said and there's lots of emotional energy from maybe people living there\nFor Twenty years forty years a hundred years ending on where people are from around the world it builds up it accumulates and parents need to be\nDealt with you know times are already in the homes from time to come into the home they sense of family that's having a problem because of emotional energy in our living environment and they're ripe for attack\nAnd so it it's called may be a professional habit we're one and I then I teach people how to\nMaintain the clarity of their bodies are energy fields\nAnd also how to maintain a clarity other living environment's so it's kind of like having a carpet cleaner come in first and then you can simply clean her own carpet once that's done\nSo it really is something we all can do to a certain extent and something I think we all should do I'm not going to be around forever and certainly there are great exorcist and every religion and not the only one\nThat are qualified extra assistance just about every religion\nBut they all but they don't work for people and other religions I get that all the time you know that people call up and say well I I called you know local parish even though I'm not no I don't belong that religion not Catholic\nAnd they won't come over and help me I Hope everybody so I that's why I don't belong to any religion but I remember doing this kind of working has lives um I have deep contacts with higher spirits\nAre also this universe is filled with stars and around the stars are planets in our universe I said before on on one of my appearances the universe is teeming with life you asked me that question you\nKnow do you go into these ... with a crucifix at all no you don't do that\nNo but

demonic possessions what has been for you Jeffrey the scariest or even maybe the most dangerous situation you've been in with this\nOh a just a few years ago I did a free night a\nAnd actually at a legitimate haunted mansion very famous I won't mention the name but it's something I was\nAgain three years and years and years you all invitation I finally they talked me into it I actually stayed over in one of the rooms they're beautiful you know and so it was actually set up for a ghost hunters to go in and uh with\nEquipment and and take a look around and everybody everybody found something people who didn't believe in ghost had you know one couple said their hair dryer when flying across one of the rooms and I was staying in most haunted room of all they gave me it was actually the nicest room too but\nUh the first thing that happened was I went up there one night to get some business cards from people on it and uh I was in there you know by myself and it was very heavy gold sheet over the bottom of the bed I forgot what that's called in the fashion learn but very heavy gold she it was called the gold room\nAnd it went up to get my business cards and this she started moving up and down maybe a foot really fast\nRight in front of me just would not stop I just said you know oh I just you know forget it I'm going to get my cards and paid no attention I said you know\nThis place is really haunted and the third night I was there um I was sleeping and uh I'd given speeches every night or to the coast hunters warning meant to be very careful about saying don't pinch me don't bite media\nPeople home negative spirits yes they will get\nChanel to get your later so it was sleeping I woke up about five o'clock in the morning and uh oh four feet above me was the misshapen spirit just terrible looking now\nI'm used to ... spears can assume any shape they won so I don't react to this you know the say the ugliness or the appearance of something like that deliberately\nOr what this thing was doing was it was singing\nAnd ... song that I'd never heard really is I Can't it's drain possible to describe it was not any kind of it sounded like some kind of evil followed by\nAnd it was right above me and the spirit was essentially you know head to head I was laying in the bed woke up in the spirit was was singing hello Patrick week and I could hear it loud and clear this horrific song\nSlowly and I just I you know\n... shot up immediately got up out of my bed at ... kind of went right back into the wall immediately because I was going to attack right away first thing I knew what it was I didn't have no idea how long and had been there a you know essentially putting some kind of\nIncantation are spelled immediately on me you know I wanted to change me a from being very happy and sleeping very well to suddenly being very um self conscious and and frightened I actually felt really sick\nI sat up immediately went to the chair sat in my room and said I Am not going back to sleep in this house and now I was not working at this time\nI was just you know sleeping after hard night of giving speeches and talking about all these things and I said I'm not going to sleep again in this mansion and actually went down into the basement which used to be a speak easy and sat down and they're not out of fear I just wanted to get out of the room you\nKnow you you just have to learn\nAn exorcist is not safe I don't go into homes and uh in in to entertain people or just to give speeches if they're negative spirits and somebody's home or negative energy I get rid of it\nHow do you know you've gotten rid of\nPeople say so I I go completely on the client I give a report on what I see and what I did and suggestions I have but I go completely on the clients\nWhen did they get back to Egypt for you I mean how many days after you were there do they call you back and say I I think you got rid of this thing\nOh it's usually right away and you know sometimes you know a week or so later but on the calls come pretty quickly you know times immediately you know it's like you know we feel better right away especially when I Do a personal clear I mean I Do these things by Skype I work with people all around the world I don't have to travel everywhere sky telephone\nOr you know whatever and so people say hey I feel better right away because I work on a lot of individuals are just working negative environments and then he declaring\nAnd and I teach people how to protect themselves and and so I Do a lot of this and so they feel better right away I guess that right away and they call up and say hey our family is no longer fighting I feel better at work and better able I go into business meetings and I'm no longer coming out feeling dreamed\nBecause I'm not getting hit with negative energy from my co workers we all generate negative energy\nAnd we don't always noted subconscious and so people don't know they're getting hit they don't know they're sending out negative energy they don't know something like a demonic spirit is around them run\nNegative spirit and so you know people calling me family is calling me and sometimes it takes a while and sometimes it's the media but I always get a caller and email thanks a lot Jeffrey really really hard you know very very seldom out of the thousands of clients that I've helped or the last\nAlmost three decades now\nHave not said that you know it's it's not a matter of ego or bragging it's just what happens you know I'm very good at what I Do and I make sure that the client isn't the best shape possible so personal clearing might be forty five minutes I Do thirty five different things and forty five\nMinutes already by different things so remarkable and it's almost like a checklist\nEvery clearing as different George depending on what is going on with the client it may just be negative energy a nurse works in a hospital or psychiatric ward or\nAround ... people that is coming in from the six month clearing they're calling me up you know buy Skype or something or is most common uh you know and I don't have to look at them for forty five minutes how I was I always work with my eyes closed unless I'm walking around really on a business or a house and so\nYou know or they feel better you know and and you know the fight stop because the idea of a negative spirit or even just negative emotional energy that's accumulated over a period of time in a home has no effect upon the family more arguments\nAnd they can turn violent this attracts negative spirit is attracts demonic spirits\nAnd so negative emotional energy attracts negative spirits demonic spirit is also happens in the workplace far more than people think\nAnd ah these are the complaints that I get and so my job is to remove the negative emotional energy from a person's energy field both deep\nMeaning that the from the very first day that were born we generate emotional energy and also things we pick up today yesterday last week as well and also the homes we move into apartments where we lived in by maybe a hundred different people generating emotional energy schools\nPeople go to school I went to this this is the same school both elementary and high school that my parents went to\nIts old very youthful but I mean think of the moon energy dinner elated\nAnd so people will be calling uncomfortable they don't know why and the body picks up emotional energy generated we don't know how to release it I teach people how to do that you know and and so\nSometimes it's a teaching session and sometimes it's a clearing session it all depends I Do both and you know I'm clearing session a forty five minutes for a standard adult you know maybe you know thirty minutes for a child and maybe Fifteen twenty minutes for pets\nNot so good at all costs just for you know\nMarshall energy more than people do\nNext stop let us go to the J in Minnesota Welcome to the program I DJ\nGood evening gentlemen I appreciate your time thank you thanks for calling\nGeorge it's always a pleasure I've I've called you a couple of times about turmeric and everything else

people least able to defend themselves which unfortunately is a great portion of the population and so they will attack people who have mental issues\nPhysical brain problems or depression anger issues unhappiness\nOr overconfidence all sorts of things that are going on and so it does happen and and we have to watch out for that and and so ah demonic spirits\nAre experts at reaching across that dividing line\nAnd being able to reach into the physical realm and affect people when the wind is right usually meaning that there is emotional energy in the atmosphere or a person is feeling weak they're not protecting themselves properly\nAnd they can reach across in damage a person physically and they can cause even something like that usually what happens is it's not so much of the media does but actually\nBeen working on them for a long time and they can cause physical injuries it's even happened to me once you know I I woke up\nOne morning I was getting dressed in my office my girlfriend was asleep at the time\nAnd I was getting up and ready to work\nI'm doing what I Do here and all of a sudden\nDemonic spirit appeared behind me I knew I could feel its power suddenly a light shot out from it hit me right in the back\nAnd it caused me to have a centrally a pulled muscle I actually had to go you know get in my car and drive to the hospital and you know I haven't looked at in a you know get some medication for it because it ... the\nDemonic spirit had pulled the muscle so it can happen to me and I'm good at protecting myself so all the people out there who are not protecting themselves which is you know most of the population of our planet are very susceptible to attack\nAnd it can be physical because demonic spirits studying how to do these things the non physical universe having the other side whatever you want to call it which is a wonderful place but they also have dark realm was that are negative\nVery negative what we might call help and and essentially that is very connected to the physical realm of the physical realm as something like the crust of the bread and heaven and the other side being the inside the bread itself which is much larger\nLet's go next to the gym in Portland, Oregon while we have some time here Jim go ahead\n... on my question is is\nIt possible for one of these evil spirits to quit being evil or you know to trip pan turtle I gotta go to the other side gets\nOff drugs so many psychics back in the Nineteen nineties asked me and said hey Jeffrey as long as you're doing exercises ... and teaching people how to protect themselves why don't you help the spirits and I said what I say no I Am not a spirit psychologist\nUh it's kind of like if somebody calls and your window and wants to see here still your stereo or worse you don't sit them down on the couch and say look we need to talk about why you steal things it's not my job you don't have time for ...\nThrow that actually are very good at trying to help negative spirits demonic spirits are homeless but the idea of negative spirit's just negative people who are dead and doing negative things\nAnd trying to get them to look at themselves and see what they're doing but it's not my job and people who hire me I work for them\nMy job is to get those things out of their home get negative energy out of their home out of their bodies energy fields I don't have time to do it and if they're not going to listen to me anyway\nThey're they don't have to there's going to go someplace else they're just not going to do that anymore to a physical criminals going to sit there on the couch is that he or she is going to get up and walk out the door back out the window I I just don't have the time\nI have to immediately focus on getting rid of the emotional energy in the person who's energy field of the average person\nNot everybody's everybody's disaster anything they just have negative energy issues and also getting if there's some kind of negative spirit attack but not necessarily living in the house they could just be going from house to house every night or apartment to apartment or condo condo or whatever and getting them out of their fast\nAnd making it work so the family or the individual that hey this is my main concern not dealing with a negative spirit's there are\nMillions and millions of spirits out there you don't just sit on clouds or walk the streets of gold actually do things and one of the things they do is work for higher spirits and help other spirits look at themselves and stop doing what they're doing if they don't or other measures that we can take\nJeffrey are you glad you have this ability disability to see demons to maybe even get removed them\nGeorge I um I was born with it and at first it was really scary because when I reported it the teachers you know I'm seeing these spirits and you know I'm\nI'm On for that could you know you know tell her when my grandmother my grandmother was going to call and you know two days and all this kind of stuff at first it was real scary\nBut actually I I started as I went along in my life I started and and I'm fifty nine now I started to remember doing these kinds of things in past life helping people that to me is the greatest gift um I could ever be given is the ability to help people it's dangerous work\nBut the idea is that once I teach people how to protect themselves they can go off and and not be so susceptible they can go to work and not come home so dream\nAnd I bet they really appreciate you while they love it\nYou know it's

I didn't I didn't know when I was dreaming that it was a dream and it wasn't a loose a tree but\nAfterwards I woke up right after and sure enough that was only a dream but what I'm curious about is\nSomebody like Dr Ford in the area of psychology and whatnot I Would would not be surprised at all that she has and consuming these drugs\nWe don't we don't know that\nI don't know but but what I'm saying is that it could very well be that she instead of what this young man had with a with a well he can dream sure\nShe hers was more like Roseanne Barr that you can read on um\n[noise] no you're you're absolutely right but that's that's something that nobody asked either one of them\nIf they were on any mood altering drugs I don't believe everything I ... I've seen in in that case\nThat never came up but ah I'm sure that's a possibility or even though we don't know for sure what it probably happened Keith thank you for that when we got open line coals let's go next to Jason in Bowling Green Kentucky west of the Rockies Hi Jason\nYou don't you're okay were you\nUh um and they have um I had a um the thing that I couldn't believe that I saw before I had a I had done a little ... ... and I had gotten to read the Bible a little bit you know and um and I was at a bone in my life where I didn't really know\nIf God was real or if the devil Rio all this you know and I started reading about one thing and then I'm\nGoing back to the point when I was out of jail whenever there's a a as God was like whoa you know your real angels on everything Israel you know show me because I Would like to know I Would like to believe right so uh\nIt started at ... at first nothing really happened except until about a week later then what happened when I started seeing these little things like with people like um beagles like these little spirits and stuff\nAnd I'm a ...

on video everybody knows who to everybody is now\nBut you're never there I mean he could on his back to the ... been a lot of things\nMy point is that if you're going to pull a gun like that it's very dangerous people could have been shot innocent people\nLet them go if a guy was robbing a bank you are in their view run in the store some guy comes in with a gun and says you know give me the money you open it up give them the money and wish him well I agree but if he turns his back on you jump on no no when he turned his back\nWell because we don't know we weren't in there so we don't know what
