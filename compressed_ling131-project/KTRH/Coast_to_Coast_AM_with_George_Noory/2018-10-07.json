I. D. A. L. W. A. V. E. dot net\nOkay that's a RV I as a tidal wave one word dot net right All right and er you answer your email I take it\nYes you know it it I can guarantee I keep up or if I have it if I get inundated but I Do my best\n[noise] ah well ah you're going to be inundated believe me what projects or it in the remaining moments here what projects or have you all taken on after the military I take it you're leaving the national security stuff behind now are you probably had enough of that sink a ship\nA gift or maybe you so you I don't know um uh but uh but so what are you doing now\nThis is Joe I'm I'm a research associate still with the cognitive science as well that was the original Abbott us awry and then later as I say I see and uh we're currently working on some very interesting contracts for a\nOff some major corporations that have passed us with doing some research firm appealing and we hope to continue or pursuing the mechanisms behind them doing\nDuring you talk about it at all I I mean I Am for example our own CIA which wants to spend all its time\nI'm with national security work uh uh you know Congress and oversight committees have been talking about changing the direction of the CIA to a industrial espionage\nAll we we of course at sea of sellout are gone into science as well have never endorsed uh espionage of any kind of were primarily interested in trying to uncover the mechanisms that supports I function\nBut we've recently done three three or four a very interesting pilot studies that have\nIndicated that we may be on the something with regard to two or three of those mechanisms and if those prove out which we have every reason to believe they will uh there'll be some very astounding a findings that will uh open the door to a whole lot more research\nDo you guys ever scarier cells [laughter] every ... scares me a high price I Am [noise]\nUh no longer surprised at at this science but I'm never quit being amazed by it\nI Would agree with that or\nIs it one of those things that once you have big gun uh I I mean I have yet to talk to a remote viewer who was involved in the government program or otherwise who has said this is lousy I'm I'm On board or I'm On the interested am not doing it anymore is it one of those things at once you've done you will always do\nA this is Joe uh it's I I always tell people that if you are if you wanted me to sell my experience in this for ten million dollars I probably wouldn't\nDo it however if\nYou offered me ten million at the beginning to\nDo it that I knew what I knew now I probably wouldn't participate\n[noise] um I guess and yeah that's a good answer that's really a good answer All right well we're about out of time anybody a water issue any final words here um I of course would love to have you back at some future point um\nBut any any final words for the American audience is intensely interested in this whole thing you've been doing [noise]\nBoth like Paul I'm\nSound like somebody else wants to say something too but um I I think there's a very exciting a process I think it's very exciting time to be involved in this one and I'm Glad that people are interested that kind of been the case what we were doing in secret for so many years so I encourage people to develop an interest in it and an export and find out about it\nSo in other words uh go ahead folks if you're interested follow it\nThat's it that's right Joe this joke I I just want to add one thing for you Dr um I Would encourage people to retain their skepticism\nAnd to ask questions it's it's okay to challenge whoever's doing this in and have them explain are open to review and criticism what exactly it is that they're doing uh that's that's we're knowledge is developed and\nIt's how we decide whether something is truly valid or not so I Would encourage continued interest but to be skeptical and ask questions\nWell you know somebody might likely say and we've only got a few seconds All right I Want to instill a demonstration you know arts holding up something tell us what it is that is not the kind of thing that remote viewing lends itself toward is it\nThat's that's correct this is Joe I'm I I've actually done six live remote feelings on camera for national ah a national television and anyone\nIn America and uh one of the requirements has been the establishment follow very closely the protocols and in those performances have have an open to review and criticism\nAlright Joe we're out of time Joe a and Paul thank you both will continue with Lindy Ken and good night

that is a I'm a fairly good training target and uh uh in fact I think maybe I have a in my in my early training um\nYou know just as a as another uh\nA session to see if you're on target because we have feedback on that\nWell there was a there is the second part to the question okay or if so was man walking side by side with the dinosaurs\nOr I don't remember specifically getting that I have always felt that are a form of man was yes uh-huh but uh that I didn't get that from remote viewing I got that from other studies that have done okay a simple archaeological bondage\nAnd then you're good PS here a PS why can't remote viewers win lotteries and um before you answer that I Would have answered a Ross in California by saying Ross how do you know that a lot of the winners of lotteries aren't re\nMost humorous [laughter] yeah [laughter] oh but you answer the way you want when\nAll right we have ah people working on numbers which is a very hard thing to do in remote viewing a there is another type of remote viewing called alternate I mean I'm\nI'm about a A R B a alternate remote viewing uh which uh substitutes remote viewing targets for the numbers\nAre and ah allows you to a remote view for instance the pick three now the way that's normally done is if you are doing to pick three\nYou have a poor people working a three viewers\nEach of which will remote view one of the numbers and one person who collects the data looks on the chart to see what the results Maine and goes and places the bet\nHuh I'm only ...\nBut it it it's been done and uh oh it's been done successfully\nWell if remote influencing as possible how about sending ed McMahon and the gang up my driveway\n[laughter] they're coming here first oh I see oh yeah I I understand that I really I Do a first time caller line you're on the air with Lynn Buchanan hello\nAh yes now one of the problems that I have is this a security clearance and ah for many other reasons as well or if there's an investigation going on especially on an American citizen\nI Will only work it through authorized channels and so if someone comes to me and says you know uh\nUh my son is missing or or uh [noise] I don't know what happened to so and so yes I'm I Will tell them partially because I Want the cushion they're partially also because it's a necessity\nThat oh if they will get the investigating officer to contact me I Will be glad to work the problem for free\nOr die ma'am ma'am ma'am ma'am ma'am listen to me listen to me he just said have the investigating officer in your case the case of your son contact him\nThere aren't there is no and I think for many years ...\nYes but there was an original investigating officer on the case\nWe uh ... retired by now\nWe worked a case not too long ago a last year some time that had been closed for nine years\nAnd uh and on the results of our ah our session a Mel Dave and I worked on this the results of our session the case was reopened and they've been finding\nAre I hear some uh some new evidence\nSo do that man well how can I get a hold of lean\nOkay that's a good question Lynne or ... what is the best way to get a hold of you\nUh do you have Internet access\nOr I Would presume if she doesn't she can get it\nOkay oh I Would say the easiest the easiest to address to remember is art bell dot com and uh right there's a link to my page and on my pages my address and phone number\nAll right there you are imam and or I might add that if you don't have a friend with the computer who can do it you can go to a public library and I just remember my address a which is WWW dot art bell dot com [noise]\nNow let me also say that right at the present time\nWhere you're heavily backed up with a signed witness program ah cases and so we're we're really bogged down until we can get more votes years working on these so um oh I Hope people won't be offended if um\nYou know if they call and uh have their police department call as well and uh nothing is done that day\nAh we have a we have tremendous backlog here\nCompletely understandable a west or the Rockies you're on the air with Lynn Buchanan good morning\nAri yes good morning on my credit for that kind of lost track of all the law to cover up a story that\nAll right I'm old that that is an awfully good question in other words could for example another group of remote viewers somehow trick you and cause you to see something that would be utterly inaccurate\nExactly Oh absolutely in fact one of the biggest problems in remote viewing is that you tend to do that to yourself to begin with oh and there is a thing that a recall basically the neighbor's cat\nOh if or someone else whom you respect very much\nA does a session on a target and they're wrong it out of your respect for them you will tend to find the wrong thing is well this is one reason why I never\nUm oh\nI asked the same exact question to two different viewers who know each other well\nThis brings me back to it deems a tapes which\nThe group earlier including you seem to agree might be or hopefully will be a good idea if it works if it works then I'm all for it but then on the other hand we all of those people out there remote viewing\nMaybe even influencing\nThey're going to be a lot of mistakes made\nA lot of mistakes there'll be made and couldn't there'll be assertive virtual anarchy that would develop\nThat's my fear I Do believe very strongly in the show Drake effect and I know that the more people who learned to remote due correctly the easier it is to learn to remote you correctly\nThe more you learn to remote view incorrectly the easier it will be to learn encourage keeping incorrectly ...\nAnd this is my big fear with so many of the quickie courses that are out there oh that I'm afraid that they're going to through the ... just a you know the hundred McKee if you're a just a\nAlmost destroy any progress that's been made simply because it'll be easier to do it wrong\nYeah well what what was your initial reaction when you heard the videotapes were going to be released to the very or relatively comparatively inexpensive price\nOh well it was just that I really hope it works or if there's a way that we can get people doing this oh and doing it well then I'm all for it and if there's a way that we can make it available to more people I think that's great\nWell listen more coming to the end of our actually the entire program uh\nYou've really been a trooper sticking it out through the whole program it's got to be one of the sudden has to be up

radio\n\nWelcome back to coast to coast am county Willis here discussing the origins of Halloween on ... ... talking with then ran for then sell as you tell us about the origins of Halloween it really does have um an interesting history\nVery rich in history um it's silly it's scary and get said panicking gets kind of crazy I enjoy watching the\nAh television shows around that kind of Halloween and that were the fun ones the little peanuts you know characters that's the only sign with the great pumpkin and all that kind of stuff\nUm but I like the fun ones and and I like when people dress up you know like the vampires Frankenstein I like the really good scary stuff\nAnd he went to the the um the police saying that the ... the he'd found like a needle in in a Snickers bar or something and it turned out that he put that in their himself\n... and ... when the police busted him he said well I was trying to make sure the kids knew not to trust strangers\n[laughter] yeah not to trust you Zach Zach\nWe I was just such an offensive like the first of all the ... you know the whole stranger danger thing is really it's really played on the fact is that most people are good most people don't want her kids at all and you know and of course every year they X ray candies and it's I mean whatever if if\nIt makes me I wanted for but I wanted to ask you that are they still doing that I remember you know it was always go X ray your candy I mean really do you do people really go to\nThe emergency rooms where there's really sick ... you know people are really sick needing to get in and do they take the time to x-ray that did that really happened\nIt occasionally does happen to know I Know that because uh I I used to live in Buffalo and I remember there would be occasional announcements and it was also I'm a dentist office they would say you know come to the dentist office X ray of the candy\nAnd and I followed that for several years again I I Would I Would pay attention to the news stories and I'd follow up and say did you guys actually find anything in the candy and the answer was almost always know\nFor something like you know it's it's a piece of candy if you have any any doubt throw it out [laughter] yeah\nI don't need to wonder whether there's something in the candy if if there's any reason at all you think its dubious you don't need to make but just toss it in a way I just the whole thing it's just silly\nNow my dad would go through it and say well let me let me look through the candy make sure that okay but he did it yes so they can steal stuff that he wanted\n[laughter] where where are the ethics hear what you know we need to go back to the days when people are ... of of of you know purgatory this ... you know this was something here\nWell what we did the you know sometimes I always think you know like little Linus commercialism when it comes to like a Christmas when did the haunted house has come out because you know those are cool and everything however it was it primarily for money [laughter] is it all these raises money right\nRight no no that that's a great question you know originally you know of course originally that the when when people begin first making disguised as I mentioned it was originally an Irish thing it was primarily restricts with the British Isles\nUh and then it came over with the with the first and second waves of of the ah the immigrants to the United states\nAnd in fact we mentioned a little while ago about some of the conservatives getting upset about it the Puritans I'm In New England or who of course are you know part of the uh the witch trials they have they were they were dead set against Halloween and that was that was a an occult abomination\n... hand so that for for so certainly for for for many years um\nOf course before there was mass marketed commercialized stuff um you know you couldn't go to the local store you know Halloween spirit store and get a a teenage mutant ninja turtle mask so your people were having to be creative you know boy the right\nYou'd actually yeah family is coming together to make a gift costume ... and what you find is that\nUh the the first um the ... the first record that I found of Halloween masks are really emerged in the seventies so it really dates back over a hundred years I'm a they weren't they weren't of course you know as foreign aid and you know plastic molded and stuff\nBut what's happened that over over the decades as as you know as marketing is turn Halloween into you know a much more of a commercial enterprise and you know it's big it's become commercialized for for better or for worse\nAnd this is when you start getting adults who are you know ... doing the the elaborate which costumes and you know the the you know the the sexy police officer costumes or the drag\nYeah\nAnd of course as soon as you have mass marketing then you have a you know you have the princess is right and you have Cinderella and you have peanuts and you have all that sort of stuff and so you know that that's fine I mean but I like you I I sort of ... I have a sweet spot for for homemade costumes that really creative and not just you know something with a mask slapped on it\nYeah it's fun for sure and so you know you talk about the history of it we now\nBasically what goes on now so\nHow do you see since you studied it so much and you really continue to do that how do you see the future\nOf Halloween how do you see it in about ten years Twenty years Thirty years\n[noise] well I ... a good question you know I think that um you know\nFollowing mentioned I mean it's it's it's very much wrapped up in tradition and folklore and stuff and all these things change right I mean we've we've talked about two or three different incarnations of Halloween going back to to win and then you've got the\nMixing it with all saints day in office all day and and you know we went to each interact with each you know a couple of generations changed a bit\nUm and I think that um I think it's probably going to remain more or less the same for the time being a you have had occasional places where people taking it too far\nIn Detroit for example it's it's known as hell night I mean there's the other like art and stuff it's like a scary scary stuff going on um but for the most part you know most people keep it keep it pretty simple I think that\nThat there's a certain sense about it\nBut I think it really feeling good it's not it's not Easter it's like Christmas it's not tied to a particular religion it's it's something that anybody of any of any uh of any faith and creed hum when it was like a dress up well I like to dress up right I mean you're okay for eighty year old kid like a dress up and so it's\nThere's something that is I think just inherently\nA humanistic and fun and and I don't think that's going to go away and\nUm you know it's still going to be knocking on doors national for candy uh you know I don't think it's going to change dramatically in the next ah in the next you know twenty or fifty years or ... you know who knows maybe two hundred years from now a ... there'll be a sort of you know virtual a go you know where you\nGot like holographic oh you got to that you got to think that he was laid the giant thing that would be cool\nThat's right that's what's going to be knocking at your door that'll be cool All right so we're talking with Benjamin Radford origins of Halloween we're going to a asking about this the panic part of it when we come back stay with us you are listening because because I Am I'm ... and this is ... tonight\nNever missed a detail on a show or a guest sign up for the ... ... email newsletter available for free coast to coast am dot com\nLeader largest\nIs going on a good thing we know what's going on\nTurn it on this thing here use radio seven forty J.

of Halloween\nAnd uh oriented time we are also by the way because he's a science based paranormal investigator he goes all over the world and investigate all sorts of great themes great mysteries that we all lost\nSo uh and he writes a lot of books his last book was on actually um investigating um goes goes hunting stuff so\nLet's say I want to talk a little bit more about the origins of Halloween and some of the areas and then I Want to talk about his book because it's very interesting stuff in there I think you guys are going to like and you know it works with the will of saline theme of goes tiny so Ben\nI'm as we talk about Halloween I Want to make sure you say everything that you wanted to say about it but I Want to know about that let's say panic part of it\nI mean it can really can get pretty evil with some people as much as I like the orange and black and the which isn't it you know and the Frankenstein and the Iraqi like kind of almost like the bubble gummy kind of\nHalloween that's what I like sure um but then there's this deep darkness in St panic part where people really do get creepy and scary\nWell yeah I mean one little things where I mean there's always going to be a certain segment of the population that take things too far right there's always going to be you know some some creep in some you know a mall haunted house you know reach out and grabs her grow somebody or whatever I mean it's there's always some of that but\nBut you know that's you know for every one of those examples or you know there's you know hundreds and hundreds of other people who who just you know have a good time with it\nUm you know I mean a a mentioned before you know so and was not you know there's there's nothing the panic about it a lot of ... sometimes conservatives cause panic because of its roots with with with pagan ritual\nBut you know the the ancient a health I mean they they they they didn't worship anything\nResembling the Christian devil at all I mean they if during summer when if you ask them you know if you told them about some some horn goat creature that you know the the evil they wouldn't have the paid hear what you're talking about it wasn't it wasn't part of the world view\nAnd and again you know it was the ... festival died out long before\nUm before you know the the the Christian concept of of of a scene and all that sort of came up and so what you find is that you know there there's there's tradition of course when you look at accidents twenty two Eighteen you know ... not suffer which to live on and so there's a there's a strong tradition\nIn in being concerned rightly or wrongly about a a cult influences right and so this was fine uh this is of course not just Halloween that's that's\nOne of the more uh obviously comes up every every year in coming up every year but I mean for example we saw the same thing in the Nineteen eighties with a concern over dungeons and dragons\nI'm and role playing games and heavy metal music and and ... and ... um I was up in uh I did a ghost investigation a couple of years back up at the heart to St James hotel in northern New Mexico\nAnd I was there during investigation and looking to go in and on the wall I I'd never seen that before I have a I have a photo of it if it weren't you board or strictly prohibited anyone using a ... will be kicked off the property\nAnd it was just it was just so interesting I mean the the owners were so\nConcerned that using the ... board was going to open up you know demonic corals or whatever\nI I I agree with that one\nBut it didn't say what was interesting was that it was it was codified on a wall and I'd never seen that like you know in the rule if you will find this don't use it and so\nYou know typically the concern is uh it's about kids because again as I mentioned for for most of most Halloween\nIt wasn't it wasn't centered around kids or was it was something that mostly you know adults and and and you know teenagers did you know whether it's a bobbing for Apple's are doing trick or treating but beginning in the Nineteen fifties\nThat twin because it was centered on kids that were the concern came from and so it was ... and that a kid the dresses up as a which are of goal will become interested\nIn witchcraft or wicker or vehicle because of that and that's that's basically the foundation for that and so this is why a lot of times um the the\n... parents who are concerned about that\nUm they do a couple of things one of them is they have instead of a Halloween party have a harvest party so the the the the they make a case to distinguish it from home and this is our way into the harbors party but there's lots of similar stuff and of course they'll they'll you know parents were concerned about that\nThey'll have the kids dressing up as princesses or something instead of anything that might be you know darker scary\nIt's so interesting because um you know everybody has their views and their opinions and and uh you know in in everything\nBut I just um I just remember as a kid loving that it was\nIt was like a fun scary and it was you know creepy in that like I said again you know black lights and uh\nUh we were um and I grew up in Louisville, Kentucky and one of the local radio stations that ... W. H. A. Y. was wacky and they had the wacky haunted house and it was\nIt was what your bigger brothers would take you to you know as a kid and\nIt got to be a family event and everybody would be there and it was the coolest thing of all is one of the biggest events like in the country I mean even though all the radio people still remember this from from back then it was a wacky haunted house\nThere was nothing nothing scarier it was all so much fun back then everybody had a good time you'd be dressed up\nA it was fun to be scared you laugh and then you'd go home and the next day you know that was that you eat candy for awhile and sometime you still had that candy\nWhen they came to Christmas and just the way it was right they sound\nMarathon bar amount either right away I assumed those\n[laughter] you'd freeze those have you ever had them frozen oh they were great under you're just taking me back your love is\nSomebody needs to a grad that recipe and make those again I don't know why they ever stop because you knew that everybody loved marathon bars my gosh\nYeah they were and they came and that was like a red and black rapper written\nOr something yeah and the real or on the back\nOh man I Googled after we're done here\nAnd uh and uh I I didn't know that um that uh what's his face was last year for McGregor so I I I learned that tonight in fact if I weren't here talking to you I'd probably be watching the fight\nThere you go it's gone now is there any way\nYeah Yup yup yup never ... all the producers were were watching that cell or hey you guys are going on there now so well\nKnowing all the origins of Halloween talking about the the past and even what you think about the future and the say panic part and all that good stuff\nNow another element is is some people they don't you know their past the trick or treating stage their past doing the tricks you know and all that kind of stuff\nAnd now what they do is they go into cemeteries or they go into the woods or they go into you know the um um houses down the street that nobody the abandoned homes or\nMinutes and we do have the long term construction to North ... into bound that said at the entrance ... will be closed until January of next year I'm Julia and then the ...

we're looking at the different technologies that are used as that goes for the most part they are ones that the replicate\nWhat we can experience right we we all we can see what we can hear and those sorts of things\nUm and so there's really no reason that I can see why we shouldn't have better evidence of ghosts because people do report seeing them people record you know the recording them [noise]\nUm and you know then you get into things like you know enough detectors ... field detectors and the problem is that there is no good scientific evidence linking ghost PMS um there's there's theories and there is speculation\nBut ... but no one has ever proved the you know the location with high EMS um correlates with with ah with go siting there was a guy named Michael person or a who tried to do some stuff with something called the got home it\nUh and that wasn't really replicated and so there's lots of pseudo science and sort of want to be science uh and goes hunting and that's one thing that frustrates me\nBecause I think those are cool [laughter] I think ... awesome if they're real than I Want to I Want to be able to find them improve them but I just don't see I don't see good quality research going on and that's one of the reasons I wrote the book\nAnd and I don't want a you know we can talk about this forever but just for time saying I Want to ask you what do you think those are I mean you think they're cool but why why why what is it [noise]\nWell you know I'm I don't know it goes or I mean that that's you know of course that's that's the million dollar question right I mean you've even even among the the ghost hunters and believers\nAcross the board there's no there's no single answer right some people leave their residual events that are you know the stone tape theory that there is something that's going on and\nThen you know some murder murder of tragedy that was recorded in stone and ... the the three played other people think that goes for in a dimensional beings other people say that they're you know the spirit of the ... that have gone on\nAnd and the very fact that there is such a diverse range of opinions is\nProblematic for ghost research right because\nGoes can't be both inner dimensional spirits and you know a an emotional recording into a tree or a house of murder and you know here's the dead so\nSo ... if you have a phenomena of it has such a widely disparate range of explanations that the problem so I I don't know what ghosts are obviously they're not they have been Scientifically Proven I think that\nThat my my best guess if they're real would be basically a folklore Rick explanation that would be there some sort of spears of the day that we\nWere we're seeing that they want to communicate with us for some reason\nThe good stuff for windows for Willis ... thank you for getting the information you had in fact that I Know you have a whole lot more that we can get a cute\nBut are coming up we're going to

looking at so what we're saying is this thing was as big as a small pony or you know your horse\nHe said and the interesting thing was he left over the edge\nJust let him that he said wait expects a
