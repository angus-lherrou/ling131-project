Mr ... as we talk about some horror films in a forest next hour we'll take your calls you questions and even your story ... give us some of your favorites you would have liked toured film since you were a kid having to you\nWell actually and and and briefly let me just say that William Castle wanted to direct a a Rosemary's Baby but he had such a reputation of doing gimmicky movies that they didn't let him do that but yet when I was a kid [noise] uh\nI was terrified of these I mean I I was like in my Spiderman pajamas a you know just sweating under the coffee table\nShaking with year I'd have to go into the other room I was the kind of kid that when the skipper we yell at Gilligan during Gilligan's Island I Would have to get out of the room you know it was a little too little too hot when skipper with yoga and whether it's ... you know\nAnd we were watching a move my dad and I I think what a lot of movies that bonding thing you know fathers son\nKind I'm the same way I was going to talk about that and I I Will but you're exactly right\nAnd and I think it's kind of a rite of passage you know and and I think originally I was watching these movies to kind of be with my dad and he would be in the recliner watching creature features right next to him are hiding behind the recliner sometime [noise]\nAnd you know it ... I think it was maybe I don't know if it was crawling hand or just the hand but they had this very convincing hand to crawl it's embodied hand crawling by itself\nSong you know I think I think women spend the money so I think that a lot of horror film corps has kind of been made and even with this new car or a with this new Halloween movie Jamie Lee Curtis is the hero she's she's going to kill a Michael Meyers when she gets a hold of them she ... she was praying for him to speak that as being asylum so she could blow it brings out\nAnd I think that having heroic women in these movies that you don't Star Wars you know and now a doctor who was a woman I think that you know it's a it's a it's a these are women are still spending their money on media physical media on movies\nAnd they're they're controlling that dollar and I think we're going to see a lot of wind five five films with strong female will\nThrow throw out some percentages I'm going to give you some age brackets here among those who are Fifteen Years old to twenty what percent of them do you think go to movies\n[noise] probably none [laughter] none really [laughter] twenty Fifteen to Twenty years old I I Know I I Would I Would say forty ... how 'bout\nThat alright twenty to thirty\nTwenty to thirty I Would say uh I Would may I may be a few that little higher maybe maybe fifty percent\nThirty to forty percent usually\n[noise] thirty to forty I Would say I would say larger I Would I Would guess maybe sixty five\nReally okay now I think it's such coming down forty to fifty years old\nForty to fifty years old I think you yeah I think it would really come down I Would think that baby baby a twenty percent fifty to sixty\nAnd I ... it probably even less and I don't know maybe the Fifteen year old might be hanging in there but I think maybe the six year old and and beyond are probably a much much more likely to um enjoy a film in their home and the trouble with going to a theater\nOne of the things we'll do just for fun next hour when we take calls for you is we'll ask the callers if they want to share their age it's up to them\nAnd bone on well and whether they go to movies or not I can't remember the last movie I went to I mean I I look at a lot at home on video I ... when you know they come out as a news new release or something I'll watch it um but I I Can't remember the last time I was in an actual do I\nDo enjoy I Do enjoy seeing a film in a theater with an audience but a lot of\nTime we'll let you ... and that's your ... your business\nSo I I I'm I'm by it because I'm watching the audience both I\nThat's what you do so that's one of the things we'll do folks who would take calls next hour in addition to your question your horror story of your favorite film if you want to give us she'd give time your age when you call in and uh let's ask you if you will when the last time you went to a movie\nOr you know what's interesting too about movies\nHow they have changed over the years I mean in the thirties and forties you had these grand musicals and these incredible songs\nAnd people were chance seen on them in the movies man those those days are gone\nMaybe they'll come in never know maybe they'll come back you know maybe George you know maybe you should dust off your tap shoes [laughter] you and I could make a all singing all dancing supernatural through\nThe I'm a single George never was a tap dancer [laughter] to me I just saw a clip on YouTube a Frank Sinatra and Gene Kelly dancing\nOr to take me out to the ball game they sang it has to do what and they were magnificent together I didn't know Sinatra could dance like that no and I always surprising how\nI always feel heavy isn't the cartoons ... whales and swaying next to a microphone I don't really think of him dance\nNow it's truly remarkable now are they still coming up with good horror films these days\nI pointed do you know you had mentioned the conjuring a movies\nI was five years ago it was good that was two thousand Thirteen was in it I guess\nThat's true but they're still making them yeah you're on the but I don't know third or fourth conjuring spin off by now I think\nYou know what I think ... the ... movie\n[noise] yeah you know they're rebooting that they've got a brand new no way and they're they're they've got their starting over with\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThat uh and uh not push them for their age though that means they're probably older than dirt and they don't want to Kelly [laughter] [noise]\nSo Mr Lovell tell us since you've been doing this for years now when of course the team and in ... twenty eight feathers that and that is fantastic and you have fun doing that and that's important isn't it\n[noise] I I if you have to you know I mean you're you're at once it stops and find the time to hang it up you know so it it it I think it has to be fought him and you know I my wife always makes fun of me when I get scared but it's like you know I get scared them get my money's worth you know so\nYou ever get so scared you don't want to go to bed or you feel like you can't turn a little light on out there somewhere or something\nYeah you know I Would go check to walk a fungal put something up against the war you know just in case chair something right up against the [laughter]\nAbove it All right let's take some calls we're going to go the first time caller bold truck driving in Oklahoma we're going to ask him his movie\n... was thirty four years old I Do do

that movie is that still scares me to this day when I watch it is a fire in this guy the the ... Holton but trapped as well yeah it was such a psychological thrillers you know it just it just um\nYou know it just well that was scary\nThat's that's the one with DB Sweeney playing the part of Travis Walton you know that story Mr mobile right\nOh yeah absolutely yeah my my wife was terrified of that movie that she would probably say that's probably the most aliens is the one thing that my wife loves horror movies more than I Do and that's the one thing that gets hurt aliens and she could not watch that movie\nI Know tremors Walton well why am I go to a lot of events where he uses speaker and I'm a speaker and it is really strange being next to him believing that this guy was abducted by extraterrestrials it's a weird feeling it really is and you know we passed a lie detector test\nThat's right yeah I think they took it took it more than once right from what I understand\nHe and his logging buddy sea boat do you have a question for Mr mobile\nI'm ... I was just calling to let you guys know that that was you know one of the movies that you still scares me to this day I'm you know just just psychological part of it I think more than anything\nNow it it really is next up let's go to Alex in British Columbia Canada Alex by the way is fifty years ... do you go to movies\nA lot more of a used to grow the ages of ... of the week\nWhile the older you got though you slow down and stop [noise] yeah yeah I Know\nThirty forty dollars ... ... ...\nJust three geez you're breaking up a little bit so we'll have Tom check your wind she we get a better connection for your question for Mr mobile it's our buddy time in ... California who simply says I'm older than George\nThank you for taking my call them ... going to movies anymore\nI'm older than Santa Claus so I mean it's a and you know yet how last time I was in a movie theater was Thirty years ago and\nThat's when you saw John Wilkes booth the jump from the theater\nYeah there you go I exactly\nI and I'm a lady that I was dating we want to see a movie on the spur of the moment at at a multiplex but it was sold out and so um we asked what other movies were available and um\nWe want to see John carpenter's they laugh while we sat\nThrough that movie twice that night and um the lady I was dating was scared out of her mind for a month [laughter] I was just I mean my jaw drop\nDid she at least hold your hand in Griffith\nYeah yeah absolutely and she just was I called that intelligent horror and this is the question I wanted to bring the Mr Lovell yeah so what are they are ...\nThey live excellent so by the way big big fan of that movie Nineteen eighty eight and there's the or the special Hofmann lenses that allow you to see the strings that are being pulled behind or\nWhat we think is real life oh yeah and the acting Keith David and I'm Roddy Piper ... was a fantastic I mean they just are in the\nSun glasses really make you eat that garbage can\nYeah yeah yeah you know what I really wanted to ask you about Mr ... was um there's another director of intelligent horror and that's an eighty and director David crying and bird and town\nScanners I'm One of my favorites was video Jerome with James words he's done other movies naked launch existence\nA high anti it's our video Jerome it's a good example of a movie that's\nYet I'll virtual reality gone hey wire type of thing and hallucinated Jenike but I'm Conan Bert creeps up on me you know as you watch a movie by him and I was wondering if the what comment I made it just seems like all ...\nAll of his you know I've heard the term body horror uh associated with his film and a lot of them all kind of have to do is uh physicality to everything where\nWhere it's getting inside of us are part of sorts in our body and I think that they're they're they're I think that's the ultimate intrusion you know I think that's the ultimate ah a violation you know and I think that he really uses that even in the fly I mean we just falling apart in the fly\nA the Jeff Goldblum fly from the ADA I'm also from eighty or like a like they live but um you know I mean it's it's a really um\nYou know he he\nAnd he and his attention to detail as amazing as always great makeup of sex\nAnd uh you

touching people and and uh\nUh we had um a you know all kinds of gimmicks the nurses in attendance than uh you know prize giveaways and I'm a ... a lotta corny stuff\nUh but those shows used for law they would travel and it pretty much was the birth of the midnight movie because you know the theaters didn't want to give up your eight o'clock movie or their ten o'clock movie\nAnd so um you know the the the people who are flow walling they what they were five or theater out you know they would they would show up in town with a film under their arm a scary movie\nAnd they they they would rent the theater out a after hours and they would show these are shows mainly for teenagers are usually teenagers who wanted an ac\n[noise] uh and sometimes rowdy ah rowdy teenagers too\nAnd sometimes they did as matinee for kids to\n'em but then they would they have these amazing blackouts where they turn the lights out maybe have luminous than\nGhosts made out of a ... that were you didn't phosphorus

sometimes they do three movies back back um with all these great get excited the magician and fight show act you know people putting nail through their nose and all that stuff\n[noise] what's the appeal of the Rocky Horror picture show remember without\nObsessively absolutely I think that that didn't have an audience participation aspect to it you know when when they have the toast everyone throws a piece of toast at the screen\nOr people have call and response where they're yelling things up at the screen a you know there's rice thrown during the wedding and I think it's in an immersive experience but I also think because of the sexuality of the film you know people who are sixteen Seventeen years old and they're kind of emerging into their adult life\nIt's kind of a ... thing that they can go and do with their friends and you know they might uh\nAccidentally see a little scanner so [laughter] so I think that all that factored in and and you have a you know people who who met met each other is sixteen year old a Rocky Horror and ended up getting married as adults and never\nAs I've I've seen that that I've seen the shadow cast in that speech or a performance that goes along with the movie performing very very different markets all over the country\nAnd over and over again I flew people who were met at that show and gotten married so I don't know what it is about that but you definitely find your people if you if you really are into that move\nHouston, Texas we go Robert's with us on coast to coast hey Robert go ahead sir\nGood morning George and Mr ... either

Marilyn welcome back good to have you again\nThank you George it's got to be here and how are you what's new I'm Glad it's\nBeen a wild ride I think that we're living in an extraordinary time saying why now and that just trying to keep balance and stay on the cutting edge\nHow did you end up doing what you're doing how does that happen\n[noise] well it started when I was a rebellious kid in Detroit and feeling like I wanted to change the world that had no way to do that and I had a couple of experiences started with uh being somewhere I shouldn't have done what somebody I shouldn't have been with\nA closing time in the bar on the back of a motorcycle and we got hit by a drunk driver\nRoom my body on\nA motorcycle and um I had a real physical tangible out of body experience and watched my body tumbling through the air landing on the concrete and\nI think it was something in that moment that suggests that any way that consciousness is more than just their physical bloom\nAnd then I went home to heal and they had talked about possibly amputated my leg and I lay there and I use my imagination to visualize my immune system healing me and I\nIt was you know really aware of the tangles up my leg you know now I have to study legs and I think that consciousness is something powerful\nAnd we're going to talk about you your first experience near death experience you were just a year and a half year old weren't you\nKnow that's true I was wandering around my family's house in my ... and being a good in pure assist which means you investigate everything\nYou have those little feet pajamas\nI think so I don't really remember but I've heard tales\nAnd ah anyway my father had inadvertently left a can of lighter fluid sitting on the kitchen table and you know I did what good Eighteen month old kids do and I put it in my mouth and I ended up in and out of intense drink\nI drink it and it causes massive pneumonia and I almost didn't make it so I think that there were some seeds planted then too that got me on this path of wanting to understand consciousness\nSomebody once you were wrong\nBut I guess that's a nice way to think about\nYou do know I was born in Detroit and raised there and left there when I was twenty eight years old\nI think I knew that but I didn't remember until now so tell me where was that I was\nBorn in the city and then we ended up moving to Dearborn Heights\nA war we spent most of my childhood and then uh my first places I was in tumor Michigan Farmington Hills and then worked in all three television stations in Detroit to four and seven\nAnd then in Nineteen Seventy nine I moved to to Nineteen Seventy eight I moved to Minneapolis a Nineteen Seventy nine I moved to St Louis knowing back and forth between St Louis in Los Angeles how about you know\nWell I was right in Detroit right near city airport and ah it was about the time I figured out I could leave that I left and you know I still have a lot of nostalgia for Detroit and a lot of admiration for the people that are trying to make a difference there family still there\nI have some family um they moved out to Harrison township where I had my modus motorcycle accident while you're born heights really yeah well he\nTold me where cars you must remember the the the street\nOh I don't I don't know who was ... was it a busy street\nYeah it was a busy street but it was late and I think the trauma kinda overloaded\nAnd I'm gonna I'm gonna close my eyes and yes you'll remote viewing now that you were on telegraph road\nMm that sounds that sounds about right\nNear Michigan viewing skill new Michigan avenue\nYeah that sounds about right I Can't remember exactly to say for sure but I'm sure there's records\nOf its ... year my gosh\nWell thank you my friend I appreciate ...\nReally steer you in the direction where you are now I mean you've got a PHD in social anthropology you've just been elected a vice president of the tourist psychological shows you usually get into that but this would lead the foundation for you well I think\nReally started when I got to Wayne State University in downtown Detroit which you'll remember\nI Do and what timers the Detroit\nA good one oh really so that is right downtown no um [noise] well I discovered to books when I got\nInto college in the first one was Thomas Kuhn book called the structure of scientific revolutions and that book said that we live in a paradigm or a world view a kind of social construction of reality and that that world view has changed periodically through history\nAnd that was a big empowerment for me because I felt like well maybe what we're experiencing in Detroit this\nYou know kind of civil war that was going on the race war and class war and gender war and ultimately a worldview conflict I think that um maybe wasn't permanent and maybe wasn't defined by ultimate reality\nSo that was liberating and then that led me to the second book which was psychic exploration by Edgar Mitchell the Apollo fourteen astronaut regard and I didn't apply for the job at no at sciences but it was about\nMm Fifteen Years later that they invited me to come and be there director of research and worked my way up the ladder from their\nNon Europe's you'll feel university no\nThat's right we're looking at ... personal experiences and from a psychological and\nNow what is the trench personal psychology what is the\nStuff you're interested in George it's all that\nKind of notion that there\nAre aspects of our experience that transcend the physical\nThat people can have these kind of altered states or near death or out of body type of experiences and it doesn't mean it's pathological it means that may be a catalyst for some big breakthrough to understanding more about who we are and what the nature of reality might be\nMore with Dr Merrill Lynch ... just like the beer right it is and he really really\nWell you know it comes from an old brewery village in Germany ... but uh actually ... brewery what she'll remember\nI remember that all Troy lists\nAnd so the beer that made Milwaukee famous actually is now a Detroit beer at least last time I checked\nThey do they do they still college which we're you know I don't know I haven't really an gobbled up it's been a death toll Hampshire\nRight over micro breweries have taken over\nWhat would it be you know what have you learned about\nNear death experiences above the other side what can what can you conclude at this point\nI Know that culture\nTakes a big role in defining what we experience so if we're told our entire life through our educational system and our families are work environment\nThat the only real valid reality is the physical you know that which we can measure and manipulate and touch and paste a son that's usually what we see and if we are brought up in a world your a culture that except\nExtended realms of possibility then we're more likely to perceive those realms of possibility and some of it may be a cultural construction but I also believe\nVery definitely that there are more aspects of our human experience than just our physical embody met\nAnd if people can tap into this and use it in their living life I think they can do some remarkable things with that don't you\nI really do I think that if we start to own the power of our intention\nYou know the fact that the intentions of very important principle so from the morning when we get out of bed and we intend to ... you know make up a path or a plan going forward that's an expression of intention\nUh and then what about those big intentions where we want to achieve something\nYou know beyond our normal capacity that becomes a tremendous empowerment and so to the extent we can begin to cultivate these abilities I think the more we'll be able to accomplish those dreams that many of us have\nHave you come across anything that still baffles ...\n[laughter] every day more and\n[laughter] I think there's just so many mysteries and again you think about\nWhat these different cultures expect from the world and you\nKnow being in the Amazon for example I spent some time with the actual are in Ecuador and you know

exploration and a wonderful adventure for people\nProbably could win a June ... before he passed on\nYeah very well regarded worked with him for years wonderful person Edgar said in the interview I did with him for death makes life possible that you know I mean I was really interested in his story because\nHe was the person who had been fighting in Korea he had been a test pilot and he talked about you know being on those aircraft carriers where\nWhen they would go off on a mission and then they had to come back and find the aircraft carrier in the middle of the ocean it was like a needle in a haystack\nAnd so for him that was a scary moment when he got in the Apollo capsule and went to the moon he said you know there was plenty of space on the moon and it was hard to [laughter]\nUm but you know his thing that he said that I thought was so wise is that he felt that was much more important to live a good life and to be a good citizen\nI'm to be loving unkind toward other people

after death\nAnd you have these people arguing their various position with witnesses that common goal exactly giving their own um personal testimony based on their experiences ... put it right there\nAnd then you get into this question of what would shift people's mind about that question and is it the data is it the fact\nThat in Stevenson collected these you know nearly a thousand cases and showed that thirty five percent of them correlated with the birth mark is that what's going to persuade people or is it the personal experiences that somebody's reporting\nYou know I had a conversation with my departed dad and he told me to go to this closet and find something you know that's really persuasive for people much more than accumulating a lot of data I think\nI I think so too Dr Merrill Lynch much were those were going to take phone calls next hour\nAbout life after death let's talk a little bit Marilyn and the time we have remaining here about consciousness and how important it please and its role but it plays with all of this what would you first of all say consciousness is\nWhy I think again we can have many definitions for me it's been about our awareness\nAnd also our lack of awareness of what we're not aware of so by that I mean when I first talked about Thomas ... book on paradigm shifts\nWe live in a paradigm or a world view and the interesting thing to me about world views is that we don't even know that we have them and yet they're the most important thing\nAnd it shapes their experience so it's like we're walking through life with these colored glasses on and it\nIt shape our experiences and so we can't see the thing that lie out side of our expectation\nAnd I think part of the process of becoming aware\nIs becoming aware that we're not aware\nAnd that we have what's called an attentional blindness for example we are primed to perceive those parts of the world that we expect to see and if we don't expect to see them we simply don't see them\nAnd I think that that is a remarkable uh aspect of what our consciousness is all about it's a lot of it functioning on auto pilot at the unconscious level\nAnd to the extent we can you know turn the light on what those experiences are and what shape are aware now where are we placing our attention then offers that's the point of liberation into expanding what we understand to be true\nDo you believe that the consciousness lives outside of the brain\nAnd I think consciousness is something that has intelligence it is self correcting it is reflective\nAnd so you can go into a rain forest and see that as consciousness manifest in forest because\nEvery now and cranny is filled with light and wet that intention to manifest life and so I I Do believe that consciousness or something much bigger than our individual brain I don't think it's an ... found that out of the brain and at the same time I think the brain is kind of like you\nKnow the radio that is taking the signal and so if you destroy the brain you may destroyed the radio it doesn't mean you've destroyed the conscious\nOr the signal or the signal exactly\nIt keeps coming ... exactly you will will science ever meet\nThe spiritual side of all of this\nSo I mean I think we're getting closer and closer all the time I just spent time with the the uh the Android she's a robot\nNear Hartford invited her yeah she'd be great for you to interview 'em and see if they would do it in a way that doesn't give me one or is a talk show host if she's in a good and\nWorry you're nobody better than your

things like pre cognition knowledge of the future uh people you know doing what you did about looking into your mind for information about a geographical location the whole remote viewing paradigm you know they're\nAll kinds of experiences that people have had that they report regularly and that the majority of our population and including people with\nHigher levels of education report so this isn't just something that people experience who have no education and you know the critics would say you know they just don't know any better uh in fact what it is is something that people have very direct personal experiences about and which can change their lives\nAnd you have written in the Bork how some people's lives have been changed dramatically through this change\n[noise] yeah I read a book called living deeply the art and science of transformation and we were very interested in trying to understand how people\nCan gain a perspective on life that is richer and full or and less filled with stress and anxiety and\nHow can we do that and we know that a lot of people can become very rigid and fixed in their perspectives and opinions but it's also possible that people\nYou know begin to shift their perspective and these kinds of experiences can lead to the sense that the world is more expansive and more complex and more\nMysterious than we had previously understood so we started to interview people about it we talked to the mystic some we talked to the great spiritual leaders and people representing different kinds of\nYou know traditional a ritual practice type of orientation send and not in that we really created kind of a change model that said to us that there are ways in which we can\nBegin to bring our awareness and our intention to creating our life in ways that are are positive are um imbued with meaning and purpose and that ultimately lead to happier healthier experiences\nHow the younger people react to these things you know what do you think\nWell I think we have seen a generation of people grow up with the media with video games that expand their sense of what they're capable of\nUh there's you know certainly a lot of fascination with I you know horror movies like you were talking about that last program\nYou know I think I imagine nations are very fertile I think popular culture has a way of training us and we know that these kinds of topics are extremely interesting for people who choose TV shows or movies to go see so what about\nYou know is that about just something that is idle curiosity or is it something that\nHelps them to take a deep dive into their own personal experiences and I think the ladder maybe what's happening\nWants to take some calls will pick it up are going to Giovanni in Los Angeles on the wild card\nLine either Giovanni hey how's it going in your room mate spent a war\nYeah and I've been a while and I'm always listening I Love the show as always and a doctor Marilyn thank you so much for the work that you're doing on consciousness is absolutely necessary your pioneer and I hope you continue doing your work and I hope that this uh this is both\nMore a wonder and and and and to this world\nBut uh I just wanted to share that experience of mine that I just really springs to mind when I heard you talk about the about the forests are about the jungles it ended up being a form of consciousness or a of a of kind of a a pure consciousness\nWell my parents are from Nicaragua and uh our our indigenous people are\nVery very uh very rich culture of 'em are mysticism and and also a you know being able to travel and to you know in three dimensional in and out and explore the potential of the mind through um through ancient practices\nAnd so it's been instilled in me over time uh the practice meditation one uh one one one one moment at one time I'm\nOn my travels I was traveling Nicaragua and the Nick and Nick and in Nicaragua there's a a jungle cold less than ... or roughly childhood or the the black a jungle and the this this black jungle is just as an Asian jungle it's\nMost of it as untouched by man very rarely explored still still rich with with a with a with undiscovered\nI'm a lord knows what's out there but uh when I was in the jungle I sat down to meditate and balls meditating maybe an hour is my meditation I felt what I believed to be the pure consciousness myself the jungle\nCalling me now it was so strong that I had trouble breaking for my meditation and and to a certain point I became a little bit tempered a bit bit fearful because\nI I was I kind of lost control over my ability to extract myself from the meditation for a moment\nAnd I believe that this is your consciousness was was calling me or or\nOr trying to pull me into it somehow and I wanted to share that consciousness I Do believe that there's more out there ... and uh the more we explore the more we'll find it's like you say yes we put it into our mind that there's something there we will find it as opposed to\nJust shrug it off and not believing something is there\nWhat do you think about Merle I'm so grateful for that comment on the question I appreciate your supportive words and I think that one of the reasons that many traditions have a guide you know a position in society that is that\nA spiritual leader or you know the mistake who's been on the past before so they can help guide the process uh because I think it's true that you can get pulled into realms of experience that are unfamiliar that are unchartered\nAnd that have the capacity to kind of take us out with them and if you are with somebody who's experienced in a lot of this kind of journey work\nAnd they can help calibrate that and you know keep you grounded in the experience but it sounds pretty remarkable I Will say one time I was in a meditation practice with Francis von who uh is no longer in this plane of experience but\nShe let this meditation where she took our identity into a bubble\nAnd the bubble left to the body and went off somewhere and I know that I got pretty lost in that moment and I thought\nIf I didn't have the kind of grounding that I had I could see how some people could be very frightened or destabilized by that and in fact there's a woman I'm Willoughby Britain who is a psychiatrist and it's really been looking at some of the\nDifficulties surrounding meditation you know we think about it always as a really positive thing but it's also important to recognize that sometimes people can get into realms of experience\nThat they have no way to navigate and so I'm very grateful for your question and your comments and I keep exploring it's a great adventure\nIndeed it is now ...
