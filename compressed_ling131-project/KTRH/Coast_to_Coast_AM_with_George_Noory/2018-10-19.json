important Georgia so I can see our insurance you\nI I Can't do the do you remember the ... story where he was getting on an elevator he could see or as and he looked at all these people in this\nThe elevator he couldn't see any ... scared the heck he didn't go in the elevator and the yellow beat or the cable stamp and the people died\nYeah you gotta love case the\nWord bat [laughter] absolutely George reminder as a psychic\nWhere do you get your I'll call the power where you get it from\nI don't think it's a power I oh God that ... where it really is distracting yeah a lot of people say that and I think on the guy has the ultimate power but the rest of us tune in and I tried to help people I've had a radio show four more years and I can remember\nAnd it's absolutely free to call in I'm very happy to have a ... and that's why she went and got the power from we all get our energy from it's our life for us we get it from God at the moment we take our first breath until we take out last breath\nSo the energy is here for all of us to you and I chose to use to help people\nPeople people listen to the show love animals joys in many of them owned them what happens when that pets that animal passes on\nThat's a great question our self connected to our animals [noise] well you know when my cat died we were so close they came to me is that night and he said you know mom I'm fine and I don't want\nYou to worry about me when I lost my dog he came to me and the little hospital bed the night he died and he was lying on his side he said I I'm okay now I didn't feel well before I pass but I'm okay now I Know it's so crazy they called me mom they really think that mother\nSo animals and that's your question tried to either go to a dimension of all animals are they usually go with the people they crossed over with they will stay with them on the other side so they're really no cut and dried rules about where animals go but they do\nHave a relief as we all do from pain and misery it's like a two wonderful dimension but\nUh I I don't want people to think the two sides it right you're supposed to go when you're supposed to go and\nYou know so a suicides are a whole different matter and I think Robin Williams and a lot of people have taught us a lot about suicides\n... birds are\nYes don't do it [laughter]\nNo you'd asked me if I see or is that I don't but I Do feel or as Joyce I Do have done ... ...\n... ... is a threat class sent you a sense than your feeling on that very intuitive so you can feel presses or like when you're with and there are a field is that what you mean George\nYes oh wow that's impressive\nSophia with the person who is not that good you would just step away from them you would pull back right\nYeah absolutely now there are some people who when I called psyche a\nVampire ... but they're not necessarily bad people they just have the ability to dream people's energy I Try to work with those people by the way I Try to help them and I've had some stories\nWhere they've changed and people began to like them again and surround themselves are on the person but I get a kick out of trying to help people who want to help themselves but just don't know\nThat's a form of hailing and that's terrific that's really really great because they don't know how to help themselves and you come in and it could be training for you but it's not because you know how to control your own energies which is really extraordinary for that's a wonderful form of hailing\nLet's take some calls are lining up here for you I'm going to give you a name and the birth dates ... the ... day in year and then I just didn't want to ask you a question to start would that be appropriate choice\nSure that'll be grave however you run a judge I think that's\nThe one that started with Christian Tampa Bay Florida Chris uh been born on October ten on October sixteen Nineteen Seventy October sixteen Nineteen Seventy Hey Chris welcome\nOh thank you happy birthday [laughter] I don't have much more than one\nOkay so tense exchange so you have a really wonderful new cycle beginning but it has to do with creativity you have a question Chris oh I'm\nVery much a creature routine and I just wanted to give their routines and our break his routine you're boring after a while\nYeah but here in Tampa that area is not boring it all to shift their and Tampa is a terrific area and do you ever do any kind of painting or art work\n[noise] um I'm used to I I Do some writing now\nYes [laughter] well you have Martin guard go at the time you were born and that tells me that you're you're extremely intuitive and you're very caught up details when you paint you should be painting again that's very therapeutic the press\nAnd that'll bring and wonderful spirit energy as well so you have a lot of intuitive abilities you have enough no Pisces so I Know you can read people very quickly so I thank you very much for calling it if you have a question\nNo that was there but thank you very much\nThey test scores in Russia last yeah hey there's nothing wrong with being in a routine as their Joyce\nNo but you know I sometimes have become really really discouraged and you say that has to be something else so at that point you have to it's very very hard to get out of Iraq really difficult for the most difficult things on the planet at that point you have to force yourself to do something you really don't want it to like whatever that might be\nA ... you know just just do it and go out you fit your energy will change change your energy though and change your life and tried prayer and meditation they got stuck\nAnd bring me something fresh and something no spirit will work with you\nDo you work with people teaching them psychic abilities\nSure are not only that but what the new website was starting which ah I mentioned before which is on my website we're going to be training people going to be helping them and uh in in all my books I say the same thing you don't have to pay a psychic for anything you can do this yourself\nIt's a God given talent that we all have just pay attention to your feelings listen to what you're hearing and stop doubting yourself and stopped saying it's my imagination\nYou know when you get that late night phone number going you're going to get a lot of insomniacs calling you\n[laughter] well that's okay [laughter] I'm probably up [laughter] to me I Hope it's twenty four seven line so you can call in\nTo the ... got a question for you in Canada and the international

before she passed\nA law was not there are other presidents you friends with Lou and she uh\nShe's very generously said a very good heart and she said thank you for saying that she thinks she thanking your day so you must have been pretty pretty nice to her\nSaying she was the greatest one of the greatest\nBefore I mean I can tell her energy is extraordinary very good heart interests\nKind you could ask afraid she would do anything for anyone but to have you not different from that yourself you very much like that you have a very good heart yourself and don't create for her she's saying look I have I'm fine\nYou know Jewish we're not going to escape death that'll that'll probably not\nGoing to happen to all of us are hopefully leaders in sooner but a user anything people can do to kind of mentally prepare themselves for this ... this trip yes\nDon't be afraid and know that you're never alone even if you go through the tunnel that follows the physical ... even then you're not alone you have always you always have an angel or a guide with you and then when you cross over to the other side it's fabulous you agree by people you know it's a big party\nAnd those of us who left here are grieving somewhere probably you know feeling really bad about it\nBut it's a joyful for them and if you watch the movie defending your life one of my favorite movies I don't know if you've

the ... this day Robert Moss has been a dream traveler\nSince doctors pronounced him clinically dead in a hospital in test mania when he was three years old from his experiences and many worlds he created his school back to dreaming is original\nSynthesis of modern dream work with the ancient shut Monica mystical practices for journey to the realms beyond the physical though he leads popular workshops all over the planet including\nThree you're training for teachers of active dreaming an online courses for the shift network a noted the author has got a number of books the most recent mysterious realities Robert welcome back my friend\nGot debate dreaming weaving with your joys\nLooking forward to this and would this tragedy that happened when you were three would you tell us again what happened\nWell festival my mother took me a Melbourne, Australia where we live in West distributed to see her on the upper thing I Am the psychic media and the main ...\nAnd she looked in the ... the old fashioned way and she saw my cat she didn't tell us she went out came back white faced well she was right that when they have made you when my father had been friends for the straight an army officer I got pneumonia at I died and help build it\nOh my parents that I had died as pronounced clinically dead and then they looked again they said oh you boy died and he came back so that\nThat is one of the first experiences of my life involving the stuff that goes into the new books I must tell you George I don't remember anything not sure what happened when I was out abide by the age three members rather hard living on his uh afterwards what happened afterwards when I was eight nine\n... died again pronounced dead again on the ... and the conditions and this is an appendectomy in an operating room in that time I remember what happened it sounds like the classic empty to begin with up onto the ceiling looking at the the the the scalpel under so didn't not money to be around going down\nDown the beach down to living up talk of some pocket Melbourne, Australia big moon faces the gate wanted to do with an old marine nine year old kid would want to do go on the ride or could go into some addresses\nSo I guarantee Luna Park age nine in my astrobiology and I'm drawn into I don't know that goes straight and maybe I'm drawn into another world and where I'm deceived by very beautiful very very lovely people and they raised me is that right and I forget that I've got a buddy in hospital bit\nBack adventure the opposite seeming to live a whole life of Ninety years old so and I'm shocked\nTo find myself in the body as a kid and and now the hospital and from that George comes my lifelong understanding that there will be on the physical you know nine years old who you talk about this she tried to talk it out that the medication you're hallucinating or something\nLike this person who could explain to me what happened in any way that made sense was an aboriginal kid from the indigenous tradition is that oh yeah we do that we get sick really sick we got to live with the spirits and then we come back and sometimes we have the same and sometimes we're not so the gift of these experiences which rings by coal dissociation\nWas an ability to travel beyond the body traveling consciousness without psychedelic drugs quite easily and an understanding that there are well beyond the physical and they are accessible\nYou must have been an amazing little boy Robert\nWell I'm not alone in a little boy you know I was sick I on my father's in the army's that we're moving all the time army brat situation I'll tell you all the things that kept me going is it amongst mine this book companions a phrase probably most of us remember from childhood was a big man and a lot of white hair and upping face\nThat come and sit on my they didn't say backup Robin you know you're going to make it through your survive I can promise you that you're learning now that you know goals and they'll like you and\nOne day all day you can't tell your dreams are easy right now people want to hear you that invisible companion George was the older rubber younger than I Am now traveling across time to cheer up his younger self and helped him come through one of the things I've learned is\nWe're time travel is in our dreams and when we developed the odds of conscious or active treated me as I call it\nOne of the cool things we can do is we can actually go back to younger self and be cheerleader and counselor to them in their own time and going the other way we can sometimes managed to talk to a wide itself who sees what life looks like a bit further down the road that we have gotten and can help us to get the right perspective\nAmazing now let's get into your latest work of course mysterious realities a dream travelers tales from the imagine all realm you call yourself a dream travel or what is that\nWell it means that one of the things going on in dreams is that we traveled beyond our old and read dimension of reality into other will we traveled a parallel worlds for example\nBut will lead in parallel lives this isn't as weird as some science tells us in the many worlds hypothesis that you are not living right now in one of many parallel worlds well how do we know about that in human terms while we might know it from our dreams in which we find ourselves for example\nIn consecutive episodes living a life a bit different from what we're living right now on may be radically different so that's part of a dream traveling mainstream traveling Olson means\nThat in our dreams in sleep dreams and then in conscious elusive dreaming we made travel to places where the dead or alive and this might be the source of understanding so low consciousness survive physical deaths isn't it pretty pretty important area\nUh so the idea of dream travel goes beyond the routine idea about dreams as the little bubble up from the snow subconscious not sold them going on a this was the ancient an indigenous understanding as lived in my life and told and stories from that life\nBut in dreams we traveled to other places and we received visitations from people who've come cooling those people to come calling my ... include a loving family members are ancestors of spiritual guides has some kind or another\nSo dream travel means we get up that we get beyond the body in the brain we get into that whole field of non local mind that science tells us about getting the condom information field to get into the ability to access sources of information beyond the Audrey and also part of this is that we are definitely time travel is\nAnybody who follows their dreams for wild and writes down will notice that they dream of events before they happen one function of time travel we see the possible future we can reduce the challenges and opportunities that lie ahead but we also traveled into the past from this life and her mother lives you learned about connections\nDrama is playing out in the reality is now the time periods in the multi dimensional universe so this is the key to dust and understanding of what the multi dimensional universe is all about this is the path of direct experiences papa dreamed travel\nAnd my stories in the book come absolutely and entirely from my own experiences in these areas and the experiences of some other people who worked with me and they're giving me permission to use the story\nRobert if we did not dream of course we all do not everybody remembers him but if we did not dream what would we be lacking as human beings what would happen to us\nI think we'd be locking quite often a sense of purpose a sense of Seoul since the spirit because you know one of the things that dreams do is they connect us to keep a source of knowledge of wisdom actually beyond the old and remind this was one of the reasons why\nMost human human couches across history about dreams and dream of say believe the dreams put you in touch with the guard or the goddess if you like but you can talk to with nature with the ancestors with the big self all the highest ... so we might be liking that I'd say terribly relevant to our times is that we might be lacking conscience stickers dreams\nCan be the voice of conscience and dreams can be\nA ... a magic mirror that shows us our actions and attitudes from a death on a more objective perspective then we can manage for our cells in indigenous people say if you lost your dream you've lost a vital part of your sold your dream sold in fact has gone missing\nAnd probably the scariest story in my book mysterious realities unquote dreamed takers\nAnd which takes a look at what it might begin to mean if you live in a society where people are divorced from their dreams have lost the sense of conscience I've lost the sense of a deep up ... percent of that by the gun to lose a sense of what it really means to be a human a fully alive human I think it's actually as important as that\nI was mentioning a Robert that some people don't remember their dreams what makes them not remember\nWell first of all we haven't made it socially rewarding fun to share dreams I mean we don't have good ways of talking about dreams most of us when we were a member of something a bit embarrassed how do we talk about this how do we tell us\nSo one of the things like you know society is a way that makes it fun and as I say socially rewarding to bring a dream to the table I invented the very simple false step process the sharing a dream of a story that

[laughter] yummy red faced man next to be as you looked like a fellow you'd like to hear a story and I look at the interest he introduces himself he's a former cop he's a former detective from the East Bay area all interesting\nHe looks at me he says Robert he's ... my name I have to share this with someone I was in the graveyard this week and I look at him\nIn a graveyard I've never been to before never been in this place and just having a walk\nAnd I'm thinking about a girl I loved and could never have from Thirty years ago and I looked down on the name of a headstone is her name the full name\nAnd there's the dates this person died last summer and I can't believe it or that I call\nShe's never beat in the air as far as I Know I make some calls I discovered she died last summer and something drew me to hand ... says what do you think of that I said it's a great story the very great story I mean not introduce his whole themes about\nYou know the energy and the connection that might exist between the living in the dead and how someone who has died my coat into sudden goal is to a certain place might even be an agent of simplicity but\nAs I'm telling us it's also an example of how like attracts like I like stories so even on a day when I'm staying at the airport I don't need a new story today I'm given what else to live as a story immediately just like that and in the ... these examples proliferate so\n... you know what it how it works is that the the the attitude and the energy you are carrying again to have results your attitude travels ahead of you in life\nShaping wanted waking for waiting you around the next corner which is a very good reason every tuning in life to pause and check your attitude check what is playing when you're in a soundtrack\nCheck what you're saying to you so Trump the negative mantras and self limiting beliefs and be open to something more positive coming into your life\nRobert is there anything physical about this I mean I Know we need the brain the dream but we're also tapping into I think the subconscious and it does its thing outside of the physical body but how important is the physical body to all of this\nWell I think about is very important like the first of all I mean scientists telling us there is no barrier between mind and matter anywhere in the universe mind Matt ... into leave at every turn in every level in fact some scientists tell us that the hot a matter\nOf reality is a dense consciousness so\nThat there's no hope of separating mind matter they're always play together\nBut when we think about the kinds of messages the kinds of discoveries that we're exploring we have to remember the party has its own messages his discoveries there's a phenomenon that used to be called pre sentiment which I experience a lot maybe you do to what it means in terms of the body is the body sometimes seems to know\nThings that are going to happen before the the mind of the brain can recognize what is going on the body reacts\nTo something ahead of time for example I go to the doctor for routine annual physical one time my blood pressure is much higher than usual even though it's controlled surprisingly high and there's no explanation for this until the nuts trying to do uh get get some blood for a blood analysis hits a gusher in my blood\nIs boat again it's all I knew lived in pants\nAnd after that I'm completely common my blood pressure is normal and she and the doctor trying to understand what just happened\nI said well this is pretty sentiment it's what's called an Alice in wonderland the the white queen gamble the white queen screams before she ... her finger so she doesn't have to scream when she actually picks a thing where I just did the same thing\nHad a reaction in my high blood pressure to it in the Ford took place on the doctor says my goodness that probably is a scientific proof of a sudden the phenomenon ... sentiment or anticipating the symptoms but he says but I couldn't possibly reported people think I was looted you well you know I said so I think the ... we know in our body all sorts of things we know everything\nWe know what the bleep we don't know that we know enough about it in all of a sudden medic response was we pick up things from a distance from other people and we feel with the feeling in our body as well so that's part of the story\nNow you teach active dreamy what exactly is that Robert\n... dreaming\nIs a way of getting active with dreams and the sense that you again to remember your dreams you got to share them the right way to you're going to take action that will empower your life and bring some elite energy and guide in July from your dreams I mean that's one aspect of it\nIt's also method of loose the dreaming you could call it shut medically dreaming we ... my favorite way of talking on the loose and dream adventure\nIs to start out lose to stay loose it what does that mean that means that we use shut many drumming in the workshop\nOr we might take a dream that we remember as a starting point we might decide okay the romance and adventure steel industry let's go on with the dream let's get back inside the treatment have more we might decide okay it's time to brave up to a nightmare terror and stuff the stuff going on\nBy going back inside the dream and I think the scary based on its own grounded might mean I Want to talk to someone who turned up in my dream whether it's spreading Merrill someone else\nSo that's an example of traumatic loose a dream yet another example is that I encourage people to spend a lot more time in that drift each try like state treating sleep and wake because that's where creative connections made where\nWe are extremely psychic an intuitive and creative naturally so I encourage people to instead of complaining about being awake in the middle of the night\nRelax into that state make it a state of horizontal meditation if you like I tend to the images of rise and fall and see what he wants to make one of the scenes will come to you the porch will loose and dreaming and finally\nActive agreement with the method is also about treating with your eyes wide open we ... how to look for the outlook for science books in the world around you so this is also a program on a method\nOf attending to the dream like symbol of everyday life\nRobert did the dreams ever mislead us trick us basically\nI don't think that dreams and felt the misleading I think that a spin on the dreams can often be misleading we might be in a rush to interpret reminded to interpret according to the wrong standards I think I don't think the dreams and themselves as a deceptive I\nMean we can pick up things in the night of the problems that are floating around that we don't walk around we can pick up things from other other entities from whether they're just a bit confused or militias that that can be confusing or deceptive but I think that any image that belongs to is that is truly our own\nCan be worked in the service of hope and healing it might not be great to begin with it might be horrible my dream of some horrible based but by learning to go back inside the dream and confront the issue on its own ground you might find that behind something that's scaring or worrying and you and\nYour dream is a power power of understanding of power that might might give you all kinds of spiritual ally or life guide a life coach if you're willing to work with the material I I think as I say that the dream is not deceptive but a rush to interpret according to a narrow understanding what dreams is about can be very misleading\nYou got to Robert we are going to take a quick break we'll come back and take phone calls and continue

interesting title but the part of that is in the previous documentation is the human dreamed again and again before his death\nBut he was living in a Bush and all his retreats on the lake come legs Oric\nWhich was called bowling get up in the nearby village is living in another bowling gun on the other side of death and those close to him said that he lost all the or death you felt absolutely confident and so he knew where he was going to a towel on the other side of death on the lake and in\nA story in a mysterious way out of his co beyond the ball to gun I follow you on\nTo that possible afterlives situation on actually gives some insight into where how humans mind might be working right now is he works on a great new books are you in the off the life I mean some people might be shocked and surprised\nBut to Rob is crazy enough to think that you would have an audience with him from the other side of death but you know you'll himself wrote a great deal not always the publication about his contacts with the deceased he talked in his in his memoirs and in his red book about extensive conversations\nHe had with the power to the shaped your view of reality and he was one of those are always understood the one of the key things about dreaming is this that gives the first time the ability to understand what happens to mind go consciousness off to death because his dreams as you understood\nWe receive visitations from the department that I didn't dreams who made travel into the rooms where they are at home but very briefly one more thing about him\nAnd his relevance to this book is my approach to everything\nHe came late in his life to the conclusion that one of the things going on in dreams is that we live I'm quoting you continuous lives and other realities that we perceive and dream so I'll dreams maybe memories\nOf ongoing life situations nothing this reality but somewhere else\nBut we visit again and again when we when we slip out of the body and go into dreams\nSo this is a great a dream Sherman of the west he knew and the manager of a Sherman is a ... to through a deep and horrifying experience of an under will journey and he paid

your most Freud favored apprentice but they broke because young because Freud although a tremendous scholar and pioneer of understanding dreams in his own and writes who made himself his number one study\nWhich is what you need to do to listen to to anything on dreams from someone who's not a dream of\nDespite all that Freud adopted rather narrow view of what's going on in dreams or rather narrow theory and he tried to apply to humans dreams\nAnd you only had famously a dream in which he's in a house that is on many levels and in the basement area fall below the comfortable Bush ... upper level is is uh the floor and bones and skills and something primal\nAnd Freud insisted on interpreting the dream to young as something to do with you know a mother complex and the desire to see somebody dead and you didn't break with him at the moment but then eventually he did because he felt that Freud was putting his dream experiences into a coffin of narrow understanding\nAnd that breakup was very interesting because the company by synchronous stick phenomena you talked about the body and Matthew in relation to these things and one of the conversations with human Floyd approaching that bus stop there's a tremendous crack in a cabinet to avoid stop so how scared and confused and\nAnd and and you wrote in describing this he felt something ... and his belly like a hot
