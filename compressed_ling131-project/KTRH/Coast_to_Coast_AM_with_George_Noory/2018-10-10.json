disclaimer before we get do you go ahead Lawrence\nRight that I did consult the Google several years ago so\nNow what is Google Plus for ...\nIs a Google of a social networking platform it it is the equivalent of Facebook or Twitter in\nThe Google ... said I've been using it since really became available ... years ago [noise] um there's going to be missed\nWas the enemy myth by millions of people you know there's this story for going on for ages with a ghost town there's nobody out millions and millions of people use it very happy with it I've been very happy with it [noise] really in a way they were sort of a victim of their own success because when they when they started Google Plus throughout its entire run\nGoogle decided not to put an ad on it so there was no ... there was no way to buy ... hosts right these are both things that drives people crazy or his book\nSo there was no separate income stream coming from it\nIn the meantime everybody got kind of look or by Facebook into thinking well you got to have you got to have the author post you got to have these things that are manipulating your your time lines and everything and they got a massive number of people onto their platform now of course a lot of people are kind of regret it given what's been going on\nBut sizes everything was social media scale is everything and Google just never really got that scale now this brief that occurred\nWell all the right at the top of they currently found out about this for a month ago they should have publicly about that at that time [noise]\nApparently there is that they really didn't as they found that in a during ... as I understand that during their own auditing their own security auditing and they didn't have any evidence that it's ever been exploited in other words it with a theoretical father ability but apparently nobody knew about it outside of school and\nThe kinds of information that we're that we're a theoretically vulnerable where like name and email address no credit card numbers of financial information nothing like that a lot of stuff that people have with Facebook so they said well why are there things up when there's so much going on right now I mean that's my interpretation\nAnd they kind of sat on it and write and now of course it kinda makes it a convenient\nI won't say excuse but ... but it it convenient to kind of a rationale for setting into motion the sun setting of Google Plus over a period of about a month but they they should have discussed that publicly the first place um and uh it would've been a lot better all around if they had\nIn the meantime all of us who've and using Google Plus all these years or try to find other places to go where experimenting with other things and I mentioned that there the Google

I'm often asked that I Would say yes they were very surprised to hear that uh but I think as I Hope people about the evidence that I was referring to people perked up and we're interested in the fact that I was taking the time to research and write a book on this topic\nNow let's talk a little bit about some of the things you uncovered that you didn't really know about before telepathy pre cognition tell look as a cycle ... he says you you of course mourned a little bit about them but you learn more as you did more be research didn't you\nWhat we find in the study is that there is a very subtle again highly statistically significant effect think Jeff thing that the body is responding in the direction of the picture eventually shown seconds before the picture is shown\n[noise] years ago during the television days they would hire a group of people lose people are based on a system called the ... skin test and it was a series of electrical impulses that they would hook up with audience members to and then they chew videotapes of various anchor people\nAnd the the one that showed the most remarkable response\nOr from the audience because of the skin test they're the ones that got hired or they were looking for some kind of reaction from people and the person who just you know didn't register at all on the meter\nUh with the people in the audience they never got hired I I don't know if they still use that or not but it was amazing technology back in the seventies\nOr that type of technology that is being used in pre sentiment experiments measuring skin response\nAmazing work no psycho Comey says is the ability to move objects with your brain what did you want to cover their\nRights again this is something that doesn't make any sense at all under the material is paradigm consciousness is considered to be at the phenomenon of the brain that comes out of the brain has no effect on the world what I found in my research is that that might not be true and\nI think the most compelling studies that had been controlled are once again that show very subtle effects\nAnd they were actually done a primarily at Princeton University which is interesting because I went to Princeton University and I had no idea of these studies were being run\nA Dr Robert Johnson who was the former dean of engineering a rocket scientist ran a lab for nearly Thirty years running these studies and he also look at remote viewing but he also he looked at ... which is disability for the mind ... matter\nThe classic study uses random number generators that these are machines that\nSpit out the heroes and once in a totally random fashion so again if we look at probability overtime a random number generator will have fifty present zeros and fifty percent one over time\nWhat the experiment does it asks people to put their mental attention to the machine to make it produce more ones and zeroes for example and the person doesn't even have to be in the same room\nSo they say hey I'm pleased put your mental attention to the machine and make it produce more ones and zeroes again what do we find is that there is a small but highly statistically significant effect\nWhere it seems as though the mind is is changing the what used to be random behavior of the machines\nRandom generators picked up a some incredible responses during the tragedy of nine eleven in two thousand one\nThey did not know what the time what was happening what was going to happen but they felt something was going on because these random generators mark just went ballistic and in ... people have that ability or have\nThat's right George ... those to me or perhaps even more remarkable and this is part of the global consciousness project which which was an offshoot of the Princeton studies where these machines the random number generators were set up around the world so people weren't even necessarily aware that the machines were they're\nGenerating these numbers and what the experiment yours have done is looked at the behavior of the machines around the world\nAround events that we know a producer heightened emotions and nine eleven is one example of what we know that people had heightened emotion and it happened at a constant trick basically in a single moment that we can look at what was happening when everyone was focusing their attention or many people are focusing their attention on the events\nWhat do we find that there was a spike at nine eleven but in the case of nine eleven which is even more fascinating to me is that the spike happened before the plane hit the towers\nBefore the event yeah before the event which suggests almost a global pre premonition that this was going to happen\nWhere are you ... you know that name of course had an incredible ability or if you believe what he did for ... she had the ability to bend spoons and keys and everything else which\nAnd now there are some who say doll which trickery its magic but do you

ridiculous but ah I've looked into it and it appears that people train themselves to be able to use their mind in a way to to act matter beyond just a random number generator which actually\nBending

something that might have happened twenty or Thirty years ago\nBut either cardiologist for Apple factor in that law all I Am aren't yet from Stony Brook another one that will find that you're looking at that and what they're finding is that some percentage of people who are in cardiac arrest\nOn back and describe this near death experience and why is that again in cardiac arrest severe physiological trauma and many of the person is clinically dead we know that when the heart stopped after a certain amount of time there is no ... at the brain and the ...\nFunctioning so if there is minimal or no brain functioning we would not expect people to have these experiences that are so vivid to them and as I mentioned earlier sometimes what they report during the near death experience when they're out of their body is verified as being accurate later\nI'm One example in particular is\nFrom Dr Sam ... in a peer reviewed journal called resuscitation in two thousand fourteen\nOne of the patient in particular had a very vivid out of body experience where he heard something in the room it was later found to be the difficulty later and we know that this happened during the time he had no brain functioning because the times were being stamped and we know when that if they brighter went off and it made it very distinct it's down\nAnd yet this person came back and describe the sound in the room that happened when his brain was off\nWhere there have been cases as well where somebody is literally gone through this near death experience there floating above their body\nThey see the nurse and the doctor and everybody in attendance talking about the person you know well sorry we're losing enemies dying or whatever then they come the person comes back into his body and tells the attending doctor exactly what he heard\nAnd it boggles your mind\nAbsolutely it doesn't make sense according to this material is perspective that we need a functional brain in order to have conscious experiencing memories\nAre but what I found is that they're very credible scientists that are looking at this burden apple university of Virginia the division of perceptual studies at the med school has looked at this very closely and Dr Bruce Grayson as one person in particular\nWas looked at these phenomenon and is is finding that something is happening when the brain is not functional and people are able to report things like what you describe where they couldn't have known about things through normal means and it seems as though their brain was off and they said something that was accurate which is not by definition if not who's the nation\nMarquee Iran six hundred and twenty terrestrial radio stations as we speak and they're all sending out signals in the cities and markets that the area\nYou can't see those radio signals bullets they're out there is that a little bit ... with this is like consciousness were sending out signals that you can't really see but they're out there\nThat's such an important point I think we tend to be biased by what are ordinary a perceptual systems can tell us particularly our eyes and ears but we know it's not even controversial to say that our eyes show or a small sliver of the electromagnetic spectrum\nAnd what we're dealing with here may be something totally separate from the M spectrum but we know that our eyes only show us a very small sliver of reality so I Do think that maybe there are things beyond what our normal ordinary perceptual systems can show us\nAt our existing but we just don't perceive them\nAll right let's take some calls here for you as they begin to line up and I've still got a whole slew of questions for you mark and by the way for a non scientist you're doing an incredible job on this topic you can learn a lot damage you\n[laughter] I have and I hope to summarize it in a way that a general audience can absorb it\nLet's go to bill from West Hartford Connecticut kid at Connecticut built by the way is an amateur astronomer and an atheist hey bill\nHi George Hi Hi Mark yes I Am a rational atheist than a materialist however I Do think that there is something to near death experiences I Do think ah there is this phenomena going I just think regarding and the ... ah where where the mind\nI Would use the word mine not sold but mine are conscious just goes uh or or exist temporarily during the ... is not having are held in a religious sense just like there's no God or no devil I Would call an energy dimension or an energy universe and I have a new term for it I wouldn't call it may be\nSeeing you ... know space no time a dimension but my question to you is specifically a I like to\nSort of question your whole premise by talking about site medications all explains psychiatric medications medications free during the ... or depression whether it's anti anxiety drugs Claude ... antidepressants or major tranquilizers ... [laughter]\n... chemically the brain and therefore they do affect chemically the consciousness meaning the mind so by changing biologically biochemical either brain through these medications or even aspirin\nOr Tylenol ibuprofen can it can affect the brain that through the headaches the going back to cite made it can affect the brain chemically we know that positively and in the mind\nThat's my first part my second part of the same one question is\nAlzheimer's disease dementia affects the brain does affect the conscious is the mines does thing that show it here's my question for you it doesn't that show that it\nThe mine and the brain are not the same thing at least the brain is connected to the mine is connected to the brains and I'm trying to say\nThank you very much for your question bill and this is something I Do address in the book and I thought a lot about personally because we do know that there is a strong correlation between what happens in the brain and the type of conscious experience we have whether it's like medications or if someone gets in a car accident\nAnd then has cognitive impairments we\nKnow there's a correlation what I argue and and some others argue that says well is that correlation does not always imply causation in other words just because two things are related to one another\nWe can't automatically conclude that one causes the other so here's this simplistic example from Dr Fernando Castro when when I mentioned in my book imagine you have a fire\nLots of firefighters show up you have a larger fire more firefighters show up\nA very strong correlation between the size of the fire and the number of firefighters that appear at the scene\nWe'd know however that the firefighters did not cause the fire that's not the nature of the relationship but the firefighters are highly related to the fire so I've used the brain in a bit of a different way with a grain of highly related to consciousness you damage the brain if you take psych med the brain and consciousness will be affected\nBut the brain I view it more as like a filtering mechanism or like an antenna receiver which similarly which show a strong correlation between what's happening in the brain unconscious experience but it's not the producer of consciousness\nWhen ... what do you think mark of reincarnation\nWell I have a chapter on that in my book about the studies done at the University of Virginia I think there is evidence for it\nWe we've had some incredible stories too of people who have talked about their past lives including little children uh and it just is remarkable when they're checked out there's no way that they would know certain things unless they experienced it is it's it's mind boggling isn't it\nGeorge I agree with you it's the chapter eleven of my book and I think the most compelling cases in addition to children being able to recall thing that they shouldn't have any way of knowing\nA man or sometimes they're five by medical records by the UVA professors is in some cases the children have birth marks or physical deformities that are very specific that matched the way the child describes dying in the previous life yes and in some cases the medical records are found so\nIt's it's something that's beyond genetics beyond environment which are the two factors typically considered to affect the physical something else was going on and\nThe researchers call it a third factor\nOr a person's petrified of water and then somehow a in hypnosis they died in the past life by drowning let's say\nExactly so it's preferences and fears that somehow or transferred to something beyond the body seems to be a transfer from wanting distance to another ostensibly\nWe have Monique in Southern California with us I'm On

in my work I've often not often but several times over my career I had the opportunity to accompany a rural folks farm folks on balancing with water which\nIn yes okay I've seen it work the at work and then seeing the drillers calm and drill right to that same to adapt\nAnd there it is on the water and there it is you\nKnow again I'm a scientist okay so it's not that there is this something there that we don't fully understand\nThen can we say that it's the ... the person or is there some other force behind it\nWell let's suppose let's suppose that ah the Dow is er and\nI've seen it with three different methods brass rods\nWillow sticks and tendons over a map mhm okay I'll watch pendulum over a map which was the most strange is one of all that somebody could could could find water and

to to to the native folks that lived in that country that made that animal a pretty sacred animal\nAbsolutely let's get a quick reaction from you mark is the time was clicking by here now there's no question that if science skin say the things Steven just said we're on her way isn't it\nYeah even raises a number of really good point about the need\nStudy these women are much more to understand the nuances of how it works I don't think we understand some of the mechanisms because it hasn't been studied widely enough and that's largely because it's so taboo particularly an academic institution even talk about these things I talked to scientists you say that it's\nA academic suicide effectively to talk about these things before getting tenure\nSo that's another reason I really wanted to write the book and the evidence one place for people to hopefully open up the conversation that it's not such a taboo topic\nWell Steven as a scientist admits that there's something very strange going on you know what it is but he's open to at least say that it's unusual in different than you know something could be happening\nMhm [noise] well we haven't talked much about quantum mechanics here but it's a field that has been around for over a hundred years which is accepted in the community as being real but it's totally counterintuitive there's a phenomenon known as entanglements and the very basic phenomenon is you have to particle two pieces of matter\nAre physically distant from one another and when you affect one you affect the other simultaneously like an instantaneous effect\nWhich suggests that there's some hidden interconnectedness that Albert Einstein did not like this at all he called it spooky action at a distance because he thought the speed of light what the ... that anything a travel and yet here we had an instantaneous connection between ... articles\nThat thing in the fat an average of reality that are totally counter intuitive but we just don't feed them in our everyday\nLives has this changed your life it absolutely\nHas I think from the standpoint of understanding human potential and what we can do like ugly it opened me up completely but also it's it's introduced this notion that interconnectedness the idea that we're not actually separate even though it appears that we are\nAnd that takes on it brings a whole new meaning to things like altruism which is ... and helping another is really a version of helping ourselves but to me that it hadn't implications for interpersonal relationships all the way up to well\nAll right my friend mark thank you again in one more time you bought your website and where people can get your book an end to upside down thinking\nThank you George my website is mark Goldberg

and the unbelievable let me tell you about marine fifth generation psychic tranche medium for as far back as she can remember\nShe is communicated with the deceit shut the age of Fifteen\nShe was introduced to a person who studied with laureen Cabot\nWas the official which upset with Massachusetts and she took Maureen under her wing and Guided Tour and ways to not only understand but also control this gift at the age of Fifteen she served as the medium for adult San says\nShe's practiced studied and instructed metaphysical studies for more than twenty five years\nMaureen has been with the New England ghost projections two thousand one and it was a company ... more than one hundred investigations here she is on the coast to coast Maureen welcome\nOh thank you so much for having me we could afford to the foreigners Fifteen Years old all the shopping for you\nYes uh I Know as you're reading that I'm thinking oh my God that was only a few days ago right\n[laughter] tell me about Lori Cabot the official which I'm sure he will\n[noise] you know he's very a a wonderful\nWoman when I was at that age Fifteen you know she was someone that was rarely renowned in the city and she still is\nUm she's known as you know the high priest is of Salem and you'll often when I was younger see her walking around town you know dressed in her her guide and very regal looking very um you know she's ... big presents for a person\nAnd at the time people will come up with open arms you did they go oh my God news or which\nYeah that's a great question she you know there are many people that welcomed with open arms but let's just say the town\nAnd Sam I'm not necessarily [laughter] so it always seem to be at those days it was a little bit of a battle between the businesses and you know and the town in Salem and those who really believed in the witchcraft and um so basically she did you know she really changed\nThe whole way they look at it now you know obviously it's a big tourism right for the type of these and then it's you know go to Sam I'm so I think that it really worked out well for the town of ... you\nKnow you are a generation psychic tranche medium that means we're talking about ... back to family you said the stability what year are who do the start with\nNo my um [noise] it's interesting because growing up my mother just\nNever really wanted to I don't know if you don't want to scare me she just you know my father though he thought just those girls insane [laughter] um but I Would come to her and talk to her about spirits I was seeing and I to me it was normal it didn't seem unusual I didn't have anything to judge it by\nUm and my mother would just you know God Bless her she'd say oh here's some holy water you know just to you know she told my father she is normal\nUm but she didn't really discuss it with me a lot until I was older and I was still\nYou know involved let's say in the metaphysical and that spiritual around and one day I mean she was talking you know in their sixties she finally told me that she is you don't want Maureen\nThis has been from my family for many many years like her great grandmother and you know her grandmother used to help people in town and he'll them of their illnesses and keep them stop them completing\nReadings for them and she said you know I hear the spirits but I just turn up the radio\nSo\nWould you see that there was a member of your family the was better than another member\nI never you know never really quite thought of that um I Would say that I had you know my grandmother died when she was twenty eight so I never really knew her\nUm but my great grandmother my grandmother rather I did know and she was the one who really got involved with doing readings for people so I heard that you know she was very trusted in her city or in her town\nUm so it's hard to know I mean I don't know have a lot to really judge by in my family history of who was might have been stronger than another\nDid they ever passed dome stories from one to the other the the you could carry through\nYou know the only thing that I Do have was given to me and uh I have this little picture of you know and it was my grandmother actually before she had passed and she was maybe maybe five years before\nShe passed and it's interesting 'cause she you had a picture of her and she looks like a gypsy\nUm and my mother used to joke about it and say that that you know that was her true so she was very unique because that's what you said so then the stories that God will always bits and pieces never never anything that was really concrete that I could say I'm about spirits anyway\nYou know you've been with the New England it goes project Maureen since two thousand one would use that\nA well run do much better than me\nTo tell the story but he started this story after on a near death experience um and he had to work and do a um you know a special course our class that he took\nTo try to keep him busy when he was hailing from his illness\nI'm and basically he started doing a cable um you know he's got a cable program and during that cable program he had to do it on something so he chose you know doing on goes that his workshop and again he'll do much better at explaining that I Would focus on but it's a team of individual that\nYou know over the years I've learned you know to me everybody is really you know it's a great team of people you work really hard to get to go out and you look for things that go bumps in the night you know someone else doesn't really want to\nTo want to look into that they're quite satisfied not knowing about the unknown or you have someone that really needs help there's been many calls over the years to run in the team um that were you know businesses um you know families you know you'd have restaurants and they don't really want to\nDo I go out and tell the public all the time this was years ago they don't want to tell the public that something is going on that they can't explain\nAnd people were getting a little freaked out and they need help so it's really been a journey of love I think to go out and actually work because we're not paid you know it's not something that we get paid to go out and do investigations of people it's really going there to to just help on\nHow many people are just a off the wall when you go to their house and then you're just using it\nWell off the wall meaning terrified of spirit you off the wall just crazy\nNow show [laughter] sure why his birds I guess\n[laughter] um you know as as it says we've\nDone more than a hundred investigations\nUm I Would say that you know not a hundred percent would we find something active going on at the time\nBut we are big believers to know that you know it doesn't always happen on command [noise] um so I really believe that there are a lot of supernatural things that are going on on if you're aware and you're open to it you might experience it you know some people say well I've never seen it and I don't believe in that well there's a good reason why you don't see it\n[noise] um so if you say how many people I say good percentage of paranormal activity does take place out there and I would bet that if you did a poll and you ask people on the street you'd get a good amount of you know maybe Seventy percent of people have had some odd experience they can't really explain in their lives\nWhat have you conclude about what this may be I mean a lot of people have their thoughts about what ... what do you think they are\nWell I think there are varying\nDegrees of what they could be right so our experience and my experience over the years has been\nYou know if I Do a reading for someone for instance um I get more of a loving spirit someone that's passed over that wants to communicate and come back and you know let their loved one those are okay or maybe has a message for them that they weren't able to give before they pass\n'em but then you know you're called out to some locations where\nYou know things aren't really going while someone's gotten thrown down the stairs items being tossed around the house um\nThere's different you know events like say a you know people walking by and then you might see a spirit walk by and all these plants just die as they're looking at them um we had one case of a woman who was living by herself with the door\nTo door closed in her apartment and yet she was hit on the back of the head with a a ballot stripped from the stairs on you know all these out she'd have something go on in the oven like she'd go to put potatoes and rolled 'em and spoil and should lay down and take a nap while they're cooking and\nYet they would fire would start in her out and um it would wake her up with the alarms going off and she'd get up and look in the potatoes underneath on you know on the plane itself\nSo what do I think I think again as many different varying degrees of paranormal activity and not all of it just like you don't have a person that's a hundred percent knife\nA couple of overnight construction zones to be aware of the of the south and east about a two

why it happened so she finished it will just be on one side and then I get up and begin to talk it suicide began to speak what are the books from behind me came flying\nLa la la until the middle of

was somebody back tossing they match you\nI'd certainly looked in ... so you know but that was just a ...\n... what has for you that you know on the cases that you've been in have you ever felt that your life was in danger\nOr never buy the did\nNot find it just by the leaving me\nAnd I first book or goes chronicles is moguls Quantico says is the second book on the series a marine and I didn't investigation that was the daytime and investigations jumped him and called me up and\nMe to check out his house so I gather in moderating up and we went to his house and the places that massively looked like it had been trashed and\nThis guy insisted that there was this spirit of a young girl there and uh so anyways uh they were pretty big ... ah and ah they kinda got us for a while after we did our thing and\nAh one of them move separated me from the other one and the other one talked marine we later found out that that the guy had just been released from prison for murder or a friend of his and so he won the marina comeback alone but that didn't turn out so if there was any fair was then [laughter]\nYeah she was telling us that story before I Would imagine it's it's one that's left an impression with us\nI think so what kind of equipment Ron do you bring with you or it\nVaries on on on particular case uh\nThat you know the logic of the um the case you know as far as locations and the more people more pieces equipment or\nThe smaller case the lesser amount but you always want to um\nYou know tried to bring the proper equipment that you wouldn't eat for instance\nIf you have reports of a operation being seen it might bring more video equipment or you know like they're ... or ... whatever\nThat you you believe versus a sound equipment or something like that and it was and vice versa if for instance most of the the the um reports manifested by audio than you would bring more audio crummy so it it it varies appointing we've gotten to a location\nWhat would you say has been the most incredible visualization that you've come across\nThat I'm Sorry what was the word the visualization of but go visit was\nAsian um actually I Believe I've seen a full body operations [noise]\nProbably four times um but the interesting part about it or judges that\nThey weren't really well I was ... times in the world while I was just doing normal stuff yeah I work with a lot of White Houses or a funds for him and we do you know public go sons and that type of stuff and there are two separate case\nIt was a one guy do these goes to his goes on board of directors of course on how the White House that we do the hunting tours and one time we were in the um [noise]\nIt's a like an observation tower where it's a square building with glass all around you and sees windows all around you can absolutely see you know three hundred and sixty degrees and his wife and daughter in and out of it and there was a group of people there and I began talking to them during my field and I looked outside and I saw a woman\nA walking on the outside towards the door\nAnd she got about halfway down to the side of the wall you know going towards the door and I I stopped because I didn't want to repeat myself as she came in and they didn't want her to miss anything so I stopped and waited for a night I saw her continually walk all the way to do it\nAnd I waited and waited and yet nobody came in so finally said is there anybody out here and there was a volunteer sitting on the rock out there and there was another one by the door and she's just notice there's nobody out there\nBut yet I saw her as clear as day so clear that I had stopped my field to wait for her to walk it\nAnd yet there was no one here and oddly enough\nThat said location is where the coast got 'cause it's on the coast guard base coast guard records and women walking on the wall in that same location so that was kind of intriguing um perhaps the other one which is going to the opposite scale\nWas on a Sunday Morning after we get a public a ghost town on a ... White House and a bit cool meal Maine we were in the White House ah keep U.S House it was on um renovation at that time it was sitting on the picnic table in a in a room off the kitchen look towards the kitchen I serve a dog will crush the\nOr the kitchen and ah but I didn't hear anything you know how it drives you hear their cars on the yeah yeah the the there was no it was founded outside\nJumped up and meal you're in the kitchen\nAnd the dog to the door was closed\nSo I came back and spoke to a woman and she says why would you see it I just I saw a dog she says to describe it sure absolutely yeah SARS clear as day like described ... she just stood there and\nShook her head and smiled at me and she says well you know run there was the White House keep it here who had a dog and when it was time for him to be relieved them leave the island uh the dog wouldn't go so all the White House keepers afterward took care of them to a dog actually died in ... I don't she says the dog you describe pretty much mattresses\nBecause she has a dog but that of that dog and I did see a picture that looked like it but can I say that was like no but so I mean his two things that I'm really not looking for goes but it's certainly salt would appear to me at the ...\nAnd it still hangs around Ron stay with us we're gonna bring Maureen back in both of you are old will take phone calls next on coast to coast am runs website of course is linked up at coast to coast am dot com and their latest book is called more ghost chronicles and\nFind out more about tonight's gifts log on to coast to coast am dot com\nWouldn't carry [noise] open mind hey sometimes I'm going to say things you don't lie Michael\nMorning in a an afternoon at ... at least I'm going\nYour age\nOur country nationwide is short about two hundred thousand electricians most students are referred to college rather than a trade\nThe independent electrical contractors is trying to help fill that gap trying to help young people who want to become electricians to become electricians and trying to help electrical contractors\nThat need to hire for their companies find good people join independent electrical contractors association seven one three eight six nine Nineteen Seventy six\nThis report is brought you by church services all church services and get a fall precision tuna for fifty nine dollars a tuna produces energy use by up to thirty percent and improve performance in hopes the boy constantly future repairs over just fifty nine dollars called seven when three seven two to five thousand that seven when three Seventy two five thousand or a book on line at church services dot com\nIt's Wednesday October that what's new today on the free I her radio last\nPerfect for decorating the house or just setting the dairy moon\nOur mind the plate and has tracks with labor in my life to we've got\nEveryone's talking about like the fantasy football or soccer ... the Joe Rogan experience all your favorite music all your favorite station\nAnd we moved up on the east side of your HDTV dial uses for information and composition moved ...\n\nWon ACC for use radios haven't forty Jaycee R.
