about um went shooting how how would you get that\nChurches typically forget I mean go there a whole nother story in our movie theaters and other other churches typically how would you get that a church\nHey action sort out the bad guys from the gun or a good guy with a gun and I'll tell you I'm a good guy with a guy you know and I certainly\nWhen I go to church I go to church and I take it that personal responsibility not only protect myself but anybody that might in there that might come under attack against the bad guy with a guy you know\nWhen I first and foremost would allow concealed carry a church is ... ... that's for sure I carry a gun everywhere I'm allowed to\nOh I live in Texas so loud too many places but at the same time they're also signs up that prohibited from carrying my gun I think at that point if you're going to if you're a church or any facility that can be deemed a soft target the simple answer is this if you're not going to allow me to carry my going in\nAnd you should but if you're not going to allow me to you better have protection there for my family and for me\nAnd that goes for any facility whether it's a movie theater or school or church or whatever I mean I'm so sick and tired of seeing signs up and say\nThat that prevent you from carrying concealed handgun that you want to to\nGet a license for and you've gone through the classes for a and then there's no protection whatsoever I mean we can look at the Aurora shooting a gun in Colorado that guy quite literally avoided six southern theaters in the area because they all allowed people to carry guns but wants to be interviewed attack did not allow good guys like you and me to carry guns in their\nTwelve people died so we are I think that you have to work in conjunction synagogue should either allow people to conceal carry and they'll be do or don't I'm guessing they don't or they should they should have protections to make sure nobody gets in there with a gun I Would also close it down to one entrance annex it\nThis way anybody getting an are getting out or anybody get a good mood to be an emergency exit on the other side to get out but anybody getting into that facility and and they want to cause harm you're going to identify them before they could pull the trigger one time\nSure I mean I got a land they can certainly get at a church\nWill they will be doing it move in the halls of Congress they do it at the White House so so but people that we pay to be our legislators are representatives or a president they are protected one hundred percent I've been to the White House you\nCan't get anywhere near the place until you have a full body scan so why do they do something to protect the good guys when they're out there a church synagogue school whatever they happened to be doing\nYeah and I don't think it's a bad idea there there are other things I think that come into play in like I said that the economic a\nFull body scan for example or even a metal detector and you know those are those are those items that it's not just to have an accent people around that men at church probably qualified people that are\nGoing to be there any way to get out and then there's training and then right no I just feel like it\nLike I said it's not just I don't agree with you I I certainly think that it would be a great idea I also almost more ... think that it's not a realistic I yeah\nWell I I think that you allow concealed carry them almost at a time if you allow concealed carry by good guys like you and me congregation members that people know and that we know have have gone through stuff to get the license to be able to carry like that also you you just have a bus system where you have to be ... to ... to be led to I've been back in it of

there's been a lot of manipulation\nAnd I'm no fool I Know what could happen but\nUh if I don't do it then who is going to Chris Ruddy doesn't do it then who is going to get the Associated Press doesn't do it as they should then who is going to have sixty minutes doesn't do it as they should then who is going to\nGet somebody should and um there are um\nFar less noble things to die for if that is what it comes to then I'm exposing the truth or chasing the truth\nSo there you are\nBack to the lines west of the Rockies you're on the air hello\nHow are mourning mourning a you know it's interesting the way the press is covering this thing whether that foster deal when when I was a service during a\nA a a breaking out of a border gate story uh-huh I Would say in Germany and I was reading a European newspapers get more information sure and I was getting out of uh\nThe thing that I was describing to\nThere are there are certain similarities in the way the Washington Post had to doggedly pursue under criticism um those story now that is what is happening here now how long is the ... been in this condition I don't know you don't use it laziness back in\nThose days I think ah you know nobody want to report on what Kennedy was going a because it was a ... guide to the the spirit of the times in those days was that we leave the president alone the dirty things about the president long ago our way back to to uh\nNot not quite true we leave the the woman ... or the bruising or the personal things\nYeah out but not this kind of thing\nBut over time the the scrutiny torture public official has been hell has has gotten more and more you know we we kept FDR's wheelchair out of out of uh many people didn't even know he was in a wheelchair and nowadays you know we know what kind of underwear president whereas my\nHair yeah like we're supposed to care as wrong\nBut it was interesting I used to have to give an update to my friends back in the states about what was going on with the Watergate investigation out because I got it out of the London paper and I got out of the uh uh English a printed a German newspaper\nI don't know what else you do with this look you don't ignore it that's all you don't ignore it I I guess maybe according to a lot of reports on getting the Associated Press may have switched off their phones or they may be so overloaded that you know who knows I Hope it's true\nYeah this whole thing just thanked pretty badly it has for the whole time or have had quite an air to quite there's too many unanswered thanks now who bumped into Princeton [laughter] ah there's\nJust I guess at the age of unanswered questions like who was with the bumped on the back of Kato Swalwell always be the unanswered question you know and who either that or late that's foster out with no blood\nYou know it's almost tiresome sir and nobody wants to see another presidency falter and fail you know as Nixon did nobody ... nobody wants that for American nobody in their right mind could want that\nAnd I know on clay feet\nI Know this is going to be seen as art bell or Chris Ruddy are both you know going after Clinton with an agenda but damn it that is not what this is about\nNow it's not about that at all I I understand it's not about that at all but but we you know we as on plug on this tasteful as it is if it is something that needs to be dealt with it is something that needs to be dealt with\nWell Americans have got to sit down and have a conversation I think after something like this with themselves and say are we still Americans really\nUm do we are we still the country we once were do we still pursue the truth or do we not care anymore and I guess we'll find out by finding out how many people call up the Associated Press apps area code too old to\nYou hear about that no good for that\nCall toll free one eight hundred six one eight eight to five five\nHe's making a Disney movie\nOh well I'm sure than a lot organization being very sensitive to that sort of saying I'm there will be repercussions but I I was very interesting um\nBut I Can't let me tell you what let me confirmed that story and I'll get it out All right\nYes All right it's a very interesting because getting scanned why\nWell I I can I I I Will know what their stance would be ma'am thank you let me please investigate that story before I ...\nA because that is a very a very very serious charge and I'm not down on your word but should you be wrong about something like that there would be very serious a legal repercussions [noise] so let me find out about that\n\nBut even if true uh it is it is certainly an isolated incident I'm so not significant compared to what Chris Ruddy a seems to have come up with here\n[noise]\nYou know Charlie's reaction of course I guess I you know I guess it's gonna be typical of the liberals and I guess there is going to be no way no escape from the accusation that I Am and Chris Ruddy is\nSimply going after this president\nAnd maybe it is that the midget liberal mind the myopic mind to the average liberal like Charlie cannot react in any other way even too serious\nOr not mid level but high level forensics expertise that absolutely demands an explanation demands an explanation and they can talk it away by saying that it's I'm a conservative not ball rhetoric\nIt isn't even close Charles ended really reveals a great deal about you as a person that you would approach it that way I Am quite surprised quite surprised [noise] first time caller line you're on the air\nI hello\nYeah I can barely hear you there you're going to have to get into the phone and shout out is\nOh okay I'm In here and yes ma'am\nAnd that last night and then one card but at that uh I'm a I'm Bob\n... comment yes right in the head of peace fell off it did yes ah\nOh I don't think you mentioned that last night the kid did a\nNo idea I mentioned it on several successive nights\nRight but that you had asked well we get

one town\nYes and has a\nWith F. like profit I think yes correct\nAnd he said that the boy the end though warning with the great act of mercy and fly cross would appear and the guy that might have wrote there\nWell All right thank you it may be ma'am it may be and uh there was an interesting you should mention that because of course I'm assuming\nYou heard the facts I read last night about the uh peace it broke off which by the way is not in the shape of across or anything like it right now there is a spiral\nUm and that has been noted by recent Hubble photographs a very strange spiral shape to the debris there is a piece that has broken off that is not thirty percent of the comment\nOr somebody worried [laughter] it is a piece that simply is reflecting probably because of the amount of material burning off at you know you take the dirty snowball if that's what it is new break off ... and you've got fresh snow\nAnd so then that begins to get bright\nThe question the good question is why is it bright at All right now in other words it's out beyond the orbit of Jupiter and whether you're talking about the nucleus of the comet itself or abuse that breaks off\nThere should not be enough energy from the sun to be melting and scattering debris as we are now see\nThat part of it does not make sense and again we will question or Richard ... about that when he's here friday night Saturday morning I don't want you to miss that program\nFriday night Saturday morning he's got a lot to say I'm not so much about the common but we will again ask about that because there must be energy to create the burn off that creates the reflected light that we see\nAnd where is that energy coming from east of the Rockies you're on the air hello\nGood morning are called from

I I think what was ... I I mean I I it's it's it's just it's still very solemn to me that you know the innocent people were hanged who were protesting their innocence and that the real the people who had confessed to being which is\nWe're ... let out of jail and then it's kind of you if you can test and said yeah I was really sorry about that then you go what are some of the people said no I'm not going to get this and then I've never been a which those are the people who ended up dying for the most part I mean there's a large percentage of them did anyone\nI didn't write ... avenue wants the tragedy of these people who did the right thing you know who stuck up for their beliefs only things are told to do in your life\nAnd it ended badly for them um which is why you know Arthur Miller's crucible of such a great work of a literature in place is because he kept right into that kind of idea that these guys did the right thing and by doing the right thing they ended up at the end of a rope on a hill you know O'Neill America\nWhat's the uh in the population using under about fifty thousand but it balloons up to two hundred and fifty during the\nThe Halloween a ... ... ... a month long festivity of Halloween is is there in Salem is there any other time of year where they they see a kind of bumps like that or is it just is like a it's a I mean I realize that they always kind of getting a steady stream of tourists but it's this they're big season this this\nThis October you know these thirty one days\nTo October oh massively I mean some some only open in October and can make their whole year in October\nShot up really\nThey've been getting more a year round kind of tourists impulse not just for the which stuff but for the maritime stuff they've amazing restaurant scene they have the ninth largest art museum by area in the country so they have like a lot of like kind of you know arrows and their\nHost or too cold tourist and still happens their biggest one is October\nWhich will never go I\nWell I Do it really is I mean that's like a ... there are state fairs that have that right where people open up a boots at a state there they can make their entire year in the week that the state fair is open and I I I Would never have gas shops that are just open for one month in in Salem\nYeah but it but the other but what the realizing there's so many tourists coming to say on the court for a year\nBut now they're starting to open longer if you go in the summertime you'll still see the shops are still open you might even feel haunted house opened the monster museums are starting to realize that they can do this year round a film grows and becomes more even bigger in popular culture than it is now\nWhat's not cool in Salem what are the rules a lake or curbs that they that are either written or unwritten about how people are just you know ... or to or how they want tourists to be in in Salem\nYeah they're they're getting better and better at that is figuring that it's actually a ... year round you any other time of year there's not that many curbs but in October for instance they are the burial ground which is the old seventeenth century um grave you're right in the middle of town then Salem and this year they had to put a cap on how many people could be in the grave at a time\nBecause it was just getting over Iran and people were like using the grave as you know picnic table and climbing on\nThem and doing all kinds of bad stuff to an actual historical artifacts that there is on Halloween Night they have a curfew I think it's around ten pm that if you're not inside of a bar inside of a party you couldn't be on the streets so they'll shoot fireworks in the air to kind of how people have the nights over start start heading to the train and start having their cars so there that's\nReally good at ten pm\nYeah I Believe it the ten pm yeah it it might be a little later maybe eleven but yeah they're trying to shut it kept pushing the hundred thousand people to the train and it takes some time so by midnight nobody around an aloe and\nIronic did they make everybody get off the streets Salem before the ... hour\nYeah yeah it was [laughter]

R. H. P. H. D. [noise]\nFurniture made an American studios this piece of news radio seven forty Katie our age Houston and I are the radio stations the aftermath\nOf the tragedy in Pittsburgh I'm John mostly daddy it's one o'clock on news radio seven forty Katie our age with\nTraffic and whether together here's been marked John we are watching some activity now instead of me\nAnd one of the things I learned that such true crime apart from great reporting is advocacy\nAnd proper journalism must stay focused on the facts of a murder and the prosecution of potential murderers so the result is a resistance to the expression\nOf sentiment you know the the\nOr sensationalism emotional manipulation of the accused because that could result in somebody not getting a fair trial [noise] this is why this is why journalism stresses terms like alleged and allegedly and how it is choose\nMainstream\nKnow notions of what sensationalism means stories that inflame the census right that sensational journalism the kind of news riding that stresses emotions over information risks riling the public up unnecessarily and at one point by the way\nThis is a very real day to day concern regarding regarding the power of the press or there was a time in us history\nNot even a hundred years ago when angry mobs would storm a jail and Lynch somebody before a trial ... just like you know the showdown in to kill a Mockingbird\nOr white or black Lynch mob justice\nThe opposite of the rule of law and journalism understood its place in keeping the public informed but at the same time call\nAnd letting the courts do their work in educating some kind of justice our guest this hour by the way will attest to this because mob rule in lynchings played a key part in the injustices regarding the story of the men from the tree\nUp but this is the same reason I Love true crime and bear with me another minute or two where true crime reporting can go where true crime story can tell something\nCrime reporting must not go right true crime is it allows for advocacy for justice giving victims of voice it's a central tenet to true crime before her death I interviewed I'm a true\nCrime legend and rule about the conventions of great true crime writing an ad rules number one rule was that any true crime story you tell must be victims centric\nThe focus on the acts of the killer or a fetish size the details of somebody's death like a lot of these true crime shows do on TV where it's almost like crime porn\nRight they're really into all of the blood and the wounds to a point where it starts to dehumanize the victim I think so I think true crime must always be about justice and on a day when eleven people are dead\nIn a synagogue where they should have been saying the root cause sham\nThat not run for your life\n[noise] uh all because of a story seemingly that had been told about a Jewish philanthropist George Soros we need to be mindful about this connection between the stories we tell and the unintended consequences that can happen\nOr these victims should burden our national heart for years they will mine when we tell the story of the shooting in Pittsburgh today we must remain victims centric\nJournalist need to be responsible in order to avoid whipping up towards bearing mobs right intent on lynching people accused of\nCrimes but everybody in the media or anybody who uses social media needs to share that same sense of responsibility when it comes to conspiracy theories as well\nI'm not waiting into a debate but who is responsible for today's mass shooting clearly\nThe majority of the blame rest some of the trigger finger of today's shooter but take it from me and my experience is on the radio it's important to be mindful about every thought seed you send out into the world that bears your name because once it hits the wind\nYou'll never know where those thoughts seeds will take root that's what we know to be true\nThere's many other stories in the news this week that attest to that so not everything is a false flag up\nOnly a small percentage of such things I've ever happened not everything is die hard to not everything is a conspiracy if everything were conspiracy than we wouldn't have any media about in fact the media\nWould be focused on what isn't a conspiracy right if everything was a conspiracy devil radio shows built around we don't have a conspiracy around this today\nSo I ask you whenever you talk about murder whenever you talk about\nPeople who you believed to be guilty of some thing\nStay victims centric in the stories that you tell and not just about the victims of crimes that have already happened in the case of true crime but stay victims centric about telling stories that could result in the victimization of somebody yet to come\nI ask you that in the name of all those people who died today\nSay a prayer for them if you will and and keep that in mind when we talk about the men from the train discovering America's most elusive serial killer\nThat even though the story is over a hundred years old it's still not too late to get justice next on coast to coast am this is Ian puppet [noise]\nNews radio seven forty Katie

Jeff shot I think I mentioned that they um [noise] there's oh there are clear geographic patterns and the murders if one occurs just south of Portland them extra curse just north of Portland a so that that would be a link between them\nA mutt typing was unknown and Eighteen Ninety eight by Nineteen ten Nineteen twelve ... the ... and Eighteen Ninety eight no one knew that there were these for blood groups say a B o and whatever\nIt is the um uh\nThe uh by Nineteen twelve people didn't know that\nUh and and breakthroughs hadn't had had been achieved that had gotten to make their way into courtrooms bought a ... it was it was a very slow process and that is a very infant pile stage\n[noise] men from the train discovering America's most elusive serial killer\nTracking this story then required you to go through a lot of newspaper are ... and other things to try to find a lot of these stories which as you point out had been a they had the dots and human conduct connected then so you you may have been the very first person\nThat ever started putting this this case together in this way\n... well yes we were ... except for the end of the the the the last year the last few crimes were connected at the time the public was aware that that what we would now call a serial murder was on the loose from in Nineteen eleven a Nineteen\nTwelve which would runner and he was killing a lot of people\nBut the earlier crimes we what we did was say look this this this murderer is way too experienced\nTo have started this in Nineteen alive and there have to be earlier crime so let's try to find them\nNow I'm getting ordered walking back toward the first crime\nThat's when I got into is that nobody had walked it back before you were the first person to go back to the very end and how is it that you are able to determine that first year or so successfully\nNominal luck and it is not all of them are ...\nI had told my daughter that ... if you walk the crimes back\nWhen you when he commits the first crime he will make mistakes that will give away who he is and I told her that because I Know from reading crime books and reading hundreds of crime books for very off of a serial murder\nWhen he convinced his first crime reveals who he is but then all of the times he will be ... and seventies it'd be sent to jail for five years and then he'd be out and start a series of crimes and he would cover is track so I I guess that that was what was going to happen in this case\n... we were just fantastically lucky\nAnd that is fresh crime happened to occur the the two biggest newspaper towns in the country where New Yorker and and Boston is first crime occurred straight west of Boston straight north of New York\nAnd because of that both of New York and Boston papers covered in depth and because of that there's lots and lots of information available about it\nAnd it's uncanny it's unbelievable how many points that first murder matches up with\nAgainst the uh with uh with with uh the last last murders and the series\nSo are we just luck I mean we never in a million years expected to be able to find convincingly who was actually doing this but\nFound a evidence about this man and argued that this is Sam and almost nobody doesn't believe it because it's just there's lots of evidence\nAnd you so you found the arc type crimes for the prototype ... he and he modeled ... he he\nPerfected that crime then successfully after that it is is the years went forward and yet ... there was kind of a mixed media right I mean there's sometimes there were some times

I've I've I don't know a lot of different but it still didn't have that reaction to it\n[noise] yeah I think I could go ahead go ahead no no please no a lot of the book and a lot of ...\nBook is about is is that all all all good books our church for understanding and a lot of the book is is trying to get people to understand the America in which these crimes occurred they hurt a hundred years ago and uh\nI grew up in a small town very much like the crimes that these that these murders occur to him and I grew up in them fifty sixty years ago so it's sort of equal distance from me and them and\nThat's one reason that the story was powerful to me but I Am trying to get people to understand what what the criminal justice system was like how fantastically primitive it was a whether they are or what how people lived that they they lived rich meaningful live\nA ... ... people\nIn urban areas today thank of people who lived in small towns a hundred years ago or often think of people who lived in small have a hundred years ago I was living in these boring lives which nothing ever happened\nTo all of the things that happened to you and me and people in our lives happen to people in small towns I mean they they they got married they fell in love and got married and they got divorced and they started careers and got promoted and got fired they moved and they went on long trips and brought back souvenirs\nThey they had entertainment so they went to literally every night all of the things that that happened ... who happen to us happened to them uh and I was trying to create a a picture\nUnfortunately it is a picture of their death so that's a terrible picture because they look bad parable bath\nI'd also is trying to create a picture of how they live them and and give the reader or a an understanding of what it was like to be in America and in a small town or a hundred years ago\nAnd I think he did that very effectively in fact I think that's one of the interesting things about true crime in general is that the the focus can be on things which ... ... ... the inverted pyramid of journalism\nAnd you can spend a lot more time on the things which are less important to telling a story in proper journalism you can spend a lot more time talking about the atmosphere of the town or the um the things that people age\nOr the way the houses were constructed during their communities were laid out you can you can do that in and it brings up a fresh context\nTo these murders um you know as opposed to the traditional way that the crimes are covered in in St story telling and a journalism context I that's what I really liked what you were doing especially when you were getting into the fabric of these communities\nThey are ... there what is it that always sticks with me that I looked at the party or just banking and that has to do with the the soccer in the case of taco invent that it\nUh one of them I think it would suck co ... where I had an alibi for the time of one of the crime is one of the crime was committed on December twenty four\nOf I think Nineteen Nineteen or Nineteen Eighteen and he had a um a he had a witnesses who said that on that particular day he was delivering\nA to his neighbors in a tally and community um a\nPickle deal because trickled deals were a delicacy that we're eating on Christmas Day\nAnd there were there was but there was conflict in testimony that said no no no that couldn't have been done on December twenty fourth because you're never buy the pickled deals on December on Christmas Eve you have to buy them on December twenty seconds or something so that you have time to prepare them and put them in\nOn on ice for a couple of days before you eat them see a\n... it's a it's a tiny detail that you would right that would not never survive I mean he would never know that that was true of Italian or the way that the Taliban American communities lived a hundred years ago\nExcept that it's important than a crime story that is what kinds of stories are there are these little there's a flash of light that eliminates the details\nOf uh uh or something that would otherwise be totally forgotten\nYou know that I think that brings us very effectively ...

wrong [laughter]\nUm but you should be very proud of the words that you all did together not every father daughter team can do that kind of thing\nOr you looked at these ah you looked at these murders and you put them in these different buckets you know the percentage that you believe were clearly done by the mentioned the train and then well there's others that might be likely that he did but you couldn't prove that\nUm or ones that are very unlikely but they they shared some characteristics which should also really inform us as to\nSo somebody who might have grown up with a very dysfunctional household\nTends to clean toward dysfunctional relationships not do the opposite direction but they know who they are in a dysfunctional relationship to know how to act in so they keep recreating that until they break the habit [noise] um so fractals theory often explain whether it's your greatest moment you know like you and you said\nYou know somebody from being destroyed and the fire so you become a fireman so did you spend the rest of your life replicating your greatest moment tend to be thanks so I Wonder what this this guy Paul Miller was trying to replicate\nBy recreating the circumstances all along the various realism of America\n[noise] well ... that's ... that\nThere is something odd about him the or that he he was not terribly young he was believed to be about thirty five when the first crime occurred but I Believe that exactly what you just said that that that that first crime was a his secret it was it was\nThe most thrilling and the most exciting thing that ever happened to them and that he was simply recreating at the um\nUh again and again and again with more and some variation but more specimens specificity as they got went along so that you know the ... the early patterns or not that tight but the\nLater patterns get closer and closer to the first crime\nIt's exactly what you're so what are you saying that that's that's who he was a that's a that's how he knew him so I I don't doubt that Mr Miller had been the victim of terrible abuse has young person or he was a it was an odd looking man he he uh\nHe had tiny widely spaced teeth\nOr he was not clean and I don't doubt that as a consequence of this odd look and he that he had suffered terrible abuse\nAnd that the terrible abuse replicated itself in his anger and his outrage is not that is in any sense of justification for what he did but I don't doubt that that was true of him\n[noise] and the the pedophilia piece um especially abusing decorum since that's what happened\nUm speaks to the age in which he might have been sort of frozen emotionally\nWhich makes me wonder whether that I'm sure you've done and this could have been committing similar crimes in Germany which forced him to go into the navy which forced him to you know just an barking income to the United states\nWell I don't know and and you know there is speculation\nIn the book has a lot of things we don't know about in your interview you can have no answer you can have a speculative answer it's up to you I wouldn't speculate\nThat he had never killed anyone before you kill the uh the Newt and family and ... in Eighteen Ninety eight I I Would I wouldn't I don't I doubt that he'd ever killed anyone before that because there is an obvious lack of planning and a preparation for the event\n... I don't doubt that he had committed pieces of the same crime earlier I don't I see this very much would suspect that he had been\nAdding inappropriate interactions with young girls\nThat he had a a well he had it had a chip on his shoulder he wasn't but like a nice guy and then he says he ... his the documentation of his life around around the time of the first crime mentions that he was\nUm it wasn't hard to get him into a fight you know he was he was he had he had he carry to carry the sangre pretty open by the uh but I so I don't doubt that there were other violent incidents\nTrue in about his life the um uh but I don't think the whole scenario had come together for him before that\nBut it still isn't that's that's a great point\nWhat year had gone into the navy do you know we don't know no\nI'd be curious whether to find the town in which she grew up in yes um and then check what ear he went into the navy and see whether prior to that year there had been something which you know he knew he had to get out of ... he had to get out of dodge\n... joining the navy it was a great way to do it so whether it's just one person who was the victim of his rage but gave him a great satisfaction and and you know I'm\nA nurse assist sociopath which is what this guy sounds like the most dangerous kind\nI'm socio pets are often rage killers and they just you know they it it's a pent up thing and and the ... they just they do it as a kind of relief and I I Wonder whether that that first release came long before he came to the new world\nIt was not a nurse if there's a ... because it was not a ... he didn't have any charm it was not it was a ... generally as a charming\nRight ... and well spoken truly\nMakes a good appearance he didn't do any of that and he was a true psychopath a psychopath have no fear ... know norm at do not have normal fear and one thing the apparent about this the ... on the train is that\nFrom his crime that he was not even not acting in fear he was he was calm in the middle of events that\nAre horrific events that anyone else would have been shaking in their boots and that was one reason he was able to get by with ... with all this probably not that I should have made this this other point first the story of a Paul Miller andme after the train is is much larger than our book\nAnd and we were fortunate enough to find this set of facts about him but I have no doubt that someone else is going to write another book about him in ten years or Fifteen\nAnd going to say well here's what the James's myth they miss this whole story about Paul Miller in Germany they missed this whole story about\nA this crime and it when that guy Illinois and uh the I don't we don't have any doubt that they're going to do that and and there'll be right\nBut we had spent years on it and we reached the limit of our particular research for the Phillies moved on in front of the book but there is still more story to be discovered there\nYeah it's

writer\nA and a and yet you know\nUntil bill there was not a lot in the ... he ... his not there's not a name that anybody would have mentioned as being the most prolific serial killer in America and as you say we don't know yet or maybe we can never know the numbers the actual numbers\nIt's fair to say that he was the most elusive in the way in which he operated because he was able to get away for so many years just\nAs it you know his vocation was like ten or in longer but his application was definitely somebody who we came to a town with the intent of murder and got away with it for years because really who thinks there's people out there that do that\nYou know it means is like even today we don't think about these people just driving around going up which Tuesday you know I'm really in the mood for murder but there are there are they get to Mike in Roswell New Mexico by two incidents where I'll be driving through in a couple of weeks at a\nHill I got a couple of questions first of all I Need you to answer for me again ever seen any evidence ... like one of the act\nYeah but I really what any of the actual evidence from any of these crime scenes they\nAre I wouldn't say so I have held held in my hand the acts with which the Alaska murders were committed they ah it it's still\nIt's still around and and the has been definitively guide to the to the murders than they are but I wouldn't say I have physical evidence now\nAll right ah do you know whether this palm will guaranteed by any chance\n[noise] no we don't he disappeared in ... it was never caught my belief is that he back to Europe and my guess would be that he ... he went back to Europe and continued to murder people bought that is speculation and we do not know\nOkay well that's all I had to pick it up you pretty much got it all figured I figured he might have worked for the world and road fatalities got to every place that he did and maybe Sunday night where they lay overnight or something like that but ah they can for being on the air and I appreciate your story\nThat you might think we should that he may not actually that's a really good question though about what was the connection to Sunday's why we're why we're most of these murders on a Sunday\nWhen I went out in a modern criminal investigation if a criminal could make the murders on weekends this is taking to be a sign that he's employed\nOr if a ... and if it happens a lot actually out there quite a few serial murderers who will\nWho committed murders on weekends or the or because they they work during the week and I you know they have jobs to go to\nThe um Miller probably did it on Sunday nights because he would spend the weekend working I'm self into the trap stocking as victims although I don't I don't know that it's a lot of stocking\nBut uh the uh just working himself into frame of mind that he could get where he needed to be\nA ... the ... and we do you think he did was just kind of trampling it as a you know and and riding the rails or what do you think he was paying you know cash money for a ticket to get on the ... these trains all over the country you\nKnow he was he was just it wouldn't have paid cash money for a ticket because he would have been seen uh and and he came into town may no contact with anyone spoke to no one and this pair that was part of his\nCriminal Jane is they ah they ah but ah so he ... his punch crime in the unplanned crime and Eighteen Ninety eight they did buy a ticket to leave the town and this this led to a trail forming\nBehind him and place followed his where he had gone on the trains are for quite a while but later he was just it was just job as white used to railroad he always\nAlways used at the intersection of two railroad so\nThat would have trained came by the middle of night just hop on and he wouldn't be caught waiting you know if you have to hell rode your last chance a year there'll be you'll be stranded waiting for trying to come here\nYeah this is another thing that really forgot what it was\nNo that's an interesting point then it by the way when I told you about the the people that were murdered next to the railroad line in the town where I grew up they um that was the shoe sure the shoreline it was it's a the the train no longer existed\nUm after Thirty years or so but he used to be the major commuter rail road between\nMilwaukee and a Chicago I think or maybe even went further up north up to Philly Green Bay or something and they'll go\nThe other point the other question I was raised in there up until Nineteen oh eight or thereabouts\nHe a settled in an area for a period of time and committed crimes there that area after Nineteen oh eight he started just morally more or less trapping it it would became a Nineteen Nineteen awake at night and Kenny transition through just\nRunning loose across the country ... bought an interesting thing is that he never stole money that one of the ways you know with him is that why this line well up here in the newspaper story about\nMoney and other valuables were found in the room that and that happens all the time that that that there was a hit he does not steal anything from the crime scene\n[noise] yeah and that definitely is was a ... you know there's the accusation about the first crime that\nUh that that guy little was accused of than it was a a robbery and and it yet you know ... at the same time the let me ask you about the acts so the ... why do you think he would leave the is this the murder weapon at the scene I understand like\nIn the godfather right when you wrap the\nHandle and drop the gun because there's no fingerprints for them to find or whatever but it would seem like even then that would be some evidence to to look for somebody if they're if they leave the ax behind\nWell a fingerprint exploded in the understanding of the American public in Nineteen eighty four Ninety five and his first crimes he just drop the acts and left his body fingerprints\nOn the on the acts up mud once people became aware of the fact that fingerprints then he wouldn't wash the handle they act\nIn a bucket of water before leaving a fan of the crime they did that in ... every every wherever the second half of his of his career\nThey ah ah which proves that he was connected to what was going on I probably read newspapers and knew what was going on or see a but it just dropped the acts because it would have been awkward to take it with him while he was playing or if he once he was out of the house he was\nConnected to the murders but if he was carrying an accident that would have connected them to the murder\nWell okay so let me just making an argument for that that it still seems odd to me because you can actually say I'm a longer that's why I carry my acts with me right right I mean if there's any occupation where somebody could watch the next day would be either like\nFirefighter or longer [laughter] the only two that you're going up um but\nThey all ... among us oh did he worked as a matter but there are some of the I think he did\nAnd the accidents that he used word they lumbering type of axes\n... uh mostly uh like an act that was found in would pile almost all of the house and I see the murders were uh were houses burn would sometimes coal\nA buddy either water coal use an ax to split the wood or break up the cold right\nWould he would use the coal actually the boys would actually whatever you found outside the building\nWell see now that answers actually to my previous question about dropping the act's I wasn't so much thinking in terms of fingerprint evidence I was thinking that could lead somebody to find out where he had purchased the acts but you're saying in every home he picked up the acts from the nearby would pile and use that so whenever a tight\nAnd our weather Channel's forecast looks pretty good today are high today in the low eighties and are low tonight should be in the low sixties
