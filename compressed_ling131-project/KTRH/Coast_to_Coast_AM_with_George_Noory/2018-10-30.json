say well they ... they complain about the new kids they complain about generation y they complain about the millennials they caught complain about the\nSame you know the kids don't want to work there they're entitled to it you know there's all kinds of things that are up I'm hearing about them and I said let alone let them grow up as soon as they have to feed themselves they're going to be find is

get blasted for that\nI don't care listen it is what it is [noise]\nWhat but listen here's here's how it works is zero to a hundred years old when you're a baby you want what you want when you want it you want it now you don't you want it for free you're a liberal and then once you're about ten years old and you have a some possessions at the other kids don't deserve suddenly become a conservative

they're coming of age to vote and we're losing their conservative every sixteen seconds because they're dying so\nAll and all we're we're going to be a nation of liberals\nWhy can't people just care about people whether you're a liberal or conservative who cares why can't they just do the right thing\nYeah would you tell me\nThat makes me crazy you know this whole division that we have going on now in our country and it's horrible yeah\nIt it troubles me it really does we knew not it's not what we're supposed to do I mean when you have a name and listen I'm I'm I'm a I'm a Republican but

ever anticipate that you think a Jack Dorsey when he founded Twitter thought that it would be used the tools like that I don't think so\nNo that when when when you think of the mind that people in like the Eighteen hundreds there's more information in a in a single Wall Street journal then somebody would ever think about\nAn individual would think about in the Eighteen hundreds so I I don't

that were born five hundred million\nAnd a half million so here's here's how it works in any country I don't care if you're if you're a Polynesian islands or you're you're a United States you need to have heavy lifters you need to have people [noise]\nBig incomes and have a big houses and consume a lot of state federal and local tax\nYou mean China is run on tax just like the United states has but what they've done is they've eliminated a half billion taxpayers a half billion people that would go into their labor force and a half billion consumers\nAre and the the the the starting in about twenty Fifteen twenty sixteen their labor force is starting to shrink it had been expanding for years and years [noise]\nSo what's gonna happen well the bullet cook themselves because they're going to have a sexually a quarter of a billion elderly that they've gotta support that can support themselves and now that they they have a whole new crop of of ah kids that can support themselves and who's supposed to pay the tax\nGeez now what could happen and how could this affect us militarily would try to I mean would they do something desperate\nYeah what what whenever a country gets in trouble um with ah their economy the first thing that they do is they saber rattling which is what they're doing\nAnd that's frightening as they go to war\nYeah they well they they they may not go to war because you know how many wars China has won in China's history zero they've never won a war\nI I don't know what's gonna happen there but but it's it's it's a it's essentially the same thing that's happening in South Korea and it's the same thing that's happening in Japan and that is they they don't have enough people\nTo to feed their system there there are the kind of he's not going to work period\nNo it's not much to take some calls this hour come ruin in here for the guinea let's go to ... in Grand Rapids Michigan to get things started Hi Dana\nHi Hi George I hope you're well I Am well I Hope you are too high okay thank you thanks guys hey can I I have I called\nBecause I have a phone compact with you um but just scare me out and then I'll listen to your response\nSo two things um that irritated me one was at a you mentioned the president having a Twitter war um he's not a diplomat so all of those politicians that have looked us in the I I Can't do that\nAs a human being or as a Christian but I'm saying this as a Christian and a woman bird I wanted to see two things you first of all I'm he called her a horse face\nShe was trying to jump start her career uh um the porn star\nBecause she had nowhere to go and needed cash fast and that lawyer is what Italians referred to as an old fashioned grease off he thought he was actually going to that he was he put Iran and possibly when\nUm the presidential nomination for the Democrats\nUm this was sold the word self serving isn't strong enough for ... both of those guys said and all they had was temporarily side track\n'em a booming economy or try to bring down that's nan but more importantly that man has kids\nActually a little one still at home I yeah and that little one but a young white and ... and his wife and we had a president and did something so by all it can even talk about on on on radio in the oval office while I was paying for him with my tax dollars\nAnd everybody said oh she has a right to a private life this guy did pass if he did that\nWas over a decade about so I don't have a problem with him saying whatever you want because you have to remember\nFrom its reactionary he doesn't start fights you look at everything from his campaign going forward he has reactionary if you'll pick on him he's going to come back at you that's human nature and the second thing I disagree that is sad is that\nI'm ... now I'm not a senior in high school but and but I'm I'm not that old either\nWhen I was a senior in high school I said that this country is nothing more than ... and it should be run like a business I have started to successful business myself businessmen and women don't have time for non Stan\nYou'd get a deal done we're not going to have a needing to have a meeting to have a meeting and then to pick a committee and then this and that we don't have time for that they're spending our money and\nSo the fact that you're saying we need more diplomacy ... the dots and win wars yep home if he doesn't save money we need a businessman I voted for him\nBecause he's a no nonsense that is that anyone that was bankrupt it four times and they had the audacity to get back up yet I'm no horse I thought I I have\nIncredible admiration for people that are fighters in a dish and he doesn't care if people call him a racist\nBecause God Knows what than it is hard and other people know that ... ... it it doesn't matter about his policy she knows she is as I as a man and and uh and as a prize of that so I disagree with you on both of those um things\nAnd let's get let's get his comments data in your comments are warranted obviously and you have a right to say these things with anyone jumping\n[noise] well ... ... regarding running it but I'm the country as a business I think you need to run a country as a country that the the single biggest enemy to any country a period is corruption and the business model does not protect us from corruption\nI think one of the things that when people say you run the country as a business let me give you an example I think you know most businesses are bottom line oriented\nYou're not going to pay thirty thousand dollars for a screwdriver or toilet um pay the fair market value or even try to get it for the last one I think when people say let's let the country run as a business\nThey're talking about things like that where let's not waste money as a nation\nYeah I I Would respect that I I Would I Would agree with that as well but it would also say that that uh our country is a republic with a constitution and the constitution works where we have the best country on earth we have the best system\nOn earth and the thing that frightens me about it a bit a a a government run like a business is that the business model cannot protect you against corruption but the but the um Republican camp that that's that's my position on that\nRight and you want to come as young as you want to comment on the president's tweeting\nYeah you know I I don't disagree with with um uh the fact that this you know porn star in it and our attorney are are self serving they absolutely are self serving what I Wish our president would do is just\nNot areas you know this dirty laundry in public I just wish it wouldn't happen\nNow but ... let me ask you this devil's advocate in by the way I've commented on his tweeting too because I think he needs to be a little more presidential he's got some great ideas I'm not a lot of great ideas I don't agree with everything he says\nBut I'd rather be a little more presidential will move more dignified when in back off the tweeting and stuff like that but\nIf he let them spoke what they did without defending themselves then what happens to him\n[noise] I I think that was in the punishment would be what they've said and and um [noise] uh I don't know I think what he has done his dignify but it is the argument and I and I don't think there is one I really don't\nKnow what I mean somebody got paid a lot of money to to do what they did and she got it and I mean there was a reason for that who led to it who pushed it who knows but\nWhether together ... book [noise] still

things that that a A R is troubling demographers about China right now is there are\nA from a forty years old and under there are about Ninety million or um men are males\nOr without that have no prospect of marrying because there's no female counterpart because of of either gender based abortion or is simply infanticide\nNinety million where are they they're in the military and the it's the there there is just a ton and and that that's what happens when you have an imbalance in your population so that's another factor that China is dealing\nWith do you see another major more breaking oh\nNo I just I I I ... and\n... yeah I just don't see any reason to do it well\nI'll tell you what what what I Do see is I think the future of the earth or is the Americans\nAnd that is a you know Canada United States Mexico central and South America or we're self sufficient we don't need a Middle Eastern energy anymore we don't need the oil we got water yeah we've got water we've got fracking we're we're almost impossible to invade because we're surrounded by water\nIt it just it I don't know I\nAm one of those always missiles low guinea\n[laughter] yeah yeah but I I don't know that just doesn't seem to be any reason for the for for that to to to take\nPlace even even with wackos like like Kim Jong hut on and on North Korea I don't see that happening in ... in fact I said I said what do you see in in Korea is going to be a unification of the north in the south [noise] do\nYou know that the south is not having children there for ... heard that oh you sound like about one to\nHere's my concern though not for my country but some some terrorist group than obtains new ... or something like that and they do it and try to planted on another country\nThat could happen that concerns me\nThat that could happen but what concerns me is a demographer is if if you have a South Korea with you know what I'm saying is having one child per couple you cannot maintain a market economy on a shrinking population you can't possible it has to grow\nSo I don't know what's going to happen here with the north in the south I really don't North Korea is about ... they're they're right at or just above replacement level fertility Mike\nAll in Jamestown North Carolina hey Michael go ahead\nYes Hi uh George and higher I guess I'm Hi my question is that that is the trend going to continue where people are moving out of the north east into like down south and west coasts like Florida is now the third most populous state outbreak in New York state and I don't want the Knicks have become the largest city out raking in Philadelphia where\nPeople are moving to the warmer weather Kenny\nThat that that is exactly correct in in in my new book the book that came out last year called upside

it's two o'clock all news radio seven forty Katie our age with traffic is\nNow that's the first college course in the country designed specifically for recently returned veterans Bruce first of all I Want to thank you for that and for sure be my friend I really appreciate that well\nUh yeah thank you very much and uh yeah thank you for having me on on the program I I I Love this show\nOh I'm looking forward to this is just as you got to tell me what I mean what did the incredible background that you have in so many different things how did you get interested and involved in the paranormal\nWell it ... the paranormal has been happening to me my whole life it started at age four with my first paranormal experience it was an ... experience a near death experience and just from that point on it just the the things have been happening randomly but quite frequently\nAnd I've always had it on the back burner I you know I've been doing all these other things\nAnd have a lot of different interests and it's always been on the back burner but it wasn't until recently that I decided to finally put these all these experiences together into a book\nAnd a and then started talking openly you know not just with a couple of friends or Family Matters but to to students and actually I I teach a class now at the college I'm On the paranormal that's been a very popular just started this this semester\nA lot of people Bruce or a little hesitant to come out and talk about their paranormal experiences\nSome of them you know pilots they don't want to talk about us all experiences has this been a problem for you since you've come out and talked about this\nUh it it hasn't I understand the the the nervousness it or the fear even that they would have it I was a I was afraid of that uh that maybe people wouldn't take my work seriously\nOr or that I'd be ridiculed or the administration would find a way to maybe I I get an early retirement or something but I haven't found that to be to be true at all I I think what has happened is that people now see me as a safe person to share their experiences with and they often do so privately\nOr some of them actually I have two colleagues that are taking the paranormal class that I'm teaching 'em\nTo two of my colleagues at at the college so I it's been a very positive experience I guess the most negative thing I can think about there was a a a friend of mine her daughter's a graduate student in history and she told her mother that uh well I think he's just committed academic suicide\n[laughter] you know that was the perspective of a graduate student I can understand that you're just starting out in your doctoral program that's something you probably don't want to tell your your graduate advisor\n[noise] you know as as it's happening now Bruce and as you probably know the seal of the paranormal they and the activities and the studies it's really growing now isn't it\nI I I I Believe it is and it's and it's gaining acceptance and it's it's always had the in the scientific community of of which you know I I I have friends in the scientific community I'm not a I'm a social scientist historian\nOr but from what I gather there there's always been a tremendous interest in the scientific community but it but a reluctance\nTo uh to do much with it in fact I think ah my friend dean ...\nWho's the chief scientist at ions good guy he uh\nYeah seven he said they're Seventeen thousand five hundred institutions of higher learning in the world and there's only fifty five zero academics openly interested in studying site and some of those are skeptics so that's a very small percentage fifty out of\nAt Seventeen thousand five hundred uh schools uh in in in ... or colleges and universities and from what he told me there's only five or six paranormal courses being offered in the United states right now which is very surprising\nAt one point Duke University had a department that's got to eat all of this under GB Rhine and now it's not there anymore but there are still the J. B. Ryan Institute thank God you to study some of these things\nYeah no I it's it but I I think there is and I come from this with with dean because he's doing and you know he's traveling around the world talking about his research in very actively engaged in this research and there seems to be a and I suggested to me seems to be like a paradigm shift going on of of gaining acceptance\nAnd I think people are are increasingly you know professional people are are are increasingly a supporting the research and and talking about their experiences more more openly\nWell and I and I look at this program you know six hundred and twenty radio stations we're on we're podcasting were on the Internet uh there are other podcast are out there dealing with the paranormal\nUh millions of listeners it's growing it's getting bigger and bigger and I think people Bruce are looking for answers that they can't find and other traditional places\nI I I think you're you're right and that's\nExactly what I've seen as people have come forward to you know colleagues and ah I've I've made a I'd make contacts with our um our custodial staff or at at that work at the college at night and they have incredible stories that I just had a ... as kind of blown me away and I never would have\nKnown and less somebody had said oh you should talk to a you know Mr D or whatever he's he works in this building at night and he's got some stories so it's like they're telling their friends who are then calling me and and saying hey I got something I Want to share with you so I think it's\nI I think once\nMore people in positions of authority or or you know academics are professional people or express their interest in and their support I think it's going to it's going to spread a lot faster\nWell with Bruce ... latest book is called timeless a paranormal personal history he relates thirty four issues and cases that he had and just an incredible thing because in the beginning you say that it's not that you don't believe in ghosts they believe in ... tells me about that\nYeah I I think that uh it it well in fact it's my my my uh spirit friends who I I I Do have contact with a they told me that experience is believing and believing is experience\nSo this this initial experience I had at age four kind of open the floodgates for me and even though I tried to every once in a while put it on the back burner\nOr because I didn't seem to have much control it just happened randomly these things uh it just kept coming back so they just kept coming back instead of a you know it it you know ... regardless of whether I wanted it to or not\nAnd then I just kind of accepted this is the this is the way my life is going to be and I just proceeded doing other things but it was always there in the background I think I was always destined to to explore this at a certain point in my life and it and the last couple of years that's that has been the the the point which to do this\nWhen did you have if you can remember your first paranormal experience how old were you\nYeah that I was very young I was four but I ... and uh we had traveled to northern Norway or to an island two hundred miles above the Arctic Circle and my parents are are from northern Norway from that island\nAnd we were staying with my grandmother for lived there about nine months so it was a wintertime and I was playing outside and I remember very distinctly what was going on and I I was a\nI got very sick very suddenly I I just ... my body was getting stiff and achy Mike I couldn't move my head from side to side my neck was totally step I had this fever coming on and I went home and I got home to the old farmhouse we were staying my grandmother's home\nAnd she had this little bed in the in the kitchen and the old farmhouse kitchen because sometimes she would you know should be baking for a long time and just wanted to take a little nap and it was too hard to go up the steep stairs to the upper part of the house so anyway I was lying down there and I just kept feeling worse and worse than my\nBy the relatives came over and they said oh this is what happened to your eldest brother and then the next day he died and somebody said oh and that's what happened to\nUncle ... then when he got polio you know they would just scaring the heck out of me and my and my parents and my grandmother and um so I just I drifted off to sleep or you know crying myself to sleep I thought I was going to die and then in in the night uh I I I woke up and there was\nThis really bright light up in the in the ceiling and between the beams and this old farmhouse kitchen\nAnd ah it I felt like I it it was an end jelly presents\nIt it was it was very bright it was very warm I felt like everything was going to be okay it took away all my fear\nAnd uh and I went to sleep and I slept soundly and when I woke up I was completely fine and and my mother and my grandmother said it was it was a miracle and that it was the guardian angel that had had saved me so that was the first experience and experience and I never questioned it I just said okay that's\nThat's what happens and I think that's what open the floodgates and and and and also my mother was very psychic too she wasn't a practicing psychic right to see um\n[noise] there's always there seems to be somebody in the family who has this ability and it kinda passes down genetically doesn't it I\nI I Believe it does because her mother was also that way she was an herbalist she was a healer so and and and this is a very remote island at that point in the sixties they're the only way onto the island was by a a small plane or buy a ferry or vote\nOr there was no bridge to that island so there's very remote there

the worst end of the world kind of apocalyptic scenario\nAnd I woke up in a in a sweat and and nervous and scared and\nI I went to breakfast with my uh uh friends are just like the continental breakfast and I told them about this nightmare and then we proceeded to the uh the base\nAnd uh we were on a tour when the sirens went off and they closed off the base and we went back to the education center and saw what was happening on nine eleven so\nSo that was my um my pre cognitive or premonition dream it wasn't specifically about airplanes or buildings but it certainly was\nA the you know a in a very apocalyptic event that or or life changing and world changing event and later I learned that this was there were many people around the world who had a nightmare as some more much more specific\nThan mine but that very morning that this happened\nThere is my daughter had none of those two we didn't know what you're saying yeah we didn't know what it was Bruce but uh she she she had the vision she was in the in the city were ashes falling down on her she said it was about a foot deep\nUm but you know then then you like a day later it happened and she said that was a yeah yeah some people\nHad it that morning some people had it a few days before the day before but there's there's so many people around the world who have who has a\nVerified that this that this happened to them and so there is something to that this this the ... that people had since that and and and I'm On a massive scale so which is and it's been studied uh I think\nA dean rating talks about in one of

Oregon Coast in at night my\nMom would bring out the deck of cards and we would uh try to read each others' minds so she would send you know she'd have a car and she looked at it and send me the you know try to send me with what the card was and a\nWet well above chance we would get the the suit right we would get the sometimes the number or the or the ... you know whether it was a king or jak face card\nA very often we get we get a right\nTo the to the point where it would make my dad upset because he was a very practical carpenter blue collar guy no nonsense and he let us do it for a while and then once we had got a few hits he'd say okay that's it stop it no more yeah he did he said when dad said stop if we had to stop\nA and my my mom you know so I had a special kind of relationship with my mom\nDealing with that and I she's the one that I think really cultivated it and I I that's where I got it from its ... it wasn't for my dad I got the story telling thing from my

were driving through you know the big tall trees it's very hard\nAnd as I was making I think it was the road kind of veered to the left a little bit\nAll of a sudden right on the edge of the road like with its feet on the on the pavement was this very tall creature and it was Harry and it was a very dark but it was definitely a living creature and it and it was wearing of all things that was wearing a hat\nA ... it was just kind of leaning into the truck is we\nBut by and it couldn't have been more than you know maybe a foot away from the you know my side view mirrors I drove by and or

around and go back and then she did she said no no that's okay just keep drive and I said well we got to find a hotel there's one here another mile from here and she goes no no you keep going keep going\nAnd uh so we kept driving but but later\nI found out that that that particular location near Oric was only I think about ten miles away from the location where that that one of the most famous big foot or videos is from\nThe Paterson given one yeah exactly yeah we'll be talking about this we are in fact\nThere's been yeah there's been more fighting there than than any other place in in the

paranormal stories you've had a a lifetime of activity Bruce\nYeah I'm kind of I've I've kinda been a a a lightning rod for the paranormal that's how it someone described it and I agree with that description\nTell me about the open casket story\nYeah the open casket um the title alone we kind of makes you shiver [laughter] well I grew up in\nAnd in a um [noise] in our region American community and we had this this older man who passed away and he was a good friend of the family and I he was a very very nice man and uh\nWe were at his funeral was the first uh open casket funeral it I'd ever been to and I was sitting next to my mother I'm not sure exactly what my father was a he might have been there too but I don't I just remember my mother sitting next to me\nAnd as we were going through the service and you know I the widow was crying and you know the the all the emotion of it all of a sudden I heard this a very distinct voice a very heavy Norwegian accent and it was the man who had died that was in the casket and he was\nSo to me and he said ah ah Bruce it's it's it's okay I'm okay there's nothing to be afraid of\nUh uh I'm okay and uh I I I I looked I kinda I looked around and looked at my mom and she you know and I didn't ask her if she heard it I just kind of looked at her and she kinda nodded at me so I'm not sure what that meant\nBut ah I didn't actually ask her about it but then he said it again there's nothing to be afraid of everything is going to be okay and he said it and then that typical you know Norwegian\nAccent and uh but I was looking at him and of course he you know he was just in the casket and and dead but so I I definitely heard his voice and um it it it was kind of comforting in a way but very uh I'm not going to say frightening but very bizarre\nIt would be weird wasn't it\nYeah it was weird I Can't say I was afraid but it was it was very enlightening knowing that okay he's I don't think he's lying I think he is okay wherever he is and I wasn't quite sure at that time\nI I think I Know now but uh uh often times I've heard that um that people who have recently passed away do like to uh appear at their their funerals justice check everybody out and\nSee what the suit was they're very\nCurious I think I Would be curious to [laughter]\nTell me about your paranormal class at the citrus college\nSure um well it's kind of paranormal ended up itself at the college let me do it but uh\nWell then you have to fight for it\nI didn't really have to fight that was the that was the thing now it's it's a community education course so it's not like\nFor college transfer credit but in his offered at at the college\nAnd I am a a tenured professor there and\nAnd I think there are a little bit surprised that I I proposed it but this is part of my plan you know that started two years ago with the writing of this book so I I've always wanted to do this and I I approached them and I said well they said well we've never done this before but we think it might be a pretty popular I said well I Hope so let's give it a shot and\nSo I thought well maybe I'll get maybe twenty people in there you know maybe if I'm lucky and that's about the standard size that most of these classes get\nBut ah as it turned out we have thirty five people and there was a waiting list\nI probably could have had a hundred people if we could have accommodated them in this classroom but thirty five is a pretty is a pretty good number including two of my colleagues and and these people are from all walks of life I mean just a cross section of of of Southern California\nOr younger people and and older people of different ethnicities and\nAnd uh and and and races and just it there they all have one thing in common they ... they've either had these experiences a lot of them or they're very curious about it but there are a couple that are a little skeptical\n... including one of my colleagues he's no longer that skeptical I'll tell you that after six weeks and the or seven weeks\nIn the course into the course um and uh it it it's\nBeen a wonderful experience of really what it what it turns out to be is\nYou know I I present different theories about different types of paranormal phenomenon I relate my experiences they they read my book and we talk about that but the big part of it for them is having a safe place to share their stories\nAnd that's the biggest thing that I've seen that's that's what they like they like to come there and they like to share their stories and it's a safe and in an environment where we all we don't judge anybody we just listen if they ask for any comments or you know what are your perceptions about this we we relate to them and\nSo it it's been a ... it's been a very bonding experience wonderful bonding experience and uh actually tomorrow we're going to have our last class and we're having a farewell dinner at a haunted location here in a nearby\nA steak house which will be fun\nA that's a hunted and I'm so that that that should be a lot of fun tomorrow night\nWednesday night we have our annual goes to goes to your oh Bruce and it's amazing the amount of colds that come in of ghost stories I mean there is you know it's amazing to me or scientific explanation of what you think a ghost might be well\nI'll I'll tell you the I've had two full operation experiences\nAnd I believe that those those full body operations are just echoes or um I think there are ... what they would call a residual hunting I suppose\nThey that they weren't interactive with me I couldn't communicate with them it's not like when I you know communicate with with those that are um in the spirit world it's say\nThe ... at least the full body operations that I've seen the to where I could see the translucent ghost in front of me one one was in Austria and a very uh in the Alps was a beautiful location\nAnd the other was in uh in New London New Hampshire when I was on a a job interview there before I got the job here in Southern California and uh in both cases\nIt was it was shocking to say the least but uh\nIt uh it it it wasn't interactive I couldn't talk to them and they well I was talking to them but they didn't talk back and they didn't seem to react to what I was saying\nI think their purpose was just they were tied to that location so that that's my impression that uh and my explanation for what's going on with that now it's different than when I ... a\nM visited by someone who's passed on and I I might see an image of them in my mind but not\nLike out in the in the open kind of a thing so I think there there is a difference between an intelligent what they would call an intelligent spirit and a a kind of a residual or experience or residuals spirit\nPsycho couldn't he says the ability to manipulate mind over matter\nHappened to you\n[noise] I was the uh um the unfortunate victim of well I don't want to say victim but it happened to me I was I was in Germany a lot of these things happened in Germany and West Germany Germany's a very magical place\nUm the ah I'm living in an old uh well in an apartment above a gust house which is like a a a German bar but there's like rooms to rent up above it either for the night or for in our case we were a GIs so we were living there near the base\nAnd a one night I woke up and I I felt like somebody was pulling my legs off the bed it was it was very frightening I mean I felt like they were actually trying to pull me off the bed so I got up\nAnd there wasn't anybody in the room and uh I I tried I just kind of walked around a little bit I had to go get something you know some water or something\nAnd then all of a sudden I I went back into the bedroom and on the night stand there was everything was vibrating like there was an earthquake but there was nothing else in the room that was moving there was just the stuff on the night stand there was my wife's ah my wife at the time ah her hand mirror a clock\nAnd a few other little items that were on the night standard vibrating and some of them fell off and I put them back on there and and and then it it kept vibrating again and then I just happened to look out the window\nAnd there was like a Greenbelt behind our apartment behind discussed house this bar and\nThere was a Green Belt and then there was another uh apartment building maybe four stories high much bigger a complex and I looked directly into this window and there was a man standing there it looked like a man and he was very dark\nBut we enforcements are headed to the
