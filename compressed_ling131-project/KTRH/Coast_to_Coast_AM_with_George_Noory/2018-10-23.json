O. two [noise]\nAnd if we produce them on Mars and they called a a floor carping gases or we sometimes manufacture them on earth for use in refrigerators and air conditioners um the the uh but we didn't put them in such machines and said we just released them to the atmosphere\nAnd we were producing with the same rate we're producing them on earth right now\nIn fifty years we'd warm ours by ten centigrade bats ally okay that's an awful lot that's ten times as much as anybody is talking about global warming happening on earth and the the uh\nAnd if you warmed Mars that much\nThat warming itself would force carbon dioxide to come out of the uh the soil because it's been ... and it would out gas and it would thicken the atmosphere a lot with C. O. two which is a greenhouse gas\nAnd that would warm the planet even more so much so that the frozen water those those glaciers that we're talking about they start to melt they start to flow and this is much ... freshwater in most places there is a north\nAmerican oceans will I bet\nWell planet why there is in those particular glaciers probably as much as to the American Great Lakes [noise] um and the the um but yes the waters on\nMars it's frozen at all kinds of places would start to melt the dry rivers on Mars would start to flow the lakes and seas would start to fill up and they would also be rain and once you have that kind of planet with a thick steel to atmosphere liquid water rain man you can start spreading plants around now\nIf we were using that kind of plants we have on earth now which are only about one percent efficient in in capturing sunlight and I'm doing photosynthesis or it would take a thousand years for them to make enough oxygen for Mars to be read the Bible but\nWe're talking a hundred years from now it's really not too far out to assume that we can do genetic engineering of plants to make them\nInstead of one percent efficient five percent efficient and in in which case this thing could happen much much faster\nAnd um so I think Mars is going to be terrified and within two hundred years and my guess is it'll probably be done by ways that are more efficient than what I just described to you because they're going to be doing this with technologies we don't know about\nAnd who's going to do a thorough what country\nThe Martians are\nThey're going to do with themselves though when we talk about competition I don't see Russia as really pushing it space program much I mean they watch us to the ... are you assess and they bring us back\nA well most of the tragedy a few weeks ago with a couple a cosmopolitan an astronaut that had to abort\nWhat I see China and India is coming along strong how about you\n[noise] well here's the thing I'm the\nRevolution in space flight is really going to put the question to these people um I think India's gonna rise to the challenge but now China and Russia accountable face it a real question\nWhich is are they going to allow private space launch companies my guess the Chinese will because they've seen the benefit of of of privatization in terms of their very rapid progress since they moved away from command economy\nUm but Russia [noise]\nThe the issue there is not allowing a private space launch companies but allowing space launch companies to believe that if they got started they wouldn't get stolen by the government\nUm and because you know the Russian government is is basically a organized crime I mean you know Russia is not a country with an organized crime problem it's an organized crime family with a country [noise] and uh the the and so if if if they\nAre going to have their own space sexes and they're going to need to have them if they're going to be competitive that's the thing um\nHold on Broadway and we're at the top of the hour we'll come back we'll talk more about this and will open up the phone lines with Robert Zubrin next on coast to coast they\nSign up now for ... zone or ... ... email newsletter today at coast to coast am dot com\n\n\n\nEverywhere you go there's another line at the grocery store at the drive through the window bathrooms are you all doing their specially in traffic\nWe got the info down when traffics all backed up by news radio seven forty gay T.\nR.

I'm a strong in space which by the way is a military necessity\nOr if you're going to be a first class power it's right or you have to be first class in space um Russia's going to have to change and it's interesting I mean\nYou know a a a reason is still coming in a certain I mean ... the reason why\nThe um the Russian government or promoted mass literacy was and the twentieth century illiterate armies can no longer cut it well they're also going to have to go beyond that they're going to have to enter the modern world in other ways and um so that's another good thing that that Iran must has done for the world\nThat's pretty dramatic I think the fact that the privatization as doing what it's doing do you ever see the day Robert The privatization could backfire and all of a sudden some of these companies could go rogue doing all kinds of things\nGo rogue I don't know about it in a like a James Bond movie where all of a sudden they tried to launch a weapon or something like that\nWell I'm a I I Know I I I don't think they're going to launch weapons or the um [noise] you know I'm\nA less we hire them to do though\nWell yeah well the ... states that one\nWeapons okay I mean 'cause what after all is a state but it is a a military force that exists well ah the presumably to protect its people but also it controls its people by having a monopoly or a near monopoly on force\nAnd um the you know um but\nI don't think that means ... a different objection people sometimes have is that uh you know if if space becomes totally privatized then gee it'll just be the rich that get to go to Mars well um\n[noise] it's frankly easier to get rich than to become an astronaut or right and um and also I think that um\nYou know if they open the path to the moon and Mars it will get cheaper it will become something that I'm increasingly not just the super rich but then the rich and the middle class and ultimately the working stiffs walk to go [noise]\nAnd um\nYou know he once upon a time you really had to to to be in the high income level in order to fly on airplanes you know into [noise] and now everybody does it\nWhat about propulsion we're ever going to do better than the kind of proportion rocketry propulsion we have today\nWell sure well I'm now ... there's two different issues here one is earth orbit and the other is in space propulsion now earth orbit is is it pretty hard thing to do right now the only thing we know how to do is with rockets\nBut um if we could create air breathing propulsion that can operate at those speeds\nA fake launch vehicles could become much more efficient because most of the propellant you know in the rocket is the oxygen and it's not to feel [noise] you get the oxygen from the air the way a jet does it become much cheaper to fly to orbit [noise]\nUm that's going to require some um technological advances but you know who knows a\n... you know the next new kid on the block me a ... you know knock you out in Moscow office a perch by saying well I'm going to do something that you've never done I'm going to create air breathing propulsion door but\nI'm so take that Mr mosque um and ah because\nYou know there's always something new and then in terms of space travel\n[noise] um [noise] well um we could\nI mean the the ultimate would be in my view fusion rockets I'm finished using fusion power to create very high temperature very high velocity exhausts a would allow us to travel around the solar system at much higher speeds and even attempt interstellar travel\nLet's take some calls here for you Robert bleary in Los Angeles to get us started Hi Larry go ahead\nAnd George great show as always thank you so it's wonderful to talk about the office\nAfter I listen to your show like anyhow hey I'm I'm enjoying the show the line is always and the idea of the question though in a moral issue as far as Mars I'm Wondering if we get there if we find someone in your life do we really have the right to invade\nLike America do like uh Europe did on the American Indian or\n\nOK still there oh yeah yeah a lot I can hear you sir go ahead I'm okay All right well here's the thing um [noise] there there\nIs an intelligent life on Mars now okay there may be microbial life and for people to say a for us to land on a planet and take it over when there's already microbial life there is really a gone off the deep end okay because\nUh what we did to the American Indians was wrong because they were people right and\nYou can even make an argument that what we did to the American to nature wild nature on America was wrong because you have these magnificent herds of buffalo in redwood forest and all this and and and we destroyed most of that in order to create what we have here now now I actually believe\nThat while we get destroy some things that were worthwhile we created much more and I would not\nUndo the settlement of America\nBut on Mars there are no Indians there are no buys in herds there are no red woods there's just a desert with maybe some microbes in it and and I submit to you that if there have been nothing here when Christopher Columbus landed but a desert with some microbes under the rocks\nUm nobody be picketing Columbus Day parades today\nRobert de ... we were talking about of course things that could happen\nYou know how far out in the future ten years going to Mars can we get the ...\nYeah I I I Do I I think that at the rate that space sex is currently proceeding or having the first people on Mars before the end of the twenty twenties is a very realistic prospect\nWhat do you think of these Japanese plans to mine asteroids I don't know how they're going to do that\n[noise] well um I I think that's a little um futuristic at this point uh I think\nThat if we have laws that allow people to state mining claims on asteroids say in return for surveying them to a certain degree of of detail\nOr that we could get privately funding asteroid prospecting missions uh being launched a ... in the very near future that is because the mining claim even if you can't mine it today if if you think you're going to be able to mine at Thirty years from now or fifty years from now or it has some value\nAnd uh and and and the exchange for those claims and people could get a exploration missions finance\nMine the asteroids is something though for the future there are many asteroids that are extremely rich in rare earth metals in platinum group metals things like this that are extremely valuable [noise]\nAd whether together [noise] most of it is an fmri that\nEarlier

Braun and some of those incredible mine's\nWell they had some pretty good wants to uh they had core lab a who was a great rocket engineer\nSo as Germans technology that help the Soviets to write\nWell they they captured some vie to split\nA as did we but I I got to tell you well I mean no I mean there's no question that von Braun and his team were top notch and and we actually got the real rocket engineers Soviets captured a lot of the two rockets\nBut they they mostly caught the second tier kind of people we we got\nWe got the cream of the crop as they say\nYeah we did um but um you know by the sixties we had developed our own rocket engineers although the German team continued to play a role through about the early seventies um I met a few of them\nWas amazing to see people who are born in the eighties for example Robert or even the nineties\nNever had a chance to experience what a lot of us went through a lot of people who are listening to the program right now during those incredible time periods I mean the moon landing spot neck all that stuff was just so historical ah we really lived and we have lived through some incredible time several we\nYes but I I like to see America once again to become a country whose Creigh Deeds are to be found in newspapers and not in museums just a you know and so you know like the Apollo Thirteen movie or just now the moody last man for not last man first than\nHers may well have made me the labs where no one\nHere [laughter] yeah well I think it's pretty good movie by the way I just saw um\nWhat'd you think about the lack of the American flag being in that movie\nNo they do show the American flag on more on the moon they just don't show them planting it\nOh okay okay\nThe this movie some people found it a bit slow 'cause it was a lot in there about you know good Neil Armstrong's relationship with his kids and his wife and so forth but I thought it was pretty strong especially you know the scenes with the ex Fifteen and the Gemini and Gino flight\nAnd uh the actual moon landing itself I thought were absolutely riveting and they really gave you a sense of of the risks that were taken the courage that was needed and just the and this particular nature of of of this thing and this this this\nAnd the daring of America at that time\nAnd um but anyway I mean that's that's that's who we are that's who we have to be we can't be these people who you know\nSay well we don't know how to go to the moon I'm you know I mean that'd be like them in the sixties saying we don't know how to fly airplanes\nBut for the day but the Salem mass say David go ahead sir\nI didn't you both and thanks for taking my call George sure thing\nUm okay so it's interesting to me how what you what you're talking about a few minutes ago was really played into my question you know we've talked about you know how life could be sustained and the things on Mars and already might stay life but we have any plans are there any theories on\nAustin was humiliating an atmosphere stimulating of ISIS landing environment a drilling holes that were trapped gas is eating the atmosphere with and we have or or any irritates her plans for that\nWell we discuss that earlier in the show but yes terra forming Mars the idea would be if you warm the planet with greenhouse gases she could form a lot of the costs a lot of atmosphere to help us out of sight\nI've got a book called the case for Mars which um you can get on Amazon and it talks about how we can send people to Mars how we can sign on Mars and how we can terra forming Mars that is transform it in the way that you are a suggesting\nBecause marshals once in a warming planet which means by the way it has a thick atmosphere and um it could be made so again and you believe we must go march don't you\n[noise] well I\nMust I I I Believe we should uh I Believe that it's going to be much better future if we do I believe that if we do we don't just get another planet we proved to ourselves that we don't need to be fighting over this one because there's an infinite number of world out there for us if we work together\nGood point Arnie in Roseville, California go had already\nYeah Hi I'm ... and I just have a question I thought it'd be leaning towards privatization\nBut are you willing or privatization on the colonization of the ... of the Mars or the planet I mean are you looking at this alone and be a free for all whoever land grabs whatever they can uh are you are you predict the government should be some more involved in\nIt hating how\nOpposition no real property as it was would be a Mars if we ever got a point where travel was easy [noise]\nAll right go ahead Robert minute left her\nOkay well I'd like to see a lot of new governments on Mars I'd like to see people go to Mars and set up city states on Mars with lots of different forms of government so we could see which kind of government works the best because that's how we make progress\nOn earth you know America was a noble experiment we proved the value of democracy and human rights and\nPeople all over the world came here because this was better and other countries around the world eventually copy that's because it was better\nWell if if it if you have people go to Mars and they're not forced to be under the U.S government to the Russian government or the Chinese come they formed their own governments\nThey'll go there with their own ideas of how government should be in some will be good ideas some of the bad ideas and the ones with bad ideas that are not workable those counties will fail but the ones with good ideas immigrants will flock there those places will grow and become an example to the rest of humanity\nRobert thank you again my front always great talking

Marcello with us branded as a political therapist author Paris psychologist residing in the northeastern section about while\nHe has a graduate degree in clinical constantly from the University of Toledo\nPsychological research methods from the University of Edinburgh, Scotland is research at the University of Pittsburgh centered on E. and maps environmental sensitivity in ghostly encounters\nBrandon has been fascinated by the paranormal for years and here he is with his work called the ghost studies Brandon I'm looking forward to this welcome to the show\nIt's great to be here George I'm excited to\nI got shot at a clinical therapist get involved and go studies [laughter]\nUm well actually I was interested in a goat psychology before I was actually a clinical therapist uh-huh yeah so it actually I actually got a job and then I studied psychology and goes\nWell that's something then you went to the University of Toledo which is not too far from my hometown of Detroit\nOh okay yeah I spent a lot of time at the casino in Detroit but we won't get into that [laughter]\nIt's not very well [laughter]\nThat's good what did you see the they didn't have casinos there when I left I left in Seventy eight when apple was at that time it was just a booming city but what we do have is the Detroit Lions and that's the great thing there\nYeah yeah good good teams up their sports wise\nShe'll tell us a little bit about your work and then we're going to die just ... the gold studies for what he was an overview of what you've been doing random\n[noise] well um\nYou know I uh I have a degree in psychology or when I was in University of Edinburgh I studied uh I'm basically ... the environmental sensitivity and goes way encounters um and then when I got back here to the states I got back into the clinical part of things\nAnd then that's what kind of got me going and and I'm interested in in writing a book and that's when I came out with it goes studies and you know I'm sure the listeners to your show no it's it's um no mystery that science is sort of dropped the ball when it comes to explaining goes my encounters\nA oftentimes mainstream macadamia will explain these things away as elusive nation interpretations are overactive imaginations which you know it's not really true in my eyes\nSo individuals who have these terrifying encounters kind of struggled to find the answers and they're kind of left with reality television shows to provide insight into these life altering experience is\nSo you know there's millions of people out there including myself who are looking for things are books with more than just go stories\nTales of locations are outdated views um and that's when I wrote the book and I just don't you know I combine real life goes encounters with the satisfaction of some new perspective and insights in the cause of these throwing encounters\nUm it the book comes up with concise and competing theories and what's great about it is it's based on data rather than faith or belief\nOr even experience and you know and you know these goats I been picking our interests for millions of years and it's and I think we're at the point where there is becoming new perspectives on these things and that's what the book really goes over you know there's several firsthand accounts of ghostly encounters\nUm you know I spent years just getting firsthand accounts of going to anyone he would talk to me about goes normal conventions everywhere and then I started noticing similarities and that's when I came up with some of these maybe theories are and that's why I came out with the book so you know really combined a little bit of my\nI took elements from psychological research clinical interviews eyewitness accounts and I sort of piece them together and come up with this uh these new theories and thoughts and I also review the ... the the greatest or the latest research in a ghost encounters Abbas\nWell then you bring a dose of real science to the picture your brand new no I think that's important\nYeah yeah and I think so too I mean\nThe great thing is it's out there you just got to look a little bit harder um the journal articles a pair of psychological journal articles and even some degrees you know I'm narrow psychology of fitness a physics they're starting to kind of go into that realm of consciousness and\nI'm entanglement and non locality and\nHow electricity affects us and I'm a ... and what it does outside the body so there's a lot of that research out there it's just you know I think a lot of people maybe don't know how to find it or when they do find it and read a research article what kind of like oh this is boring and I don't know what's going on\nBut I'm a lot of great research is out there it's just a matter of finding\nWhat have you concluded today brand new about what the ghostly experience might be for someone real big into their imagination what do you think's happening\nI actually think\nA majority of it goes to encounter that that are out there I Believe are there is some paranormal phenomenon happening\nI'm you know I think that when it comes to my encounters it's such a complex process\nAnd there's so many variables going on um you know there's\nEnvironmental stuff there's um a internal bio electrical stuff going on\nUm but you know for the most part these these experiences are genuine and um you know obviously there's some fraud and there's some misinterpreting stimuli or whatever but I think a majority of these experiences are actually like I said genuine experiences\nAnd what do you think causes them one of the hell\nI think there is I'm In my in my view I take them more a sigh based view on goes\nSo that's um inside is basically um pull up at the extra sensory perceptions those types of things\nI I really think that a lot of ... counters that happen out there um the base of it has to do with um telepathy or I'm sort of 'em are coming in being\nReal sensitive to the environment and picking up something that's in the environment than other people on my main theories in the book over um what I call a uh hello Patrick distress signals and sort of how they play a role and goes way encounters\nA start really think that um people's ... the ... is a real or it was a real important part of it goes way encounter\nHow important then use the person as opposed to something like this\n[noise] um I I think that it's um\nIt's kind of a fifty fifty thing and I know that's kind of a weird answer to say there but uh I think there's so many people out there I think there's a lot of people out there there are more prone to go slowly encounters but I also think that the event is sort of a catalyst to everything that's happening so when I say that\nYou know I I think if we look at a lot of the ... counters that are out there the catalyst is usually a crisis of some kind right I'm\nA death or\nLife threatening events or some sort of trauma or something like that is the catalyst to these ghostly encounters or so the event is an important part of it it's what happens after that event um and I think when you have the events when you have this trauma I think it is sort of\nThere's a lot of things that happened after that and one of those things is um you know emotional\nDistress so you have an event you have an emotional distress trauma life threatening you're gonna have all these emotions that are associated with it and then that leads to sort of these by energetic shift that happen inside us I mean we're all electricity and when that happens I think that it actually triggers\nSort of our innate ability to send a distress signal to somebody else\nAnd and the great classic example of this is the crisis aberration All right so we probably heard of these\nThis is when I'm sitting in my room on a random Tuesday night and I look to the left and there's a an aberration of\nMy aunt and she says you know um I Love you goodbye and then I get a call the next day saying you know my aunt passed\nAway right on time that I had a right and I and I\nAnd I think that that you can sort of see there\nWas a trauma life threatening event with my aunt she was dying and somehow she sent 'em a top athlete distressing they'll saying to me and I picked up on it and it showed up as an aberration of some kind\nOf as you say some people do get these experiences why not\nWell I I think it actually comes down to something I'm pretty mundane [laughter]\nI there's a lot of research out there in something called environmental sensitivity All right and um\nWhat environmental sensitivity as it's not like psychics sensitivity it's not like I'm chip coffee and Sylvia brown and and those types of psychic sensitivity where your mediums and\nUm you have psychic abilities but something as simple and concrete as sort of our ability to taste touch and smell and that's what environmental sensitivity is\nI'm so those who are are environmentally sensitive are simply picking up on the environment to a higher degree than the normal population\nSo if you think about this as humans man you we both experienced the world differently we're both affected by and react to the environment in different ways but the physical environment\nCertain people more than others and this leads to all kinds of conditions and

self\n... and um and and that sort of under special conditions\nI'll call them goes enter into our universe I'm so in this example the witness in a sense was able to access the previous timer dimension universe\nAnd she was able to look back and see what's happening that location and maybe the child and the mom saw this woman dressed and futuristic ... futuristic clothing and got terrified and ran away so it's almost like a glimpse into something else\nAnd a lot of times these are perceived as ghostly encounters\nYou ever when you're doing these ah these studies have you ever encountered something where you'd even scared to death\nI'm personally no I haven't been scared that legit I had an experience I'm a I live in sort of the country a rural area of Ohio\nAnd um [noise] oh one morning a new my wife was out of town and I'm\nOne morning I had I kept getting these overwhelming feeling like something's wrong like fear like adrenaline and I was sort of drawn to the outside uh we have a four acres and upon and I said why is that why do I feel this way and my dog was feeling the same way to normal she's pretty calm in the morning but she was like scratch and they get outside\nSo I'm like yeah this is you know my scientific brains going just take a shower and go to work and don't worry about it you know and I'm like you know what I'm going to go ahead and I'm going to follow through with this\nSo I opened the door the dog and me and went outside in the back yard and she sniffing around and I'm like I still got this feeling and then I looked over at the pond and I saw something like in the pond floating\nAnd I started walking and then I started running and it was a neighborhood cat had gotten into the pond and and somehow um you know drowned in\nThere by you know it's still in the ... you know all that stuff [laughter]\nBut I found myself this is it's not so much scary looking back on and it's a little scary but something drew me out there you know I I go to work every day you know it's the same thing\nAnd I never got that feeling that desire to go outside but something happened and I kept asking myself what what happened what made that day different\nAnd was there is some sort of like distress signal sense to me with the cat and distress and it's kind of linked with me and the dog and then I you know so that's it's not scary in a sense but looking back on it it's kind of like this so many cool things happen there it's really an amazing experience\nHow many people are normal experiences occur Brandon because the person who died who comes back never had someone tune as business had they had to tell somebody wanted to get something done\nI\nFeel I don't know percentage on that um I I Would say that you know a lot of the a lot of the cases out there of ghostly encounters have\nTo do with easing are coping with a psychological injury like the staff of a father or something\nRight you know I'm\n... you know you're sort of struggling with the death ah there's all these emotions happening um so you know the body sort of\nDo the electricity or the emotion signify a psychological injury and that sort of sets in motion of plan to sort of ...\nPsychological wound through another whatever means possible so maybe if you're not able to cope through normal means you might use unconventional means you know and if you have collective unconscious and there are collective consciousness exist and memories\nOf personalities and experiences of all of our humans are ... stored in the atmosphere um you might be able to tap into this field um and and get some sort of resolution like or your father showing up and saying don't be sad I'm In a better place you know and and I think these things\nThe research out there really said that I think it's up to eighty percent of elderly people experience these um bereavement operations associated with their spouse one month after their death um so that's a\nPretty high number eighty percent it's huge yeah yeah\nYeah and and perhaps these bereavement operations er visits from the deceive shortly after death are are kind of more important to our individual and perhaps ... could be sort of a way\nTo process emotions and ensure that our cycle like psychological well being of the survivor you know final goodbye from the deceased\nCouldn't help but to move on through crisis or grief\nOr maybe if we didn't have that when the person died it might be a good way to sort of move towards revolution and I and when I talk to the these people that have these encountered they often report feeling more at ease or accepting of a loved one death after the evaporation\nAnd I think on TV usually go negative negative negative negative negative but there's a lot of positive um it can come out of it goes and counter you know this idea of wait a minute there is something more to life where there is\nUm something to look forward to it's just not a negative and demons and things like a\nBrand and what have you concluded above the people who are more receptive to these kinds of preparations and encounters than others what's so special about them\n[noise] that that's a great question I Wish I had a definite answer for that um I think [noise]\nYou know something narrow biological is different about them you know when they put them there's there's some cats out there specifically with people who claim to be really sensitive to electricity and things like\nI Would like human magnets or something or\nYeah yeah exactly you know the research is kind of sometimes fifty fifty if you want to think about that thing this phenomenon exist and and it doesn't exist but there's\nSome really unique experimental design that um you know where they're actually doing F F MRI's jeeze and what they're finding is their their brain it actually and their bodies are reacting to this electricity at very low levels so there's some sort of\nObjective evidence that they can detect things that are more than ... other people and the general population can\nYou know so and this is true for which we all we all experienced pain differently right and they've shown that throughout all rise as well so you you know you know I might get hooked with um a pen and to me it's a horrible painful event for you it's not really that\nDoesn't hurt at all stay with us brand

work branded if anything\n[noise]\nUm [noise] you know most people actually when they find out that you wrote a book about goes are interested in advance sigh most people will tell me a story\n[laughter] and they've all got one don't think they do\nAnd I was really shocked you know you gotta sit back and kind of way when you put yourself out there publicly but it's really been positive\nYou know there's there's still some colleagues you'll come up to me and go you know I don't tell me a story but then they follow it up with you can't do any water or anything like that but there was a pretty positive you know it's something that's really fascinating and it it made it\nHistory and it's been intriguing for human since the dawn of time you know does this go stuff um so you know it's not that bizarre or out of context\nAnd listen I mean parents psychology is a subset of psychology it's a legitimate discipline\nJust like social psychology and narrow psychology it's an academic field you know the University of Edinburgh where I studied as a top twenty five university they are the ones that clone sheep and the nineties Charles Darwin went there and they have a whole department dedicated to studying pair psychology or paranormal phenomenon which is\nFor those of us in the field it's you know that's a great thing it's taken seriously for a lot of people\nWhat's out there that has baffled usual for brand and you don't have the answers for you wish you did\n[noise] ah well I'll be honest with you I think or any type of um\nCulture guys activity or recurrent spontaneous psycho ... says we're objects are moving and I really don't know what's going on in those types of cases\nYou know the do humans have the ability to move objects if they're\nUm in distress um you know to me it's hard to fathom you have the ability of like when a poultry guys I'm a you know we'll call it a ghost moving objects when they can't physically touch them and things like that I really don't know the answers to that\nUm so you know it it's it's something I always read about and I go back and forth on well maybe that's true maybe that's not but yeah that's one that's always baffled me\nWhy new rules seemed to move our car keys [laughter]\nI don't know there's a whole book in that George you should get on that\nMr Bush or something else to give us another story if you weren't\nSure um I was lying awake in bed for hours I could not fall asleep and I could not understand why I was very anxious and felt as if something was not right without warning soft glowing light appeared next to my bed the light gradually morphed into the form of a man who am I recognize instantly as my ex husband he\nDid not say anything and appear to be just staring at me what was bizarre wasn't I wasn't scared and I had little reaction aside from being curious\nThe next day I got a call from my son my ex husband's child fitting my accent died the night before unexpectedly his death occurred around the same time I saw the image of my room I think he wanted to say goodbye one last time\nSo this is a case of a crisis operation that we talked about earlier so we've all heard of these but it it will straits the role of fill up at the or a sigh phenomenon and operations so as a man was experiencing intense emotional chefs related to the process of dying in a in a way sent a\nHello Patrick distress message to his ... ex wife who we felt linked with\nIn this case the woman witness I'm the typical soft glow in the white operation or those types of things um and what's really fascinating is since his death we don't really know the time of his death you know we know that this happened around the time of his death we aren't sure if this is\nI'm a ghost or telepathy or a sigh phenomenon\nMy suspicion is you know as a person is dying and these crisis events they're kind of\nA in a life threatening situation they send something out into the environment like a message tell a path ugly if you want to think about it like that and it resonates with people who they are linked with in this case you know the life may know maybe the son got a similar experience that night as well\nBut this is a great example of a crisis aberration sigh phenomenon but also begs the question you know was this\nDid this happen after he died or did this happen as he was dying or before he was dying and you can never really pin down the times to the exact moment 'cause obviously we don't know exactly when the guy passed away\nAnd you find that energy and electricity has something to do this well\nOh yeah yeah I it's one of the most common themes when it comes to paranormal and I'm a ghostly encounters electricity and it seems to be\nYou know was the most prevalent things but the the idea is I mean listen we're we all think the electricity comes from you know toasters and street lamps and things like that but you know electricity electrical fields comes from humans as well an animal's\nSure does so you know any involvement of humans also includes the involvement of electricity because lectures that he is the basis for our thoughts are emotions are movements or we're all a collection of electrical signals\nFive people who walked by street lights and the lights go wild as they get on a on a range the lights go back on again\nYeah exactly so we're all sort of traveling around with her own bag of electricity and it's just like sensitivity to environment it's all different for for everyone is walking around in a way\nUm so it's it's really important when you talk about paranormal experiences because really the only constant in all paranormal experiences is the idea of a human being president to sort of experience that operation a poultry guy so an eerie feeling a temperature change an uneasiness or whatever\nSo for humans always present electricity electrical fields magnetic field they're always president as well since since the first goes counter ever\nUm you know ... and that's an important thing to think about you know we're always immersed in\nElectromagnetic fields we can avoid them you know as as part of earth that's what it is you know and the Mets have always been linked you know there's some research saying that you know abnormal or fluctuating maps can actually cause a ghostly encounters\nUm you know sort of trick the brain into thinking you're having a goes to encounter a on the other side of that\nThere is this idea that you know electromagnetic fields have to do with with ghosts and goes for encounters and you know every TV show and paranormal investigator team uses or he amassed meter and that's an important part of the for them indicating that goes to this president\nYou know for the EMS as moving haphazard way through the house like a person walking the belief is obviously that that's it goes\nUh whereas if you have a fluctuating he amassed next to a dishwasher you can probably say well that's a dishwasher worried um so yeah energy electricity electromagnetic fields\nVery ... very entangled with goes way encounters even when I hear these real life goes to encounter some people will say you know uh I just felt like you know my hair was standing up or I felt the room felt Energizer like there was it felt like a\nOf electricity in the air or you know I reached towards the operation in my hand felt like it was shot you know those types of things are always comment as well\nJust go to Jason in St Louis Missouri to get things started hey Jay going in the\nMorning George yeah Brian question or do you believe that spirit [noise] [laughter] I ... in walls and [laughter] and watch what we're seeing in and do we\nDo they hide in wall Purina on us Brandon\nNo I I don't think so you you know and and then this is obviously just my opinion um there's no way to definitely prove this but but I don't see it goes that sort of I'm\nHanging around all day watching us you know like a TV um I see the ghostly encounters and paranormal experiences happening at certain times in certain events for certain reasons like the the Halloween thing we talked about before there's some sort of need for that interaction\nAnd and sometimes when people have interactions and where there isn't a need it's more people sort of like we talked about linking up to the environment and having an experience of some guys\nYou know there's that intelligent hunting that sort of like the cream of the crop you know those types of things are harder to explain in and sometimes that falls into an earth bounce spirit but I don't I don't necessarily think they hang around in the walls and kind of watch us in a way\nUm you know just like when we walk into a hunting building it's not like a zoo where we have to you know call out for the goes to come out and you know try to encourage them er instigate them by yelling at them\nYou know it it doesn't to me it doesn't work like that there's so many complex processes that happen whether\nIt's the person the environments are resonating the frequencies all the stuff we talked about earlier that just simply yelling goes come out is not sufficient enough in my view I I
