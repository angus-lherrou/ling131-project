longtime friend the coast to coast am of courts and Mitch has a very popular voice of audio books as well his latest the miracle club Mitch welcome back\nMuch George great to be here\nIt's a pleasure my friend what you've been up to these days\nWell a today is the launch day of the miracle club which is very exciting for me because it's probably the first book I've written that is strictly practical that goes into techniques and methods and ah it's a big bridge that I've crossed with this book and I'm very grateful to have the chance to talk to the coast family about it\nIt's a great title to by the way the miracle club it sounds like a movie already\n[laughter] you know it was a group of a cult explores here in New York City in the nineteenth century and they were dedicated to exploring everything just like you do on your show and I really wanted to revive the spirit of that original group\nOr their motto was try that that just one word try and that's really been my informal motto throughout my whole life so I use the term in tribute to them\nHow many members of the club\n[laughter] it was probably about five of them they were just a little group outside of Manhattan and Eighteen Seventy five while we're experimenting\nWith San says and medium ship and talking to the dead end table rapping and so on they weren't around for very long but they formed the nucleus of a much larger and more influential group the esophageal society which is still around today and which is probably responsible for the whole revolution and alternative spirituality\nThat is amazing too because during that era the Eighteen hundreds it seems like the dabbling in the paranormal was different than today Mitch yeah and they really took it seriously didn't they\nVery seriously and they had the spirit of childlike wonder I mean they were delving into mysterious things and they were looking into some dark places\nBut they were doing it with their sense of just asking themselves what is out there how can we understand life you know it was a period of time when a Darwinism was in the attendance and people were starting to think maybe we've been wrong about\nGod and spirits any invisible world and these people said listen we don't want to throw science out we embrace science but we want to use science to try to experiment with whether we can detect things about the invisible world\nThomas Edison believe it or not was a member of this original group and he talked about wanting to construct a machine that can help people talk to the dead it's not clear whether at us and ultimately did that but he and a major general Adnan doubled day we're both early members\nThat's amazing now tell us a little bit about the book the miracle club and and because it's also a practical guide book isn't it\nIt really is you know for many years I've written\nAnd I've been on the show talking about alternative spiritual history the history of the occult but I've always also considered myself a believing historian I experimented with the ideas and the methods and approaches that I write about and I wanted to take the opportunity\nTo write about the things that I've tried myself I Believe very strongly in the powers of the mind I Believe that thoughts are positive I Believe that if you walk around with a deeply held emotionally charged mental picture that is going to affect what happens to you and you can use that and there are reasons for this\nAnd I wanted to write a book that would give people concrete has on math\nIs what do you think a miracle is Mitch\nA miracle very simply put is something that is a radical departure from all natural expectation and occurrence that breaks away from everything that you could naturally and reasonably expect to arise\nFrom circumstances and I've experienced miracles in my own life the very fact that you and I are talking you know I didn't start reading my own books until I was into middle age I Am currently fifty two years old and my career did not take off\nUntil I was in my forties and that didn't happen by accident there was a mental picturing there was a visualization\nWas an affirmation as well as a lot of sweat equity but I Do believe if you can define miracle as a radical departure from circumstance miracles do occur today\nHence the subtitle of the book in which is how thoughts become reality and you're you're very strong believer in that aren't you\nI really am and you know it's funny if you actually take a look at your life sometimes there is a long interval sometimes there is a long gestation period between a font and the event but if if if listeners really sit back and survey their lives\nThey will find an uncanny ... grew in sea between things that they've thought about and things that have happened to them\nMitch have you found the people who dabble with the dark side tend to do some of ... the similar things that the positive people do but that something always goes awry for them\nWell it's an interesting question you know we face these ethical questions of how to use our powers\nAll the time in life you know a person could be completely materialist he or she can be an atheist and they still face ethical questions\nEvery single day about whether they're treating other people fairly honorably if you take seriously as I Do that our minds have these extra physical capacities\nThat responsibility becomes all the more that responsibility becomes that much stronger my contention is that however we may feel buffet by the winds and currents of life we are much more powerful than we think we are we have a hand in events\nMentally and and often these shows up in ways that we don't suspect\nSo my messages also be careful be careful because what you're thinking about absolutely has a practical dimension on your life and on the lives\nOf other ... before you came on and he said he was in Israel and of course great mental list\nAnd it was telling us the story and how he was commissioned to help the Brits in a soccer match against Scotland\nAnd over the stadium they put him in a helicopter and he was supposed to influence the ball and and I guess when the when the Scottish kicker was going to the ball or a mentally moved in and the guy missed it or something like\nThat and now here's a story about or he's an old or a family friend and he was over at the house hold up my brother in law I've and when I was Fifteen Years old\nAnd I've and expressed all kinds of skepticism and er he said to him do me a favor I've and go into your bedroom and draw a picture and so I've been when his bedroom drew a picture came out and said\nYou drew a house and I was shocked and said that's absolutely what he true\n[laughter] I Know Edgar Mitchell delayed astronaut when he was on our program was talking about a tie class episode he had a NASA tie class\nAnd the ... or or type pin and he lost it and you couldn't find it and he was telling Henri bonded in out of the sky just out of nowhere they heard upping\nAnd it was the tight class that that fell on the ground and came out of nowhere the other part of it the the part that class into the the pointed at the end of it yeah was in ... ice cream [laughter]\nYellow swallowed it I mean it's amazing these are the ... in there for that [laughter] I was just amazing but\nBack to these miracles and we take calls next hour I'd like for people to share miracle stories with you Mitch if we can but back to the dark side of it and I don't want to dabble in the dark in too much but you know that'd be too but\nYou know people dabble in the dark side the curse other people they put exes on other people in in a lot of cases those things happen to these people yeah how how come than the dark side has that kind of power\n[noise] well it represents something that's in us you know when we we we are being of of of a broad spectrum\nAnd my contention is that thoughts are ... and whether you are using your thoughts through spell or whether you're using your thoughts through a ritual or whether you are projecting thoughts at other people\nSomething's going to happen there is going to be some effect\nHowever one of my favorite teachers never God or to grade teacher in the mind our tradition\nTeaches that the only way that you can project\nA negative spell or thought on to another person is if that person could wish the same thing for someone else is if that person could wish the same thing for someone else if he or she could not get rebounds tea is so uncertain\nSince well we grew up calling the golden rule is protection against evil forces and I want people to listen to that very carefully because we're apt to overlook familiar things we're apt to overlook simple things\nIf you are concerned about negative forces in your life the golden rule can serve as an enormous source of protection there is an esoteric and a cult dimensions of the golden rule that we don't always appreciate\nWell that's absolutely true now why do our thoughts shape the reality of what happens\nThis is my contention in the book and I felt they really had to put myself out there and come up with a theory of positive thinking I'm going to be very brief about it across all kinds of Sciences from cyclical researched quantum theory rising we have made the determination over the past eight

spoke it does not need to be spoken out loud agreed to them to use an affirmation\nIs those few very relaxed moments just before you drift off to sleep at night sleep researchers call that the hidden a gothic state it is a state of time when you could not only reprogram your own psyche\nThrough repeating affirmation Z or prayers or holding visualizations but\nBut cyclical researchers have also

silently repeat them to themselves in those few moments just before going to sleep at night that is an exquisitely unusual supple suggestible time it's a time that each of us experiences every day you also experience it's just as you're\nComing to consciousness in the morning use that time that is the prime time for silently reciting affirmation stew yourself\n[noise] and it seems to work doesn't\nThat's been my experience George when people ask me for a simple step to take that is always the step I give them again my monitor is never neglect simple things we have a habit of overlooking simple things used them there's more depth there than one might expect\nOne or some of the positives of mind control methods we should use\nWell one of the things that's most important is writing things down right down your goals and I don't mean on the computer I mean get out and old fashioned pencil and paper and do it because once you do that you've\nActually created a physical manifestation so to speak of the thing that you're looking for the actual tactile act of writing something I think not only helps\nPersuade you mentally and in terms of your neural pathways of the goals that you're moving towards but you've actually done something empowering you've done something real if you sit down and for a sustained period of time make a list of things that you truly want in life\nAnd you know these are things you want with all your heart there not diversionary but they are essential life goals\nTake that list put it on to some sort of a laminated card or something that you can carry with you look at it morning noon and night\nThink about it as much as possible and when things on that list come to you and overtime they will come to you and they may come to quicker than you think just expressed gratitude and most important of all\nDon't tell anyone what you're doing remain silent because sometimes you share these things with other people and they'll roll their eyes or they'll say it's nonsense than they knock you off your resolve remain silent make your list carry it with you review it three times a day memorize it\nAnd when the results arrive express things that is a method we can all do and it's easy isn't it once you get into it\nIs easy ... the the the important thing is to do it with consistency is to do it with silence and it's to do it with total stark honesty\nArriving at a definite aim in life or a ... a small number of things to coalesce around one name has enormous power an aim is really another way of saying focus and we know that\nWhen you focus the sun's rays with a magnifying glass prism they become enormously powerful what is a laser other than focused light\nNatural laws are consistent your mind is powerful when it is focused which is why I keep emphasizing and the idea that you have to really\nNail down what you want in a very concrete way and be very honest with yourself that's worth focus comes from\nMitch since you've been doing this have you use these techniques for yourselves\nEvery day every single day George\nAnd I must tell you you know I my life has gone in directions that I never could have expected I've done television then narrating and and and and written many books and articles\nIncluding in places that are not known for their cold enthusiasm [laughter] I've written about these topics in the Washington Post the wall Street Journal the New York times I never dreamt that was possible and so I feel like I'm an example of the effectiveness of these\nMethods and everything that are offered to the coast family or things that I wrote tested myself I Would never ask somebody to do something that I hadn't experimented with myself\nOr you could tell you love doing what you're doing\nI really do I really do I mean you know it's a dream come true in the most literal sense you know Fifteen Years ago this is exactly what I pictured myself doing and exactly what I wanted to do the patient

of the ... of the miracle club but I got to thinking you know speaking of magic decoder rings maybe it would be fun of people had a little membership card so I asked a friend of mine a great artist named Tim boat\nTo draw up a membership card in America club and anybody who emailed me\nAnd I'm super easy to find throw my name into Google it'll take it on my website and my email email me and I will send you your own membership card to be in the miracle club you could sign that you could folded laminated carry it in your wallet just something fun to have with you to sort of keep you on course throughout the day to keep your thoughts\nSteady and productive so I I thought it would be fun for people to have an official card\nA designating their membership and the miracle club so send me an email you get America club membership card\nWe're going to take calls next hour with Mitch or what's in of course we will take your miracle stories as well I Would guess Mitch it's surprising

what we're looking for and I would say that's more than just the turn of the roulette wheel our minds play a role\nIn that again a miracle is a departure from all expected and all reasonable

R. D. I. A. dot com\n[noise]\n\n\nAnd we'll come back to the coast to coast George George with you along with Mitch Horwitz Mitch told me about the power behind writing down the goal women going for it\nYou know it's interesting when we write down a goal in really demands that we pull something out of us that's authentic and that's kind of the magic key to all of this material I Would say that absolute passionate intensity is the one the hidden key behind every self help program with it\nOr something will work without it nothing happens\nNow one of my contention is that we really need to have one absolute definite chief aim in life and that could be something that we very often resist writing things down can help us with that because if you write down what you really care about over a course of days are over the course of weeks you'll see that it will all tend\nIn one direction and my challenge to the listener is whether you can come up with one overarching goals that facilitates all of the smaller ones what would that be if you can come up with one chief aim you have arrived at mental focus\nAnd mental focus is the open sesame so to speak to everything that we've been talking about\nInteresting work miniature what's with us and Mitch did you get some professional help when you put those together or did you do this on your own\nDo all of my own you know this is really my tribute to the thought of my own heroes in the mental healing tradition of things that they've thought about things that I have experimented with ideas that I came up with myself\nA you know I view the miracle club is something that we all belong to all of us who were drivers all of us who are experimenter as we are all automatically in the miracle club and my idea was just to create something around which we could all gather and experiment with our minds\nWhat would you say would be a great miracles story that you've heard about\nA great miracles through that I've heard about was a financial miracle I had a friend\nIn New England who was recovering from a very\nSerious disease and he was facing financial disaster he had only one hundred and two dollars left to his name and he was on the brink of losing his health insurance one night I challenged people like challenged people to make a marathon reading of the book George that I Know you love very deeply the magic of believe\nIn ... and ... yeah\nAnd my friend rather than reading the book decided to get hold of an audio version of it that I happen to narrate he listened to it over and over and over for about five days on the fifth day he got a call from an old boss\nWho said to him you know you left behind a four O. one K. account here have you checked that account and my friend said on that unity and carry thought it was a few dollars and cents\nHis old boss had to have you looked at it there's over fifty thousand\nDollars genes in ...\nYeah I can only tell you that that's what happened and to my friend he truly felt like a miracle\nThat is America it really is\nYeah it's exactly what he experienced and was quite recent that when you least expect it you know yes\nYes that's why I tell people you know again George it can sound sort of Hackney to say never give up with these things do happen when you least expect it you can always give it another twenty four hours you have no idea what twists and turns life is going to take in as much as life visits catastrophe on us and it does\nIt also visit extraordinary absurdly good news on us and you never know you never know what life is going to take in twenty four hours I always in poor people who feel desperate among other things among other things given twenty four hours more\nYou are a believer in visualizing before something happens aren't you have\n... absolutely I think that if you can get yourself into a quiet meditative state and we all enter this wonderful drowsy but still conscious and Congress and state just before we fall asleep

climb a ladder for example don't see yourself climbing the ladder like climb climb you know really feel those rungs\nIn your hands really feel the weight of your of your feet pressing on each run as you climb put yourself in a simple scene and then run that seen through your mind over and over again it's important to choose one simple scene\nIn order to keep your mind from wandering because you will find that your mind wanders\nAnd you always need to bring it back if you can feel the emotions\nOf what would be happening as you're acting out that scene like somebody shaking her hand and saying congratulations maybe your boss telling you got a promotion at work\nIn time and time that will Congress ties into reality may be in ways that you don't expect there may be a long period of

yacht for that I heard all of a a lot of how well you\nWell good for you but they do happen Mitch don't think\nThey do happen and it's also very important that we pass things on you know what we wish for other people rebounds to us because in effect\nKnow if if the mind is extra physical and then we all belong to some great over mine Ralph Waldo Emerson called at the oversold new pony and he'll
