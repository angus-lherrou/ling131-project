on the show to are also but he did and uh but he really couldn't help set the stage because he really didn't know exactly what the heck they were going to do it's like when we were in one of the studios I Know\nWe're doing a um [noise] a something for one of the talking head magazines I don't know which one it was and we came around the corner and there was a a myth barber stand with standing there\nAnd I I looked at her and I in my mind went totally blank all I could remember was Victoria Barclay from the big\nValerie are exactly and what she was classic actually\nAll while and she was a little clip of us think she was so tiny\nAnd so and I'm I'm starring because it's like oh my gosh and ah and she was found and she was so disgusted the way the movies were being made now the way the studios were acting\nAnd she says none of this would have been allowed in James made the mistake of some one of the cameraman said who is that [noise]\nAnd James made some mistake of saying some old time movie actor\nOh no oh yeah you know better than that of\nCourse he did but I think he was just let's get this you know let's keep going I literally I I had to talk her into letting me make the white light and go into it\nAnd I she says I got to keep things going here and I said and how's it going for you is anybody listening to you and she just looked at me and I says and how many people have you talked to since you've been dead and she just looked at me I said you have no idea how much better you could do if you went to the light\nAnd she said huh and I said have you talked to other people live people\nShe said no and I said so do you think I'm telling you the truth she said yeah go ahead and make it she says I'll go but you show up and talk about it in she went in the light so I

dime I didn't understand why they did it it's like one goes whisper was being shocked\nFor somebody to buy it out there in LA and ah the person that would take me around took me to this this house of a couple of producers that had a ghost in their house and sell\nIt turned out that they knew who the ghost was which is actually sort of unusual because usually the person doesn't know they don't go right and so and I guess he thought it was really important he says to me while I was a person on the ... whore house he says and and uh and I helped you know\nWork on that and I looked at him and I sort of squinting my eyes at him and I said boy do I have a bone to pick with you and he looked\nAt me I says why did you put flies in the attic what do you have to do with anything\nAnd he said we have Fifteen seconds to kill I said\nFlies had nothing to do was go I you needed to exterminate or not a gold\nPerson I says why did you even do that it's like people they just they do things that

but I mean could that cost a curse on somebody's life Fifteen Years later you\nMaybe it depends on how powerful the individual is\nOkay and then um as far as uh uh uh I don't know what is on the idea of energies shopping or something I've noticed that ah in in myself when I feel kinda awkward and uncomfortable or around people if I think of myself as sort of a White House generating not visible light\nBut then for red warm you know and you're not supposed to draw attention to myself it calms me down and I think it makes people feel better too\nI think so too I'm reading a book on Frank Sinatra and ah you talk about energy this guy\nEither way either ... direction I mean he was on or off\nWhen he was on a lot of people love to be around him when he was off a lot of people wanting to be away from it\nWas amazing how that kind of energy works both ways positive negative next up we're going to rolling in Springfield, Ohio we used to the Rockies hey roll and thanks for calling\nMorning our way today\nWe are fine thank you hope you are too\nOften Yes sir I had a weird experience at a local\nLike I'm not far from where I live probably within an hour has friends come\nOver the person I worked with and so they are going up to the lake you want to go and not a well I had just had a scan acts that my name was all swelled up and I dislocated\nIt I thought well no he goes well you might as well get up and move around\nOn others as otherwise it's just a stove up so I have talked me into it I went and uh\nLike I said it was about an hour away and we got up that direction and hung out with people for a little while and ah they don't want to go to a bar probably I don't know maybe\nAnother thirty miles from where we were there and uh I was like well whatever you know I got to be late afternoon but time and the early evening and a wintertime\nAnd we got up there and I got this real strange feeling\nAfter I got into the bar or they knew people there I didn't know anybody other than who I drive with and it was just weird it felt like everybody in there that was in that bar we're focused on me I didn't understand\nWhy at the time you know and I thought well what the heck just about\nLike a bar full of empires from something here exactly it's like well I mean I felt like a a lamb or the slaughter right and sign up on a road or something yeah\nAnd and I I got real uncomfortable and I told him I said hey look I'm not feeling good I I Need to go\nSo they they agreed and and we left that place then they went to this other place that way out in the country and it was an old I mean this was an old dad gum seating bar yeah and I went in there with them\nAnd to this place and that was a bunch of old\nPeople that there again I felt that are in the in the air and uh I told him I said hey look I'm all just go sit out in the car\nBut these these folks who brought you there they felt comfortable right\nOh well I've known them because I've worked with him um and uh yeah there are to me it didn't you know I didn't feel any threat from them it was just in the places that I attended they know where they took me\nAnd I'm like I said it ended up being a night of heavy snow and it ended up being a level three snow warning which means that you're not even supposed to be out\nSo we're out in the country after I go out back to the second bar after I go out and sit in a car and they finally decided well come on let's go\nWell we go down the road a little bit and next thing you know a war off on the farm and the car won't move forward or backward guards there was like six or seven of us in the car\nAnd uh they tried pushing couldn't get no no momentum so they decided they were going to walk up to this house and see if I could get some help on the house was completely dark and you know I sat in a car I couldn't walk\nSo I was I was I was stuck no matter what on there is no way I could run away do anything\nAnd I think that was you know part of what people were sensing when I was there you know in those places earlier in the evening\nAnd the more time went on time went on I started getting nervous around these people when and so I just sat there to myself and the only thing I could think to do was ah our father who art in heaven hallowed\nBe thy name police are doing that under\nMy in my mind over and over and over reciting the Lord's Prayer\nAnd it was weird because those guys are this one girl that was what this dude and I went up her where she looked at me and I was an honoring a word she says are you praying\nAnd I says yep [noise] and she goes even better\nShe knew one looming up\nI was like oh my goodness about ten minutes later here come the people at walked up to the house\nAnd says any luck you know the telephone nope instead\nAnd I was like wow that was weird so they get in the car started up\nAnd pull out with no problem\nLike I didn't understand that we're in a car pulled out of the bomb where we were stuck\nNow at any point did they try to hurt you or anything\nNo no but you know I just kept I just kept that that father was the Lord Jesus in my heart\nWould you have these dreams
