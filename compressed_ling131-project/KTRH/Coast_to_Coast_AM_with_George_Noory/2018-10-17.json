Serling his life working imagination the name of the book Nicholas how many twilight zone episodes were there a hundred and fifty six\nWell that's why I think ... gallery that came out in color after the twilight zone didn't quite have that twilight zone magic to it\nThat's one of the reasons I think yeah yeah the other reason is that rod really had no creative control over that series unfortunately\nWhat was his role\nWell he he created the series um he he wrote the pilot film which was called my gallery was three stories and it was a it was kind of a ... movie of the week kind of\nThing and even ... he's the one will probably pitched it to the network will I bring all the\nYeah after that was such a success he pitched it and they kind of mutually pitched each other and and so he he wrote a lot for the series and he hosted it obviously but he had no say in cast and directing and editing and all that kind of thing and and you see\nThat kind of his absence come up all the time in episode where you say uh you know rod would have done this or you know and he didn't have that freedom to do that\nHow come you never wrote a book\nWell he never a novel he did write your collections of short stories\n... sure but I mean the closest\nThe ever came to writing anything that was novel length was actually\nThe stories that made up tonight gallery movie uh they originally were developed as they were long short stories I'm In a book called the season to be wary\nI'm ... but he never had the time you know that's the simple answer he ... he was so busy with tells me he he wanted to write a novel he really did but he just never could get away for long enough period of time to dedicate to writing a novel\nThere's there's going to be removed the twilight zone\nYes it's it's already in production and it's just supposed to be coming out early next year I'm Jordan Peele who the director and writer of get out or is in charge of it he's going to be hosting it and producing it\nAnd from what little I've seen so far in terms of trailers and things I'm I'm cautiously optimistic I think they may actually get it right to some extent this time\nWe're the what's the venue for where they're going to hear it\nIt's going to be on CBS all access so it's not going to be on regular TV it's going to be a pay you know like um [noise] you know Netflix or Amazon Prime that kinda thing so CBS all access and the interesting thing about that is\nThey launched the CBS all all access network with Star Trek with a new Star Trek series and now they're adding onto that with the twilight zone so it's like they you know the going way back to get these shows to to launch this new network so it tells you how you know how classic these shows are that can be ... re introduced to a whole new audience in this way\nNicolas wandering around surely one of the co writers of planet of the apes\nHe sure was in a lot of people still still don't are surprised when you say that but yes he was he didn't really get credit for it to well he did get literally get credit for it on the screen it's ... it's the the credit is\nWritten by Michael Wilson and rod Serling a coke credit but ever since the movie came out there's always been this kind of you know what did he really right you know what what do you really can contribute to the final film and it's been a lot of misinformation and and speculation about what he did right so that's another thing that I think I clarify in the book\nSome of these is shows whether it was not gallery your twilight zone and in the era of supernatural to it what was his belief about that\nHe was he was a skeptic but he was very interested in it he was a\nHeat you know Carol certainly was once asked that question and and I think the answer she gave us the best answer to give she said that he wanted to believe\nHe had that he really wanted to believe that you know the aliens had been here you know a thousand years ago and he was very open to these theories of you know the crop circles and you know we only visitations in UFO sightings and all that kind of stuff\nBut he was also very practical guy and he was he didn't have any experience of his own he never saw a spaceship or anything like that so he was always skeptical but but he really had an interest in it and you know in the early seventies a rod narrated some very popular\nOr documentaries about this kind of thing you know in search of ancient astronauts in search of ancient mysteries which led to the series in search of\nAnd during that time particularly he really got interested in this thing but I don't think he ever you know went over to the side of being a true believer or anything like\nThat now the twilight zone there were thirty minute episodes but I guess mine is commercial time there were about what twenty two twenty three minutes\nTwenty four most of them yeah back then now nowadays or thirty minutes she'll be twenty two but back then it was twenty four yeah a little less commercials\nThat's still a lot of writing isn't it\nOh yeah yeah um yeah and and the amazing thing\nIn his how fully developed rod Serling can write a story in a character and twenty four minutes you know he he often\nA complaint about that to some extent said how hard it is to write a fully developed story in twenty four minutes and then he went out and did it over and over again you know so he um he was able to succeed in a in a in a venue that you know it's very hard to succeed in\nIt's very difficult to pin point your very favorite twilight zone episode because they were all different and they were all great\nIt's yeah it's um you know it is and and the show was so yeah but as you said if so they're so different it was very hard to pigeon hole the twilight zone it covered the gamut from you know hard science fiction and fantasy too westernized comedies to you know it went across the board so\nUm you know I you know I have a couple of favorites you know just a you know to\nThrow a couple of my favorite at this point probably as is walking distance wrote songs for season a episode about his kind of archetype will you know businessman who stressed out and wants to go back to his home town and you know really this youth and go back to our easier less stressful\nLife was that the Willoughby or it's just like well yeah it's kind of a stop it will be a kind of a companion piece to twelve distance\nYeah so they both very similar and they're both among among the favorites and that was that was a big theme visceral English this idea of going back to his innocent youth and bring him to New York\nI I I Love like I mentioned I sing the body electric uh to serve man that was a classic a\nMan is absolutely a classic and and it's again one of those shows that people still now to this day they know that ending its a cookbook you know they that's\nThat's ever [laughter] and they're just so many good in the uh what was the name of the one where the guy was obsessed with the ah he hated gambling and then all of a sudden he was obsessed with a slot machine that kept calling his name\nYeah that was called the fever and start a average Sloan who actually started rod Serling his very first breakthrough hit called patterns on crafts theater\nOr you start in that and you start in the fever and yeah exactly he was he was against gambling and he

the current state of TV\n[noise] well I I think in a in one regard I think he would be thrilled with how adults television has become in you know in the in the realm of drama\nUh during the time the restrooms renting obviously we talked about some of the censorship but\nNot on the issues but also the language and and just the ... the subject matter in general even if it wasn't a social issue um you know today there are so many shows that are that are are so adults in scope or you know I don't even have to name them but you know Mad Men and Breaking Bad and\nYou know not just cable but but um but network television I think it would be thrilled with how how uh the with the quality of those shows now of course we have many more channels now and he does certainly a whole lot of you know of\nJumped to but um but I think in general he would be happy with it and one thing I can tell you for sure he he would hate reality TV on the um he and and I don't\nSay that just you know that's not just like me saying that at the time you know I guess reality television for its time a rod had some very negative things to say about a show called this is your life if you remember this is your life\nUh this is your life with a show where they bring somebody\nOnto the show in the normal you know regular everyday person and they will trot as family members out there and they would go through his you know scrapbook and look at you know it was kind of reality television for the time and he just\nDespise the show or you know I thought it was just the invasion of privacy and everything else so it's a reality show and he would hate but [laughter] but I think there were so many shows now that he would absolutely love\nWoman old time television tuned to a really did not understand racial mix ups demographics when you look at some of these old shows way gone back or even the comedians are the game shows\nThey were all older white guys you know in and I'm not I'm not talking like a middle age I'm Talking the older white guys [laughter] where did it television you know it would be difficult to get\nThat kind of a person like Jimmy Durante for example you you thinking him he was a big superstar very talented I don't think he would make it today\nYou might be right yeah yeah you could be right I mean well listen to the ... the um\nThe field as has grown so tremendously there's so much more competition\nThat uh you know there'll be there'll be but it's kind of like talking about now major league baseball before the before Jackie Robinson you know yeah you know they didn't have the competition from the from the black player from the Latin player from all these places and they were certainly people who played in the major leagues in Nineteen forty one\nWho may not have made it in Nineteen fifty one because there was so much more more competition\nWhat would rod say about all the different channels available now in his day there was just three major networks now my God you've got hundreds of channels\nYeah well he would he would love the freedom that it that it gives to uh to writers and creators that you know in his day you know if those three networks didn't want to hear it that was it I mean you know and in some cases if he was you know have on the contract to CBS\nCBS didn't want to hear it that was it nowadays you know you can go to so many different outlets to get your creation\nOr seen and heard uh so yeah he would be thrilled with that aspect of it for sure\nI mean Netflix and Amazon truly rival the networks now don't they\nOh absolutely I have some of the best television being made right now is on on those platforms\nIs amazing let's take some calls us go west of the Rockies cursed in Boise idaho or to get us started Hi Kurt\nHey George I'm Glad he got Nick I Can't wait to read the book you mentioned earlier when you were talking about the impact of the fact that the entire series is in black and white and of course Nick mentioned that you know the film or look but I've always been amazed that ... was able to do\nWith regarding the size of the SATs which to me was as far as the visual impact was which was a testament to the you know the semi talk of her in the lighting directors which I just I was just blown away with what they were able to accomplish sores wandering\nFrom Nick if he knew how many cameras they used during the actual shoots okay Nick do you know\nI Do not know the answer that question by will absolutely agree with Kurt that it that's one of the striking things about the series is\nIs that you know of course the production level in terms of budget\nYou know it was a fairly of generously budgeted show at the for the for the time\nBut of course in terms of special effects they weren't going to be able to give you the brilliance you know spaceships a shooting across the sky and that kind of things so that ... had to work with a you know more a relatively modest a set and uh so and he did he got the most out of\nOut of those particular sets and and every now and then to actually because budget was always a concern\nUm he would write a particular show that only took place in one the one room because it was going to be cheaper to make\nYou know actors one room and that's it and he would do one of those after they had a couple of expensive shows like eye of the beholder or you know and I married twenty thousand feet or something and then he would do one of these shows that we've got kinda got the budget back on the control\nHe jumps started many careers to did you not\nYeah I think so I mean it's it's certainly there are a lot of you know stars and soon\nTo be Robert Redford yay yay has learned Redford\nActually got his first job not on the twilight zone but in another show that rod Serling had written cold in the presence of mind enemies on playoff Ninety it was the very first appearance by Robert Robert Redford on TV [noise] uh and that was a great great show when he was a very good and that too\nYeah in the twilight zone episode he was a cop in the lady thought he was a death coming to get her yeah I'm not going to say what the ending is but that was a great show\nYeah was it was very that was written by George Clinton Johnson actually and that's a terrific show\nWhat was the name of the show and Nicholas were ... more head was a woman in her house in a small\nFlying saucer landed inside her house or something like that and she beat it with a broom [laughter]\nIt's called the invaders and and that was written by Richard Matheson or the late great Richard Matheson uh he wrote several episodes of the show and that's one of the most well remembered episodes of the series it's ... it's largely dialogue free there's almost no dialogue in it until the very end when the when the\nYou know spill person you know a says a few things\nWe found out who they were in the other one I like to was the lady who was having plastic surgery\nOr because everybody thought she was ugly and uh she wanted to look like everyone else and uh we sure found out what everyone else look like and that's\nThat's the eye of the beholder and that is um you know if there is a quintessential twilight zone episode I think that's that's it that's that's the one uh and again one of the most well remembered at\nThe end the one that really gave me the message of people was the shelter above that fallout shelter\nYeah the shelter is a great a great episode Serling wrote that one\nAnd uh yeah it's about the idea that there's going to you know there's a there's a bomb threat a nuclear threat and what this what does this community do when there's only one bomb shelter and they all want to get into and they can't get into it and they turn on each other and it was yeah that was a terrifically both on episode\nRenee in San Francisco is with us Hi Renee go ahead\nI I you know um there's an episode that's a very rare episode that it was finally released years later I was called miniature\nMiniature I don't remember that Nicholas deal\nRobert Duvall absolutely right another great you know a great actor who one of his early early performances Robert Duvall a that was one of the hour long episode was the fourth season of the twilight zone they were all in our long as opposed to half hour I'll rarely yeah okay yeah and then you sure it was one of the hour long episode\nAnd it ... it was involved in a in a lawsuit at the time that\nUh the series went into syndication so it was not initially syndicated so it was not seen for decades or at least Twenty years\nOr in so that was long long settled and um there was a special on called the twilight zone silver anniversary special and they showed that particular episode along with a couple of others that had been similarly left out of the syndication package\nWhat was the tragedy when they were doing the twilight zone movie a helicopter crashed or something like that\nOh he has horrible horrible incident I'm a yeah helicopter crashed after an explosion you know special effects explosion and killed the moral starring in that particular story and two young children who are on the set\nA it was yeah you cast they pull over the entire movie of course\nHorrible horrible situation on Long Island New York is with us they just go ahead you're\nHigh like a couple of questions or\nOne would be the first one would be that seemed like it was very a scape is\nMore than maybe someone stay back in the sexes so I'm just speculating if you had a job and he came home and watch the twilight zone\nThat would be almost like an escape from your daily reality and I guess people might have wanted that and I'm Wondering if there any other shows really like that my second question would be about the mysterious endings which I think a lot\nAll the search for answers continues in the case of a missing journalist overseas I'm Eric sharpest one thirty others radio seven forty Katie our age

failed that everything else [laughter] not really but\nYou know I I was a middle aged guy I was in a restaurant business I was the stock market forecaster\nStuff that was one of these guys who told Merrill Lynch which way the market was going I worked at a think tank yeah parents got sick got called back to Connecticut and ended up in the antique business after a restaurant jobs didn't work out when things usually working life\n... that's true but people of color ... collectibles aren't going to tell you when I Wish I still have my baseball cards from the Nineteen fifties I don't know where they are I've asked my mother who is eighty nine years old mom checked the ... where are they she says George you we gave them away\nWhat I had in the fifties every baseball card and clear that play during that period what would they be worth today a fortune\nWell Nineteen fifty two mantle card supposedly was in great good shape your real good shape right what would you ... well suppose you were in a tag sale All right you're running around out there in the city angels and\nYou've come across and old an old house right hundred years old it's big coup all out there and there's a farmer and I just sold the house I I'm just getting rid of the stuff so right away you got a feeling that this stuff might be a legit not the tag sale or some facts you guys can outsmart\nRight right you look around and it's all real stuff that's been handed down for years yes see of fifty two man told their and excellent condition ask him a few questions you find out it's right a guy says listen I've been told that's where the porch and I want ten thousand bucks for the bite you buy it\nI don't know I don't know until I call a guy like you\nKnow well that's worth a town somewhere in the neighborhood of a you know two hundred thousand dollars no yeah oh\nI hear now Caroline's and mental saying Willie Mays I had him all to\nMyself I used to put those cards and my bicycle spokes\n[laughter] I had to do with kids we did it with the duplicates remember\nYeah with the duplicates in generally you had like I had Fifteen Pete Rose rookie cards from\nIran into Pete Rose a couple of years ago in Los Angeles and the ... what would those cards have been worse if you'd given them to him to sign even more\nNow I I actually don't think that would help the value very much you probably would hurt the value you don't want to do that with a you know you're better off having 'em sign a napkin\nYeah exactly a now old football cards and stuff are they worth money too\nThat's what you should be buying right now really I always think if you do little things a little different than the average guy you'll make a little extra money right there everybody's\nOn the baseball cards that nobody's buying football cards which means you should be\nEyeing football ... interesting to\nWrite basketball cards I once saw a guy who had a complete\nHad Michael Jordan rookie cards that before they cut the cards is called a big plate he had a whole plate of sixteen Michael Jordan rookie cards on got\nOh I don't know what the heck that'd be worth today jeeze basketball\nCard but nobody collects football cards and you can buy and real cheap and that's sort of thing you should be ... you could get yourself like addict but his rookie cup Dick Butkus card right some sort of thing if you can buy that for a couple of bucks you buy it\nI think I threw away a wholeness Wagner card was worth anything\n[laughter] I don't know I did have a an honest Wagner card did you really do it's like a million dollars isn't it\nYeah it got two million if it has a a a a\nA Piedmont back gosh\nYeah that's that's the most famous uh collectible in history\nWhen what makes these collectibles so expensive and so long after\nI always say you know the way to make money in antiques just adjust instead of sitting around and saying well this is rare this is exceedingly rare there's only one of the world and it's obviously a four hundred years old the\nWicked outs dusty it is right that's not the kind of what makes things gives things value is what I called marketability ask yourself who's going to buy it you know everybody loves baseball\nGot its unamerican the love baseball one of the reasons Mickey Mantle baseball cards are worth so much as it sounds like Mickey Mouse\nYeah you're right by its name the named beautiful [noise] um and he was he ... right there is also a lot of people live in New York they love that\nYou know there's so much commonsense to the business I'm In an almost everybody who's out
