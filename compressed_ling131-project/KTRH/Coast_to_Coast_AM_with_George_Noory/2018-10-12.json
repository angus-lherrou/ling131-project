anniversary of the greatest\nStock crash in modern history Nineteen twenty nine to thirty two and that is one of many of our cycles we covered in zero hour\nAnd and are newsletters that Ninety year cycle is the most powerful for the biggest what I call you know downturns depressions and the biggest stock crashes and this has happened\nEvery Ninety years since the industrial revolution caused the greatest boom and global his\nOwn you know here we have had a couple of guests on who ah say very similar things to what you're saying there timing was off some of them said things were going to happen back last September or you lose one fellow was talking about Jewish prophecy and he called it the ... meter\nOh yeah yeah I remember that guy and it didn't happen it didn't happen then but you could happen now you're saying\nWell yeah I mean we we were in the same position we're coming into a two thousand sixteen the marketing gone sideways for you were saying you know this looks like in may that finally Tom and then Trump got elected I mean we\nBoy I mean when Trump had that surprised when in the markets were\nOut of two thousand point reversal from down nine hundred ... eleven hundred just overnight and end of the morning I said look this is a reversal this is a tax cut coming in and all this sort of stuff this is going to extend this boom another year or two another twenty to thirty percent or more\nAnd that's what's happened but now we're on the other side of that now we've seen most of that I'm an we're running out of tricks I mean what can you do now and the Democrats may when the house it looks likely possibly the Senate but it's got to be much harder for Trump to push his gravy train for businesses\nIt ... the Democrats get more control and I see the economy falling apart by two thousand twenty at the latest and that\nThat's not going to win reelection I was just going to last night and\nI don't think Trump gets reelected and he may not even make it we're tracking Watergate on a forty five year cycle almost to the tea\nWhich would say you're about to see the special prosecutor get fired up elections early next year and\nTrump could be in trouble by late next year so so either were peaking now or at best Trump holds on notice after we're going to peak late next year and see the greatest crash in history I don't see any other two

strong millennial generation but not as strong as the baby boom so we'll\nWe'll be in the middle but yeah we can tell about when the economy will turn around and where it will be the strongest the other thing we the biggest Boston bubble burst all ready as being commodities and things like oil and iron ore commodities are down Seventy percent\nIt worse so far oil and iron ore eighty per se there's going to be another\nBig commodity boom and bubble which will be driven by the emerging world and they're the biggest commodity producers and consumers they spent much more of their money and so you can buy these metals and things like that everything from gold\nTo iron ore and and and copper and things like that and there'll be an incredible boom and again you just wait for them to go down first so yeah the next\nBut between on now in two thousand twenty two twenty three is going to be way more than a downside and after that the world starts to recover and again that's when you buy stuff into the only on George is a real estate has a new factor this never had before because the baby boom was so large because older people when\nThey die they are literally permanent sellers if you want to call it a real estate\nAnd more and more countries including the U.S today and massively in Japan\nAnd places like Germany there's more old people dying and selling homes than young people with the next generation coming in buying so\nWhen we adjust for that real estate is not going to come zooming back and a lot of countries like stocks will so and and of course the aging baby boom sectors like health care will do better than other sector so\nIn our newsletter which by the way people can get on our free newsletter by just going to Harry Dent dot com and that's going to be best places to be the next year that that it's going to be different sectors the next boom is not going to favor everything eighty three to two thousand and seven everything went up the next boom is going to be more selective but there will be\nThe next global boom and and we can tell you when it's going to come and we can tell you about when it's going to peak\nHearing what happens if we ever regional war somewhere what's that going to do to the economy\nWell you know wars are actually stimulate I've been a lot of ways especially if you're not fighting of people don't realize World War one\nWas the greatest gift ever given the United States Europe was at war and we were supplying them with everything from farm and commodity products to you know a transportation automobiles are tanks and everything we became a major exporter to Europe over that\nSo you know that goes both ways but wars tend to cause higher inflation\nWars disrupt things and and uh the great depression was followed by World War two\nThe disruption a around the world and makes people angry as we're seeing now and even worse this time and then when things get scarce and there was a fixed pie countries tend to fight over things we this trade war and we said this is zero our book\nCame out a year ago this trade war with China and it is a global thing as well this is not just a short term thing and Jack Ma from LA Bob came out just a month ago and said this is going to take at least Twenty years to sort out\nThis is a major war between the leading to countries the U.S and China who's going to be king and that's why China China should be giving in more because Trump's right about this\n... they need us or our trade is three times tilted towards them this is going to hurt them more but it's more important to them because they're the up and coming and they don't want to give him too much 'cause they see this is a long term battle and they think longer term so\nSo I don't know if it's more a trade war but but they're certainly after this downturn coming out of this downturn [noise] the the potential for wars around the world will tend to grow\nAnd that's where our time let's go to Peter and cotton wood Arizona did get things started with us I'm Peter\nHi hey thank you for taking my call this is great I'm sure they're going to be a bank holiday during the crash\nThat's an interesting question what do you think\nYeah yeah I mean that definitely tends to happen and and and that's what happened to the great depression of course because people don't realize banks can lend up to ten times their reserves and guess what their reserves are ten percent of their deposits and whose money is that that our money they're pledging that they also tend to have you know capital they raise up to about ten percent [noise]\nSo so they're they're at risk to but yes when when you get problem like this banking system will get in trouble especially when real estate goes down that we saw that in two thousand eight and nine forward\nAnd all of a sudden they don't have money now the new trick and then I'm I'm getting ready to go into a fight city tour in Australia is a big concern there because their housing bubbles already starting to crack ahead of ours this time\nIs it banks in Cyprus just said well you know what we need money we're just going to wipe out of the the more affluent accounts were just going to take you know ten twenty thirty forty fifty percent of their count and say look I'm Sorry we need this we're gonna take your deposits\nAnd work in a kind of ... them into equity in our dying bank who wants equity in a dying bank\nSo this is in in in ... even in Australia that people are realizing they're not supposed to do that but there's loopholes were in an emergency banks can do that so people have to worry you know you need to spread your money around I tell people all your excess money\nOther than you need to pay your bills should be in a brokerage account whether it's in a bank or a brokerage firm or an on line from I I prefer firms that are not into lending that's why I like a lot of the online trading firms that\nHave have it in a brokerage account 'cause they can't borrow against that they can't swipe that but they can deposits in savings account so yes this can happen to people\nLost their deposits a lot of people there was a run on the banks this happens in in in in the magnitude of what I'm Talking about\nIs exactly what had happened doesn't happen in a normal recession like we've seen it started to happen in some countries the last global crisis it will happen big time and and in some countries worse than others\nNext up we go to Keith in Rochester New York He's taken away\nA Mr ...

E. R. dot com [noise]\nThat I I Do think I mean this is going to have to happen a lot of rules are going to change just like banks may suddenly start swiping money out of more flew an account\nThey're going to have to have forgiveness these loans are going to have to be restructured all loans are going to have to be restructured um except for the most sovereign like U.S Treasury bonds and get may not be but\nBut this is the key to going through this the countries that restructure their debt and we restructured massive amounts of private debt and the great depression it made a stronger coming out Japan never restructured any of their debt and they're in a coma economy forever even when they're next young generation\nIs come along so I I my bet is that they're going to come to point we're going to have to say no we have to allow restructuring of student loans there to owner as we went to find that to me what happened the education establishment I'll even call it a mafia\nBasically overcharging had the greatest inflation next you know of any sector education even more than healthcare\nThey're on a run and win win that got too hard they say okay we can encourage student loans then people can afford these higher prices we can keep our bubble going\nThis bubble has burst and and and too many students are never going to be able to pay off these loans so when you have excess loans it's better to admit it just like a drug addict\nAnd then change policies and restructure detox I call it the leveraging go on we're gonna have to forgive or restructure down these student loans however it happens if it makes it changing in the rulings yes I I Would say that's highly likely in the next couple of years\nIn two thousand a year and I saw one way to bail out everything would be to give people like a hundred thousand dollars you know voucher to buy some good what do you think\nWell I don't like money printing except in emergencies like I think they should have done money printing quantitative easing for the first year in two thousand I like they did just to make sure the banking system doesn't just melt down like it did rapidly in the great depression but to put it on\nA permanent\nQuantitative easing just perverts the entire system is bad but the second thing I always said if you're going to print money don't give it to the damn banks who got us in trouble and did all this leverage and\nAnd the rivers and all this crazy stuff in the first place just sin if you know send a peer to try to to get us out of the at least send them money to everyday people send them a check I wouldn't say a hundred thousand but if if they just said everybody at twenty five every household at twenty thousand dollar check\nThat would have done a lot better for the economy and then in that that would help banks because things wouldn't have been as bad for the economy but it would have helped people\nInstead of the banking system this whole bailout his whole quantitative easing has only made Wall Street stronger only made the rich richer is only benefited corporate including these tax cuts and has not benefited main steal\nThe reason why I wanted it as a volunteer as opposed to check he ... because I wanted them to be forced to spend that red line them but you\nKnow right and they don't spend it or did they get you're right that that's much better way the point is to get every day people some relief and and to have them spend that money to stimulate the economy and then that helps that you know businesses and banks and everything but it should have gone to the people and not to the damn banks\nNext up we're going to hear in Port Huron download very good that you\nKnow hello there George and ask him that question you mentioned earlier about the bank and you can and just now but are they taking the money I'm wiping my what about credit unions are they going to be doing the same thing or what's what's up with those\nI I Would much rather have my money in a credit union than a than a money center bank\nBecause that's where all the leverage is been it was kind of opposite in the great depression a lot of people a lot a lot of the problems was forms were over expanding and borrowing money and those were in more rural areas and that's where the trouble is and it was rural banks going under more than the money center by this is totally\nMoney center bank thing and and also when you do bang if governments have takes procreate money or how they're going to do for the more fluent accounts and those going to be in the in the bigger money center banks so I'd much rather have my money and a credit union\nThen you know bank of America Wells Fargo or or ... or city bank and stuff like that\nOkay let's take a call or two before we wrap things up with Harry Dent Hi Barbara North Carolina\nOkay thank you\nAnd I just think that part of one of my question but well I Am at\nA red light I got one right here on why I Am I'm In my head on the line\nRight yup it's all about timing\nIt all of that time what am I going to have a limit on how to get answered my question what about the smaller amount so my Social Security income that much\nUm I don't have to worry about that so much and I'm at a larger town hall or is that what I understand\nYes I mean if they're going to have to restructure so security there's certainly going to take the benefits of a larger\nAccounts and more affluent people first I mean the everyday person is going to be more protected and whatever scenario\nAnd bank insurance agreed that they can insured deposits and they can insure them all that so what oh deposits are insured they can't insure everything if you have a major club but the smaller account it'd be spread out a few accounts and you have more money in your brokerage accounts which they can't get at\nYes you're going to be weightless all of old and and what happened in Cyprus it was a lot of rich Russians that had big accounts those were the biggest losers those were the ones they hid and of course\nWhen when things go bad people gonna hit foreign deposit is more Iceland went down and basically stiff all the foreign depositors and foreign loans and protected their own people so yes the smaller accounts domestic accounts\nAre going to be safer but again\nI still say have as much as your money in a protected account and your name that is not just the general deposit they lend against those deposits in real estate loans and business loans go bad\nThey're going against your deposits but if you have a brokerage account with your stocks or bonds or cash\nIn it they can't they can't\nPledge doses reserves and well that's a good thing Harry thank you were at a time Harry's website at coast to coast damn dot com up next a psychiatrist

R. H. traffic and\nWhat was the other one was\nHe has had many close brushes with death as well starting in the womb\nYeah you said a number of paranormal or a novelist experiences visions breed cognitive dreams auto body experiences encounters with message burying operations as well welcome to the program Dr\nMany mate is on the coast to coast Dr welcome to the show I'm looking forward to this and inviting me\nVery interesting that the somebody with your medical and psychiatric background would be so heavily involved in the paranormal and how did that all happened for you was it the near death experiences that started it\nWell I think it was because I almost died from anytime\nYou know when my book to but it's not my first came out many people ask me if the based on stories with my patients had told me that my aunt was always no not at all because whatever patient tells the doctor with confidential\nA doctor bound by the Hippocratic Oath states but the doctor should not be read anything into by a sense and I don't so the material in my book based entirely on my own personal experiences\nStories from my readers and for my audience to and from family and friends and some I own extensive reading research into the paranormal in terms of why I had the experience I think it is related to the fact that I had some ... ... ... ...\n[noise] um you know there's been a lot of literature written about the near death experience mhm\n[noise] but the um term near death experience\nYou know it's climate document moody in Nineteen Seventy five so that's over forty years ago I was right now I think he estimated that something like one thirty Americans is either had a near death experience or know someone who has had one and that's a large group of people\nBut there's an even larger group of people who have almost died but never were pronounced clinically dead and never had the typical near death experience\nBut when I looked at how my close brushes with death effected me I see that I have some of the same after effects that Dr moody described in his patients who had a classic near death experience\nIn other words I'm having had all these close calls this death I tend to have a deeper appreciation of life and I I also have overcome my fear of dying and I have found give myself a shift from materialism spirituality and then he an increase need to find meaning and purpose in life\nWas that a pretty dramatic shift for you\nKnow not at all I I Would say was gradual the first couple of paranormal experiences I had I was quite young and I honestly I didn't think anything of them I just kind of brush them off yeah I just thought well that was weird but I didn't tell anyone about them because\nI didn't think anyone would believe me and in those days no one talked about those experiences because there was no rational way to explain them\nBut then as time went on and I got more and more of these experiences and then when I went to a um a life threatening illness and and came out on the other side thanks to a stem cell transplant from an anonymous donor\nOh jeez well\nYeah there was that was quite dramatic um but at that point I felt like I Need to share what I've been going through because that would help other people\nIn the ... stem cell transplant why didn't they let harvest stem cells from yourself\n[noise] [noise] well that's one way of doing it but the the um anonymous stem cells donor it's called an allergen it transplant mhm was more effective they actually found someone on the worldwide ... computer\nI just like I'm the owner bank and they found his name on the computer and he was a perfect match for me\nOr super ... what was what was wrong if you want to get into that\nOh sure well I had leukemia ... um\nYeah and I had it for many years well actually I had leukemia for sixteen years and I was in the hospital I had numerous um blood transfusions numerous courses of chemotherapy and then finally the doctor said you can't keep giving you chemotherapy because it's doing too much damage to your body\nYou was it was still in remission\n[noise] well you have to be a new mission in order to receive a transplant so they gave me chemotherapy um and I was in remission but then I Would keep having relapses and that fight against that they gave me the transplant huh [noise] now the person who gave me the transplant he lives in an anonymous donor that\nThe rule at the time was that after one year I was allowed to contact him if he agreed to be contact mhm and I did back to him just to thank him for his generosity and I found out that he was in the he's the man was a member of the U.S navy\nAnd when his name came up on the computer he was stationed on an aircraft carrier in the Persian Gulf wow\nSo he was flown back into the ... who sent from Washington DC and the team from the city where I live down to Washington and took a sample of his themselves and then flew back to my city and that's what happened and that was eight years ago and I've been fine ever since\nThen have you still in touch with him did that happen\nYes um I actually met him in in DC and least kept in touch and we've become friends\nThat's amazing you say your life\nHe did I can thank him enough he did save my life and in here altruism you know\nHe said the way it came about was um [noise] they were having a donor drive and one of the basis where he was stationed then he just got in line with his buddies and all is required is that she could swab type that's it yeah just to cheeks ought to get the DNA so that's when his name entered the donor bang\nAnd then um years later my name came up on the computer and at that point he's even forgotten that he had agreed to be a donor\n[noise] but then once you know ... we found out that he was a perfect match for me and he was flown back to the ... center in DC they gave him some injections to stimulate his bone marrow seafood produce more stem cells and they gave him these injections for five days\nAnd then he had produced enough themselves so they took a blood sample which contain to stem cells and that was what was brought back to where I live closer but yes we become friends and I just I'm not too long ago\nIn Dr ... the fact that you are dabbling so heavily into the psychic realm has that help or hurt your psyche has your practice\n[noise] well I tried to keep the two things separate I mean you know in terms of the psychiatric patients generally they don't talk about paranormal experiences they have you know serious mental disorders that they need help with and that's why they come to see a psychiatrist [noise]\nHowever since I had that experience in psychiatry I'm able to help people distinguish between what's a psychic experience and much a psychotic experience\nRight and and and there's a big difference there\nWell absolutely there is a big difference\nI mean sometimes if a person see something or here's something they don't know what it is they think they're losing their mind but in fact these types of experiences are quite common\nYou know for example um if someone is believed that they've lost it I'm a spouse or a child quite often will be some type of post death contact with the deceased loved one so\nLet's say you're a widow might see her deceased husband in her bedroom at night and she might talk to him or she might feel his tax on her shoulder or something like that\nAnd these experiences are quite common in fact one study showed that up to fifty percent of people who've lost a loved one will have some type of post death contact with a loved one\nEven a third person has no belief in an afterlife and many of them don't I mean these these types of experiences are not related to religious beliefs are belief in an afterlife\n[noise] um and in fact you know an atheist and nice to have this experience as well as religious people you\nSay that everyone is like you and I I tend to believe you can agree with you OK but\nUh when you said that what's the basis for that what makes you say that\n[noise] well the thing is the word psyche how about a lot of territory you know it includes things such as ESP or

little bit about the death bed visions and your thoughts about that do you believe they're extremely common don't you\n[noise] that said a lot of studies have shown that it's it's very common for someone who is dying to see a deceased friend or relative\nI'm actually happened with my dad when he was in the hospital he saw his late sister he mentioned over this ... you mentioned her name she was out in the hall and there was one study that was done in a hospice is dying patients and they found\nA lot of these patients I'm said someone who is coming to take them and they called they didn't call them vision they called them visitors and as they got closer to death\nSo as you say these ... can be very powerful and and where does this where does this message come from that brings up another subject which is sometimes people received messages in dreams which aren't the cognitive\nAnd who's giving them the message\nThat's the question right where's this message coming from [noise] you know we can we can speculate you know we can say it's coming from the unconscious or we could say it's coming from something they've added or we can say it's coming from the spirit\nWorld you know but some of these\nMessages for example this woman I mentioned who had the dream that should be killed in a terrorist attack where would that be coming from that could've been her fear mhm you know um and maybe it was just a coincidence that somehow when something like that happens it seems to be more than a coincidence\nOr news there was a movie about to a group of people government people who tried to enter the dream state of other governmental leaders to to assassinate them\nAnd you know the wanted them to die of heart attacks and they were going to put fear into their dreams and stuff like that do you think that really might be going on many\nWell that reminds me of the collapse of the studies that I mentioned that were being conducted at my monitor these medical center in New York because I think people can be more susceptible to telepathy\nI don't know when I was dreaming while they're asleep I don't know to the point of getting having making someone to have a heart attack I don't know if that would be possible if that's ever been done\nWell who knows when people die in their sleep what caused right that's\nRight that's right because you know I sort of take the position that anything is possible you know and I think that's possible although we don't really know and that and how how could we know it's right you know um so yeah\nThat could be pretty remarkable mhm\n[noise] yeah I was also talking about messages and dreams 'cause I've also had that experience where I received a message but it wasn't um\nIt wasn't a pay cognitive Venus was just a message and I didn't even know what to make of it that I remembered it just clear as day when I woke up this is the message I got I I just saw these where it said\nThis is a world of illusion and the biggest illusion is time\nDidn't Caesar's wife have a premonition about the ides of march [noise] that's\nRight in fact she dreamt the night before he was so she'd done that he was going to be assassinated\nShe begged him not to go to the Senate hate in order to please also with his favorite told Julius Caesar it'd be where the ides of march which is the fifteenth of march and he he ... ignored his wife and he was killed so yeah that was a very strong premonition premonition is usually a warning\nHow many people don't act on their premonition stole maybe\nI'd say probably the majority I Would agree because I don't think people believe them they don't believe they're intuition\nAnd then they do the water should uh after the fact\nYeah exactly and how many times has that happened I Know\nThat said the majority of people don't pay attention to it because they they think well we live in a you know scientific rational society and we need to think of things rationally and they disregarded things which could be dismissed that superstition there's always the fear of being labeled superstitious\nThere was a a movie called let it ride with Richard ... was among horse racing and oh yeah one of his friends apparently really understood who's gonna win the race but didn't bet on that horse spent on something else some washed\nAnd Dr seuss in movies screaming in ground you knew you knew you knew that is a little like not acting on your premonition\nYeah for sure that is yeah and you wonder why I think it's fear I think people I don't believe they don't believe in also they're afraid of getting into something which appears irrational tell me a little bit\nBob blind people in a obese and things like that\nWell that that's very interesting story because there have been reports of blind patients who've been blind since birth will have another body during during surgery and then when they recover from the anesthesia and they wake up a book to tell the doctors and nurses\nUm what they thought and what they heard while they were out of their bodies is one patient with blind who when he returned to his body after the surgery was able to describe the color and the patent on his\nDoctor high and it's quite the doctor with founded there was another case or the plantation to left his body during surgery [noise] I Know he was he was wasn't surgery he had a cardiac arrest and they took out his dentures\nAnd he left his body needed observing everything that was going on and then when he when he recovered and they couldn't find where she put it that you\nAnd he wanted his teeth back right\nBack but then then they said I don't know I put them and he said well now it's out of my body I saw you put them in that door over there and she open that door and sure enough\nThere they were they were wild yeah it works it works yeah\nWhat ... what have you learned many about all of this what do you think it is\n[noise] I think well I think that there's a spiritual component like I have to say that\nYou do I do and you don't think it's paranormal\nWell I think it's related to the I think it's ... I think it's paranormal and I think it's spiritual I mean there's certain words that are used to describe these experiences these phenomena some people call them fake and people call them paranormal some people call them spiritual or anomalous\nOr Mr polar mysterious is relative or it's being used to describe the same event\nSo I think paranormal event and have a spiritual component\nYeah but I'm not saying every parent normally there but some do of course it depends on the person who's having experience how they want to interpret it or what they want to how they want to think about it\nDo you think science should do a better job investigating these things\n[noise] oh definitely I think it improves quality of life for people to feel like there was something more out there that we don't have to live in nine to five eight and a day to day lives that there's something more than we don't really know about and I think it should be explored\nObjects when we come back with Dr many make this we're going to take phone calls your calls you your stories about pretty cognitive dreams and so many other things you've heard us talk\nAbout here on the coast to coast stadiums and find out more about tonight's gifts to log on to coast to coast am dot com\nExcuse is known for the Astrodome heat Earl Campbell diversity or Houston we have a problem beautiful women we use it and we're known as the plane to go for keeping up to speed with used thing one to turn on the radio news radio seven forty\nKatie our age [noise] want to get\nReally growing harbor gates complains and\nOur brigade blend to provide a one two punch that simply works this powerful organic combo designed to specially for gardening success in our area will energize your greens I'm like never before so him out to the armor gay located in Tom ball on FM twenty nine twenty a mile and\nWest of our way to forty nine more business on line and Harvard gate dot com\nThis report is brought you buy Walmart have Houston ... been working behind the scenes to bring you stumping fresh there's cruising at stores in the area and updating their services getting ready to take your shopping experience to a new\nLevel in the oil patch radio show is proud to bring you this week energy minute produced by shale mag dot com there's Texas railroad commissioner Ryan fit in with your current industry update\nAnd twenty sixteen now plans to take their government owned oil company study aramco public\nExpected to sail five percent of the company in an I.
