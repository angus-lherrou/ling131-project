if I were on the line mosques delete Stephen Hawking name were petrified warning us about the dangers of artificial intelligence isn't that bad\nA well\nI I Would say that I don't think so but I'll say this what what they're worried about a was look we mentioned earlier which is that kind of artificial intelligence we don't know how to build a general intelligence and that's\nWe don't know how to build it but the idea that we could build it is based on the simple a\nSupposition and that is that people are machines if if you are a machine and your brain is a machine and your mind as a machine\nAnd it stands to reason at some point in the future we can build a mechanical you and then over time that will become better and better and better it'll have an eye you have a hundred and two hundred and two thousand and two million and then it won't even know what you are um\nI find that idea that people are machines to be very pervasive in Silicon valley\nThat there may be more that that may do a lot more harm than than than good it it it's very literal suggest the machine would\nDo that now through through accidents are absolutely you\nKnow you had a had a rocket blow up because a single one was a transposed with the\n... and opens transposed with a zero so a lot of our systems are quite brittle and that is very true you know if you had a um\nYou could have an airline pilot had a heart attack and that's bad for one air ... air airplane for people\nI think when you got the co pilot right\nThere you go but if you have a um if you have a computer flying a network computer flying all the airplanes in it quote has a heart attack like that\nYeah that may that may propagate through a systems may be much ... much more brittle much one better they may break in big ways now that being said they haven't done that yet and and\nAnd we come you know we're better now I think uh at writing good software that we were a few years back\n[noise] what is fueling the gross\nAnd the ... and just really the incredible growth of this kind of technology\nYou mean is it the humane\nThe main thing that fuels that technology is it's actually finally working\nA hey I even the term was coined in Nineteen fifty six by a man in the car McCarthy and uh he got together with a few of the computer scientist and they said you know we work really hard we can solve artificial intelligence and one summer or they thought that were very interesting reason which was\nNew and you know three laws of planetary motion laws magnetism laws of physics laws of electricity very few simple laws that explain everything and I hope to find that with intelligence we did\nThat being said people get excited about a a bunch of money came in everybody was disappointed funding dried up all the people you know took him out for ten years then there was a breakthrough more funding everybody neither a winter it kept going well now for the first time\nIn space up to space up his face up his face up to space it's delivering the goods it it can it if you have a business that can make public any department in your business than ten percent faster temper ... better ten percent more profitable\nOr it can it can do all of these things you couldn't do before and so we're never going to have another one of those yeah winters we now have a technology that we know how to do some cool things if there were no more advances and I ah we probably have twenty five years worth of stuff just to apply what we know today\nTo the world but of course we're going to have you know more advances uh they they come to light speed almost\nJust amazing now we ever have a a series of artificial intelligence soldiers\nBy the millions sending them into warfare in battle it's a fantastic question um\nArtificial intelligence the simplest definition is it's a system that responds to its environment so land mine is the kind of artificial intelligence if it weren't a program that is something weighs more than fifty pounds explode that's a very rudimentary\nVery rudimentary uh yeah if somebody came out with a landmine just hypothetically that said um there's a camera and it can make sure it's somebody wearing ah the peaks or\nCarrying a gun mhm and then it blows up you would say well that's that's that's better isn't it and then if you say well it can also stiffer gunpowder\nAnd you know we can do for other things to make sure it's blowing up the right person you say well that's better I guess that's better right and you you eventually get your way all the way up to\nUm if you could have ... to to an artificial\nWell jumps fights wars and instead of people um\nThere there is a quote debate about whether we're going to make a columnist killing systems I think it's disingenuous the debaters I personally think it's disingenuous I think you've got twelve or Thirteen countries that are ... that have significant military budgets that are spending money on these systems and no one of them can say\nYou know I let the other guys all have it but I'm not going to do it I just don't think that's going to happen or the south Korea came out with the forty million dollar automatic gun ... that\nCould could shoot people at a distance automatically and it it's required by law to say you know leave shoot\nA and it now requires a person to approve it's tiring but originally ah they only put that in because people requested it and so uh it could easily be turned off so even if you make decisions that require people to make decisions\nYou always disabled them so I think it's inevitable that we're going to for better or worse whatever you think there were going to build a a weapon systems it's going to happen\nWell for for three very easy reasons you could argue that ah\nThere the better the more effective at their mission and there'll be less collateral damage wherever they are you argue that you will be saving lives of soldiers ... or ... whatever country you are and and\nA third you know they will they will work to be effective and probably cost effective Mel enabling Portugal eat what were the political cost going to war which\nUh is there's no not necessarily a good thing\nWell it may not be a good thing but in the long run if we don't do it some other country will\nOh absolutely absolutely I'm just saying that it isn't necessarily good for all nations to feel like oh well it's just these weapons systems fighting each other it doesn't really matter and and you know if if one has no cost\nA then perhaps it's entered into more rationally\nI mean I Do you see

Hooper\nA Google Amazon you wouldn't have seen any of the million companies that were made so that these technologies are the same way you it's easy to say that jobs going to go away it's hard to see the better job that's created and what happens is\nEverybody every time technology makes a great new job and destroys a bad job everybody kind of ships up one level\nIf you had a robot that was a waiter in delivered food to you you get a tip it I'm not\nI don't I hear the waiter wonder why I don't I don't think a robot can do\nA what a waiter can do you know they you you still a drink\nYou know the robot can't a clean it up that would take you know tons of programming\nThat you have a special order and you want you want to send your food back there is something you didn't like about it you have a question about where the radishes were I mean there are so many things it's it's funny we we we have every human on this planet has ten thousand skills than thousand things you can do\nAnd then we had this vision that if you can do those ten thousand things and you can do estate planning than your high skilled otherwise you're low skilled but in reality every human being is incredibly high skilled we don't have robots stick can\nThey can do what a two year old can do let alone and an adult yeah so well correct correct but it's proved very difficult\nLike right now I heard somebody say if there was ever a robot uprising just wait Fifteen minutes all their batteries there'll be dead 'cause we can't even you know make batteries that the power these things for very long so right now hands down and and I think for for decades to come\nUh people are going to you're not going to make machines that had the same range of movement joined gonna have a robot electrician who comes in and look at your house over and figure out where to punch your whole out to run the wires it's just way beyond\nYou know when I called my airline of choice and it tells me you know say your number and happy when it gets started right when it doesn't get a an agent ate all mixed up so that's kinda wherever that I'm not like you said that you know yet um\nAnd that's it and that's a big yet because one day at the progression we're going we're going to get there\nWell with physical robots maybe that's true it's an open question on intelligence it's an open question whether a computer can be creative with a computer and\nIt may be that that you have to experience the world in order to do a lot of the things we have and it's it's unclear that computers will be able to do it and let me let me say real quick thing about our brains you know we have these brains that we don't really understand and then we had these mines and which is kind of all the things the brain does that we\nCan't really explain like I have a sense of humor you know your liver doesn't have a sense of humor but some of your brain does\nAnd then we have consciousness and people think we don't understand the brain 'cause there's just so stinking so many neurons\nBut people have spent Twenty years working on something called the open worm project to try to take this little worm he's got three hundred and two neurons in his brain they spent Twenty years trying to modeled out of the computer just pick a worm that lives in a computer with a brain that three hundred new neurons and even among the people have been working on it they're not even sure it's possible\nSo there are so many we're we're so\nSpectacularly amazing\nAh beings that that\nTo duplicate what we do with the machine is you know ... one leading a researcher said worrying about those kinds of things it's like worrying about overpopulation on Mars yeah maybe some day we'll have to worry about overpopulation of Mars but it's like that far out\nSo you call your book the fourth age because you believe we've had three ages meat already going way back but tell me about this\nSo we learned this trick humans did which is technology which is multiplying what we are able to do\nAnd and we've used it\nTo overcome scarcity because for a long with human history there's just never been enough for the good stuff never in a food and medicine never enough of any of the good stuff but we learned this trick technology and sometimes we learned something so\nBig and knew that it just changed their productivity of humanity forever and the first of these was a hundred thousand years ago I think it was language that's this thing we do where we coordinate action\nAbout what it means is that you know twelve humans working together you know men if was a match for us anymore 'cause 'cause we could all communicate and the men it's couldn't\nUm then the second one I think is when we got agriculture and that actually wasn't the big deal because agriculture give us the city and the density gave us the division of labor and the division of labor says you know you specialize I specialize in we're all better off because of it so agriculture indirectly gave us prosperity and that changed everything we have prosperity\nAnd then the third time things changed I think it was five thousand years ago when we got\nTwo technologies coincidentally at the same moment we got the wheel and we got writing and when those two things happened or you invented a nation state and that's why I dozen years ago you kind of set your clock by it all over the world\nA giant civilizations emerge now some ... Mesopotamia missile America and just go over the world and so I Do think that um\nThat artificial intelligence and robots are another thing of that magnitude\nIf you if you actually can take human thought and put it in a machine and human action and put it in a machine and and and multiply us both of you know we're number one on this planet 'cause we're the smartest thing on it imagine if you can just make us a whole lot smarter [noise] I I don't I Can't predict what that's going to what's that's going to do but it's going to be a big one\nWell we know for example that machines called 'em robots or revolutionize the automobile industry with the mass production I mean they they did things faster\nThan humans can ah coming from St Louis I've been in in in ... Bush factory and I see how they bottle beer or by the thousands in the bottles humans can't do it that fast uh\nYou're you're right that is already official intelligent hid it is to be frightening if if you saw if you were a skilled across person and you saw a skilled people making more stuff better and cheaper than you like how purifying once that and yet we don't look back and say that was a bad thing do we\nKnow now that all not at all and has displaced workers\nProbably you can't have a million workers are sending up bottles by hand\n[noise] right and yet we never had unemployment and ah you know we never had unemployment long that time you also had an interesting phenomenon that from Nineteen forty call it the Nineteen eighty Ninety Ninety Seventy you had a million women entered the workforce every year\nAnd toys at this time according to Houston trash starting with major accidents or stalled vehicles\n... construction zones to be aware of eye to eye on the east by an ad Sheldon slain restrictions also on the south side and six in the south east about an end to eighty eight gotten one lane at times [laughter] I'm like ... in the Gulf Coast windows dot com twenty four hour traffic center [noise]\nWith a gentle forecasts are for the rest of the overnight a slight chance to be pop up shower too close around Seventy five cents we get into your Tuesday and eighty percent chance more rain tons of eighty seven partly cloudy otherwise right out Seventy nine and part of a cloud to get to keep the R.

you still have the illness that\nKills everybody you start poverty which I think it's a technical problem you have all these problems technology can solve why do I say that because\nThey don't have to be that there are there are lots of problems that aren't technical like there's hatred bigotry and all of that but there are certain things we just haven't figured out how old are you in disease how do you slow down aging how do you do all these things and so\nThey're suffering people around the world that just are waiting for technology to come through and\nAnd finally deliver on all the utopias people used to dream would it be great if\nAnd now finally we've ruined district and we can now make enough at all the good stuff for everybody and we just we're almost there and and so I don't think we would speed it up if I could there's there's still too much suffering in the world rich he's also the last thing you know we live in a world a universe\nThat looks looks vaguely looks very in the uh it looks like it's waiting for us to pay a visit you know I think our ultimate destiny is a billion people each on a billion planets and ... and if you think that range\nUh I think that would be the best possible outcome because we live in this this universe and so we we got to get there are right now we're we're we've curiously balanced on this you know pale blue dot\nIt's going to Ritchie in West Virginia now Ritchie taken away go ahead sir\nThe morning and thanks for having me on the shelves and say ... interesting topic I just wanted to ask your guest there and if you think that the way technology is progressing that we may get to that your to your age where we only have to work just to better ourselves as human beings\nAs working alongside with technology\nI Love that question you know you know Maynard Keynes the economist in Nineteen thirty wrote an essay and he said in a hundred years so basically our time GDP will be up eight fold and real dollars and people will only work Fifteen hours until you have to ask like\nWell what happened because GDP did go on a fault just like you thought so why are we still working all these hours and what it turns out is that if you want to live the way somebody lived in Nineteen thirty\nBel Air conditioning six hundred square feet no medical insurance no higher education ... grow your own food make your own clothes you covered Fifteen hours a week and live\nLike you did in Nineteen thirty or ... people decided they wanted more and so there is no limit to human once it turns out so even in the future people are going to say I'm going to stay late at the fusion reactor 'cause I Want you know the the same flying cars that the neighbor has a so\nWe're not completely materialistic interestingly ... the time we save at home but not hauling water up from the well and not run washing her clothes at the river we turn that into hobbies\nBut it turns out we've always worked forty hours a week if if if our productivity goes up we just work more to get more and we always talk at the time we save at home I'm with labor saving devices\nWhere do you see this fifty years from now Byron this technology\nUm\nI I think that question I ask earlier which is you know if you can imagine a machine doing a job I think we all have machines doing the kinds of jobs you can imagine a machine doing you just start looking around you and say you know who to machine\nA\nMy road probably couldn't machine teach kindergarten probably not a ... would we wanted to and so I think machines will be doing\nAlmost anything that you can imagine a machine doing that doesn't require unique human ability\nBarber in Los Angeles ... go ahead\nPlease stop them from getting worse than now and they can ... and and go to school there and take care\nOf them and to rent that any woman named ... and ... it gets half an hour with and I am talking\nAbout automatic guns\nWell your your biggest bart is entirely right uh we are using a condom his weapons were killed decision of course we've done that\nSince landmines we drop drop dumb bombs uh I mean the nature of warfare is we build machines to kill\nA so I didn't mean to say that uh that we that we don't do that\nWe always done that we built machines that we push a button and we don't know who's going to die or the debate is allegedly going on is whether are we going to\nYou know make more debt systems that operate completely economists say that you can just release in an area and it will go and decide that's a non combative that's about it I'll kill them and so forth a it's a subtle distinctions but I agree with you\nBefore the smart robots conscious computers in the future of humanity where do you get the book Byron\nWherever find books are sold I think ah is the expression Amazon dot com Barnes and noble or just visit and reach dot com and there'll be a lot of lakes\nSo what do you see is the most dramatic change coming for us through artificial intelligence what's gonna how\nJune June very simple things one\nEnd of the world wide average income per capita for the last two thousand years or if you look at it for Seventeen hundred and fifty years from say the birth of Christ so deep that nothing happened what if you look starting Seventeen fifty shot up like a rocket\nUm why because we learned how to system because the acquisition of knowledge we made the scientific method and there's no limit to where that line is going to go so vast amounts of well created\nA eliminating poverty and then the second thing I think will happen is all purely technical problems like disease and hunger you will live to see the end up I Know that sounds like a I'm dreaming it's all kinds of people said it would be possible but um\nYou know this country the United states already Throws Away in a food to eat all the hungry people in general no question that the world strange to feed them or we just need to get a little better at it\nWell and I hope we

ghosts interesting things\nRight isn't that the craziest title who calls her book that goes for target for\nWhat some of your peers about the fact that I mean you're you are you were corporate executive doing some great work and now you're writing a story about the ... we'll talk\nYou know this it's it's a it's a great question I\nI think because what I Do day in day out is rooted in data\nAnd and I'm and I'm known you know within the organization is being in a very direct on this kind of person that when I started telling the stories and they couldn't help but believe even if they were kind of on the fence because they're like what you would make this up\nYou know you're the you're the nerd you wouldn't make that stuff\nAnd you know and I would say Ninety nine point nine percent of the people um have kind of gone with me on the journey um I I think that's a very small you know point zero one percent um you know they they just they can't make their way over right\nTo our mind that's right um\nBut I'll tell you at least half if not more than half the people that when I started telling them one of my stories they could interrupt me fast enough to tell me there's [noise]\nAnd I realized you know during this time that I was kind of thinking about you know put it writing it all down my oh my gosh people don't want to come out about this like there in the closet they're afraid to tell these stories because they're afraid that they're going to sound like they're crazy\nWhich is one of the reasons I actually wanted to write the book was so you know people could feel liberated to just to tell their you know talk about their experiences 'cause there's so many people have had him\nI also wanted them to you know what I wanted to write it so people also will believe in themselves and believe that it's actually happened and not you know their their brain playing tricks on them or something\nWell what's so amazing to is that the people are all into the ... like you said not a lot of um admit it but once they feel comfortable with you or somebody who is going through the same thing they open up\nOh my gosh they talk your ear off and you know just just for your listeners then because I Am a nerd do you mind if I roll through just a couple of stats for them yeah go because I you know when this started happening to me um I didn't know a lot about it you know I didn't understand\nUm a lot about what really anything about goes for tiger fee a little bit about medium ship just you know some of the things in a little bit about but I started um I started researching and there is a Harris Poll um that says that between forty and forty five percent of Americans leave and go so we're almost a majority\nAttorney were barely a minority and that's grown I bet and\nAnd you know what I think it was done maybe three years ago four years ago something like that\nWould be over fifty percent\nI I Would think so and the second is that\nUm I worked with my friends I'm at Google um to get this and every two seconds to say it again for everybody every two seconds\nSomeone in North America is doing the work is\nDone horsing yes every two seconds so none of us are alone I think everybody knows they're not alone because of you whose is listening\nOn but they can also now use them statistics to tell their friends hey I have a way I'm barely a minority and I'm probably a majority now\nYou have nothing to hide\nAnd have nothing to hide\n... journey shortage for you because of a personal situation\nYes did you did you know just\nThis started from me I'm I'm I mean the book really is a journey and well a transformational Journey Through grief [noise]\nUm I had lost my mother to all timers are and you know I I you you'd only deal with the the eight to ten years prior to it because it's a very it's a painful disease for everyone on and when she passed I was devastated I was broken she I was her person in this world\nAnd not long after she passed I started seeing ghosts and photograph\nAnd at first it scared the heck out of me um I actually want to I'd open a like a ghost portal because you know I Do live in the world of movies so everything in my life I think about tends to get exaggerated when it's like oh my gosh it goes world holder guys what am I done\n'em and and then I started the aging you know the house the perimeter everything um and kept taking photographs and I now have a crazy collection of nine thousand but aggressive 'cause\nYou have been doing a sham me she thinks we're kind of camera [laughter]\nAnd I found\nI used and what a great ad by the way right shouldn't apple say have an ad that says shot on an iPhone and have scroll through a bunch of pictures of ghost [noise]\nUm it was I found I I ... at one point and and the journey I bought a real cameras like Sam son Kamron on the phone but like a regular camera\nAnd it was interesting because all I captured on that um we're ... not that worms you know aren't important in special in our ecosystem but I wasn't getting everything else it's interesting\nYou know when this was going on for the entire journey which will get into your mother's situation in the old timers but how did that really gets you going\n[noise] how did you I'm Sorry so you mean get me going through this year I mean how did I start to heal from that you\nStarted to get in the strange thing\nYeah I um you know I I was I'm very lucky I um have found some phenomenal\nAh women actually in this world that are incredible psychics and they were like my psychic sherpas

[noise]\n[noise]\n\n\nAnd welcome back to coast to coast we're back with Julie ... her book is called the ghost photographer I loved the subtitle of course is interesting ... were you talk about a Hollywood executives true story of discovering the real world will make believe it's coming true isn't it\n... men like doesn't really have facial features he where it's like a foot door and sometimes a coat but what people get the feeling they have is just out of fear right because they'll see this kinda shadowy figure while they are their bodies paralyzed but they're awake and\nAnd one man asked you know who are you and he said they called me scratch\nAnd scratches another name for the devil bashing the day when he tried to ... Adam and Eve away from God to really\nGet scratched out of the book of life\nAnd so clearly he's not a nice guy right so my theory and it's just a theory that's all this is the theory is that you know if you subscribe to the idea that we're spirit having a human experience\nThat when we sleep it's our physical body that needs to sleep not our spirit ... spirit goes off in parties in the actual space I'm sure many people have talked about the astro planes\nAnd you know when our spirit is getting ready to land back into our body I think what happens is that it doesn't fully land and there's like this little space and I think it's a little space before it lands properly and you are aligned\nOn is when this can happen again it's just a theory\nWhich were pretty good it's not terrible so I really consider it more of a spiritual condition than I Do a medical condition and it's not that people who have at our bad because you know what\nThe light doesn't need more light or the dark doesn't need more dark but dark needs a lot you know the the the darkness one flight\nSo I think it's you know people are are these bright lights that I think that this entity kind of makes its way and and I don't really want to spoil for folks 'cause I I I Hope people will read the book I'm\nA at what happened that last time that alec saw the ... man because of that is probably the most profound event that has happened in my entire life\nWould you want to duplicated duplicate that experience yeah yeah\nI can handle it now you one real yeah I could would you couldn't\n[noise] um it was um oh let me just tell them so I just tell your audience what happened\nWhat I'll do it if you want me to George uses like All right I'll tell them All right we have a couple of minutes yeah those that supplements the blackout oh I'm Sorry\nI mean is you know when you say you're going to tell us\nOh yes Oh yes so I I so how how about I just tell everybody instead of just teasing about them having to read the book to find out because what happened was that Alex called in one night and said I saw that happening again\nAnd and he spoke to me and what he said to me was how her my name is Ron and I went he he said what\nHe said how her by name as wrong as I noticed that the message for you and I said yeah that's the name of my ex step dad who was not very nice\nAnd I said I'm he's trying to scare me away from you\nYou think that was him\nI don't think it was my extent that but I think it was that man who knows I Would say a lot about a lot of people fair to say um but I think that you know\nAnybody tries to if if there's any darkness that is trying to scare you they're going to find that thing that triggers you\n[noise]\n\n\nAnd broke her back to coast to coast Julie ... with us of course the ghost photographer and you have fun as a photographer don't you\nI I I think that actually have fun for the most part with with all of it I think it it made my life so incredibly interesting ah and I think they're really good word for it\nWhat is it done for you Julie knowing what you now know about the other side\n[noise] um I have found a tremendous amount of peace I Know that there was more than what you see with you\nAnd I think it actually it you know it it actually doesn't bring me chaos it brings me peace and there's a lot more at work you know there's a lot more work like this story you know from the four oh five but I think is so\nI'm profound about that is all the\nCoordination collaboration that had happened on the other side in order for me to still be alive\nYou know my spirit guide you know talking to me and and I had to listen and believe\nToo not just Pam my friend who I who I Believe is actually her sister who is holding her down where she could not answer the phone or the other four people I called that you know their guys or their spirits are there fast somebody was distracting them not to pick up the phone\nAll with the you know chance that I Would hear in less than that is pretty incredible when you think about it from the flip side\nDramatic yeah it is and as I I Believe that's happening every day all day all the time to millions and millions of people\nDon't choose to listen don't you think it's pretty stark if you did not believe the other side that that's all there is\nYeah I think it makes the world really small and I think it and I think it also probably leads to live depression and a lot of abuse\nLet's go to the bells warn you ready for some calls\nI Am so ready for some call\nLet's start by going to San Francisco runs with us welcome to the program Hey Ron\nI um I just tuned in just about a couple of minutes ago and\nIt seems to be a subject that I that's dear to me at the moment I just lost my dear dear mother last
