diseases different parts of the brain are\nRandomly or more severely deficient and things and you get different symptoms based on the different part of the brain is more severely affected\nAnd so what I like to do for people with essential tremors were those diagnosed with Parkinson's disease or central feminism matter billionaires come from all over the world for me to treat them for those need to get rid of all the bad stuff no fried foods and processed meats oils no gluten snow sugar and then you take one healthy brain and heart attack or a hundred pounds of body weight one healthy brain and

movement she's the author of several great books including the field in the intention experiment in a way it is the power of eight\nLynn is the editorial director of what doctors don't tell you and also the architect of the intention experiments and she has conducted many Lynn welcome back to the program\nHey George it's great to be back\nYou two are you still doing intentioned experiments\nI Am I mean we had two amazing on last autumn and we just calculated the results of a few months ago\nYou know I get an intention a bit when several weeks ago Hurricane Florence was heading toward the Carolinas uh the topic could hit as a category four or five and we did a little of let's bring it down in the ... hit a tropical storm really fast\nOr something happens it work sending\nMe does work I mean I worked with a group in Florida to keep it at the last hurricane not this latest one away from Tampa Bay and it just courted around it\nSo there's something going on and I mean now we run about peace intention experiments trying to lower violence\nI'm left with timber we ran a six day experiment\nTo lower violence in the violent place in America which is believe it or not a neighborhood in St Louis Missouri yeah ... and we calculated the result Georgia and it was amazing um we looked and I had a professor ... work at it from\nUniversity of California and she saw that\nCrime went up in St Louis has a whole property crime went up in St Louis as a whole property crime went up went up in fairground the neighborhood we we concentrated on the violent crime the thing we were focusing on went down by forty three percent from before\nAnd it just completely bucked the trend from the time we did the intention so something's going on here\nWhat do you think this is one of the people tapping into of course you touched on it a lot with the book the feel of what's out there\nWell what's out there we're in a collective consciousness and I like I called it the field it's a quantum energy field\nAnd what seems to be the case is we can shift what's going on with our thoughts I mean you know the bottom line is our thought everything is energy\nAnd our thoughts are another kind of energy when there are worked together collectively we have an amazing power that can change things and now\nYou know I run thirty three of these experiments and we've done everything from trying to make seeds grow faster to purify water\nTo healing somebody of pie TST to lowering violence and\nYou know of those thirty three twenty nine shown measurable positive significant effects\nDecided to walk into a trend that the odds\nWell yeah because you know there's no drug out there to be honest George that that has that kind of track record you know new pharmaceutical drug has his good or record is that in terms of studies so\nSo as I say what really seems to be the case his thoughts are things that affect other things and when you get a group of people doing thoughts together there is a collective field that seems to be created that has great power\nTo change things now he'll think\nThe experiments you been working on a blade are primarily piece intentioned experiments\n[noise] yeah we did that one we did that one in St Louis and then I tried something really amazing I had the chance to work in a studio in southern England that had where I Lived in the u._k.\nAnd we had nine different screens with the studio I could be beamed down to nine different locations so we had cameras in nine different locations\nAnd we had those cameras in eight Arab countries\nI was working with a guy who's like the Deepak of the middle east and also very prominent Israeli ... a documentary producer so we had eight and Arab countries you know Saudi Arabia Bahrain et cetera on Kuwait and then the ninth one was in an audience of Israeli Jews\nSo these are guys who have been brought up to hate each other and I also beamed at this live over my YouTube channel to um my followers around the world\nSo we all did intention to lower violence in Jerusalem there was an area of the old city that was suffering a lot of violence and we chose it because it's you know the seat of all the major religions and we thought everybody would come together\nAnd runs amazing is afterward I could call on the people in the different locations you know and just calling their screen and they could talk to everyone else\nAnd the Jews started saying to the Arabs we love you it's time to you know to end all of this and the Arabs were saying your God is my God and everybody was crying and everybody was sending love and it was\nAmazing it made the papers all over the middle east it was historic and it was incredible to me to see what was going on with these peace experiments wasn't just the outcome it was the effect on the participants\nHow much does attitude play ... in the if you're a beach in positive ... generally work better than someone who goes into these experiments as a doubting Thomas\n[noise] well I thought so but no I mean and and when I looked at when we've done intention for individual for instance we did an intention once for a kid called Luke who is Fifteen Years old\nWho tried to commit suicide he threw himself off of forty foot structure after his he broke up with this for a serious girlfriend\nAnd he broke and everything he had brain damage he had a you know he had nerve damage and so I got my my community just start sending intention to him for three weeks while his stepfather with keeping moods\nAnd careful you know tracking what was happening when we were sending intention\nLoop got better in record time the doctors didn't even think of is going to live\nBut he got better he got out of the hospital a far quicker than anybody could have estimated but here's the funny thing of it you know he's Fifteen Years old and like most teenagers he thought his parents belief in the power of intention was pretty stupid\nIt worked for him and he didn't believe a word of it\nIn which these experiments how do you start conducting them how do you scientifically put it together\nGet a team of scientists George I know I work with a lot joy or Gary

hundred dollars and she suddenly here from Lloyd's of London ... she had been a former employee to say that she could get a special amount of money because she had been part of this again out of the blue\nSo this happens so often that it has convinced me it's not just luck is not just happenstance\nAnd you see universities are studying the power me what are they doing\nWell we did the um we did the brain study you know and then we found and as I say we compared it to things like meditation and we found that it's not the same in all brain state during meditation still makes you feel like you're you\nThis what makes you feel like you're part of something much much bigger the power of eight you feel like you're part of you you kind of feel like you're part of the field that you're not this little lonely individual anymore you're part of something much bigger and grander\nUm and again we've looked at it compared to other um mystical states and its\nIdentical to a Buddhist monk and ecstatic prayer but now we're moving forward um life university the one who studied this hot largest chiropractic university\nUm has their nearest scientists and we're planning a study with their biology department to looking at immune system markers so what changes in your immune system when you do this\nOn the one of the other big pieces of this I talked about it with altruism was the University of California Berkeley who did this big study of what goes on when you do something else rustic when you do something compassionate like our piece experiments\nAnd they found something incredible that goes on a with a thing called the Vegas near it's the longest near the body and it winds its way from your neck through all the major Oregon's\nAnd it has a big effect on um things like releasing oxytocin which is a hormone that gets released the feel good hormone when we're when we caring for babies\nAnd the result of this activating is that it has a really positive effect on the immune system so when we do good or feel compassionate or ... something like that\nWe um you know we we actually get healthier but the other big piece of this which is why that Middle Eastern experiment came about and the Arabs started you know sending loved to the Israelis\nThey found that when you do something compassionate like be part of an intention experiment or power of a group [noise]\nUm that Vegas and you're also makes us more tolerant more tolerant of people not like us so that was a big piece for me George because I started thinking wow\nAmerica America is so polarized now what if we started doing intentioned experiments where we had Republicans and Democrats together would that\nWould be ... and that would be an interesting comment\n[laughter] well you know we're doing one this that this Sunday on doing a pilot experiment like that in ... county in Florida um we're going to do something about lowering violence\nBut we've got Republicans and Democrats as part of this experiment in the same room together to see what happens to them afterwards and we're planning to roll down in a big way next next spring\nOn where we want people you know of the different political persuasion in the same room together to see what happens to them afterward\nYou were talking about a mirror affect what is that\nWasn't near affect me was the biggest piece of this George because you know we weren't just seeing a fix among the ...\nEven stuff and the receiver of the big intention experiment you know the outcome that change all that was amazing to me with what happened\nThe participants in these intention experiment\nSo when we started giving these teeth experiment I started surveying the people to find out you know what happened to them and we're able to get on the Web site and all that kind of stuff but more amazingly I asked him how it was for them and I'll be getting answers back like that [noise]\nUm I felt like I was part of the higher network it my body was shivering and I was you know shaking uncontrollably and crying I felt like I was in the tractor beaming Star Trek remember these people were participating in their own\nHome in front of their own computer by themselves but yet they were feeling this extraordinary energy\nAnd the extraordinary emotion but more interestingly after they participated in a piece experiment on line became more peaceful they were making up with relatives that we're getting along better with their partners that we're getting along better with their bosses and they're co workers\nThey were and they were hugging strangers about half of them said I feel more love for everybody I come in contact with\nThat to me with the amazing thing about it the mirror effect and when we did healing experiment we had loads of healing when we had peace experiments we had loads of people finding their lines were more peaceful [noise]\nIn a way that's probably the most the most powerful part of the intention experiment up the outcome that's pretty interesting definitely but it's more the active participation and what happens to the people me changes their lives being part of that\nWhen we're going to come

the eight when\nNo I think I think you can even ten for yourself no question and you can\nHave you know you can manifest thing definitely I'm not certainly team that in my own life and seen it in in many in many instances but there seems to be some sort of scaling up in a group you know\nI I wrote about this is my land but the bond about how we are really need to be part of the community George\nAnd you know that is are are kind of birthright it's also are feeling of\nOf coming home in a way you know we were only meant to be in groups we were never and we are we are supposed to be part of the greater home we would never be alone and I think there's something about that group poured\nThat group feeling that you know you got a load of people who are just wishing you round there you know intending for you for your healthier happiness or something really powerful\nAnd you know in many cases wait in line master classes for instance when I cook ... group they're total strangers\nAnd they don't meet in person they're meeting virtually you know they're meeting on Skype or do or\nIt's coal or something like that many of them end up feeling like this is a batch of people who are closer to me than my own family never they never unless they've never actually met them in person\nAnd not the incredible thing about it but it's that idea of a group of strangers you know praying for you basically that's very very powerful\nHave you found when in your studies that these abilities work uh for people of certain age brackets of certain sections or does it skew anything\n[noise] no I mean you can be young you can be older\nYou know I think that um the people who tend to do this stuff or people who are you anywhere from their thirties to their seventies um it really depends on what they want in their life they I've had young people I've had older people\nAnd it it works for them I think it's all about\nUsing the techniques that I teach you know in becoming a a master in tender essentially knowing how to really focus your mind knowing how to\nWhat kinds of things to intend for and how to do it but also being part of that group and just meeting regularly and I think it's that meeting regularly that does the trick I mean there's a guy called\nA Michel Dean I write about my book who is a clinical psychologist but suffered from depression which such so bad that it was often suicidal that's not a good calling card for a psychologist\nSo he had tried everything conventional an alternative to try to get over this depression and he couldn't and so being part of the group they intended for that\nAnd what they intended for was that he would find the source of his in his depression and soon after that\nHe got a brain wave to go to a Chinese herbal is\nWho worked out that one of his liver filtration systems wasn't working and he went and got tests and they confirmed that he that he was right and as soon as that was treated\nHis depression completely lifted but the really interesting part of Michel story is what happened over the year not only did that happen\nBut he ended up going back to his fighting weight loss wait the he got back to his you know his his weight that he was as a young man he um he is she going practice he was practicing she'd gone that Gump better he got a writer's block and was able to start writing again\nUm he also developed something to help other people with I think it's with depression is special I'm a special kind of technique and everything in his life with getting better\nAnd even his training you know he's he's um he's a trainer at the gym and said to him what are you doing man you're exercising less and you're more fit what's going on with you and it was like everything in his life was starting to improve\nBut he he was one of the people who met religiously and in fact one of the guys in his group Robert became a really really close with him even though they'd never actually physically met\nAnd there were times when mutual would say you know\nI had insomnia last night and couldn't sleep and Robert would say don't worry man I had you covered and he was intending for him to say I have a you know to to sleep better and so knowing you've got that constant support is really strengthening in every way over the year\nWhen when you do these intention non experiments but when you do these intentions to do something what did they do actually I mean you sit there and think I mean what what did they do\n[noise] okay well there's a lot of little techniques that make you a good intent or I mean you know the popular view is that you just have to think about it and believe it\nOr ... or whatever you do\nYeah um but it's you know one thing to really keep in mind George is that where are you intending all the time [laughter] you know and we sabotage most of our intentions we we think that we're just having\nYou know we we have a meditation in the morning we do a little power thought and that the power thought is the thing that's our intention and that's the only thing the universe is going to hear\nBut um as I wrote about my book the field\nYou know we are and meeting energy all the time we're meeting a tiny current of light all the time and our thoughts are another part of that kind of mission and we're we're kind of leaky buckets we're we're broadcasting twenty four seven\nAnd so we we have this one little power thoughts saying I'd like to have this\nUm but the rest of the time we're thinking no it can't possibly come to pass or on such a loser or I don't like my hair or whatever you know were sabotaging it\nAnd so one of the things you have to do is get used to really having a focus the mind a sense of positivity but probably the most important thing of all that no one ever thinks about it being specific um\nYou really have to direct yourself to a ... don't you\nYeah I mean most people think about you know we'll all do something general and the universal feeling the gap\nAnd that's a big mistake because the universe can oftentimes sit in the gap in a really negative way you know I think of the case of\nHeather wheels McCartney who was a pull McCartney is a second wife um she was he had lost his love of his life Linda his first wife and he was learning her and he meant Heather who had been a\nShe was a northern girl from the north of England who came from a pretty rough family and she wanted to better herself so she came down to London and she was a model\nAnd she was the glamour model and she got hit by a motorcycle one day and she lost her leg below the knee one of her legs\nBut she was very lucky and she\nYou know she continued to model and stood up for the rights of people who had lost limbs and that's when Paul McCartney miss her now having meals really wanted to be famous that was something really important to her and suddenly\nAfter pull married her and fell in love and marriage her you know she became really famous you know super famous she married a former Beatle\nBut I think you know what ended up happening is as the marriage got Sam our um she they the British press\nStarted digging up all this stuff about her about how she had featured in porn um photos and things like this it's just simply Heather from being very famous\nAnd kind of revered was the answer to this and so I look at that case and I think her big problem was she wanted to be famous but she just didn't specify how and so suddenly\nUnintended consequences should they have consequences right\nAbsolutely absolutely so\nIt's about really telling the universe what you want I mean I Know that you're a journalist too and so you'll recognize the five W than age I usually tell people you know what reporters have to learn is when they write a leader of a story they write in an intro they have to do\nWho what when where why and how and how and that's not a bad thing to do when you're formulating an intention and\nIf a story includes all those ingredients you got a pretty good story\nAnd for an intention it's the same thing you've got to say what do you want\nYou know the number of people on my master class who will do things like I Want to be rich and you know they don't really want to be rich what they want is usually you know in the sense of having loads and loads of money and more stuff what they want is\nWhether together
