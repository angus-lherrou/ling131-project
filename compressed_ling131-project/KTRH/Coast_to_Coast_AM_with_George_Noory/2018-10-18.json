that with the student loan debt so Ellen if somebody gets sued for not paying their student loan or they're going to lose in court that there's no way to win is there\nWell what happens more often than you would think George is\nAll the money used to come from essentially Wall Street because the ... it was private banks that were making these loans are today this money comes from the federal treasury because as I said Obama um federalized all any program [noise]\nAh so the federal tax payer puts the money out a and the federal taxpayer hum\nAnd let's be clear we're not really talking about the taxpayers we're really talking about the department of education a ended sort of crony contractors that's where the money is going and they they keep that\nEssentially away from the tax payer and they keep it for themselves [laughter] ah but um so yeah this is a federal program money it ultimately comes from the taxpayer who\nAt this point as I said is making something like Seventy five billion dollars a year in profit\nOr and even making a profit on ... I should add so that's a of something that makes this a predatory lending system by definition\nAre their predatory lending laws in the various states\nThere are there are state use three laws in every state in the union and federal student loans are exempted from all of them [laughter] there are also fared\n... practice laws\nFederal um a fruit than lending laws uh and these again are restricted or completely remove a for the case of federal student loans\nWho came up with this scam [noise] well the genesis of this the genesis of\nThis really comes back to sort of a swamp the beltway cabal of bankers a which included a it started with a company called Sallie Mae which was a government sponsored entity back in the seventies [noise]\nUh and by the way one of your other guests who appears on your program frequently Catherine Austin fits yes\nServed on the board of Sallie Mae back when it was actually controlled by the government and she was there right at the Nexus One this company went from being a publicly sponsored enterprise\nTo a holy private for profit enterprise and she can tell you many of the stories about people like Albert lowered a bill defender for in other executives at Sallie Mae\nWho had no interest in serving the public and at every interest in making money off of this system\nSo you can point to Sallie Mae and um they're very deserving also other groups like the consumer Bankers Association [noise] uh like many of the state run guarantee horse in the country um like USA Funds\nThese people were all in it for themselves and they saw an opportunity to make money and they did everything they could\nTo make these loans as oppressive as possible and here we are twenty Thirty years later living a under the the fruits of their labor\nWhat do you recommend for a parent who whose child is ready to graduate from high school and they want to go to college\nWell the the only good advice that I can give at this point George is do not borrow and if you have to borrow\nDo not borrow from a student loan company so don't borrow federal student loans don't borrow private student loans from a bank you know that they were they were technically it is called a student loan\nBecause as soon as you call it a student loan federal or private you lose bankruptcy rights are and for federal loans you lose statute of limitations you lose fairly collection practices trees in lending a state use three laws all the all the rights all the consumer protections that I mentioned\nUm so really don't borrow is the best advice I can have but if you actually have to borrow go to a private bank get any private line of credit\nAnd do it that way because at least then you'll have you know every consumer protection that exists for every other type\nOf loan whatever happened in the days of scholarship so they still being awarded to people\nWell you know George ... of course scholarships and grants are still out there but the colleges have been raising their prices just so astonishingly much that you know no amount of ...\nAn serves even state funding cetera can keep up with their budget um you know I was just in Syracuse recently in the price to go to Syracuse University has now Seventy\nThousand dollars a year well I can guarantee you now you're per year\nThat's tuition room OR Books um for for your course for a four year college and by the way it no longer tapes for years to graduate George the average time to graduate from undergrad it's now six point two year what happened well again\nThe colleges are sitting in the cat burst sheet vacant because they're just winning program standing behind the whole thing and the federal government and the other lenders are willing\nTo pile as much dead on the back to the students as possible the colleges have carte blanche to not only raise their prices but also really straining to students out and keep them in college for as long as they can possibly do it [noise]\nSo it's it's the time is getting longer the pre your cost is just exploding and that's why we're seeing these just insane stories where people are graduating with you know a million dollars and that\nThere was a story just recently where Lindsay a guy walked out of dental school with yeah a million dollars in student loans\nNo wonder ... the belt bills are so high\nThat's right you know and and this really urged the broader economy when you have one point six trillion dollars in debt strapped onto our younger workers just out of college um after charge huge amounts just to pay out that burden\nAnd you know we're seeing comments from people like Jamie diamond a gp Morgan Chase and William deadly at the New York Federal Reserve bank and many others are about how the student loan problem is\nReally affecting the broader economy I mean when you have Ninety million dollars in interest clicking off that's Ninety million dollars where people aren't buying homes cars they're not

credits\nOr have a a very difficult time to make payments seemed to be the ones that get the short end of the stick\nIn by that I mean a you've got these payday loans that are outrageous and predatory or that or gear marked for people who need some money and you know they're having a tough time you've got these student loans situations and one of the worst icy are these um\nSecondary car market a lenders who will finance people who really can't afford a car because they have to have a vehicle so they'll finance them\nWith just what you said they want to default so what they'll do is\nThey'll say All right I Want five hundred dollars down you can buy this used car\nAnd so the person the poor person gives them the five hundred dollars keeps a car for a couple of months makes payments for a couple of months then defaults the car gets repossessed\nAnd they sell the car for the same amount of money if not the ... the ... if not more and with financing and they do it all over again and they make more money on it\n[noise] yeah that's right you know that\nThat's a great analogy George and you know I I make a similar analogy off and I say you know student loans it's like buying a car where you pick it out you buy it online and say you know look it's got great reviews you go and so you buy online you go to go to the dealership and you pick up the car\nAnd you're driving out of the dealership and all of a sudden you realize that the car has no breaks and you wind up in the ditch\nAnd you go back to the dealership and you're like hey guys you know this car has no brakes what's going on and they go well hey buddy you know what can we tell you you should read the manual because this car comes with no breaks you know uh and this in fact is really what's going on with\nStudent loans in particularly is used as you rightly say for lower income people um\nYou know a ... what we're seeing particularly in past ten years or so is these sort of fly by night expensive for profit colleges are marketing very heavily to um you know disadvantaged uh\nUnder privileged people\nUnder under privileged people people who weren't born with a silver spoon in their mouth and they're getting a horrible sort of a nonsensical education is just a joke a and lo and behold they get saddled with the loans uh and this is rex their life um\nI mean they should be getting more interest rates better financing deals but because they're credited shot and they don't have the ability to make the payments the way most people do they get the short end of the stick and that's very rural\nYeah you know it's a it's a real cruel irony and and just in general you know there are a means test for student loans and the first place so the only people the people that get student loans and it's about I mean let's be honest is about Seventy percent of everybody who goes to college winds up with student loans but still this is a a um a an economically needy group of people\nWho you know don't have a silver spoon in their mouth and\nHow cruelly ironic is that is these very people that the lending system was supposed to help\nUh and it's essentially wrecking their lives you know the default rate across all borrowers by my best estimates is over fifty percent\nAs crazy crazy once once the tuition like in Harvard or Yale\nA it's a it's on a par with the the number I mentioned for Syracuse earliest probably Seventy or Seventy thousand Seventy Seventy five thousand dollars a year\nAnd there are even more schools by the way um but uh yeah the the ivy leagues are running you know they'll they'll be up at a hundred thousand per year within I'd say a couple three for\nYou or I should have pushed my kids into sports when they were younger so they get scholarships to go to university smart yeah that's right well\nYou know even scholarships really won't pay the freight anymore I mean the price even at state schools were seen annual cost of attendance of thirty plus thousand dollars a and you know the scholarships really have an increased\nUh on that scale and and so it's you know\nUnless you get a full ride it's a very tough proposition to go to even a state school these days you know we're we're getting stories from people go to community college and wind up with you know fifty sixty thousand\nDollars apiece crazy\nSo this has just gotten unreal um this is not\nThis is not your father's a college environment you know it used to be that you could pay for tuition by working a summer job or maybe a summer job and a part time job during college will\nYou know those days are long gone um the colleges have gotten so brazen with the amount that they charge a and I should say their own salaries as well it's it's just stupid vine\nLet's go to Joe truck driving in Indiana the get us started Hey Joe go ahead\nGeorge Allen good thank you [noise] I got good news for you too man a throw rally over there and a lot of the other day yeah there was a big

[laughter]\nI Love it\nBut uh anyway I wanted to drive a little bit of trades will do\nA ... a former company I used to work or I got on egg wildly when a company went under the under the ... the night and a private plane crashed on a mission to several years ago probably about seven years now you know that it was a sad time but a pretty much went under and they laid everybody off\nAnd that was one of those people so I ended up her job over here and I found one but they wouldn't even let alone and fast or if I was I didn't have that little piece of paper saying that I'm there without doing\nWell and I think well over the years you know\nYou probably in more and more experienced than most people\nThere and I looked at the local school there and they were voting for thousands of dollars that go for oh I think it was a horse just don't think well you know it's like they're way\nSo I ended up going out and not spend thousands dollars on a great little are learning to drive semi thrive and then I felt like I got ... I found out that I could have done it for about half the price now they've been\nLet's get your reaction to this is Ellen what do you think a trade schools\nWell you know even trade schools are participating in the student loan program these days and so the prices of trade schools are getting jak through the roof as well you know when you have this land system stand behind these schools\nYou know they can charge almost what they want because there's all this quote unquote free money out there and so for guys that want to pay out of pocket\nYou know what are they supposed to do they can't compete with that uh and it's just a travesty it's it's really shutting more people out of getting an education even at even provoke tax and other trade schools\nAre as it is you know allowing them to actually go to college which was the intent of the lending program and the first place\nTo go to Gordon sort of hear the Gordon and Lakeland, Florida have already go ahead\nHey thank you for taking my call 'em out to publicly thank gallon he the one that pointed out to me that the lack of bankruptcy protecting encourages predatory lending um and of course a tuition inflation I our already knew that the more you set for dies the loans especially the taxpayer on hooked on it\nThe craft a dollar by the way because almost ten percent of total that his college did\nOkay I already knew developing in half or two but now there's one thing that I wanted to mention and that is the ...

there is that I was going to ask if you heard it is comedy or and\nAgain to me Allen doesn't it do you have student loans out there gene\nI Do I Do I got my first time you know trying to work on my bachelors\n... well what ... what these companies do these companies somehow have the ability whether they buy the lists or not but they find your name and they know you have a student loan and in many cases Alan RT scammers\nAre yes there are a lot of scammers out there and I haven't heard of this UTSA company but there are a million of them and the sounds exactly like just another one where they're looking for two things they're looking for people who are in the fall that they can assure through\nThis loan rehabilitation a scam that I described earlier where they\nMake you sign for a much larger loan and then get a commission off the top of that uh or they're just trying to get you to read your your loans and ... surgery or consolidate your loans or otherwise refinance your loans into a new again larger loan or and make a commission off of that\nSo I Would I Would rip that thing up because it sounds like it's not worth the paper it's written on\nJames truck driving in Texas the first time caller Hi James go ahead sir\nHow they're George it's pleasure to speak with you on your way I loved your reading of upgrade Allan Poe's tell\nTell huh that job thank you and I'm hoping we hear more of it before Halloween that point though I'm\nA very interesting I've I've just had a my loans and the fall for a little over a decade maybe Fifteen Years and they fell off on my credit report and lo and behold the same way this is just last week I got a letter from a company called central research L L C\nAnd hope you don't mind me mentioning mentioning them in particular a but their information as a hundred percent correct the principal was sixty four hundred and some change there's you know they're listing of breakdown of all of the costs that I've ever heard\nAnd I was wondering what advice you can give me do I tried to negotiate directly with the video he tried to negotiate with\nThese people I mean there's something like four thousand dollars in interest and also a few\nSounds like another scam Alan what do you think\nRight I mean first of all I Would I Would never deal with a third party collection company you know unfortunately I don't have any great advice for defaulted borrowers because they're truly is non to give other than\nHelping us fight for age are twenty three sixty six and getting out of bankruptcy writes back so that they can't steal from is legally a but certainly don't deal with their third party collection companies I'm the owner of you're alone is probably either a a guarantor or the department of education\nAt this late date I suspect it's probably the department of education\nI mean if you can make an offer to them of a hundred and twenty percent of the lake it alone he'll take it all the you know that's something you can do but certainly dealing with the closing up you know like like what you describe how did they get\nThe information Allen lucky said they had everything down to the penny how did they find this or a public that clearing house that has all these things out there\nNo more than likely they are sub contractors to either a guarantor or maybe directly to the federal government itself so the information they have is good um but I can tell you that dealing with them is only going to add to whatever price you wind up paying\nSo I definitely recommend I'm getting at the bottom of if you if you want to negotiate find the owner of the new rather than these third party collection companies because they're only going to cost onto the process\nBy a friend that had alone with a company that went bankrupt\nNever heard from them again\nWell you have to be very careful these are some beat loans there are no statute of limitations for these loans so you may think alone went away maybe it went off your credit report like this gentleman but I'm telling you they will come back from the dead and\nMy niece down the line least expect it\nThat's right yeah they they are waiting in the wings to to balance a like a shark or whatever [noise] um that's the thing about not having statute of limitations these things can follow you literally to the grave\nAnd well what you need to do is just say send me a copy of my loan I'd be glad to talk with you and you know what Ninety percent of the time I bet they don't have a ...\nYeah that's right I'm I'm guessing that something like fifty percent particularly for order loans is probably even higher than that they do not have the original sign\nProblem not at all Allen once again thank you for the information truly enjoyed it up next aliens in

Pentagon I Love this title tell me more\nSurely you don't you mention that I put out\nStory off off certainly the Pentagon's\nUFO credit cram a tip but she can text you alliance that story and and really to to try in one don't humane tree to tell as as best as I can the entire story of the U.S government thorny relationship with this\nPhenomenon over or watch seven decades now\nLots of people have been talking about the Pentagon the CIA what's been going on there these new revelations that keep coming out Nick what do you think\nThey are absolutely staggering there's no doubt that this has been the biggest single revelation now in in the UFO community for I I think decades I the only story that I think comes\nClose and I would say this wouldn't tie is the de classification and release of the British Government files but the the revelation that off to decades of the ... the U.S government did have a new effort program off to roll and it was run by the ... super secretive defense intelligence\nAgency I'm I'm from an agency of the day and and you're like you say for years they said no no since project to close down we haven't been doing this this knowing ... there were no investigations and of course\nThey were and that's what I really focus on in in the new film aliens at the end again to try\nTo train on angle the numerous threats to the story and there are numerous threats I mean we've we've seen the videos we've seen the talk of\nOf mystery man polls there all the different players involved and maybe we'll get into some of this but Robert Bigelow a Senator Harry Reid Tom to long I mean you couldn't make this stuff up\nNo you you can't make it up and how do you track all this stuff is coming from all different directions\nI think the answer that one is it's very cautiously and very carefully and and absolutely in meticulous detail because I think the problem with this story in one sense for years\nPeople have said the problem is that particularly with the gal them we have two little information about what's going on with the aid kit story with with these revelations um we must have too much information and I think the public\nI mean it's it's just about okay for the deep specialists or is it difficult for them but for the public eye I think it's just that confusing mass if you if you think back to when the New York times when they are they a landmark story on this on\nDecember sixteenth last year and then the the three videos came out to first than a than a third one but now the public have been absolutely bombarded there thinking yeah well this the videos and then there's this walk strong guy and then this\nThis ... millionaire businessman and and they're struggling to see how it all fits together and so that's that's what I've tried to do to take a step back and and give people an overview of this\nFrom my incite a perspective of having run a similar program in the u._k.\nDo me a little bit more about the film we're getting a lot in the course tonight Pentagon tell us specifically about\nWell I took a long on on on this one and it was quite a diversion for me usually I I just sit in the interview seats and and you've done this of course civilian times yourself you know you sit in the ... said\nA direct tucked kind of talks to you and you spend a couple of hours and and onto the questions I when you see the final product sometimes you think wow well you know I go edited down to a few soundbites and I wish they'd\nPut it in and I wish they'd taken it out and gosh I'm not sure I Would have told the story like that\nSo alien to the Pentagon and what I did is I teamed up with Warren ... from reality films and we essentially I had the the idea that I Would script that thing so I scripted the entire movie I did the I ... a million and a half thousand would I think he was\nScript for this and unfold in that way I have absolute control of this\nAnd then literally I went into a recording studio ... you know padded walls and headphones on and I knew right did the whole thing and and then I sat down in front of a camera and did did parts of it too to Cameron in that way\nIn that way although there is a director who's done a brilliant job of putting it all together I'm Michael long I but I was very much in the driving see having done the script and and in that sense\nWhen we look at the final product no one can well I Can't say gosh this this somehow didn't turn out the way I wanted it because I had my fingerprints on it from from start to finish and that's a departure for me it's a completely\nRole to me I there are people of course who are used to this sort of thing or people like Jeremy coal bellicose who just made a a a great movie but um you\nKnow I I it was a departure for me so it took me to some interesting new territory\nWhat are you hoping to accomplish with the Pentagon\n[noise] firstly I as I say really to try to go through some of the the confusion about what's been going on and just tell the complete story from from start to finish but another thing that I've I've tried to do this\nI think we probably discussed this before but one of the big problems I think that that this field\nHas is it we know young people are interested in in the subject but they don't go to many conferences and and you know it is difficult to engage with them so by putting this out as video on demand\nWe go on to the platforms that the young people\nThe watch these things on when they stream as many people do these days so it's on Amazon and iTunes and Google Play and food do and video and all those\nSorts of things so that the the aim was to take this subject not not just to the conventional UFO conference crowd but but too young to get people and and another thing is\nYou know it's been a year since termed along ... had his press conference\nWhere he\nGot together with the to the stars of people um and it's been nearly a year of course since the New York times\nWhen the story I I did ... uh you know in some ways the story I think has pulled down a little bit so we'd aliens at the Pentagon I Wonder we ignite the ice and put it back where it absolutely belongs center stage and under the spotlight\nAnd how is this organization do we know nowadays like you like you said I I'm beginning to feel as if the momentum is waning what do you think\nThat when when you say the organization M E T I O right\nYes um well that's very interesting question and the answer is no one knows because in in all of this the U.S government has said well it always says in\nThese sorts of situations only as little as possible and we we really have very few pieces of the puzzle\nFrom the government itself which is is pretty much profit because we don't frankly we don't even know whether a tip is still an ongoing project\nI I think people like Lou Elizondo ran it of course say yes it is it still has its mission it's still continues he of course all though he's resigned from the Pentagon and still has has a lot of contacts and friends that he he says it's still going now\nLike structures zones to be aware of eyes forty five but do freeway north on front

F. I. files we are seeing government say effectively will look here is\nOur data or as much of it as we can release you know without compromising\nSo classified information I'm ... and and the ultimate irony of all this might be ... genuinely governments don't really know what they're dealing with either I'm which takes me back to the mountain Reese\nQuite what if we all dealing with some things so above and beyond comprehension let's say it would be an allergist to explaining quantum mechanics to a chimpanzee\nYou'd never know you you never know you know when you look at Leonardo da Vinci's works or he depicted things that we have today I'm not sure he knew what the what what he was drawing though what do you say\nWell he was clearly a fishing reach genius [laughter] been a time travel [laughter] well I'm not sure about that but um I guess there are there are a handful of physicists\nWorking on that Ronald Merrill it comes to mind yeah but I think there are some some others or you know I mean I had a job and the ministry defense where I was paid to think the unsinkable so I I don't really things out\nDid you get involved in remote viewing or anything like that psychic work with the ministry you did\nYes absolutely we had you can't run a UFO program without finding yourself the the focal point for anything\nYou saw\nAny any one kind of comes to the government about and of course we had we had people who said that they psychics and they wanted to volunteer there to the intelligence community to help us well you know like Kate\nSoviet missile submarines a mosque by some trade has that sort of thing\nSo we looked classic low probability high impact probably when what but if it does the payoff is so big wind on\nSo we actually did have a program the U.S government had three over the years that we know about ...\nSome street can dog ate\nThe ministry to go into the briefly in about two thousand and one\nAnd did a study which which was classified I think ... it's now classified\nAnd only ministry defense website actually on the national archives website I'm not sure where but it's out there it it wasn't a very good study I have to say it didn't last of the U. S.\nPrograms and because it was an intelligence program the age old problem they they are so much in but they didn't go out and talk to people that they probably should have talked to some of the people involved in Stargate and fame and from trade\nWhat do you what do you think of rumors about a congressional hearing on your photos to sell the teeth\nAnd I and actually this is a big breaking news story actually just this week it it turns out it's more than rumors I'm calling from reliable sources but the Senate\nUm his ... his committee has already gone it looking at the two thousand four incident which causes the focus of of some of these\nSafety classified videos that we've been talking about they've interviewed at least to the pilot and I think one of the right All right\nSo so we have the Senate Armed Services Committee involved we also in how have the house armed services committee involved and if you look at the congressional record\nFor the house armed services committee dated April ... you will see a paragraph\nWay and I think it's run up to about forty three forty four pages but All right there on the second page paragraph for three I\nWon it says that the CIA [laughter] ... supply the committee with a briefing on basically what I did\nNick who when we come back let's talk more about these rumors of congressional hearings and then we'll take phone calls spinal our just ahead with Nick Pope on coast to coast they um find out more about tonight's gifts to log on to coast to coast am dot com [noise]\n\n\n\nHarvey taught us one flooded all around the venue is president and be prepared\nTo regain\nSevere weather station use radio seven\nForty days the R.

[noise]\n[noise]\n\n\nBand back with Nick Pope your questions this hour as well Nick let's get back into these talks of congressional hearings what'd you think could happen it could happen when\nI think now it will be because of course we we get the judge Kavanaugh mhm get what's coming up to me but hey you know I'm\nI'm happy to\nHave been doing and I think back in track\nIt into the white a question of you ate pays\nMore generally we actually know in parallel that that a representative Amy Farrah I think it was a has had some discussions with the chair of of the uh science technology and space committee\nAnd the space subcommittee that could actually be a little bit of a don't fight about that I mean that's another\nPoint if this congressional interest which we know Israel\nEvolves into formal congressional hearings the\nQuestion arises well where should those hearings the as I say should they should they sit in the armed Services Committee or in the the space subcommittee or the the science technology and space\nMain committee I think I think it will be difficult to get it away from the middle of tree frankly it was a a military and intelligence program and I I just can't see how you would get it out of of the armed Services Committee and indeed\nOne of the subcommittee is is is the emerging threats and capabilities\nSubcommittee which specifically talks and its terms of reference about unconventional threats well if ever there was like a forum to to discuss the UAE pay\nA mystery it's it's bad so so you you know I I think it ... we know as an absolute indisputable fact\nThat there is congressional in traffic we know that there is lobbying going on for formal hearings I've actually I Can't say too much about this but I I supplied some briefing myself and I sit and they said that I'd be happy to to testify if my own experience of having done this for the British Government\nWould be useful um but but watch this space one of the other things which I think is is bizarre and fascinating is I think so far they haven't really been for\nA national daily newspaper reports that have actually going into the fine but yes there is this congressional interest in UFOs and you know war all four of those articles or in British newspapers\nAmong us one us no not yet no\nNo thank God we do what we do and we have so many good podcast results are doing what they do to get the word on that\nI absolutely but but this is going to transition into the mainstream and and just this week fortunately he got the chance one one of the things is I Know do some work is a freelance journalist myself\nAh it it's kind of like like we said with aliens and again you know if you don't like the way that you you are portrayed on TV sometimes ... documentary well I I take the same view with newspaper articles\nAnd this this week I had an article published in the guardian newspaper which is is one of the most respected national daily nearing\nAgreed on line or two\n... yeah I absolutely as they all have to be these days and and my my article in the guardian basically um I expose this the Senate Armed Services Committee and House Armed services\nCommittee interest and I I think that things will be going on behind the scenes as a result of that article but it's it's it's staggering live before articles I've seen about this all four of them a British not one US\nI'd love to see a survey by the way you just mentioned the Internet on line uh I'd love to see a survey of twenty five to thirty in that category who read a newspaper every day as opposed to going online and I bet it's like Ninety eight percent on line\nI'm sure you're right I mean I Am I Am of course off off the age where I like a hard copy newspaper in my hand and we'd only write things you know I I used to get disappointed like when somebody said oh it's it's on the online version but now I guess my ... my reactions should be well great like\nGets it gets the attention absolutely\nAll right let's go to the phones Brian in Indianapolis east of the Rockies hey Brian\nHey George morning hey good to talk to you again\nHey hey ah first of all you had to open up the show about a special report about working less being at home and yeah I got I got I co signed for student loan you know kind of stuff so I I gotta work [laughter]\nBut anyway I make great program may great group time of your top notch guy but a Mitt what an honor it is to talk to you my my friend you're not my friend but third great honor\nThank you Brian hey listen I my wife and I are eight namely why a lot that pretty religiously and in operation a project Blue Book they had a special report I think it was like number fourteen or something like that to come out in the fifties\nThat they they sign they said they scientifically proved the UFO didn't exist now you said earlier that ah some of the believers in your new book or or movie\nUh we're ... we're we're the people that they ran into the labor were people from project we book and I take my answer off the air George you do a great job keep up you\nWere saying spring will talk to you too I'm trying to get time to do a live show in Indianapolis perhaps the next year if we can pull that off I think he was also talking about Nick the con didn't report\nYes um that that was hum of course widely regarded now as a bit of a ... job and I think quite rightly the U.S air force made it quite clear\nThat they wanted just to get out of the UFO business or at least they want it to the public out an invites another point that we make\nIn in the documentary aliens Pentagon\nReally the one thing of project Blue Book\nUm which was kind of just like the program went dark\nAnd of course this is the famous\nA ball and a memo which which says the UFO reports which could affect national security are all made a in accordance with I think it's a chain up one for ... sake and on ... part of the blue book system\nSo so in other words the clue with there all along that the ... reports that had national security implications we're never going to be in the public program of Blue Book anyway\nNo that's a good point Nick since you've been doing this and you've been doing this for how long\nHow many years well\nMy goodness ah I guess I was appointed to the British Government fewer project in Nineteen Ninety One\nSo uh yeah that's more years ago and I can't mention of of course I did that for much of the early nineties and they stayed in the end Modi in different positions until two thousand sake I never lost my interest in in all of\nThem were you interested in your clothes before you were put into the ministry of defense\nNot told no I not interested didn't know anything about it I Will simply assigned to that position I mean it was like here's your next posting and I was like yeah okay what's the job and boy did it change\nMy life if you remember what was the very first case you looked at one oh my God\n\nWell I think I don't know whether it was one that I actually came in I mean we go we go to a three hundred reports each year\nI think it was it was actually going through the old filing cabinets pulling out the old files you know dating literally back to the the actually the second World War but I'm I suspect was pulling out the rental shack forest file\nYou know of\nCourse I'd been told that the party line on this ... that we have to push with everyone was UFOs or if no defense significance and then I'm reading I pull out the ... and I think I did a kind of wait a minute [laughter] what do you mean\nAnd whether
