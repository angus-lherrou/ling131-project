E. will get you go what did you experience how did you know it is here\nWell the my first one I've ever had hundreds and hundreds of experiences over the decades but\nThe first one I had um I was actually in a dorm room are going to college and I was doing what I call the target technique where you select three objects and you focus on them and as you fall asleep at night and the next after\nA series of days went by a one day I was sleeping on my side and I when I become aware I've realized that was vibrating differently\nIt's it's strange to really describe this but you feel a vibration of floating sensation and when I reached out my arm I realized my arm entered the wall\nAnd when I did you think we reached beyond that\nOh no I was not ... I didn't realize it was tell you the truth at the time but when I reached out what is at now I realize it at that moment I realized was my non physical arm it went through the wall and then I saw them stand in the next thing I knew I was standing\nBy the foot of the bed and it was a one hundred percent real and I began to move around the room and examine my surroundings that was my first experience it was relatively brief but it was quite a life changing\nDid you encounter any body being guide anyone there\nAre actually that I did and I write about this is my first book adventures beyond the body that I observed someone that was observing may um\nBut they didn't I didn't communicate with them but somebody was observing may which was at the moment was a little bit shocking I was a newbie I had no idea about that what I had first stepped into here\nAnd a ... over the decades and years of course I became more and more comfortable as I began to have more and more experiences\nIt's addicting isn't it\nYeah well it's it's it's exciting because you can finally obtained the answers for yourself that said\nI think is the most important thing you don't have to depend upon um external sources and uh the indoctrinated society and culture that's around as you can you can find out the answers for yourself\nYou don't give me an example 'cause how do we know the answers are true\nWhen you experienced some in other words once you leave your body you know you you're more than your body you know that your brain is not the source of consciousness mhm as we've been trained to believe\nYou realize that you continue to exist\nAnd also you begin to realize that the universe is multi dimensional what I began to experience was a not only one non physical dimension but many of them and you realize that the physical world is just the in a sense the EPA term is a thin at the ... of the universe\nIs just one of them\nYeah yes and but you can experience that first hand and that's what's important it's it's it's not conjecture or belief system\nMhm I always think you know incredible as our our world is ...\nKnow incredible globe that we're in\nA given topic couldn't stop here I mean with all of the intelligence that we have here and with all the information is in the human being why would the universe just create one type of human being that doesn't make any [laughter] absolutely\nNot and once you have to mention\nThat once you have these experiences you realize that the universe is multi dimensional and that and that there is there is trillions of all their life forms\nYeah and and not only human there has to be it wouldn't just be one that did not want to do anything\nNo of course not and it's the universe is far more diverse and magnificent and then we can that I can express\nMhm yeah it is it absolutely is so now when you\nYou have these experiences and you know they're real because usually they feel real you know he was clean because usually not a language to really clearly defined what an entertaining chin is universal understanding\nWell once you leave your body and you begin to you begin to communicate and meet other being's\nGenerally they're humanoid they're generally what we would consider to be people that have died or I write about communicating and meeting my mother and my uncle who to it passed\nAnd all communication is very elegant it's by solved and there's no need in other words language is no longer a barrier\nWe we communicate directly by thought ... and it's amazing it's so clear and concise compared to the physical languages that we use here that are symbols and it's uh it's amazing\nBut that's one of the great benefits of this is that you have an opportunity to experience and explore yourself and discover the answers for yourself there\nIs no um when I teach my classes there is no um belief systems attached to it\nEach individual is given the skills given the tools needed let's say to go out and become an explorer themselves so they can discover what they feel is the truth for themselves\nWhich is very important\nNow your classes you teach them in really tell us what does

so um I was familiar with it but most out of body experience suggests to be clear or or spontaneous\nAnd people have there are certain prayed alludes to them vibrations a sleep paralysis by the way is a prelude if it's if you react properly is a wonderful prelude to an out of body experience if you stay calm\nAnd react I I always I often say and people think it's strange but I Love sleep paralysis\nWell that's an indication that I'm ready to leave my body\nWill keep the case that then you know walking off your balcony or yeah I think you know people\nDon't know how to use it um to initiate a profound experience or as science hasn't told us that\nSo many people have common phenomena and they don't know what's happening millions and millions of people have they wake up in the middle of the night and they're non mall over\nOr their vibrating or they're a hearing strange sounds you know these all can be a prelude to an out of body experience if you're if you learn how to respond to these what I call them in our signals\nOf there's a shift that's occurring within you that's preparing you for this shift of consciousness that we call him out of body experience\nIt's important to become aware of this\nBut we do this naturally anyway I mean ... when you are when people are going to be travels the pain ... the brain argue make any type of um recording I'm Derek travel\nWe have at the Monroe Institute we have in isolation booth\nThat has been used to map brainwaves during many different altered states there is a copper lines or isolation chamber huh uh at the Monroe Institute that's used for um research\nAnd matter of fact there was one in each a we have two centers and uh\nThere's there's quite a bit of research being done on different types of ... states have consciousness let's put it that way for instance we have a class called discovery were twenty people are all hooked up to a mind mirror and every person they go through a series of techniques\nAre and they're they're but they're not their brain waves are mapped during every exercise\nAnd in fact I speak it one night at on this class and I talk about how to initiate obese\nBut they they cover a lot of territory they also how to go deeper and meditation very quickly how the remote view more effectively for instance there's a lot of different let's just say I'm skills that are taught\nAny more interested in different kinds of approaches\nLet's talk about some of the findings Cindy's what is a mind near twenty people hooked up to the minds\nOf the online mirrors just a device that um will it's that's the trade name of the device\nI'm In ... in our class we will have\nA four people can be monitored by each mind mirror and it's a it's a brain wave which it literally will monitor 'em your multiple different venues or the brain while you're going through an entire forty five minute program\nSo you can track it and then we can print out it resolved and again that's you can tell what is what are you most responding to [noise]\nBut that's that's that's one of the beauties of the Unruh Institute is that there is research done in these areas but for me the main my main goal is to teach people how to have the\nScary in themselves and not only have it but control it and get the most of it my main goal is to teach people how to have a profound\nA spiritual experience ideally throughout a body exploration it's not just about walking\nAnd walking through a wall and talking to someone and it's a lot more profound than that you have the we have the ability to have the literally connect with Sarah herself with a multi dimensional fell right\nAnd have the kind of experiences that that a Buddhist speaks of and the ancient Hindus and missed except talked about around the ages\nThat we're no we're there we have that ability ourselves because we are all of us are multi dimensional being it's just a matter of of beginning to open up to our own potential\nI found some great information on your website and let's say by the way it's ... ... ... dot org and there are great resources on their uh\n[noise] I I I've found that civically ways that you can take yourself into and it'll be ... if you want to go through to do that there are\nLots of great things really any talking on a second with senator your survey results the on\nBased on your sixteen thousand one hundred and eighty five a hundred ... a ring came out with the um common reported and nominate associated with out of body experience is very interesting so the\nAverage of what people go through which is fantastic in on this is pretty ... which I think great that you really help and give the information freely so people can\nPractice especially if you have something going on in your life a problem on illness\nYou can connect to your own answers can you connect with people that that are and loved ones that um can you help families to answer\n[noise] well you can definitely contact loved ones uh it depends on whether each individual is open to whatever information you want to share but when you have the ability to contact\nOur loved ones face to face\nYeah amazing

because I Am my guest is William ... and he's talking\nAbout out of body travel and he's been doing twenty five years of research at the mineral Institute\nSedative or sixteen thousand participants who have gone through the OB e training at than than real Institute Virginia and he's come up with a common reported phenomenon associated with these obese believe mom it's funny if you could explain this to our audience [noise]\n[noise] yes I'm just to clarify I've been at the Monroe Institute for the last eight years oh okay but I've been studying nursing practice you know for forty or just to go on my website ... dot org I included um over a period of ten years I did\nA number of surveys\nAnd I receive sixteen thousand responses from people that had out of body experiences and this is from forty two different countries\nThey're used by the way and it's it was amazing how similar the\nKinds of experiences that people were having were so similar it didn't matter what the culture was for instance I'm a floating or um vibrations high energy sensations\nEighty five percent of people experience buzzing humming are roaring sounds as a as a prelude normally to the experience because normally when you're in your experience things become very generally speaking are quiet but there's a lot of phenomena associated with the onset\nOf Seventy two percent at some point experience some kind of partial or fall asleep paralysis\nI'm being lifted or touched that was quite common thirty three percent hearing voices are footsteps thirty seven percent this is one that's very common probably to almost anyone\nAnd that is seen through close dial it if you're seen through your clothes die lives at night and you can begin to see you are already in the\nProcess of shifting your consciousness to your non physical body because you have in it doesn't mean you've accident your body but it means you're in the process\nBut most people don't know this because they haven't been trained in the in the prelude and the phenomena associated these are common things at\nA for instance probably the most common it's just a jerk awake you feel like you're just a you're taking a nap and suddenly you just jerk back into your body right is I find that many people feel that that's an indication you're you're at a phase with your body is your fell asleep\nThen that's the dance on it because then happen if I'm a retired I Will switch and I think his muscles ... are you saying that now that he said\nNo I'm I'm saying it's not I'm saying it's a prelude to one potentially ... this is what I have found and what many other um experience or has had seen unexplored\nEvery one when they sleep we all humans are moving out her face from our body sets with sleep is mhm we take it for granted no one you know there's no we we know about REM periods and we know about this from a scientific standpoint\nBut what happens for that one third of our life\nWe're actually moving out of phase with our body and when you leave your body you can observe other people\nIt's like a double image people literally are floating I'm not saying they're floating up the ceiling they're just like two inches\nOut a phase with her body at night as a sleep and you can observe this actually during an out of body experience ... image you're looking at it's amazing the same applies to animals by the way animals also do the exact same thing\nOh yeah when you watch the animals sleep they aren't switching and having all sorts of experiences\nWhere they're moving their legs and the dream the can or they may be running in their non physical body I mean my point is that out of body experiences or as natural as breathing\nAnd think about this for a moment and and that is just that everyone is non physical we're a non physical ... its temporarily for a very brief period of time eighty years or Ninety years we\nDidn't have any biological machine ... and then we're ... we're moving beyond the body\nSo it isn't it I find it just\nIt's one of the ways to discover what's really going on what this multi dimensional game of chess or play ... and most people only aware that they think there's two levels of the game life and death actually it's a it's a vast multi dimensional game\nBut very few people are aware of it\nAnd you begin to awake into this one you have an out of body or near death experience\nWell that if you wanted to ask the question like how did the pyramid game here would you go into an OB and ask that question and have you ever tried this and I'm curious how did you think he seemed to have an imagination\nThat's a good question it's all in the perception of the experience are okay and you can have multiple experiences for instance I had I began to have spontaneous experiences when I started this goes back in the seventies and\nAre we still learning what was going on I'm Still learning by the way you know one's a master we're constantly learning and I started to have experiences of myself as a German tank commander in these experience I Would find myself literally riding a German tank\nI mean and it was so real it was just like the physical world and I didn't even know what was going on I didn't believe in a past lives that wasn't on my radar\nBut then I had these repeated experiences and that's the way a lot of people end up getting verification and I had multiple multiple experiences where I found myself as a German soldier in World War two\nAnd I also found out that my let's just say one of my sons was with me at the time\nAnd um my point is that when a Austin will get information given to us or we open to these experiences and we get a download and it's more than just a download of information it's presented to us in exponential were there were present\nAnd when you have this happen a dozen times it begins to get you get your own verification\nOh what's going on ... and I think\nThis is very important because no one's telling you for instance I didn't believe in past lives into I started to have my own\nThat's I mean I'm just using this is one example\nRight that does make sense it's it's just not needing to be validated or verified ... anyone other than yourself\nRight I and it's very important that that self verification is essential I find because that's the only way will ever break free from the indoctrination of belief systems that dominate our society and culture\nAnd very important\nYes because all of us have been from birth we've all been indoctrinated along certain religious and let's just say educational lines\nAnd [noise] you know I always ask somebody that's an avid believer and anything like that a specialty of religion you know what would you believe what faith would you believe if you would have been born in India ah eh we're had\nBeen programmed and this gives us an opportunity to break free from that program into truly see what's real and look beyond the programming that we all share\nA cause and that's an important aspect of this bigger and it's an individual journey nobody can tell you what you are and where you're going nobody can you after you experience it and then you suddenly oh my God now I got it\nAnd it's it's a transformational powerful experience and it's very self empowering\n... it is now back to the report that you had you talked about the common maybe put it in ... and then also\nThe average age of ... out of body experience have you seen ... years old and he put ... recount changes and it's often repeated experience it happens over and over again but it declines during the early teenage years why do you think that is so they can get that\nI I think the children are just more open to naturally experience their multi dimensional self and once you hit puberty\nTraffic still isn't budging Lewis on on the east Lubet ship channel is closed due to an accident traffic is backed up the highway to twenty five I Would

San Pedro or the empty or it doesn't matter how you and do the experience if your fear based and you take your fears are mindset is going with this into our experiences\nThat's why it's so important to begin to each to take a close look at yourself and your beliefs and to see how and tried to perjure yourself as much as possible of these fear based a belief systems that have no reality to them\nBut if you believe in some kind of negative vanity if if there is not like there's negative energy it's you were going to create it when your mind is going to mold of reality around you\nIf you believe in love and light you're going to manifest love and light if you believe in darkness and a negative beings and whatever\nThen you're going to manifest that as well well you are creative powerful beings and when you leave your body no matter how it's done you're entering into a incredibly thought response of environment and\n... for your experience some people don't like to hear this but it's a true\nWell I had we had one once where I went it was a specific dream I guess I remember but it could very well in and out of body experience where I\nWas shocked by somebody that had written up it was like a future scene and they were on a motorcycle and they got in their back on their helmet look directly at me didn't recognize this person I don't know anyone that um\nRide their own the motorcycle and it was and it woke me up because it was as if\nThat person was really looking at me and I don't know who lives in it wasn't a projection of anything and it was when I was no there isn't a premonition of anything that happened it just it was as if I had gone into a future dimension\nWhich looks pretty bleak honest and then this person looked at me saying why are you who how did you cross into this dimension and then I woke up because\nI was scared to each other yeah I'd I don't know if that's an added well out of body travel less likely mhm\nWell it could have been but it wasn't a projection of my psyche at all\nNo object there is consensus what I call consensus realities and there's Don consensus realities there's that's that's why it's important to learn about the consensus realities are created by a collective group of individuals that all agree on a reality\nAnd they create that's why I called consensus\nThere's many types of realities that exist in in our multi dimensional universe and that's why it's important for us to look at them learn these what is essentially the rules a non physical reality and how they function because it's not the same as it is here\nWe're used to linear time writing to gravity or you're still there yeah when you leave your body you don't have a biological body you're not breathing air you know you don't have gravity\nAll the things we're used to have to ... you have to learn how to function in a new kind of energy space\nThat's and that's of course one of the things I teach and I'm\nIn my workshops but it's also in my book but it's important for everybody to start learning the nature of our continuing existence\nYes so that will be prepared for this transition of consciousness\nI understand I understand they want to thank you so much rain it's been great if you go to his website which is an astral info dot org you'll find out about all of this book and his courses in classes and there's lots of free information there as well\nAnd when we come back we're going to attack that killed ...

that this is Jay anyway come to the show [laughter] funny yeah thank\nYou very much and thank you very much for being for letting me be on tonight and I've been a long time listener so this is a dream come true\nAs well you can be your book and we do our you know constantly in Colorado during guy as shows and I thought it'd be so fast\nYou didn't 'cause there are so many different pieces of history little pockets of history and it's really unassuming you can find things like that in Colorado and everywhere but where did you what was your first experience\nWhere we are normal well\nThis well I've been seeing go since I was me an e high to a grasshopper is what I always say\nI'm and about and my parents never believe me so it was quite frightening\nAnd so this really has become part of my mission in life is to try to spread some better understanding and after I got cancer I'm about ten years ago\nIt was my wake up call and I looked at my bucket list and believe it or not my goal was to try and the unite the paranormal can you ... community and to also do some outreach to help children better understand\nAnd um so I actually started this paranormal convention and I partnered with my friend dory spins\nAnd she's a professional psychic and she runs a nonprofit called kindred spirits out of Longmont, Colorado mhm and so\nThe two of us uh with the brainstorming and then getting a lot of support from other people in the community now we've changed the name to spirits of the Rockies paranormal conventions and uh we've we call it a ... feast because every year we try to sponsor it in a different community\nAnd by doing that we outreach to the historians because we call ourselves haunted historians\nBecause what we do is actual real history so even if you don't believe in ghost or things that go bump in the Knight supposedly this stuff really happened\nAnd I particularly interested in this after I found out about a journalist named Charles for it and I'm sure all your listeners know about him\nThat he was pretty popular about a hundred years ago and what he did was he went into old newspaper archives and old mysteries and he revisited them to see if it was possible that these things really happened\nAnd so that's what I decided to do and interesting enough this is actually my fifth book and I want to shout out to ship for publishing LCD they actually publish my last book\nGhosts legends and lord of the Rockies and it is available through shut the ship for publishing\nOkay well let's just back up for a second here so you let's talk about your Journey Through sure going to die of cancer and how you how you reconnected your life which goes what were you doing before then\nWell before that\nI like I said I've always been in to the paranormal because I've been seeing it you know since I was little child\nLeaving seeing it you you\nKnow I see it and I actually feel it\nI mean like humans to examples that\nWell I can [laughter] I Know this is going to sound really funny but I can actually sense things [noise]\nUm I'm an impasse I think a lot of your listeners probably are familiar with that kind of a term but I'm very ... I'm just highly sensitive now if somebody came up to me and said hey is the Broncos going to win the football team I Can't protect that into the future\nBut what I can do is I see pictures for example today I was at the flea market with a friend and they lost their backpack and I saw the picture in my head of where it was that I just close my eyes and I saw where it was at and we went back in there it was so I'm able to do things like that um but I\nLet's see I think okay so I was a professional storyteller from the time I was about twenty all through college I used to do singing telegrams all of this kind of thing and so I've worked in the entertainment business for quite a while and about Twenty years ago is when I bought a bed and breakfast in managing Springs Colorado and he was taunted\nAnd so I said well I might as well start doing haunted history tourists and I open my big huge mansion to the public and I head haunted wine and cheese parties\nHe'd you know before you bought it it was haunted\nYeah I was haunted but I was kind of like this you know my kids were starting in junior high at the time and I was like oh this will be fun kids get this we are oh you're going to love this story this is way true I mean it sounds like it's made up but I'm telling you that all that I'm telling you tonight is a hundred percent true\nWe were living in Southern California at the time and my husband was working for cancer research company and he got laid off when the company changed hands\nSo my entire family a move to Colorado and bought\nAn old haunted mansions sight unseen I Swear\nThat because we wanted to buy a hundred mentioned well are they wanted to buy a mansion well what happened\nIs I actually come out I'm actually from Colorado and I'd come out on vacation and I was staying in the bed and breakfast\nAnd I got to know the owners pretty well and I told them my story about how my husband was in this cancer research company and he was the CFO and everything and at the same time the owner's life who actually wasn't living there she was at in California because she I\nMean ... Texas because she had cancer and she was dying so she was really interested in the research and I tried to give her as much information as I could you know her husband and mind you and she died and so during this time it was really interesting because I actually got an email\nUm and it was back in Nineteen Ninety nine you know so I think it was like I feel bad a questionnaire and the room and that's how he got my email address\nAnd he said to me you know I I Know your husband was involved in this and everything but we actually have this\nA bed and breakfast up for sale and uh if you you know I Know you said your husband just got laid off of work I don't know if you were thinking about coming back to Colorado but we could talk about financing the home for you\nAnd that was interesting 'cause my husband didn't have a job I mean everything just fell into place like we were meant to have this house and by the way I actually knew of the house because I grew up here and he was always really fond of this big beautiful old\nA craftsman style mansion done and the arts and crafts file I just loved it\nAnd um when we bought it it was really rundown [laughter] extremely run down and so one of the first order of business was to actually fix up the house now this was a problem because the owners said to us\nThat they would finance us no problem we didn't even have to put any money down but I was not allowed to sell anything in the house until the house was paid for\nAnd we signed a balloon I'm a balloon like loans and said that we would pass the house and five years after five years we can do whatever we wanted with the furniture or the house with what ...\nWell after us and you know no no hard feelings to the former owners or anything but I really did not like the way this house was decorated and an artist you know and it's\nVery severe that I'm In a soothing you can see where this was going roe [laughter] yeah so I actually\nCalled the owner's son and he was managing the bed and breakfast at the time and I said hey do you think they would mind if I you know just sold a few things and it goes you know what steps do what you want he goes\nMy mother is old and she is going to die soon you know this was before she died and he goes don't worry about it you know I'm just do what you want there never coming back to Colorado again because you know it's too high of an altitude song about it just do what you want\nAnd I said All right thank you very much\nSo I put an ad in the paper and I had the biggest state so I don't think anybody's ever seen anything like wow I hired twenty people um to help me out and we all had T shirts that said on a ledge estate so Nineteen Ninety nine and it was ethic\nMy goodness you know being flown flew everything in the house lock stock and barrel you can see where this is going right [laughter] I Can't wait\nWell the ghost of surely actually sue\nWas not happy with me I'm not long after that my nephew was living with me and he was only six years old at the time and he actually had his own bedroom must be on a ledge estate and he started talking about a ghost named sue\nCourse that killed him O'Donnell's almost three hours later we're still dealing with the closure easily north but after Manchester because of an accident\nThat whole area is going to be shut down causing stopped traffic from highway two twenty five you're gonna want to avoid that if you're heading in that direction I don't see that cleared up anytime soon and then he sends to park when north better just to deport boulevard Dwight lands blocked off due to an accident on the Jillian in the ...

and she is not only a professional story or as we can tell but he's also the owner of the blue moon hunted histories tours in Colorado\nSo Stephanie tell us a little bit more about you when we were talking about men or two springs and how it has this incredible magnetic anomaly there where ... in Colorado and why the civically Colorado did it just called you\nUm I think another reason why I'm that\nPeople were drawn to manage his springs for spiritual reasons is because originally this was a sanctuary to five warring Native American tribes and when they came here they had a pact between them that they would not\nFight when they were here this was their holy sanctuary so they would wipe off their war paint and put down their weapons and there was peace here forever until the Victorians came along and the legend is that we started building you know the hotels and\nI went up there to the theater and the ghost is gone it worked\nShe'll be manager confirmed that\nSnow yes all of this worked out beautifully [laughter]\nNeeding now had she seen the operation of this not\nSince the book has come out it was amazing\nDuring the time before the book yes\nOh yes she knew it was hard but she hit like I said her job was at stake oh by the way it was interesting I forgot this is an important part of the story why out of the blue you know on August Eighth two thousand six team\nBecause the theater had just been sold to the city at one point it was actually slated for the wrecking ball\nAnd this girl was reaching out desperately trying to find someone to help her tell her story\nI'm sure this isn't the first time that's happened to you\nI'm a ... well the first time I got a call from a ghost that desperately needed their story\nThat yes but you seem to be the you like the publicity for the east coast and the [laughter]\nYou I think that is the main thing is it's meant to be one you have no way really connecting history with you you do the research it's like a real live go go under\nWhen you when you go to places and they say it's haunted don't you always want to know why and I laugh when they always say it's haunted by the goes the likes of the little girl that bounces all isn't she do I'm like no leave and you go listen friendly does give me a break [laughter]\nThere's no devious funds spirited\nNo no absolutely not if they are they're just kicking you being a trick to improve\nTheir it's here they are in prison here by their own their own their own minds they're they're they're they're they're in danger\nDo they tend to come out more during Halloween during nighttime so yes\nIndeed I absolutely believe this time of year that the veil as the dentist and this is the best time if you do want to communicate with your loved ones this is the best time of year to do it I'm absolutely a big believer in that\nWhy do you notice that there's a peak time Oh yes\n[laughter] and the best time of day believe it or not you know everyone thinks that it's midnight or you know they're ... we do have the votes to come out at midnight you know but Tom or at three thirty in the morning but I find the best time to actually look for those of you wants to see them with your eye\nIs at dusk in between when the sun is just setting it's in between day and night it ... that is the best time\nThere's a transition time why it's\nThe it's because of the lighting if you think about this there are so many colors that we can't see and when the lighting is just right see I'm also an artist and oil painter lends itself to the shadows does that make sense\nYes it does it make straps when you see the shadows people and the light changes very fast right now and it\nOnly I call it the God light it only lasts about ten minutes and in the Rockies we have it it's beautiful because of the way that it bounces off the rocks in the end of the mountains like I live in a canyon and it really lends itself to being able to see the shadows that just the right direction\nNow is a place that you're living in now haunted or did you ... non ... and the gas the goes follow you\nRight yes they do on line two words it's very funny see I've been doing them now for Seventeen years I started when I was in kindergarten [laughter]\nJust kidding [laughter]\nUm that being said I've been doing it for so long that I just naturally thought that the this is going to crack you up but I thought that the street lights and managed to on a timer because whenever I Would walk underneath ... rights\nGo out when I Would be talking about certain goes you know these certain locations\nAnd then one day my kind of why would they go out when you're standing underneath them if they were on some kind of that trip or to save on electricity or whatever they would on when you walk underneath them and I said yeah that's true [laughter]\nSo they really do communicate with us on the tour I Will talk to them in the street lights flash this talented very hunted by\nWell it's too for a lot of areas I mean even Boulder when you walk around there and then went there once a month and doing doing uh my show in the ... if you just look at the top of the buildings it's got a lot of history\nToo I mean I heard that sometimes it just happens to some people but the truth of the life\nI used to happen it doesn't any longer\nAnd and the at the gym noticed that would happen to other people who are just you know what you said it doesn't anymore\nYeah I notice it was just happening to me and it happens so much that then it stopped\nI Know and then you don't want to tell anybody 'cause I think you're psychotic they're like oh\nHave you tried to say it's happening it won't so\nThey're like oh I actually you know how to do and don't really I'm Serious I was just wondering if it happens to you too and they're like no I don't have that are there\nAre there other western towns like old western towns that you other than Boulder and and manage the springs at you know are also carry that type of energy and that's really at\nThis point right there oh yeah you know this family hotel right there on that a NATO summit very sacred Native American land anvil they're right there it seems to be a a there's a [noise]\nI heard pilots telling me that if you go up on an airplane and you look down on managing springs and bolder and even as his heart\nWith s that infrared cameras at nighttime that you can see light light up with a red energy I find that very interesting and you know the natives used to call this the sign of the ... the spine of the earth was the Rocky Mountain very sacred land it very very old ancient\nWhy did they call it the spine anything right there in the center of the country\nYeah the center of the ... you know speak they believe was the name of the universe I find that fascinating because maybe it will\nYou know that's what I was going to ask you know why is what we need to get into this this is very funny I Love this hikes peak gets very popular and it has a lot of um a lot of stories around it and I hope that I Know that you've written a lot about this and you can tell us about it\nAnd um we're going to take a break in

T. V. A. T. that are have a I think that's what the native youths used to call it\nBut they literally believe that the mountain was the belly button of the universe I just love that I loved belly buttons anyways but especially the belly button of the universe that's pretty important\nOne why you would call that that's connected to the mother okay yeah\nIt's connected to the mother and think about the native is the way they must of looking at it as being closest to heaven as they can get um father sky Mother Earth ... and so\nThe significance and even even if you look at the mountain it definitely stand out\nFrom the rest of the whole front range it stands out like a sore thumb that and the natives knew that if they are of the significance and we also know that cripple creek is right there on the side of pikes peak and cripple creek as I understand it um during the pikes peak gold fresh\nUh produced more goals than any place in the whole world I Hope I have that right but I'm sure I Do [laughter]\nWell it makes sense because there's a lot of other minerals there as well\nYeah and if you I Love the show ancient aliens and they talked about that that we have a lot of UFO sightings over pikes peak\nAnd I'm a lot of those stories of posts and of course in this region but on the ancient aliens they talk about how perhaps the I'm ancient aliens were attracted to this region because of the rich mineral deposits underneath\nThe mountains here in the Rockies and I find that that is a very good explanation because when I was doing my research especially about UFOs I found that most of the sightings happened over the all metal mining camp\nEspecially cripple creek you know there's a story that happened this would have been Twenty years before the Wright brothers to fly over ... over Kitty Hawk\nHere and cripple creek Colorado they were over five hundred people that saw us so when they were coming out of church on Sunday about noon was cleared daylight\nAnd it was a flight of about seven or eight of them of ships\nAnd they were hovering just about oh a hundred hundred yards by the time it was so close that they could see the windows I mean that that is amazing and they were hollering they weren't flying so the explanation of weather balloons was totally\nBefore there was like yeah it just it just I I find that fascinating because even today if somebody says oh I saw a UFO you can always brushed it off as being an airplane but this was before we had\nOr a governor ... experiment gone exactly\nExactly or even weather balloons wouldn't have behave the way that the the ...\nThe ... up and down sideways hovering you know like a helicopter ... a fascinating and they didn't know what to look they there was no explanation now so what I did was I followed it I followed the sightings throughout the Rockies at the very same time it was fascinating to me this was like an Eighteen fifty nine\nYou would not there weren't a lot of people well yeah\nBut a lot of people saw this I mean just outrageously crazy and\nHe found his story in\nKansas and then came over to Colorado yeah it was amazing\nAnd the story was consistent\nVery much so the way that that that's a very good question right there because that's\nThere was no way that the farmers in Kansas you know back then before we had the worldwide Web could possibly know farmers in Colorado we're seeing that I mean this was amazing back then you know [noise] um well we you know that we've had the telegraph you know\nYou think pikes peak because of its mineral rich content and waters that are that contain a lot of minerals there it's a conduit for a a UFO or extraterrestrial activity yeah\nAbsolutely um I have had the great pleasure of meeting some wonderful people over the years as the director of the paranormal conventions and one of my friends is named Dan Mathias and he lives in green mountain falls Colorado and um which is right underneath pikes peak\nAnd um he saw a big foot at home to his back door opened his door actually um [noise]\nHe um the big foot actually rubbed it's tiny on his screen door and he actually had some big hair [laughter]\nAnd um then has really committed his entire life to the belief in Bigfoot and he believes that his property is on part of a portal and he does live above green mountain falls back in these rock formations and there's Patrick listen the rocks and I've been back there with him and all of this myself\nAnd I believe it's possible you know a lot to be and why not\nWhat have you seen in the writing\nA he believes that my friend he probably if it's um you know it's like stick figures I find this fascinating because they are elongated just a straight line a stick you know with too little like a triangle at the bottom and then a triangle on the top\nAnd then these long arms with triangles on the bottom of it it's very geometric looking it's it's fascinating\nAnd my friend actually believes that his property is a port hole where big foot is traveling ... and I know it might sound outrageous but why not consider the possibility that\nMay be big foot is a missing length maybe\nAnd maybe ... maybe he's coming in and out or maybe we're seeing I'm mainly seen something that happened and another time a long time ago I don't know [laughter]\nWell tell me ... how do you feel that the Native Americans feel about this uh these stories and goes and the legends and so forth that isn't being reported on by Native American\nWell this is great that you brought up this question again to you'd think like a researcher because that's what I mean I'm like well why don't we have more stories and that's because nobody was looking under the right name of course the Native Americans wouldn't have called this creature big foot now would say [laughter]\nI wouldn't have gone Chinese would know that there was a hundred and fifty four different names by the Native American Indians depending on where they lived in the Rockies were they were located a hundred and fifty four different names that's\nWhy we had a communication problem here I mean I can think of a few names right off the hand that I mean\nThat's why I'm doing research on this was so fascinating it open so many doors for me I went oh my gosh now this story makes sense now this story makes sense you know if all of a thing being\nOnce we decide on a name you know sasquatch I think most big foot tall it is like to call it um you know that is just a name that it's been come up with in the last few years I mean relatively speaking maybe fifty years I don't know\nI yeah I I'm but I my question more it's more about the hotter the Native Americans feel and the people feel about these places that are being built on the manager she springs area and garden of the gods and the areas near pikes peak\nWell that is really very interesting and the other good question because the the the legend is that our town is constantly flooded baptized by water every seven years and so it seems to be true now I looked into this and I'm like going All right well ones\nFatality motorcycle accident with Zach Kelly in that accident\nInvestigation is still
