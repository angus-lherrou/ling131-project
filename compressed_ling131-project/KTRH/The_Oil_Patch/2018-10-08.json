parkway taking at the center related with about ten minutes lanes and stopping traffic from edge broke he's\nSo this is what happens when basins mature and the oil and gas industry the big companies that have produced all these wells and in late all this production work for all these years as the production declines they decide well okay this is among core asset and we're gonna\nGo ahead and do the best that and so they sell it\nAt a company like your core comes here which is a huge company of course like a forty billion dollar company ... it's not so little mom and pop operation they come in and what they're doing is they're going to him and stimulating these wells and re completing a lot of oil\nAnd dramatically increasing the production from him so so they're able to come in and that's a a focal part of their business where it's not for Congo Philips are afraid Ken\nAnd so what's going to happen for Mexico is you're going to get a lot more natural gas production and collect a lot more taxes on it and a lot more world\nAnd that's all going to go into the school systems in the hospital systems are going to benefit the whole state so it's it's a part of the industry\nThat we don't talk about a law because there's not there's not a shale play up there there's there is a shale formation\nOf the Pennsylvania formation there has been real productive and so it's not a hot spot [noise] uh but it's still a really vital part of the oil and gas industry and\nAnd and people don't we\nIt is now just because of huge boom going west Texas but ... years ago that's exactly what was happening in the Permian Basin it was a mature dying base or all these companies were just going in their\nRe completing wells trying to make you know get as much additional production now the existing wells was good\nAnd so yeah there we were able to produce off for ... for me in the center of the universe and the oil industry but two years ago it was worth of Salem basis as today so I just like it's a really interesting story because I'm kind of again about the oil and gas industry to hold out hope our listeners like it's interesting as well\nYou're not a good game that you're in there but I guess we see what will happen in the future with Permian an equal for it last question white cat President Trump announced on Monday he finally reached an agreement with Canada's prime minister Trudeau about death finally now we have Mexico and Canada Day\nA new trade deals which it no longer called NAFTA tell me about it with the oil and gas industry ... what do you think yeah\nSo I mean and it's wonderful thing or a candidate held out until like thirty minutes before everything was going too far and\nYeah kind of get in line right you know and then the\nTerrorists were going to kick in and do all industry was panicking because you know there was probably going to be tariffs on imports should exports of oil and gas between these three countries and um and at the last minute you know Canada armored decided well we better joined history just going to really really bad for everybody and they did and uh\nThe industries very excited about it and happy about it because what it means is\nThere is not going to be terrorists on energy exports between these three countries are [noise] people don't realize but we have a lot of a circle natural gas lines going into Mexico and supplying natural gas to Mexico we both export natural gas and oil to Canada in import\nOil and natural gas from Canada and so if you had tariffs going in on all these transactions it would've been a big they get a lot of companies and the oil and gas industry um and so basically what the new bill does is preserved\nA status quo or were terrorists are concerned on energy\nAnd doesn't put any new restrictions on capital investment between these three countries were energy is concerned or anything you know and and so the industries very excited about the new deal just because it doesn't change anything what your status quo as good\nA good feeling gas right like a topsy turvy well that is all the time we have for this show but I'm really excited to announce you're going to join me

listening to end the oil patch radio show our guest today is Bob Peterson who is managing director for a B L and Bob before the break we were talking about all of the Permian Basin strategies for independence to look at it of course ACL is an expert in this area\nAnd you recently um released a report ACL discussing some of the complexities that these shell independents are going to be dealing with and opportunities for them to think big term so let's get into some of those complexities when when you say that they're going to need to think things differently and go into a little bit more detail for me\nYeah and I think it really is the name of the bag meant independence characterize is there a\nTraditional way of approaching business um that can be independence historically have tended to be very competitive with one another as a group um\nThey have tended to\nWant to control all of the various assets infrastructure related to production to provide them a security or what's called the right to operate and so we think we believe very strongly Permian um skills up\nAnd become ... um you know I commend is logistics exercise independence will will need to find a way\nTo uh act last\nI'm kind of ... and collaborate cooperate in areas where\nThere is really no competitive advantage that by doing so they can lower their Koch attract\nOther sources of capital and I'm executed or will the third of all the plans ... so so what do I mean it's just ugly\nUm if you look at a wonder she'll power generation Armenian I'm On the Delaware and to a lesser extent middling basin is partially developed area um as\nAs lecturing scales up\nTo me what to believe the producers will need a gigawatts of power which currently do not exist in order to a a power ... weeks\nOf production equipment Pam to run a gas plant separate oil in liquid [noise] um and uh and natural gas\nOut perfect area or a collaboration across producers in order to aggregate demand\nTo attract capital from a infrastructure sources\nAnd I'm no benefit by I'm providing lower cost gas doesn't include to generate power\nAnd receiving maybe power at a discount costs the uh um whoever might put together of our project and then also a shell excess power into the Texas grid that's quite a different deal\nThan a independents are passed them to get to a working so collaborating it man or a judge these media aggregating demand\nBringing in other parties for budget climate actually not necessarily\nA new a new idea but then I'm not controlling the um [noise] ah the infrastructure so there's opportunities power is one I think a similarly\nWater will become a big issue in the uh the arid Permian Basin as the growing skills up\nAnd I'm so collectively there isn't the best interest of the producers to on projects to aggregate water demand for fracking or retreat meant\nAnd a horn suppose all then you know there's a other areas within the infrastructure I'm Chana management talking talking on the issue the wall Street Journal estimated\nIn recent article that I'm there will be as many as a hundred hundred and twenty thousand truckloads of sand water and oil every day in the Permian when it reaches its peak\nSo clearly that's well beyond the capacity of the road system [noise] show opportunities to um\nThe road system in the structure but our collaborators in terms of a a
