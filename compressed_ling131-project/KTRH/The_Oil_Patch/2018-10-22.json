video conference with patients out of town and you may not need to come\nTo used in so give us a call contact Teresa in our office\nAnd we'd be happy to help you out Dr Joe ... dot com [noise] All right this part of the program we are going to talk about some things that are in the news that you need to\nBe aware of you may have seen an article and you're wondering is that any good is that worthwhile should I forwarded this\nArticle to my Twitter feed and I try to pick out some really key articles that or a most widely applicable to everybody that listens to your health first All right so the first article in and let me back up and say this past week\nWe saw a patient that may have\nDrug uh\nThis is supplement related liver injury\nSupplement related injury and so the article talks about dietary supplements and how incredibly uncontrolled they are meaning nobody really is checking to see what is in these products and there's all sorts of crap that's in these products\n[noise] and while these dietary supplements are promising money back guaranteed to make you skinnier to look better more energy make your muscles bigger\nThe one thing they're not saying is that they're not safe\nNow many of these products contain unapproved on regulated pharmaceutical the active ingredients other drugs so these over the counter\nSupplements that you buy may have pharmaceutical grade drugs in them that is not listed on the bottle\nWe have grown accustomed jak the labels lip read the labels and you'll know where you're getting well yeah you read the label and say look there's nothing in here to organic it's natural but\nWhat we are saying what the FDA is saying is that there are a lot of funny things in these products that are not listed so this past friday\n... network open Journal of the American Medical Association published an off an article that basically says there are serious public health concerns out there so for all of you listening to you yourself using supplements or do you have somebody in your family or friend or a coworker\nNow in particular the ones that they found from two thousand seven to Seventeen there were seven hundred and Seventy six products different products it's a loss marketed as dietary supplements containing hidden active ingredients that are ...\nAnd save for ... studied among them\nIs a\nAnti depressant which has previously been taken off the market which was marketed at that time to manage premature jak elation and men\nAnother one was a weight loss supplement a drug ... taken off the market because there was not safe but it showing up in these supplements\nAnd imagine if you had a heart problem if you had some diabetes or kidney or liver problem and you're taking this supplement\nIt is not good to thirty five billion dollar industry big business\nAnd a fifth of the products have one or more on approved ingredients so buyer be where do not take these things\nAre another article ... section rates have nearly doubled worldwide since two thousand the number of women delivering babies virus the Syrian section has nearly doubled worldwide since two thousand to about Twenty one percent new research has shown now\nWhat is medically necessary part of the experts is about ten Fifteen Percent\nC section rate\nAnd the largest increase in C section rate is mostly in Richard settings for non medical purposes so it's not medically indicated the child is not at risk the mother is not at risk\nWhat the article was saying that women are doing it so that they could plan their pregnancy on a particular day and they have to skip the pain and uncertainty\nOf labor so be careful with vast C sections are going up a alright\nAnother one according to the Centers for Disease Control more children aren't receiving vaccines for from their doctors\nAnd this is an ongoing battle between vaccinating our children and typically the argument has to do with autism\nAnd the article says a small but growing population of children are not getting vaccinated according to federal health data\nWhile most children are receiving recommended immunizations the number of children who aren't being vaccinated by twenty four months has been gradually increasing\nA report released this past Thursday by the Centers for Disease Control and prevention now part of it is uninsured and Medicaid insured children are less likely to be vaccinated according to two thousand Seventeen survey\n\nSince two thousand one percent of unvaccinated babies and toddlers and and toddlers quadrupled to about one point three percent in two thousand five\nNow the sobering part here is that health officials warn that avoiding vaccines could ... could trigger disease outbreaks diseases that had been cured through vaccinations are now coming back\nThe one that we see most often is measles\nWhich can be tied to children not receiving the measles vaccine and so for the last ten Fifteen Years there's been this back and forth article about don't vaccinate your kids your poisoning 'em and giving them autism or risk of autism\nNumerous numerous studies have been shown that it is not the case\n[noise] All right let's uh we will close out this segment on an obesity related story and so so much of what we talk about is obesity fatty liver related to obesity heart disease related to obesity\nKidney disease related to obesity hypertension stroke related to obesity\nAnd now this is a new study from Journal of the American Medical Association oncology looking at obesity being tied to colon cancer risk in young women\nSo we do know that obesity is linked to Thirteen different cancers but obesity is linked to an increased risk of colon cancer in young women this new research has studied\nColorectal cancer rates have been increasing in people under fifty we talked about this a few months ago while declining in older people\nNobody knows why but there is a whisper that it's related to try to obesity\nAnd observation of study published in ... research is perfect or prospectively tracked eighty five thousand women for twenty two years beginning when they were twenty five to forty two years old they found a hundred and fourteen cases of colon cancer in women under forty five\nNow this means that two thirds of us oil production is coming from shale formations\nThat's huge let's talk about this incredible development\nYeah you know what it is incredible it's a decade ago ten years ago a you had a few hundred thousand barrels a day or being produced from the upper ... and that was the ... oil producing\nShale formation in the United states of America and being cut you off drilled the initial good oil into the eagle Ford shale in South Texas in October ... years ago we'll talk about that later on\nA and since that time in a decade we've gone from almost no production from shale\nInterject brutal to closing in on eight million barrels a day two thirds of the country's production or in a decade and just put the ... that's a little research\nSome point seven one today the United states is the largest producer of the earth where we're reducing moral delving Russia or Saudi Arabia but just our shale production of low crude or would make is the third largest oil producing country on the face severe such moral\nThat is produced by Iraq or Iran or China or any other country other than Saudi Arabia Russia it's all coming from the shale formations that we're producing nothing ten years ago so\nIt's it's an extraordinary it's an amazing story of tech technology a horizontal drilling in ... fracturing and wearing those two technologies up and finding the best way to access as much of the Rockies you possibly can going from ... you know\nQuarter mile long horizontal ladder roles in these horizontal wells Chanel horizontal ladder roles that are three miles long and so these formations\nAnd even longer um [noise]\nIt's just a it's it's an amazing amazing story of innovation are a lot of very smart people in the oil and gas industry and uh the department of all this technology that it's just something that you can only do in America\nA because other countries won't allow companies to go in and do I mean we're still uh have you know there there's a shale play in England that uh the government will let anybody access China as you know who knows how much a show Roscoe under under the ground in China\nIt's a fairly close country still and nobody is able to get in there really access to the south America and Africa they're show plays all over the world just in the United states but because of the nature of our society and our government where the country's showing everybody else in the face of the earth how to do it\nAnd let's back up a little bit also because I think it's important for us to remember this wasn't the case now up we talked about that just technology that's coming online and it's finally here which is awesome\nBut there was also a period of time in the seventies in which\nWe found ourselves in a very uncomfortable situation and and the United states was really and we had we had been for quite some time to Pentagon other countries like Saudi Arabia for our oil resources to take me back just go back to that period of time and just kind of discuss\nWhat happened and what was the negative outcomes for us when we are not produced in our own oil to shell productions and other forms as such as offshore is well let's go back in time\nOne of my favorite anecdotes about the oil and gas industry is in Nineteen Seventy so\nOur country was importing one third of the oil we needed to uh\nTo feed our national economy that we use every day one third thirty three percent it President Jimmy Carter declared that to be a national emergency\nInput and price controls and all sorts of crazy big government measures that said only served to make things worse [noise]\nBut then you can fast forward to two thousand six and we were importing two thirds of our daily oil usage in two thousand and six almost almost Seventy percent for a couple of months there and nobody thought twice about it\nOkay and then the government at the time you know the Congress was very much against to encouraging all production in low President Bush wanted to [noise]\nUm but that was before we figured out how to get oil out of the show for the day\nWe're we're importing less than twenty five percent of what we need or a daily basis\nSo and that's thanks to the ability to produce it all oh from Michelle place and so it's been an amazing transition it's only going to get back I mean oh yeah production this week uh from from the CIA that are here by twenty twenty or twenty twenty on\nWe're going to be producing another three million barrels a day from shale formation trail because we're going to be over ten million barrels a day\nFrom shale formations low in the United states and so that that the ... when you see what's happening in Saudi Arabia in some of these are countries\nThat are big oil producers around as usual produce you see what's happening over there and how stable at his\nLast year like we are on that part of the world and other parts of the world for our daily needs the better off in more secure we are as a country\nCouldn't agree with you more I think it also has a lot to do with when you look at why we look at the middle east and of course these are countries that are provided\nUm these resources and they're just always seems to be a lot of conflict and then all of these spills over into the U.S as well and we get involved in it rather we want to or not and um I think this is another opportunity for us to look and\nAnd maybe not have so much\nInvestment out there and and and look to our own resources as well and\nNow we are going to take a quick break but when we return scene and we're speaking about how many barrels tomorrow we're putting out shell place\nThere's also been a lot of fluctuation once again and the price of of course oil so I Want to get back on that topic again but we do have to take a quick break you were in listening to an oil patch radio show and we'll be right back
