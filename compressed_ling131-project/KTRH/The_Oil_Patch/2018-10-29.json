intend to use a three way in bounded Allentown Sheldon that construction projects slowing down for about ten minutes in both directions\nTo that level but then all this uncertainty about one of the big factors that's going on right now uh is is uncertainty about what's happening with China's economy [noise] there is a growing I say conventional mindset among economists that economic growth in China\nIs the the rate of increase the slowing down you know it's no longer growing seven or eight percent it's growing more like four or five percent like our economy and and so when\nYou know economic growth drives demand for crude oil\nAnd if the first of this year to me you know how to nations the international Energy Agency [noise] you know they they do a projection for what global crude demand is going to be\nA the growth and crude demand will be in the coming here and they said okay it's going to be about one point two million barrels a day you know year over year so at the end of this year [noise] they projected that crude demand would be one point two million barrels higher\nThan what it was at the end of last year and then we got to pay an economic growth was really\nStronger than they are because if you remember we had four percent growth here the United states and the second quarter which is very hard compared to last eight or ten years and um and so they revise that up at one point four million\nOr so they thought OK economic growth a stronger so we're going to say we're going to have more demand for crude well\nA couple of weeks ago they said okay you know maybe it's not that much stronger and looks like China slowing down so we're going to take the projection debate back down to one point two million and go back does their own projections\nOr the U.S energy information administration does projections like that and so you know everybody's going up and down on those and it's all because\nIt's just based on what what is happening with economic growth\nMainly in China but also in India Indonesia sugary Graham country I'm In here in the u._s.\nRight and and you know David it's so important because I don't think that we um who are outside of oil and gas I mean if you're inside oil and gas you know you kind of get this outside I don't think a lot of people really understand that\nIt isn't just affecting if where fracking here we're doing hydraulic fracturing we're doing we're we're exporting were importing these are world commodities and and what's going on around the globe affects prices here too\nAnd and then it's also regulation too because when you were talking about how we're paying a lower price here in Texas well uh it's so strange you say that 'cause my son actually who lives in Las Vegas sent me a snapshot of the prices over there in California\nUh their their pain at the ... you know at five oh five a gallon which we would probably just you know blow up a\nGaffe get if we were paying that kind of amount um per gallon but there's things regulation that matter and so this is why I think that you know when we talk about on our show\nHow oil prices um how good they are and how they affect us as as an everyday you know we'd rather it's economically rather it's pertain to your job these things matter and oil and what's happening in the market does matter and we need or the other hand it as well\nAnd you know the reality is in California they want their government as as intentionally develop those are as you say regulations rather in and that is an intentional effort\nIn the state of California to make\nGasoline more expensive to consumers ordered wrote to promote the adoption of electric vehicles and there were new field so uh so that's a conscious decision California state government is late in the you know our our government here in Texas has made different decisions\nVery interesting well you know we also have um a commissioner Ryan sent and has gone into partnership with an oil patch radio show and he produced is every day\nThese segments called the uh and the patch energy minutes with commissioner Ryan sitting which of course we now is one of the three Texas

H. dot com Sally Adams on Houston's news weather and traffic station news radio seven forty Katie our age\n[noise]\n\nAnd we're back our guest today is a black man our resident energy expert an editor shall magazine in ... and before the break we were talking about our our energy minutes that we produce for at in ... in partnership with commissioner Ryan ... at the Texas railroad commission\nAnd energy man and he discussed also that there's been we've seen a rice and natural gas prices um and so I kinda wanna get into the price increase on natural gas and how that's affecting impact cats\nYeah so Cory process going down that the gas prices going up you know they're they're not and she used to years ago Dametra gas price was actually tied to the full price and they would rise as all went up and down it was all\nBut that was more Twenty years ago and of course that was completely separate markets and uh\nThe natural gas price uh yeah this week over it in the low ... you know between three twenty three twenty five an emcee of which you know we're spotlight [noise] a lot to\nMe it's not great for gas producers are truly go for natural gas consumers and our electricity bills here in Texas and other states they use a lot of natural gas power generation but I have gone up\nA over the summer or the natural gas prices down around to sixty two Seventy than a Monday teens and ... street twenty three and three twenty five so it's gone up more than twenty percent here over the last couple of months\nAs we're getting ready to go into the winter season and and there's you know it it's an interesting way this market works for natural gas in the winter we use a lot more natural gas that we produce\nAnd in the summer months we produce a lot more get natural gas that we use in this country and then in the spring and fall is what's called the shoulder months when we are building storage for natural gas and so um [noise]\nNatural gas storage right now is lower than it has been in many years um then the levels of\nOf of\nNatural gas in in our various storage areas around the country is not nearly as high as what's been the last five years and so there is a lot of big fear but some concern\nThat if you have an unusually cold winter this year you could end up with some spot shortages of natural gas in certain parts of the country particularly in New England where um they have a hard time getting part large battle to take it to the New England states [noise] and uh so that's why the natural gas prices have gone up you know it\nIt's I mean I haven't gone up a lot our electricity bills here in Texas are still going to be amazingly low compared to the rest of the country but it has increased a little bit and and made things a little better for the producers who have been you know struggling with very low prices for their commodity for a long time\nAnd if we do have a very cold winter and they do have shortages I sure would not want to be them and looking at but their utility bills are going to be for my gosh [laughter] no I was in Baton\nRouge ah yesterday giving a presentation on that subject came up you know ah in January of December and January\nAh electricity bills in New England a rate payers will probably in about four times as much for their natural gas as we had to pay for it here in Texas over the winter and they were even importing natural gas from Russia\nEven though we we are flooded with natural gas in this country because they can't get hotlines bill from the Marcellus Shale through the state of New York\nGet natural gas to their state utilities in Massachusetts Connecticut than the other uh New England states their their electricity bills went through the roof over the winter and then go you know it's just a problem with them so they have another very cold water they're going to be paying really really high electricity process yeah\nYeah well you know like a Brock Obama likes to say is margins mattered have consequences [laughter]\nThey do and you know more of Andrew Cuomo the governor up there is the main problem with all of it he got just got re elected yeah he's just about to get reelected\nSo setting like spending more money than they have to you know I thought you said that if things regulations into getting a little bit and talk about um\nYou know to the point in in a commissioner sentence energy minutes with how all these things matter and of course then looking at these global issues so the issue with Iran which are getting ready to get on that topic\nWell I you know and and yes global demand for all is continuing to increase its coming increase somewhere around one point to one point four million barrels a day this year where now in a hundred million\nBarrel a day may end market globally for the first time we're in a global demand has over a hundred million barrels a day\nIn the United states we produce about eleven million barrels state so we produce where the biggest producer on her or between the United States Russia in Saudi Arabia we produce a little over thirty percent of the the world's crude all and then the rest of it's produced and other parts of other
