David for joining us for this week's business spotlight now it's time to bring on our resident energy expert an editor I shall magazine gave a black man David welcome to the show\nHey it's another beautiful day into\nRain rain rain rain rain yes beautiful day everything is so green isn't it it's so wonderful yes I Want to jump into the show because obviously we have a lot to talk about let's start with the price per barrel is it going where is it going 'cause it's it's up a little bit again\nUm and so we're hearing again media reports it's going up to a hundred dollars a barrel and you and I sit here and like an hour now now now tell tell me a thought\nWell it it it did jump above aged Seventy five a this week which is quicker than I thought it would get there are a bit and saying oh Europe thought it would get there\nFor west Texas intermediate us crush or by the end of the sheer well here we are in October to Seventy five dollars and that that mainly the market overreacting to the ... version of\nSanctions or by the United states against Iran and they're seeing you know oh my gosh China's going to stop importing oil from Iran and all these companies are going to quit doing business with Iran\nYeah because they don't want to get hit with sanctions from the United states so Iranian exports you're going to drop\nAnd the market has markets tend to do nationally reacts to that so the price jumped up three or four dollars a barrel and just a few days well but sooner or later what happens is the market calms down and\nThey decide well okay we're at this level let's keep it at this level and wait and see if Saudi Arabia and Russia\nAre two countries with a tremendous amount of excess producing capacity let's see if they follow up on what they said they're going to do and that is increase their own production to make up the difference right [noise]\nAnd I suspect we're going to see the smoke is Saudi Arabia in Russia are going to help that they're increasing their production to fill the void thats being left a by the Iranian oil that's coming off the market now\nAnd the effect that will have is to hold the price steady or it might even go down a little bit in the near term and uh\n[noise] but I think so I still think overall between now and the end of the year the the [noise]\nThe inertia behind all prices is going to be behind the slowly rising oil prices are just because the markets ballots [noise] and um you know other than the United states [noise] unless\nSaudi Arabia Russia do jump in and they raised their production the United states is really the only country that is significantly increasing production every month\nSo you end up with a with a market situation that just adds ... slowly rising all Russia's between now\nJanuary and then question in January because well what the us producers do them and what does OPEC do when they re set the terms of their export agreement with Russia January\nAnd okay so let's switch gears a little bit and move over to New Mexico you know that it's becoming a trend that pick publicly traded companies are leaving the base and and private companies are coming in to take their place and I'm curious why is this happening\nYou know it's also the really interesting phenomena not find it interesting 'cause I worked for many years for for Burlington Resources which is a\nA big producer of the biggest British ... for Twenty years a calico Philips about all those assets in two thousand and six and what happened last year a mid year last year they sold all those assets\nAre ... corporate privately held company here in Texas\nA M Cana ah there'll be a earlier\nThis year did the same thing you know sold to a private company and can I just did the same thing and so what's happening\nIn that race up there in the northwest corner of the state\nIs that it's a very mature based and then it's mainly natural gas production there are so huge coal scene called the fruit and coal formations that produce ... most of it in recent years but there's been natural gas production the English Channel on base and going all the way back to the Nineteen twenties\nWell David we do have to take a

[laughter] how about ...\n... ...\n... well we'll let let me ask another question then so why is the EPA restricting the sail up this Fifteen for eight months old print there and why are they in some parts of the country [laughter] that's\nRight it's a little while or the termination deeply I made earlier on the list is there anything are going to shift uh FA blended in gas wage during the summer books when you have these are those people have she live live in big cities\nThat have been developed during summer looks right they decided that any blend above to pursue a essay can help actually cause more Hayes where the deadly ...\nAnd so for those much which is about the middle of may through the middle of September they actually do the while they'll face to blend he Fifteen gr those much of the year because of that and then there's some parts of the country where they don't allow the sale of it all in Los Angeles and\nOther uh big cities where you had a real big logging problems if you're not either really allowed to show on in those those community so [laughter] so that's why the restriction has been there the president is just now say okay it's just not a big problem either way\nYeah and the EPA frankly has advised not a big problem with it either way you do you're going to rewrite those regulations but again to be clear when you go to your gas station you gotta ... says he Fifteen or you're not required to buy you don't have that he and and be there\nAnd read better ... than it is not going to damage your vehicle as well we got that\nWe come back I wanted to get on the topic I Want to sound I'm just hoping to find out are there any gasoline said actually don't have ethanol but we do have it\nTake a quick break here listening to an off ... must be right back [noise]\nWhat's your sins known for a barbecue day day why NASA rodeo medical center out can well the floods in hurricane and we're known as the point to go to the preparing for floods in hurricane or whether turn on the radio news radio seven point\nMaybe our age have trouble doing yes that being well now benefit you let me tell you how there is a new app it's called the get upside app\nGet upset you can download it from the app store or the Google Play store to free up easy to use I use it this weekend I figured it out you can't do\nIt gives you up to twenty five cents per gallon cash back every time you\nFill up for gas you turn the cap on it shows you nearby gas stations and it shows you the discount per gallon of gas at each station it's easy to use open the app choose the gas station with the offer you want to claim upload your receipt and you get cash back you get it back quickly within twenty four hours using pay pal or you can request to check in the mail or if you're like me you're just going to let that baby right so Christmas Time and then\nYou get a little extra scratch in time for Christmas and you can use it on top of the world to programs here's where the incomes and download the free get upset at a news promote coding D.
