this segment will be a little bit different I can assure you\nOr I count myself as as someone who needs a little jumpstart in the morning and get myself to the office without falling asleep at the wheel but my first stop here is pretty much always the kitchen to build a pot of coffee to tell you all and me why why that is a genius idea on my part oh welcome Nell\nAreas Andrew cells buried to the show Andrews a cofounder of purity coffee makes a strong case in favor of strong coffee welcome aboard Andrew\nThanks very much appreciate it get give us a quick story on how and why purity coffee came to be\nUm I'll give you the show but the story hum it was a a few years ago just over three years ago with my wife was having some health issues um low energy we couldn't figure out what it was at the time\nUh Bush is doing is she was drinking a lot of coffee like most of us do I'm going to need a bit of energy\nAnd as you can probably ... uh\nThe drink a little bit of what I was doing was was back\nSo I saw you know maybe one foot on the accelerator why put on the brake and drink and just watch coffee combee good so um I was introduced a tree professors at the Institute of coffee studies and found a bill university\nAnd what they told me was just amazing which is that there's a huge gap between what science knows and the general public knows about the health benefits of coffee\nSo that sort of started me down upon initially trying to find the very best coffee for my wife and then afterwards realizing what he was focusing every decision based on health and so we started working with\nThe University of Brazil and some of the leading cause I'm just looking at every step of the production chain saying what can we do differently would just making a decision based on how\nSo the the low hanging fruit on copies benefit is is it the caffeine helps us get our brains into gear right but is there is there such a thing as you found out now as too much coffee in the morning\nWell the interesting thing what you said there is that the caffeine is\nOnly a small part of what coffee is made up of this one's a constituency and coffee\nAnd the biggest constituent off from caffeine is a thing called courage and the gas is ... and what that is a horrible sounding name but it's a it's an antioxidant and that's the reason why most of the health benefits are coming from the antioxidants and coffee\nAnd not from the caffeine caffeine gives you that short joke we'll we'll like hum among some health benefits come from the ...\nWhat's good to have all of that in there then what about a ... back to that question I'm trying to pinpoint here how much is too much coffee or is there such a thing\nThat there is there is such a thing but it's really watching your body goes down to the caffeine parts of it is that\nWe we we metabolize caffeine in different ways I'm a foster metabolize caffeine and I could have doubled expressive before I go to sleep when I'm fine other people have a copy of twelve o'clock and staying up all night so it's really watching your body and it's all about the caffeine that you'll sensitive to but but when it comes to\nA daycare or just a country that's a very low and caffeine\nUm the mole the best of it is actually dose dependent so if you're drinking a caffeinated coffee you know you you have to what you buddy\nHow much caffeine content is there in in eight ounce cups and I'm guessing it varies widely from Brando Brandon right\nIt doesn't actually surprised home they have all the things about things like the opposite ends very cynical widely from from ... from this one type of coffee coffee called ... which is a lower end of the coffee chain\nUm that's high rent and ah and caffeine but apart from that but we're in a sort of ten to Fifteen Percent range\nOkay and that's why a cup of coffee may taste different but as far as the the jolt you're going to get from is probably going to be about the same unless you're again going to like a double espresso or something\nYeah so a lot of this as well what people say especially the churches and a sort of nervousness and that's the thing is not necessarily being over cap and they often the case of just the fact those poor quality coffee time with some of those those problems\nYeah that's that's very interesting take on that because everybody always assume just the caffeine now I read in the material Andrew that the coffee also can reduce the risk of some pretty serious disease is talking about that for a minute\nAbsolutely and that that sort of a ... most people are not aware of is the companies that number one source of antioxidants in the American diet I Want to not talk to the dogs that reduces information and the body so there's been some very very large studies done on coffee and health and the one in particular which is one million one hundred nine thousand people\nFollowed over Thirty years and it showing the benefits school reduction a type two diabetes by Ron forty to forty five percent one drink three to five cups of coffee a day which is\nYou know which is shocking given the fact that those you know eighty one million people pre diabetic and the U.S should be something more people are aware of\nYou you mentioned that you and your wife amber had gone to this Vanderbilt University Institute of coffee studies I wouldn't even believe that was a real thing if I well I I ... I Want to hear more about that how long has that been around and what what did they study there\nSo that they study the cultural effects of coffee primarily but they've done some work on the health benefits as well and that's where I was introduced to out on a from ... from Brazil\nUm what they're really trying to do is understand the cultural impacts a coffee production I'm particularly in Latin America as they do a lot of work with smoke from those hum in Latin America to understand how a middle man is really affecting the ability for those small farmers to get a living wage", "show_name": "Fifty +", "year": "2018", "city": "Houston", "day": "21"}
