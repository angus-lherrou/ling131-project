mind on this ... is a piece you wrote called when the truth does it matter anymore what'd you think of the way Kevin O's nomination hearings unfolded\nUh you got three days I don't know I'm I'm a I'm outraged\nI'm offended I that many different levels at the end of woman as an as an attorney and a conservative as a woman at thirty seven years as a Democrat and then they started Jason he doesn't think the kind of Republican\nThough believe me I'm I I I I understand that not I wasn't born in the Republican oh I had to be pushed there by the end of the the Democratic Party and so that it gives you some idea\nOf how I feel about what's happening now with his nomination pot that than I Do truly believe it had absolutely nothing when judge Kavanaugh it how do you have to give it to have an um but it really is the ... the attack\nOn Donald Trump and on the fact that sets Kavanaugh is going to be and I believe he will be confirmed but that is going to a conservative voice on the court\nUm and if they were honest not\nThe senators who are hurting him if they come out and they said they don't like you're either an abortion about executive power fine I'd say okay well you're in the

anticipating at the time it's going to hurt if beautiful state of ... than\nAfter all stair things yeah oh I\nSee what they have done and how they had tried to you know I never used the word I hate to use the word that kind of like what that Clarence Thomas talked about twenty some years ago the high tech lynching and that being the national attack on a man not because of his his um quality\nIs inherent quality is ensuring\nThat because of his condition any votes\nAnd also one other thing is the me too movement on steroids um it is the me too movement run amok it me too movement weapon I

hide from an opportunity to truly served this country on both sides of the all that's going to happen right\nOh absolutely the politics of personal destruction and again\nWe see that unfortunately at it more often come from the left and I hate saying that because I was I I mean I was never um I was never a liberal I was always a very very social conservative even when I was a Democrat\nBut there's some things so disgusting about the way that the conservative has the right has left rather um how liberal have tried to attack a human being\nAt the tender heart and that is their reputation um\nAnd they also had no concern for the collateral damage that they're doing to his wife the capping off white hits little girls\nAnd and she'll the man who has done nothing but then in his life dealing with when they're feeling when coaching girls\nOn his daughters I think it's the soccer team I'm making sure that we had a majority now law clerk for the group judge and this is a guy who had\nI forget how

you know might have taken a class\nWith him he's he's lemon knew him moving at the\nTime that I'm Christine Blasey Ford alleges that she was assaulted and you know what I'm not treading with um you know I'm not gonna treat doctor for like ... either all of these people if they only need to treat her workers back then and now she was credible and her colleagues\nShe wasn't credible she wasn't compelling and I'm not going to treat someone with with kid gloves that but the metaphor I was trying to\nUm who is being used and who is allowing herself to be used to destroy somebody up look at these allegations duck\nThirty six years later not one eye witness who's willing to say yes it happened she didn't venture to anyone in two thousand twelve and oh yeah she mentioned it to a therapist
