mean some of these studies you sent me are absolutely incredible\nAs you know I'm very into neutral picks the anti aging community has taken a keen interest in Korea teen specifically the cognitive benefits of Korea Team\nOh absolutely this is one of those areas where Korea Team really shy and see what we need to understand is that your brain even though it's only two percent of your body's weight it utilizes twenty\nPercent of your body is energy this is a very thirsty Oregon for energy and just like your muscles soak up decree it seemed like a sponge because this is a naturally occurring molecule in the body it passes right through the blood brain barrier your brain or an soak it up like a sponge and it increases your Korea teen phosphate\nReserves in your brain so now in your brain you have more readily available resources to do was to recharge those neuronal batteries to make more energy inside the brain so basically what do you notice well your memory is supported and pet scientists have done\nSome amazing research here they found the people that take Korea teen it supports their memory it actually helps the brain to utilize\nOxygen better it supports memory and people that are sleep deprived it's been shown to help people add numbers quicker and for longer periods of time without mental fatigue get this study pet just five\nDays five days of eight grams of creativity and supported mental tasks in subjects that we're getting rapid fire question scientists were asking him math\nQuestions in science questions over and over and over and they found the folks on creating didn't fatigues quickly mentally so this is amazing stuff it's like a turbo booster for your brain it's like a super charge you for your muscles that recharge is all your cellular battery so all of your cells tissues and organs have more readily available energy\nOr dark I loved that ever strong appeals to athletes and people want to get more reps in the gym maybe get some extra power in their workouts but you're also saying there's a big push nutritional community to encourage people in their forties fifties sixties seventies and even eighties to leverage the power of Korea Team to stay fit strong and healthy if I just say\nKorea Tina's going mainstream you know I share the story with you before my mom who's in her late seventies now she's taking creating she works out a couple of days a week three days a week she goes to novelist does the free weights because she's got osteoporosis she wants to maintain her muscle mass and she wants to make her bones stronger and as you pointed out Korea teen helps to do that\nAnd then the other three days during the week she'll go and she'll swim now she's not trying to get bigger stronger or anything like that but even at her age Korea teen has benefits\nOh yeah and what blows me away about that story 'cause you told me before is that her medical doctor recommended routine for and that just goes to show\nHow much more mainstream this is it's called every strong and it supports the muscles that supports your power your strengths your speed if you're an athlete you're certainly going to love it but even if you're not an athlete you notice the difference let's go to another study one more review study this out of the journal\nCurrent aging science December of two thousand thirty and I thought this was very cool cause the researchers looked at the body of research out there on creating and seniors without exercise they want to see what happens when seniors take Korea teen and they don't\nExercise so I'm quoting here creating supplementation without associated resistance training seems to enhance muscular strength power and endurance increase lean body mass for those that don't know what that is they're talking about muscle and improve the functional capacity\nOf the elderly they go on to talk about how it supports bone health as well and then they finished with this creating supplementation without training in the elderly could potentially delay atrophy of muscle and unproven difference and\nStrength so here again we see bottom line ... is very very effective it's gonna help you to feel stronger whether you exercise or not it supports your strength and power your brain health\nOh no I mean ... when you think about it this almost sounds too good to be true right now you're a person
