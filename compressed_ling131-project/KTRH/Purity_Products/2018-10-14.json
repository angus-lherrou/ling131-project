of clinical studies that just may unlocked the key to helping you get stronger and healthier at any age now Dr ... eleven is a chiropractor a nutritionist spokesperson and\nA longtime advisor for purity products that eleven welcome back to the show\nOh it's great to be here with you today pat and we have a very exciting topic to cover today packed today we're talking about strength and power and how to get it back even if you're in your fifties sixties seventies eighties so if you want to feel better if you want to feel stronger\nIs some very important information we're going to cover today\nYou know this is an exciting topic taught to me about this important message today what molecule are we talking about and how it's impacting the lives of people who follow the science\nRight right right well we're talking about a new supplement it's cold every strong and it features and exciting molecule called Korea Team now pat a lot of our listeners may have heard of ... and I know you've used Korea teen right but for those that don't know about Korea teen it's mainly use\nIn the Olympic circles professional athletes body builders college high school athletes because it does something extraordinary and what I'm about to tell you is proven by hundreds and hundreds of human studies so here's where Korea Team does for us\nIt helps us to get stronger more powerful helps put muscle mass on the body and it helped protect us from losing muscle tissue as\nWe get older we know that's a big part of aging not only that pat great for the brain great for memory and it helps promote bone strength as well so an amazing molecule that everybody needs to know about\nIs an amazing story can you share some of the science and tell us why you're calling Korea teen one of the best kept secrets to healthy aging\nOffshore pat what we need to understand with Korea Team is that it's a natural molecule to the body it's in every single celled tissue Oregon in your system and its\nIn the body is to generate and maintain strength and power that's a reason for being to maintain strength and power it's an every single cylinder body Ninety five percent of it however is in your muscle tissue because that's where we tend to use it the most it powers up the muscles it's good for strong muscle contraction\nAnd it's important help maintain strength and muscle contractions when you're using them over and over again for instance if you're working at the gym if you're playing sports golf tennis anything like that it keeps your muscles\nPowered up in their high energy state\nSo they're strong and ready for action now pat here's the key is is so important for those of us\nSay in our fifties sixties seventies you see we had lots and lots of Korea Team when we were young ... stuff it was coming out of areas we had lots of creating our bodies made a lot of it but as we get older like everything else we don't do that is well we have less Korea Team in our muscles you know the good news is that\nHundreds and hundreds of human studies show that when you supplement with Korea Team\nIt goes to work or go straight to your muscles it's absorbed easily it pumps up at the Korea thing in your muscle tissue and you get stronger you get more powerful not only that it helps or memory and brain health and it helps support the strength of your bones\nYou know we were talking before the show and you were talking about how Elyn pick athletes have been using Korea Team for years to enhance their strength and performance tell me more\nWell this ... is the premier sports nutrition supplement there's no question about that pet you've used at body builders know about it athletes know about Korea Team is the premier\nSports nutrient so you know back twenty twenty five years ago the Olympic athletes and their coach is of course he knew about it they knew what made you bigger and stronger and faster they knew was natural to the body it was supposed to be there but there were a little bit afraid to supplement with it because they were afraid it might be considered cheating that it might be considered too much of an edge\nBut back in Nineteen eighty eight the international Olympic Committee\nThat came out the officially confirmed that I'm quoting here Korea Team can be used by athletes to enhance their performance and now that it's not just for athletes anymore because the studies are clearly showing\nThat for adults for people in their fifties sixties seventies this stuff is amazing and purity has this incredible new formulation\nWe call it ever strong because that's exactly what it does it helps you get stronger and stay stronger with hundreds of human studies to help you and it's the purest form of ... money can buy stuff from Europe this stuff is fantastic\nAnd we should point out that naturally occurring in red meat problem is in order to get the amounts that are going to benefit you you'd have to eat large amounts of red meat in like four pounds of red meat a day most people aren't going to do that right and what about vegetarian they can be creating deficient\nWhen I have a vegetarian that comes in here and their energy efficient they don't feel the way we don't want to feel and I put 'em on average strong\nAnd if it's almost right away because they've been so low on it you know if you're a person out there that staying away from red meat if you're staying away from meat in general and\nYou have more of a vegan style diet this is for you you definitely want to add that ...\nHigh so obviously this works with athletes but you say Korea teen is going mainstream there's a lot of studies are showing the folks in their fifties sixties seventies and beyond that Korea teen can be a cornerstone compound to help people stay strong stay healthy stay sharp stay vital right\nOh exactly I mean this is the ideal muscle enhancing strengthening muscle protecting nutrient for folks as we get older fifty plus there's like you and me patent but let's go to a couple of studies on seniors just to show this we'll do one on the guys and one on the gal so head\nFirst on the guys love the title of this one Korea teen supplementation improves muscular performance in older men study done it several American universities\nA group of men get this at age fifty nine to Seventy two hey you know we know that's not when people are known for getting stronger right right so this was just a one week study people need to understand that that's how effective and rapidly this stuff works with just a one week study get this the guys on Korea Team they put on four pounds\nOf lean mass that's muscle tissue for those that don't know that it shows they built the muscles and they hydrated the muscles nicely they increase the strength of their bench press that's a chest press for people that don't know by seven percent\nThey increased the strength of the leg exercises they were doing by Fifteen Percent pat they could get in and out of a chair more times faster without using their arms on top of that it could generate more power on a stationary bike pet is happening in one week when I think about that yeah it's really quite incredible\nAll right but what about the women out there did they get those kinds of benefits to as well will actually help women in their fifties sixties and seventies get stronger to\nAbs Luke ... let's go straight to another study love the title on this one is well Korea teen supplementation improves muscular performance in older women published in the European Journal of applied physiology thirty women age fifty to Seventy one the course they got either creating a placebo that's\nThe way they do these things again a one week study the women on Korea to increase their bench press by almost four pounds they increase their leg press by over ...\nPounds and they had better balance and agility so fifty to Seventy one year old women not only getting stronger not only getting more powerful getting faster with improved balance pet study after study shows that older folks that use Korea Team\nGet amazing results they get great results if they exercise they get great results even if they don't exercise they can lift more weight\nThey get faster they get stronger they get more powerful they are muscles don't fatigue as fast and get this\nThis is very important especially for the ladies ... you know that when women do resistance training their bones get stronger as well right now get this when you resistance training with Korea Team your bones tend to get stronger even faster so an all around when when", "year": "2018", "show_name": "Purity Products", "city": "Houston", "day": "14"}
