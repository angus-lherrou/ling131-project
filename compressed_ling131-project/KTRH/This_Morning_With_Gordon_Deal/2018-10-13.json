{"month": "10", "state": "TX", "station": "KTRH", "content": "Not I think would be Fifteen twenty percent would be my guest George but important thing to remember is that there are there and they certainly believe that we exist\nAnd so the the old game is is that they don't want us to know that there is there they want us to think that this is our own feelings\nOur own thoughts and some of it is all of the violence author is not caused by demonic spirits and negative spirits are but certainly there are there to amplify and right now everybody's got a target on their back everybody\nHow did they possess how did they take over somebody's body\nThey work on them for on people for a while you can leave these things happen over a period of time people who are depressed people who move into a home\nA and there's a lot of negative emotional energy drugs or something I practice something called modern actresses\nAnd and that is that came out of the idea when I started going into people's homes I I found out many years ago that\n... homes because people have lived in there that generate both positive and negative emotional energy use which are unseen but we feel them and it accumulates in the environment and demonic spirits actually feel stronger and become stronger and these kinds of environments and so do negative spirits\nAnd so they are uh attack people and homes we don't take care of our homes we\nClean them wash windows when you move into a new place the carpets paint everything but we don't clean the atmospheres and so essentially were living in other people's emotional energies and so demonic spirit's just play on that\nAnd they come into the our environments and generate huge amounts of energy that is negative and the air thickens with emotional energy especially negative energy at thickens and so it's easier to transmit negative emotional energy hatred\nThose kinds of negative thoughts and emotional feelings when the air is thick with emotional energy and so I get calls all the time from people who you know say hey I just moved into this new home apartment whatever and it doesn't feel right\nI don't know why but you know the kids are crying the dogs are barking in a certain area\nWe're just getting into more arguments why is this happening and so modern extra citizen deals with the idea of that first the negative emotional energy\nHas to be removed by\nSomebody like me from the atmosphere of the home that makes the spirit weaker than I deal with a negative spirit or that's the second thing that I Do that's modern exercises in different from traditional actresses and in that I don't always go after the spirit first\nSometimes I cleared the atmosphere to make them weaker and then I attack the negative spirits\nAnd you're not you're not you know ... you're not a priest does that affect what you do\nI Would not say that I'm not a free so I Would say that I'm an independent priest say sharman priest exercises\nI don't belong to any particular religion because I work with people from all\nDifferent religions or no religious at all people call me who are agnostic atheist everybody calls me and that's the thing you know you don't have to belong to particular church to call me and a half of your home cleared\nAnd these days I Do it by distance as well because when I was going through homes and doing strictly in person and work for the Internet ever came about um I wasn't touching anything anyways doing personal clarion so it wasn't touching anybody anyway it's really it's not necessary\nThere's no such thing as as a\nDistance on a non physical level it doesn't matter as long as you have focused each one of us is a complete individual and so anybody can be cleared from anywhere if you know how to do it\nAnd it it it has to be done you know we we move into apartments like I said and there's lots of emotional energy from me\nThe people living there for Twenty years forty years a hundred years ending on where people are from around the world it builds up it accumulates and spirits need to be\nDealt with you know times are already in the home sometimes they come into the home they sense of family that's having a problem\nBecause of emotional energy in our living environment and they're ripe for attack and so it it's called maybe a professional habit cleared out one and I then I teach people how to\nMaintain the clarity of their bodies are energy field\nA and also how to maintain the clarity of the living environment so it's kind of like having a carpet cleaner come in first and then you can simply queen her own carpet once that's done\nSo it really is something we all can do to a certain extent and something I think we all should do I'm not going to be around forever and certainly there are great exercises in every religion and not the only one\nA qualified extra assistance just about every religion\nBut they but they don't work for people and other religions I get that all the time you know that people call up and say well I I called you know local parish even though I'm not you know I don't belong that religion I'm not Catholic and they won't come over and help me\nI help everybody so I that's why I don't belong in the religion but I remember doing this kind of work and has lives um I have deep contact with higher spirits\nAre also this universe is filled with stars and around those stars are planets and there are\nThis universe I said before on on one of my parents as the universe is teeming with life you asked me that question\nDid not do you go into these actresses what's a crucifix at all no you don't do that\nNo but when I'm working a with Christians which haunt me all the time I'm even evangelical Christians have you know they need help to
