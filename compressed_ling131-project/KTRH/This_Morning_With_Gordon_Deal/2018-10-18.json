Washington correspondent at USA Today Maureen what's up here\nAnd there are two issues than a direct way that could be a have a say in health care isn't some doubt initiative that we're seeing in Idaho Nebraska and Utah I mean there are some of the state that did not go along with the Affordable care act's expansion of Medicaid and this time um because because the governors and state legislatures there haven't done it\nBut if you're trying to to do it and how they are and they're saying that that did they want their legislatures their their public officials to go along and expanded Medicaid people the way of Obamacare intended\nTo do these state legislatures and those three states think they can handle it\n[noise] well there's a there's some kind of pushback\nFrom officials in some states and one of the interesting thing that's going on is that for example in Utah their ballot initiative include the way to pay for the state's share of expansion of federal government paid him as the costs of the state does have some ... a portion of the ...\nName which was the first state to do this to expand Medicaid true about initiative\nThe government has three she has to go along in part because the funding issues in Utah now they're trying to avoid that additional roadblock by including a finding initiative along with their ... their ballot initiative ...\nSo how similar are the initiative that are going to be on the ballot in ... Idaho Nebraska in Utah\nThat the main thing that the Affordable CARE Act are allowed expansion of Medicaid up to for people earning up to a hundred and thirty eight percent of\nPoverty I'm the one difference there is the ah the tiny now in any kind of go along with that I'm an issue one week and it's still I'm practically and as a nation state that there's a lot of\nPressure from hospitals particularly real hospitals and other medical medical providers and he said that have not expanded Medicaid saying look there's all federal money available that would help us and we're not tapping into it even though ...\nMarsh states are going to find these things and you know across the country [laughter] one argument for why that has happened by mail initiative is there any they're conservative states where it's not politically feasible for the public official Republican public officials to look like they're supporting\nThey for CARE Act but if their voters say we want this then there's a way that they they can do it without having to take direct responsibility for it\nWe're speaking with Maureen ... Washington correspondent at USA Today she's written a piece titled midterms healthcare is the key national issue but the real action may happen at the state level or could this be a trend where state legislatures are addressing this\nPotentially they're Seventeen states that have not expanded Medicaid and I'm a Republican\nWho worked on health care issues for a number of years on on the hill and he said a forum with health care reporters that he thinks if these initiatives he's found that should as in these states passed that it it could start a trend for the rest of the states that many of the other states that have not expanded Medicaid but the other thing that's going on\nIs some states that had an expanded Medicaid conservative states have been asking Trump Administration for permission to do so but they do so in a different way in a way that advocates for the Affordable CARE Act don't like such as ah imposing work requirements and that's another issue that play some states might be willing to\nExtend Medicaid if they can do so in their own way but some of the things the way they want to do that\nThat are being challenged in court and we're saying that for example in um Kentucky\nOkay yeah I think you're going to that point you mentioned a couple of states where governors races or could have an effect on this right\nRight and that's a little bit of a it's not quite as an immediate impact is about and it's just because the governor's aren't the only ones and there are states that have the say in it there's in the state legislatures do too but it's come up as an issue in several governors' races Florida Kansas Tennessee in Georgia where the Democrat candidate for governor saying this is something that we should do\n[noise] boy that due to a lot like tying it to I guess that the federal government money ... would there be a guarantee that there would be there every year\nThat's the way the law is written by one of the argument that uh opponent of expanding Medicaid 'em when they get the argument that they're making is that you can't guarantee can't guarantee that they said that funding will be there forever\nOn Saturday in their their argument is that states get dependent on his federal money and then if the federal government can't live up to bargain of funding Ninety percent or more out of the expansion Penn State you're going to be on their own\n...
