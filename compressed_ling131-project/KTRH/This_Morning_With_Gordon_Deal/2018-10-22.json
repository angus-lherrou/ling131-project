naval mission of the war\nAnd so even a even as I said even the captain didn't know what it was only major from and what it was and his uh his companion happened game now when it was it along to

it out ran any Japanese submarine that were to try to target or\nSome funny stories about speculation among the crew about what it might be a because there was a fairly conspicuous package that was delivered there and in fact as you noted in the book the the the uranium the\nThe radioactive part of it a ... element was carried on to the ship in a briefcase but there was a lot of funny stories that were told about what might be in their right though Sarah\nOh yeah I mean again these are teenagers and they have this large crate that delivered which is really a diversion to everything but they brought you know they see this crate come aboard and it's surrounded by marine guard\nAnd of course there first gas is Rita Hayworth undergarments or scented toilet paper for Douglas MacArthur

a thrashing around to blame somebody in the ship itself got blamed a which you would like to tackle that\nWell they were in effect blaming Indianapolis for her own own demise so in one one case in point is that no distress signal got off the ship\nSo they were saying that that was happening and they thought that was the ship fault for getting hit by torpedoes and having her power you know flown out\nI'm also as a treaty creator at Tara mentioned she had a single through jak that went uh all the way through a from ... stern and\nEnded in certain cruising conditions in the in the matter is

in a slightly different condition which would ... called yolk modified and not let some of those folks had I'm not the old or in other words not water type that when the bat was blown off the ship\nAnd she was continuing to make way through the water the with just flowing in three that that a long three attack and so um\nThere were a lot of questions and the court marshal about why that was the case why she why she would open like that and because of that because of this question because of their reporting on those questions some of the families who had last man on the shed a blamed

the\nWeather is walking into Monday in a year where Democrats are considered the favorites to win back control of the house many of the races now tightening or districts where President Trump won modestly in twenty six teams still Republicans say they are becoming more confident that they could have a shot\nAt a pair of Nevada raises it's a story by Wall Street journal congressional reporter Christina Peterson Christina explain is\nWhat I was looking at in particular where races that were kind of ignored at the beginning of the cycle and people didn't think would become competitive back in the last sort of final\nStretch here has become closer than than people expect that they would and we're seeing that in particular and a handful of districts where the president won\nBut not by a huge in that [laughter]\nSo maybe forty nine percent victory fifty fifty three percent so districts you know that he comfortably carried but where there is more room for a Democrat to pick up votes if people have become dissatisfied with the president and\nThat's a one of them was like in ... in Washington state explain that one\nYet so it's interesting because a political analysts have had their eyes on two races in Washington state all year and they're at the third race that is sort of sneaking up on a lot of people into coming very competitive and that the district currently held by congresswoman Jamie Herrera butler\nUm she has been in office she was elected in two thousand ten and that sort of cruise to victory in recent years but that has a significant challenge or has been out raising her and um came in pretty close to her in the primary in fact the top two Democrats and garnered more votes than congresswoman\nButler in Washington state is one of those states where they have a top two primary so [noise]\nUm [noise] the incumbent advanced as the the highest performing Democrat who is a woman named ... she's a political science professor\nSo it's an unusual race there in that um this hasn't been considered you know one of the sweetest districts but Carolyn lungs campaign just released a poll that had her up by two points [noise] um so it looks like you know it's getting to be a pretty tight great well\nAll right how about the Long Island New York with uh the incumbent Republican Congressman Peter king\nYet this is probably a little bit more of a long shot but he has a younger and democratic female opponent and this is the year when those candidates\nAre attracting a lot of energy and enthusiasm for voters especially female voters um our pool and other polls have shown a gender gap and and it reveals that women\nAre showing more of a preference for\nA democratic controlled house and are also more energized vote this year so you know it's a truly them of terms that it comes down to turn out but if that is indeed the case it looks like women are more place to turn out and that could help some of these female challengers and in Long Island Trump wine and but I think he had around fifty\nThree percent of the votes and not a huge blow out for him there\nGot it we're speaking with Christina Peterson Wall Street journal congressional reporter or pieces called house races tightened as mid term elections near to down south in the suburbs of Atlanta with a congressman rub what'll\nYes this is an interesting race I'm kind of what all is definitely being outraged by Carolyn up or do who is also a professor she's at Georgia State university and I'm In the suburbs of Atlanta so this could have been some one of them are like classics suburban battlegrounds that we're seeing\nA but it just wasn't really on people's radar\nFor a while one of the factors that could be at play here is set Stacey Abrams at the top of the ticket is trying to become the first black woman elected governor in Georgia and Democrats hope that that could give a boost for their down in the ticket and that I'm mystified go could benefit from that\nAnd so and as as part of that you looked at the two seats in Nevada as well\nSo this is where Republicans are a little bit more optimistic um there are two open seats that have been held by Democrat that are currently held by Democrats and ah so does you know they can see the Republican feel they have a better shot rather than an seating a democratic incumbent\nI'm One of them is actually a rematch that we've seen before between Democrat Steven Horsford and Republican crescent hardy [noise]\nUh and then the second to the to Republicans are optimistic about is currently held by congresswoman Jackie rose and who's a Democrat but she is running for Senate in Nevada\nUm this is a little bit\nProbably a little bit more of a long shot for Republicans because of their candidate Danny Tarkanian has run many times before and not shown that he can win a congressional races so that that seemed to be um [noise] a little bit more of a stretch their\nWings Christina it's Wall Street journal

Bush in Nineteen Ninety two was the last president to do it\nIt's not unusual for the president you know historically to say what he thinks the fed should do it again it has not happened I'm trying to Ninety two\nWhat is unusual for the president to say things in quite a manner that Donald Trump is obviously Donald Trump has been [noise] I'm kind of a difference in many respects the president and the other example he's saying things about the fatty blaming them for the market fell off you're saying that they've gotten crazy [noise]\nUm he said that they were his biggest threat to them and that's not something that we're really used to seeing rights\nAre so he feels what the fed is moving too quickly raising interest rates\n[noise] that's what he said but part of this is also laying the groundwork to blame the fad ah if anything should go wrong in the economy or financial markets\nAnd you know even though there's some speculation there about why he's doing this [laughter] if you look at the ... the president has\nInfluenced fed policy the president has a lover [noise]\nThey get to nominate the people [noise] but uh sit on the fed board and the fed bore along with a rotating number of dead presidents that are not picked by the White House\nA boat every few weeks on monetary policy Donald Trump has not pick people who would really take monetary policy in a radically different direction um so what he's been doing this just to kind of a\nRunning public criticism of the central bank and you know the fed faces some hard choices potentially over the next year [noise]\nAnd while the fed says presidents for criticism isn't going to change how they operate it does you know up the stakes here a little bit because now they know that if anything does go wrong the president is probably going to blame them for it you know\nIf nothing else or as per usual when the president does something like this he started a discussion right so is there a debate now among the experts about whether or not the interest rate hikes are are too sooner too frequent\n... exactly right people are always going to\nTalk in the markets about what the fed is two and a Trump is um probably elevating that debate and saying look the unemployment rate slow\n[noise] ah and the fed might feel it needs to raise interest rates you know as of a black disappears in the economy because you don't want to have inflation but when President Trump is saying here as well where's the inflation why would you need to raise interest rates that we're not seeing an acceleration in inflation\nWe're speaking with Nick tomorrow's Wall Street journal economics reporter who's ... has called presidents sustained criticism of the Federal Reserve complicates a tricky balancing act there was one person who sit in your story or it might be more likely that the fed doesn't want to appear to be caving to the president so they might just continue to do the opposite of what he wants\n[laughter] that's right the question isn't very difficult right now the head [laughter] you know most officials believe they need to keep raising interest rates to the decision to make right now on particularly difficult but that may not be the case for a year from now with the year from now\nYou have the unemployment rate continuing but inflation is maybe not rising much and so it's a close call about what your models tells you you should do\nAnd so the question is on the coasts call where you don't have as much conviction\nAbout the policy pass through the president's criticisms again in your head at all I Know some people who say look this is creating a political risk that they may have to take more seriously the point that you um identify as the other side which says look if markets begin to question the feds credibility\nThan that's even worse and so it might actually from their backs a little bit [noise] um but the ... so far as saying we're going to ignore the\nWe're we're just going to do what we think we need to do for the economy and if people criticize it you know then we'll deal with that\nMick Wall Street Journal economics reporter Nick to morose it is twenty minutes now in front of the hour on this morning Americas first news\nF.
