[noise] from ... in Houston totally cellphone it\nBreakdown works on the court he actually is sandwiched between for people who are more conservative and he is and for people who are\nOn the liberal side of things so we are here they he is part of a five justice conservative bloc it's more conservative and it's been in recent memory and so he's in a position where the court can do a lot of things that he would like to do with the law\nBut as we say in the story I mean the big challenge for him as you know Brett Kavanaugh\nComes to this court after this brutal political fight or you know in some inflammatory remarks he made in his second Judiciary Committee appearance [noise]\nAnd you know the whole process just is not to sort of process that reflects terribly well on the court and then to the challenge for that she will be to to try to steer the court through these meaner pretty rough partisan times\nWithout also just looking like another partisan body you know\nHow to steer it though 'cause I mean it was rare you ever see any of the Supreme Court justice is like you know do an interview or or be public so what does that mean to him and steer it\nWell I guess a few things I mean there have been times the cheapest taken different approaches I mean there have been a lot of times where he clearly favors incremental type rulings instead of trying to tackle some big\nHot button issue head on and dealing with every aspect of it you know he'll kind of break it down and and take a micro part of that and have the court issued a ruling that doesn't that's not so sweeping so that's one way to to minimize the court throw a little bit there have been other times it on an issue that he really really cares about he's not\nThat interested in doing that so [noise] you know that's a calculation he will\nMake another another question for the court in their time and they're big cases the court will not be able to avoid I mean the lower courts are split on the proper outcome of some big legal issue the Supreme Court really doesn't have\nA choice but to take it so so certain things they won't be able to duck but it is the case where the court has almost entirely discretionary docket meaning they can pick and choose which cases they want to hear the you know if if somebody brings a case that tries to overturn roe v Wade for example\nMeat and the court could just say no we're not going to hear that case right now and so that may be a way he could try to deal with some of the\nInteresting for speaking with Wall Street journal Supreme Court correspondent Brent Kendall his piece is called Brett Kavanaugh's confirmation battle tests Supreme Court chief justice talking about John Roberts it's interesting right I mean ah two weeks ago maybe Brett Kavanaugh might be the only justice most people in America could even name\nAnd now ... all of a sudden the the high court is under this renewed spotlight\nPromoted him when they go through the confirmation process [laughter] they have some ability for a little while but then that kind of fades but you know it sure does look like like judge justice Kavanaugh will be in a similar boat\nJustice Clarence Thomas who had a similar sort of thing and you know in justice Thomas's is probably easily the most recognizable\nMember of the court for the public off the bench and you know the people I expect we'll have long memories of the cabinet proceedings [laughter] just like they did the Thomas proceedings for him now the challenge for him will be just to get back to the judge in cases and and seeing if there's you know over time\nAny any way some of the guys down I mean whether some of it dies down may depend of course on how he rules and so you know he has some calculations to make just like the chief justice does I mean if if a new justice Kevin I'm\nTakes very bold dances in cases you know that cutting a strongly conservative direction then you know people are probably on the left are going to criticize him for that if he finds ways to moderate in the end to forge common ground with with a cross section of people in the court didn't then maybe slowly\nThat that sort

people even though they may not know anyone involved they find themselves grieving even feeling sick inside maybe even helpless why does this happened and how can we manage we're joined now by doctor Judith or loss\nPsychiatrist and clinical faculty member at UCLA Dr what's happening in these cases\nOne thing that's happening is that many people are highly tactic and what they do at the heart goes out for other people but they also take on that sadness into their own body and a lot of their past traumas that trigger and so I wrote a book called the ... guy about these people who\nAre sensitive and started running but they take on too much and that's what happens in this kind of accident and horrific situation too much on in their body and they go to bed they become exhausted are anxious to crash\nAnd it's really important to learn how to set boundaries and Center You're out and realize\nThat you are not that the hearts and go out to them but it's not healthy to take on other people's anger and\nWhat is the nature that they take on this dress\nWell it's interesting it's done some research on that and they think that it's a hyperactive mirror neurons system and the mirror neurons are the compassion in the brain where I'm at a path to that's why it's such a tractor and I'm just standing impact and thought that\nThe mirror neurons the compassion neurons go on overdrive\nAnd when you know for instance if someone is on the scanner and in that you love and they're getting ... with a needle Iran mirror neurons get activated that much more showing hiring a path with people\n[noise] so how do you begin to set boundaries then if you realize that when you see something or here's something tragic in the news you know it's going to affect you 'cause you're an impasse had to begin to set those boundaries\nWell one thing I suggest all night and pat patients to take this fast and not become addicted to\nIt's because if you have that constant on ...\nStrasse negative news it's just too much or anyone system and people become addicted to that so many fast go out in nature medicate exercise Brandon laugh so that's one tool but also just note path count as a\nTrigger for instance you know if you lost your father\nAnd you know I'm a man was lost in this current accident now your pain about losing your father is to have to know that they can make a big difference though that you know I'm dealing with is an addition to the current situation [noise] um and also\nDoing a Rockefeller nurture\nYou know do something really kind of yourself if you're you know taking on too much of what you hear in the news the Panetta go outside\nUm learn now it's a complete sentence with paper because then you don't know how to set boundaries with what I call energy vampires draining\nAnd you're not able to say no no I'm Sorry I Can't do that or no you know it doesn't feel good if you're criticizing me you know whatever they have the type that energy vampires are the criticizes the blame or as you know that can make\nAll this worse you know you want to be around loving supportive paper when you hear horrific things in the news they don't want to be around\nEnergy vampires will I write about destroying your energy\nFor we're speaking with Dr Judah oral off she's a psychiatrist also a clinical faculty member at UCLA she's got a book called the impacts survival guide and we're talking about coping with tragedy in the news like that horrific stretch limousine accident in upstate New York and which twenty people were killed [noise]\nUm can the impasse who take on all this stress from other people's tragedy call themselves long term harm\n[noise] oh definitely and and pass it don't have the skills but I'm writing about in the book can be kind of course they never want to go outside they had panic disorders bacon as it is a lot of the nation is because they're censoring overload all the time\nFor it they're just being bombarded and don't know how to stop it and so yeah I Believe the empathy is a trait that's going to the world really good I feel so strongly about it is something I teach all my patients how to develop\nUm and you have to be having to be with somebody despite their differences and try and understand where they're coming from the first step to hearing his he so we need to have empathy but we don't need to take on the suffering of the world\nPsychiatrist Dr Judas or loft clinical faculty member at UCLA again the book is called the impacts survival guide twenty minutes in front of the hour on this morning Americas first news",
