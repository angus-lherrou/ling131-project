I don't know a few years back\nYeah I think it was just before the in two thousand sixty before the election and then in early twenties Seventeen we had a series that rice and being bailed the

delivery services\nAnd so on are going to have different people from time to time coming in but it it has been my experience\nIn the past that the delivery people coming into office buildings manufacturing plants or whatever are generally the same person day after day after day unless that person is on vacation if they come in and it's a different person you know it may you know where's second such\nYou know if they said on vacation or she's on vacation then you know there may not be anything to worry about but if they come in and they say air science but it I gotta go gotta go gotta go yeah then there could be an issue with that because they're trying to get out of the building as fast as they possibly can\nAre these days um most of us are in this see something say something mode

to be just a solidly red state it might still be a red state but it's so far lighter to these ...
