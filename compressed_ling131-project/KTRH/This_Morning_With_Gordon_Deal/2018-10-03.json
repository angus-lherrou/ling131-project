activity\nA new report by the center for political accountability\nStudies annual political spending policies as and be five hundred companies the nonprofit advocates better disclosure of corporate political activity among the four hundred and fourteen companies that have remained in the U.S it'd be five hundred since twenty Fifteen increasing numbers or either prohibiting or fully disclosing direct contributions to candidates\nAnd contributions for election related used to trade associations so called five twenty seven groups and other nonprofits more from Wall Street Journal business reporter tail Francis tell what are we seeing your\nPoint there's a lot of a concern and then some quarters consternation about the idea that companies uh you know after the Citizens United Supreme Court ruling that a lot more freedom to swoop in and get involved in electoral politics I've always at the lobby they've always got a lot of money in Washington and in state capitals but the idea was that they would start\nSpending money in in large quantities and elections and certainly there is some corporate involvement on election there there's a lot of debate about just how big that is\nWhat this shows though is that some big companies are actually voluntarily saying you know we're not going to get involved in certain ways\nAnd when when you talk about interfering in elections with money talking about endorsing a specific candidate is that what they mean\nWorld show companies do have some restrictions on their contributions to candidates\nBut they can support candidates and other ways such as an independent expenditures they can support political parties they can support organization that then go on to support candidates such AS Party a democratic Republican uh governor's a tax that that basically support a selecting\nGovernors one party or the other or are there similar groups for attorney general on for state legislators and so they they can contribute money to those which then use them to support candidates but again ah what was seen as a little of Richard of a company as large public companies are saying we don't want to use money I'm going to war ...\nWell we're speaking with tail Francis Wall Street journal business reporter he's written a piece titled companies curb their political spending what is the phrase up backsliding\nThat you wrote about organization that produced this report the center for political accountability\nHas a way of looking at that that you know they're tracking these companies year after year so far hundred and fourteen and companies\nHave been in the ... five hundred for four years that they have been tracking this and what they've seen it a steady improvement in those companies disclosing a cow and where and when they spend a and in some cases how much they spent on these different election activities and\nThey also call out companies that\nHave gotten more so for example they used that published a report on the political activity and now they don't or their report too much uh informative than they used to be um fewer companies now in part because of new companies joining the U.S and the five hundred index pure companies\nHave a dedicated Web page to their ah ah to display their political standing reports that something I expect you'll see change as those companies stay in the index it turns out that larger companies and companies that have been an index longer\nTend to do better at disclosing how and where and when they spend on on politics\nSpeaking of a large companies referenced a Lowe's and they're the big home improvement chain date as the mayor did they seem like they're pretty strict with this stuff\nSo rose um got called out for a in less for coming in may in the center for political accountability XYZ in how they disclose what their restrictions are on a on political spending\nIn talking to me they said their position hadn't changed they still don't contribute to political campaigns are candidates they don't contribute to nonprofit groups like Fargo on C. four and five twenty seven groups for political purposes\nUm but that they simply admitted some of the language that Adam previous versions of their annual political spending report um other companies by the way there's about ten companies that say they don't do any of this they don't contribute to campaigns are political organizations or\nAnd they tell their trade associations not to use the funds for a electorate activities\nSo that show very small number but it is a number that's been growing year after year\nI was gonna say so is that does have some sort of trend we're seeing we expect more companies fall into that group\nIt's a slow and steady trend I you know we're we're not seeing a tidal wave your of changes um the way this tends to work is that uh you know the organization that Saddam for political accountability but then also uh some\nShareholder activists or shoulder advocates have put pressure on individual companies overtime and made proposals\nTo uh you know Asher holders have what's called the company to produce a political spending airport in some circumstances companies either see and how those votes go over time or just on their own emissions of goaded the investor and said look what's hash out at the Senate you remove this project proposal

does little to fix the problems inherent in online voting more from Danny Boyle and national security correspondent at the Washington Times Dan what's happening\nWhat's happening in West Virginia is that they are trying to wrestle with the issue how to process ballots from their residents who are overseas are serving in the military\nMeans about sometimes are difficult to get in on time because it's maps of the ballot so West Virginia has taken a pretty bold step of saying actually use a smartphone applications\nTo allow folks overseas to vote\nAnd it kind of the most experiment that exists in the country right now\nWow All right so several presidential elections ago we would not even have considered this from a technology standpoint but these days has to be asked what's the uh the hacking riskier\nThat's a big issue because a lot of folks\nHave said you know what what on earth is going on here you know in the last election twenty six to like you guys have talked extensively about it and wrestling a\nDepartment of homeland security said that there were Twenty one state state's ... pro ... by Russian hackers looking for weaknesses too to see if they could mess which

split is this fifty fifty supporters into tractors or is it too hard to tell\nUs pretty hard to tell a I one of the guys\nI was doing what should we should have written a piece for the MIT technology

channel trying to get the U.S government to adopt one block show he thinks it's great for a little he goes to the argument that I just said that this block chain allows for a deeper level of education um\n[noise] I think what's what's interesting um\nOrdinance that Virginia is a all across the country it's a battleground state this year with senator democratic Senator Joe Manchin\nIs up for reelection are losing a neck and neck race with a\nRepublican attorney general down there Patrick Morsi so people are really watch the game and so this is a straight Republican slipping while they're going to have a pretty strong chance of maintaining a majority and expect them to maintain it gives them a better chance to take the take the Senate back\nSo all eyes are really watching thing that's going to be a real close race and those that were seatbelts could be extremely important\nNow and again it's not just for service members it's designed with them in mind but anybody can use is\nAnd what I Believe in yeah I Believe in what he got some sort of government service overseas either which somewhat narrow they're trying to to keep it to folks that are involved in the government because the actual process to vote is the school or your government id of\nIt and then this is really interesting actually you that are supposed to send a selfie video of you saying Hi this is Gordon Deal I'm overseas and then this technologies apparently matches up your with facial recognition it matches up the picture on your ID\nWith your cell phone video and it says this is actually growing\nProcess as well about that but that's heavy\nIsn't it that's really fascinating\n[laughter] yeah yeah and the uh the analysis comes out what the next day or a week or two after the reliability all that stuff\nI think it's pretty instantaneous while you know\nAnd I think that that's where some some cybersecurity folks have said actually that might be where people ... well okay the the ability to hack is three hundred and sixty degrees so [noise] they could pop and all over the place and then it comes back to that question of well do they have a paper trail to go back and it gets tricky at that point\nI
