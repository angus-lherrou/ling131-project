looked at me odd they said they were up there scouting areas to hunt the two twin girls in the backseat\nLooked like they were in their Sunday Best church clothes\nI Can't remember this was a long time ago I Can't remember specifically if they were wearing dresses but I Swear to goodness it looked like they just came out of church they might have been in dress is not what you would expect for going out scouting hunting areas in the rain forest in the woods [noise] um\nThey were like blonde hair blue eyes again just like of aliens came down here and said how do we blend in and looked like humans it was like they were too perfect\nNot a flaw not expected dirt know dirt on their face their hair was perfectly comb their clothes I didn't even see a a a single wrinkle the plowed shirts were tucked into their waistline not seem like you would expect out in the woods in the middle of nowhere so\nThey just comment you were looking for a place to go hunting as they're driving by or did they stopped to chat\nThey kind of stopped\nIn chatted they they see me they see me coming down the road and so they hold off and they kind of parked a little bit and I I stopped and I I chatted with them probably\nProbably two minutes probably two or three minutes of course I was on my way down to the lake\nAnd like I said I've got this logical brain that seems to just kind of reason away anything and all these weird events that I've had in my life sometimes don't sink in until after the fact [noise] and you know I started thinking about it well wait a minute how did they even get that ATV onto the road that show\n[laughter] alone how weird their appearance was I mean I was struck by how odd it was at the time but um\nYou know I just kind of reason to the way that well there are people but I tell you up in those woods there'd been some strange strange events uh I I called in a while back I talk to you when you talk to the big foot researcher that the records their their sounds it was\nIn those sim woods where I heard this a ungodly sound that couldn't be any other animal and\nI don't think of the best opera singer POV raunchy could have imitated the sound and I'd encourage you to find out what coast to coast did with the audio tape they used to play of this a legit big foot recording ten or more years ago George or used to play it\nI think art bell used to play it hasn't been played for years but I heard that up in the shame woods it's a unique recording never heard of it before\nI'm starting to buying more and more to the fact that these big puts might be dimensional might have a a extraterrestrial connection these humanoid that I saw in the woods the more I think about it there's\nI'm Ninety nine point nine percent sure those were not humans and in hindsight I'm

kind of a big experience and it wasn't until you played this year sounds like coast to coast they realize that that's what I heard I\nWas up um the Willamette to birth national forest is a lot of the field of between um mount bachelor and a three sisters in Oregon\nAnd um it was up there a late night watching the stars and he went out and you know like to play music stuff's sometimes I just kinda hang out somewhere where it's quiet and there's nobody around for hours up there\nAnd then went down uh looking it starts with an ... and I heard that same sound that he's talking about is just as I Know what he's talking about [noise] um and at a weird psychic effect I don't know anybody else it had this experience but um it was kinda like hey what are you doing it you know and I\nGot a second guessing but oil and really far away and uh you know maybe I'm just imagining that and\nSo I mean I look at the stars and about and yeah and they closed the at least three miles in maybe ten minutes and it did the same sound again only the the impression or psychic him personally at all it was like hey I'm coming at you\nAnd me and I jumped in my car and got out of there and you know I never really piece together what it was you know I'm like oh God I Will do a lot of reading it wasn't a lot of course coast\nAnd theorists down it was like oh my God that is what it is it has a musician so

America's\nBeing with us as the mid term elections\nApproach America's electronic voting systems are more vulnerable than ever what's being done to fix them we're joined now by cyber security journalist Kim Zetter who's got a piece running in the New York times can what kind of security that we have\nIt's really and what I Would refer to his band aids security there were really not and I'm much of a different shape than we weren't she doesn't sixteen there are some some some differences some changes but certainly not um ah what you would want\nWhile what are the band aid by the way let's let's let's work backwards I guess\nSo um what's the ... prior to he doesn't fixing it reached out to states and it I'm offered the scanning service that it does um what his name is it simply will scanned the Internet facing system to these where they um\nServers like the voter registration um databases things like that anything that's on line the ... will do this remote scan 'em and all it's doing is looking to see if you have any um open software vulnerability that are none south of ... that we know about that I'm also have a patch of elbow\nAnd it will tell the states where it's found a vulnerability and\nI'm able to keep scanning they will keep scanning like on a weekly basis on a weekly basis to see when the um the customer has that patch that to them so they did that to a few states before um the two that I think the election and then they've done that to more states are more county now\nUm since then but it's still the the amount is I think it's less than half\nUm and the scanning is really a sort of cosmetic it getting at only the Internet facing system could not getting at the core back in ... they're supposedly not connected to the Internet not getting at the voting machines at all not looking at the core vulnerabilities there\nAnd it's often not touching I'm order the election management systems and these are the system that sit in a county headquarters a there used to program their voting machines and they're all the youth to tabulate the vote so these are actually the most critical and not the Internet they think this them\nOkay so if if you're an average voter do walk into a polling place in November with the utmost confidence where are you saying there are there are some doubts about\nWhether or not we could be hacked\nThere has always been the possibility for our election system to be hacked 'cause at four glitz going back Fifteen sixteen years since many of these systems were implemented were just addressing it now because of the Russian threat\nBut um it's the ... the situation is not new I Would not tell voters not to vote uh definitely I Want and others to go out and vote as you did before the problem is not the voters problem the problem is um the ...\nStates and counties need to implement um mandatory audits and they need to have a paper trail is either a paper ballot the voter filled out or that have the machine produce paper trail\nI mean they need to do a manual audit of those against the digital though it's not it's not up to the voters here and I don't want voters to to come away with the wrong message that they shouldn't those\nWho you point out there's really two types of voting machines are in use do they provide that type of backup\nUm yes so many states have recognizing this problem I'm obviously that digital ... ballots a deal that can be altered\nUm have mandated California Ohio Florida for example mandated years ago that their machines I'm happy to have other ideas need optical scan machines where the voter filled out a full size paper ballot that gets Canada machine for um the fully electronic machine has to produce a paper trail\nUm so many states and many voters are now voting on these systems are the problem is is that um state the county election officials are not looking at the paper after the election is over in many cases\n... we're speaking with Kim Zetter veterans cybersecurity journalists also author of a book called count down to zero day she's got a piece running in the New York times titled the crisis of election security how do we get so vulnerable\nWe got vulnerable because of a reaction to the Florida fiasco and the two thousand presidential election\nUh in that case I'm sure everyone recall the dangling Chad wow yeah that that took you know the the race to the Supreme Court and lawmakers in Washington DC decided that they didn't want that to happen again and they thought\nThey came to the wrong conclusion that it was the paper ballots that where the problem and not the fact that we didn't actually do a recount a manual recount\nAnd so what they did was they set up legislation that was designed to get rid of those uh assistance and many states I'm over reacted and went to systems that didn't have any paper at all and that's how we got we have today\nIs Kim Kim Zetter cybersecurity journalists Nineteen Minutes

Brothers exposed how cavalier of the world\nHad been towards risk households have bought homes they thought could never go down in price and banks had made loans they thought would never defaults in repackage them into securities to make them seem risk lists\nWith time even the deepest traumas wear off and there are signs that risk taking is returning though in different forms from before more from Greg hip chief economics commentator at the wall Street Journal Greg how to use the it\nWe've got to Christ basically because uh everybody became somewhat blind to the president of risk weather was bankers who\nThought that these loans could ever to fall to her home buyers who thought their homes would never decline in prices they essentially didn't realize the risks they were taking on [noise] and ever since all of that bankers investors and we it's individuals have really tried to avoid a repeat by also limiting are exposure risk whether it's in regulations\nOr attitudes towards risk such as what we want to buy stocks and what type of stocks we buy\nAnd I think that helps explain the kind of economy we've had in the last ten years it's been very stable growth because we haven't had a lot of ah you know booms and busts and crises but it's been very muted growth because you don't get the kind of investment of risk taking a firm which long term prosperity is born\nThat's interesting so you you wrote household and investors are much ... of risk what's the uh ... what some of the other evidence that you've seen\nWell housing is a very good example I used to be that aren't really year we'd build one and a half million new homes and its expansion so far it's more like a million and there's several rates for that one is that well I'm wearing aging country so maybe fewer people need homes but also regulators have made it harder to get mortgages so that's a limited who can buy a house\nI and also I think young families young adults are also more hesitant to make that size of a commitment and you can see that in their own behavior they live at home with their parents longer they take longer to have to get married and longer to have children\nWow what kind of a ripple effect I guess does that have\n[noise] well I think one thing you look at it as a business area so businesses for example a lot of them were caught with too much debt or not enough cash on hand and the crisis and they've kind of learn to be more cautious they're investing\nAnd so we see investment if you look at housing and business investment combined it tends to be a little bit more muted you don't have as many people going to start their own business Bartlett because it's harder to get the loan you know he used to try to a home equity loan to start your new business those are harder to get but I also think people are at an age and it sort of a psyche that ... it's\nThat's something they don't want to do [laughter] sure you have your ... here and you're ... months there but it really kind of the exception you know it seems that if even if you look at Silicon Valley\nWhat people want is to not start the next Google and Facebook but to be bought by the next Google or Facebook the level of new businesses being formed does actually historically quite low and I think it's troublesome I mean essentially\nThat people need to take risks to come up with a new or a better product and if nobody wants to take risks we're going to kind of stagnate\nNo we're speaking with Greg ... chief economics commentator at the wall Street Journal he's written a piece titled the financial crisis a crisis made us afraid of risk\nFor a while so you mentioned it before like this pessimism is why the bull market has lasted so long does that mean once we arrive at a downturn it might actually be a softer downturn or that aren't related\nI think it helps explain why the bull market has lasted as long as it has I mean as an old saying on Wall street a bull market markets climb a wall of worry that as I say if everybody pessimistic there was nobody that fully invested and therefore some kind of shocked knocks prices down you don't have a lot of people ...\nAnd fell into that so in some sense cut some of them is a healthy background for the stock market to rise\nHum and that is similar for the economy if you don't have a lot of people investing in crazy project she left like you've got to bust into recession\nNow that said I think you've seen some signs that there's a wariness is wearing off the market is extremely reach very high levels evaluations are very high you see that in the property market\nAs well some of the pessimism that we've noticed for the last eight or nine years has worn off I don't think you can call it the most hated bull market in history any longer\nAnd I think those are the circumstances but uh about which the risk to start to grow and if you look at the regulatory site to yeah we've got a very good job of protecting our banks from the sorts of risk taking that cause the last crisis\nBut you know risque kinda like goes away that sort of changes shape it's sort of like water running downhill and counter the barrier try to find a way around it and and we hear happening now\nSome of the risky types of loans have been banks will make like to like have lead headed companies those are being made by other companies like investment banks of private equity funds so you in some sense still have risk out there it's just a form that we're not used to when we can't have a lot of confidence about whether\nThe system will be safer as a result\nWhich Greg Greg it chief economics commentator at the wall Street Journal reminder by the way we can connect on social media you can find us on Facebook you can
