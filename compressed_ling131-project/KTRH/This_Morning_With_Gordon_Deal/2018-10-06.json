this weekend's Jennifer ...\nThe heated national debate about sexual misconduct has cast a spotlight on victims reluctance to report assault here with more on their complex reasons as Elizabeth Bernstein of the wall Street Journal Elizabeth what the numbers tell us first about how many people actually report attacks to law enforcement\n[noise] for the numbers have been pretty steady for many years decades they're showing that about five to twenty percent of victims do report to law enforcement so that's a very small amount I it's even smaller on college campuses about Ninety percent of victims do not report on college campuses\nAll right Elizabeth let's talk about some of the specifics what are some of the factors you found in your research about why people are not coming forward\nVery complex so many many reasons why somebody might not report or an assault or rape\nOr it can be re traumatizing to revisit that to help people and go over the details again\nA and once you once you tell somebody wants to law enforcement system\nTakes over you lose control and this is a primary issue of why the rape or the assault itself was so traumatized and you've lost control of your body right so now you you send it out there on your telling people justice system is taking over you've lost control of that again and that that also can be reached traumatizing\nElizabeth why do so many victims blame themselves\n[noise] well we we are in this longstanding culture of sort of blaming the victim and unfortunately victims noted that since so are there is a deep amount of shame often you know ... people were in a position I'm not often but sometimes either somewhere or they feel that they they did something wrong I went to that party\nI had too many drinks I walked down that street that with dark or they should be things that anybody can do and still be safe you should be safe in this world right in a perfect world but we're not\nAnd so there's that self blame like how did I not protect myself\nWe're speaking with Elizabeth Bernstein of the wall Street Journal Elizabeth your article I thought it was interesting that people are more willing to come forward if there is some evidence of physical harm why is that\nBecause then they face feels like they will be beliefs of the huge fear is that I Am going to put myself out there I'm going to relive my trauma and no one's and I'm going to do it publicly people now nobody shameful details it's you know facts as a private thing to begin with even when it's consensual and nice\nAnd people are going to know these horrible details in my life and no one's going to believe me right so these these physical injuries that somebody has or at least physical ... they're visible press that something happened to me\nLet's talk about the victims you actually know the person which seems to be somewhat often if that person is a friend of relatives tumbling at all that does that make it that much more complicated\nYes especially for young people you're on a college campus are high school you see this person in the hall you see this person around the country club wherever you are and so um you're you're scared aid that they will get angry at you and there'll be some retaliation I'm but you're also scared of being ostracized ostracized so\nUh you know will people again in this victim blaming society where people say that you know you you should be quiet and here's the thing I'm there's something called cognitive dissonance when something we can get our mind around some things that we've
