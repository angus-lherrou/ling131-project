and then people kind of go well no one guy there that did that so you must be mistaken or maybe somebody was traveling through or this or that\nSo I Hope that helps them sort of get a better idea of what could be happening in that situation\nLet's go to Chris in Columbus ohio Hi Chris go ahead\nOh Georgia since you're a gift there has been a in Ohio northeastern part yeah I've got to ask I Believe he did a show from there the man's school reform and tore yeah we sure did\nAnd every time I go there and there's something it's electricity and if I could I'd like to share a love story with you sure okay my mother\nAnd full blooded Cherokee of called in quite a few times a following ... but anyway uh my father died and\nThree months later my mom she's really depressed didn't know how things were going to work out you know to put two kids\nAnd just before they liked the world cup my father was there\nYou came in her bedroom sit down on the bed mom soon enough he how gr kissed her and said honey everything's gonna be All right but it's beautiful in the strongest power of everything is love and I was going to share that\nWith a sweet mhm\nThese sometimes these stories are just emotional as well or if they Brendan\nYeah yeah you know I mentioned a little bit before it's these aren't negative experiences for the most part if in in my in the real and that accounts that I go over with these people that have people I've met over the years\nYou know sixty sixty seven percent I think are more positive than they are negative and it's this idea of someone coming back saying goodbye\nSaying you know it's okay um you know these are positive experiences in their life changing and they reaffirm the connectedness that you had with this love one and and these are important things in life we talked about before it it could heal some sort of psychological wounds and help you move through the grief process\nSo this phenomenon could be used as a coping skill and there's a lot of research out there that says there's sometimes paranormal experiences arts uses coping skills um so you know I always shutter when it's always negative negative negative negative goes goes go scary scary scary\nScary not like that in real life go to Joe in the Bronx side Joe's going\nHey George how are you\nGood I'm Brendan yeah I wanted to ask you a question then maybe you relate a story about a full up origin or seen um [noise]\nThe um the question is do you think that there is a supplemental under channel of communication going on between to go see a permission and the recipient of that goes to experience\nUm maybe perhaps subconsciously there's the supplemental um communication to weigh communication going going that precipitate the a ghostly permission appearing\nAnd I had a full reparation experience\nA half the my brother passed away um I'm a singer songwriter and I was having writer's block on his song and I've really destroyed before on coast to coast um my brother comes into the room [noise] um he looks the way he did when he passed away in the hospital\nI'm short of 'em and uh it's it's during the day or at the foot on my bed he walks by and he speaks to me and says just get it done and then disappears into the wall now um can you may be elaborate\nOn what could have precipitated this\nOr does your does your brother pass away or he was\nHe a this was after he passed away how long ago that he passed away a city a ... before he had the extra and maybe maybe maybe maybe uh fourteen years\nOkay All right I'm while answer your second question and we'll get back to the first question one quick so I I think it's kind of similar to the well we talked about earlier\nOh with the husband thing his wife and then the wife kind of said hey check on the bench and he finds a pumpkin there\nThat's an idea where you sort of gather information from the environment\nUm possibly connecting are resonating with his consciousness and communication is it happening\nIn other words he's saying get on with the complete your song those types of things he's giving you the motivation because I don't think you need at that point it's like that guy needed to find that pumpkin you needed some motivation to resonate with the consciousness of your brother\nAnd when you resonate with something not just information visual stuff as well\nUm and the idea you talked about before as far as that I'm unconscious communication between people there's a lot of cases out there like that there was one case in my book that I go over where a I'm a guy wakes up in the middle of the night and this\nFeeling like his dog is in trouble and he has this visual operation of a dog laying in the water injured and you can't communicate with a dog but he could somehow feel like the dog is trying to communicate with him and they had a reading each other's emotions\nAnd then you know wakes up cars finds a dog that type of thing so\nYou know why there isn't physical communication or words there is some sort of like I'm understanding or collapse you're reading a mind type thing\nWhere do we get the book to go study sprint and\nUh the study at Barnes and noble a

announced that his leukemia has returned and illegal ingredients in your dietary supplements love that story and about twenty minutes\n\nPolitical thinking right now is that the blue wave\nFor the mid term elections is not going to be as powerful as once believed that dead history does not favor the political party of the president during off year elections with a look at three build whether states that could determine control of the Senate ears Wall Street journal executive Washington editor jury side Jerry set us up\nWell so for Democrats to win control the Senate and the Republicans have only a\nFifty one forty nine margin there so it's not a big margin obviously it's the smallest possible but Democrats would still have to defend\nA lot of tough states win those states keep her seat and turn a couple of others in their direction and that is a tall order because I'm a lot of the seats the Democrats have to defend ten of in fact are in basically red states that Donald Trump won so they have to hold on there\nAnd find a couple of others that they can turn their way and when you look at that um the equation that they have to put together\nI was trying to figure out what is it what are the bellwether state that will tell you whether they can pull this off or not and it seems to me there are three of one is Missouri where Claire McCaskill the Democrat is trying to hold on in a state that is going to increasingly read over the last few cycles\nAnd where she really did have a problem in how to handle the Brett Kavanaugh Supreme Court nomination there was a there is a liberal base a progressive base in Kansas City in St Louis that was opposed to Kevin all wondering who oppose it\nWhich she did but also a southern Missouri is very much Trump country so she's trapped in the middle and if she holds on it'll be because she's Claire McCaskill kind of an institution in Missouri but it's a very tough environment and that's that one out in the balance the teacher the important for the Democrats\nSecond one is Florida where you have to build they'll send a Democrat and other democratic incumbent\nFacing Rick Scott the incumbent Republican governor so that's a big match between two heavyweights\nVery very uh a heavily funded from both sides and the wild card there all of a sudden is hurricane Michael and does that help Governor Scott 'cause he's seen is leading the rescue effort or does it really hurt him if people think the rescue effort has had been sufficient so\nAgain Democrats need to hold on to that one if they're going to have a chance and third is an interesting open seat in Arizona where there's a Jeff Flake or\nPublic can retiring airs on his kind of become the ultimate purple state it can go either way in any election\nUh and you have to you have two women from Congress Martha mix Sally on the Republican side of course the cinema on the\nDemocratic side in a year of the woman going at it a whirl Martha McSally running pretty much as a Trump Republican\nAnd Kirsten Sinema running as a kind of a moderate Democrat in a state that can go in and which direction depending on who shows up and if\nDemocrats are going to flip one to get them to their fifty or fifty one vote total was probably going to have the Arizona so those seemed like the three to watch if you're trying to figure out how this adds up at the end of the night on November six\nWe're speaking with Wall Street journal executive Washington editor jury Siamese\nBut an online video talking about the three bellwether races that could determine control of the Senate with regards to Missouri in Florida the kind of the late are arriving debatable topics like a ... in Missouri and then hurricane Michael in Florida will will those be enough to determine on election outcome\n... that's a great question I it's hard to know is this I'm either going to be late breaking events or is it basically the fundamentals and I think in a certainly in in Florida there's a big question about uh you know who turns out is it\nA a suburban voters or is it Hispanics or is it working class a more conservative voters in the panhandle where where's the turnout going to be and I think in Missouri You have a similar situation in which there is a\nPotentially large vote suburban women for Claire McCaskill but also millennials and minorities [laughter] those are two groups of voters who simply aren't as reliable uh in terms of just showing up in a midterm election compared to their performance at a presidential election so\nThey're you know events on the ground are difficult to predict but it's also difficult to predict turnout in the mid term there seems to be a lot of enthusiasm on both sides but in a to Z as in three weeks before the election and actually showing up on election day or two different things\nWhen is Jerry it's Wall Street journal executive Washington editor Jerry ... it is twenty minutes now in front of the hour on this morning Americas
