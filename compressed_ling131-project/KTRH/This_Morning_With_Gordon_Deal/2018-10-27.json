mammoth and that's going on right now are including a group that's being led by a guy at Harvard named church\nSo um the question then becomes do we I mean you know it's exciting it's it's interesting that it's like science fiction come true but then when you get past all that kind of the bells and whistles of it all\nYou have to ask you know then we really want to do this and\nThere's an even deeper question that I raised in the book and that is with all the genetic engineering were doing and you know the extent these the extinction efforts are do come under the category of genetic engineering why we're doing in is something that's never been done before\nAnd that is we are elevating recessive trade\nAnd we're the drama of traits in other words we're flying in the face of the very forces that have created these species the evolutionary forces sure we're defining the\nNatural flow where to find the natural order of things and you kind of believe that when you take on Mother Nature remember the old commercial you don't don't mess with Mother Nature or something like that\nYeah it's not nice ... nice to mother nature\nYou know that one yeah it's not nice I forget what it was the commercial was margarine night it was very mired in for a merger and right yeah I mean we all know margarine is not so great for us but\nYou gotta wonder that because we are doing this we now have the ability of elevating recessive traits than suppressing dominant trait we're fine in the face of Mother Nature we had to pay a price\nAnd he can't do that you're you're you're fighting against you know a billion a cart into science you know billions of years of evolution right where we didn't\nDo that and we take it on or who's going to be the casualty I'm thinking we are\nYeah you know this is the ultimate question and I I mean you know I was reading the DEA extinction thing and\nI'm not sure that if they brought back quote unquote a wooly mammoth what we really wouldn't have is just a wooly or elephant you know and but much in the same way that we have a sweeter orange right where we have a a a juicy or ... or something that people do buy\nSlipping genetic codes around here there and I'm not saying that that smart either but but I think I'm more worried about some of this idea about the the ... some of the robotics that you talk about and and what that what that really means who's gonna decide\nWhen robots have really gone far enough and are we going to be in a situation as crazy as it sounds words like sky nut and it'll be too late the robots will you know there'll be self teaching and we're out\nWell you know again that's a very real possibility I um\nI tell this story about a this guy I think his name is Anthony ...\nIs a former Google engineer a big into driverless cars I'm so he he he helped launch way mo which is the driverless car a division of of Google right and then went to her and then got involved in this ugly lawsuit about stealing industrial secrets and so from the sun but\nHe recently applied to the artist and was granted I'm a tax exempt status for what he's calling the church of artificial intelligence [noise]\nYou know on the surface that sounds a little bit crazy but when you look into what the thinking his thinking behind doing this he's he's basically saying this look if we continue in the trajectory we're now on\nIt it it is inevitable that one day\nA artificial intelligence robots\nPowered by artificial intelligence will will become so much more intelligent than we that they really reached the level of a deity they they they are in effect God because\nThey know everything they see everything they they control everything if we give them that kind of freedom\nAnd so we may as well just start getting ready to worship it because we want to stay on its good side because the guy who did that this technology we're creating will run amok and you know you start thinking well okay it's a little ... crazy this guy but\nYou know it's not that far fetched because the rate at which artificial intelligence is it is developing you know I talk about how it beat the pants off of the chess champ\nYeah and and then the checkers champion and now it can be a chance that the you know Texas hold them poker and the uh the gang go which is generally conceded to be the most complicated game most ancient game around go yeah yeah I play in every once in a while you write in artificial and tell us now can beat the pants off her her\nYou know the the goat champion and so\nIt's printed that writing is on the wall in\nI mean it it's pretty clear that these computers and not just going to become fans there they're no longer just anti adding machine they're no longer just doing computations\nAh but they're they're becoming more adept at doing things that we both are we once spoke about being very good at that well you know like you they're ... button it up I think they're generally like he was still pretty small\nBut you know one day they're general like he was forced seem to be even greater than ours that day of the singularity that's for a day and all and ... when they will have the equipment IQ of you know ten thousand two hundred and twenty five so\nYeah I think the interesting these are that you is it that the equation is ... ... you said a hundred and twenty five and we're using that as like a horizon line for human intelligence right we go with an IQ one twenty five but at the smarter machines get\nAnd the more the takeover of our day to day activities and or the more they do things for us and we allow them to be in the driver's seat of our lives who's just said that that that average IQ isn't going to drop ten points\nSo we we'd like to think that we might day but the more we get cushy our brains get ... and who knows it might be a lot we might be bringing on her own physical demise faster than\nRight than we would have possibly imagine so\nI like that the cushy Murphy ... yeah I'm right because you know what the old saying if you don't use it lose that you lose a yeah no but I talk about I think I caught one guy that that you know it may very well be that we are in the process of creating our own\nConquer the crazy with that the right now I fully believe that completely and it and let's pick this up and coming up after the top of the hour 'cause I'm saying like [noise] like

here to discuss turning big lotto dreams into everyday wins Laurie what do you recommend\nThat is thinking that that's real and starting to believe and possibility\nAnd so what it does it allows us to start to dream and drain in a big way we know the the jak pots are so high right now that it allows us to stretch really far so that's part of that process\nAnd with everything going on right now in the news and the economics and the political fun we start to look at\nOur lives sometimes and how it affects us negatively and there's a lot of fear going on around communities and even national way and so people me things that give them hope\nAnd when we dream and we wonder and we think it I go by that ticket what would I Do that it opens up the door to allow us to accept abundance integrate or way\nMm So to that point then how do you say okay I didn't win it's however\nI see you next door to walk through like what do you have an a ha moment for example\nSure and so you think about getting out not letting that go and so it's not a self defeating moment when you look at that ticket and the numbers aren't ears and you have to go back to work that day what you want to do is say OK why
