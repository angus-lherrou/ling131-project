this morning we're going to be with us looking into Monday some go behind\nThe numbers of the latest jobs report from the government the unemployment rate fell in September from three point nine to three point seven percent the lowest level since the Vietnam War\nWhile hiring cooled slightly one hundred and thirty four thousand jobs were added Here's Mark Hamm Rick senior industry analyst at ... dot com mark what's that number mean\nIt means that there's nothing to see here and move along meaning that uh that number is being widely regarded as being an accurate portrayal of the job market largely because of Hurricane Florence so\nAh we believe the trend remains in place a big cause we're adding about a two hundred thousand jobs a month on this country\nFor Eighteen straight months Gordon the nation's unemployment rate has been below four and a half percent\nFour years ago the Federal Reserve projected a and a sense adjusted\nAbout projected back then that four and a half percent was essentially full employment and our country and we've been below that level for uh Eighteen months so uh the economy continues to grow it a robust rate the job market a continuing to chime in as well and so this was a good time for workers\nEmployers are having some strains from the standpoint of trying to find well qualified workers ah but you know that's a good issue for workers to have\nWhat about the wages now is the markets starting to push those wages up on a continuous basis\nNot to the degree that we would've expected by this point and so in this report a bit of a disappointment from the uh hoping to get more pay standpoint average hourly earnings up below three percent two point eight percent actually a bit of a backtracking there\nAnd so what the unemployment rate now at a level that was last seen in Nineteen sixty nine what were you doing when the Beatles were still together a you know we would have thought that wage growth would have been more substantial at this point and uh it's not the case\nAnd speak with mark ... senior economic analyst at ... dot com talking about the September jobs report\nUm does the wage issue remain a mystery are we just kinda waiting patiently for things to show real progress because I really don't understand why why the wages aren't going up or they are in some cases obviously yeah\nAh well for one a lot of average right so that the old your results may very routine and we think about\nHow ah without getting into politics that we have a political divide in this country that at least to a modest degree as for informed by\nDifferent individuals economic experience so you think about where economies have not participated in the economic expansion of many small towns across America or some of the more remote areas such an Appalachian\nA and nothing's probably going to frankly changed that much in the near term and so that does inform an individual's view of what's happening but my point about that is I said as we speak in Washington DC and use it in a good place as well\nWhen it when it comes to looking for jobs are there are others across the country less so and obviously it also depends on what sector your work again so I'm\nTo the broader picture though yes it's disappointing I think there are a number of ways that are ... employers substitute for labor whether it's with technology or move the jobs elsewhere either across the country or around the world ah and perhaps none of that changes frankly and\nI Know the question is probably impossible to answer what it has to be asked\nBy people like me or nine years into this economic expansion what's left\nI think the best bet right now is it's got at least another two years to go uh\nThe you know the question really ended up being to some degree you know for the past two quarters we've had I Would say substantially better growth unexpected\nDoes that bring the end of the expansion closer or does that extend to another words doesn't mean that the economy can continue to crank out a good output for another two plus years\nOr does it mean that we're overheating at some point you just can't improve any further and that's the answer that only comes after the fact ah but I think for most of us I think the the most important attribute that important question is for now it looks positive uh the impacts of the tax cut begin to

NBC News poll rated young people and Hispanics as the Democrats least interested in voting in next month's midterm elections here's Wall Street journal national political reporter Reid Epstein read what's going on\nA year and a half or so now but our work or a previously a sort of low profile congressman Raul Paso isn't running for the Senate in Texas had Cruz a and he is something of a phenomenon there he is\nDrawing crowds for a political events a larger than anybody has ever seen in a state in Austin be at a concert with national true fifty thousand people a which is probably the biggest political rallies since President Obama's campaign but the question for Mr O'Rourke and protect us Democrats is that\nHis appeal is strongest with young people and Hispanic voters and those are the demographics that\nAre as we know from twenty sixteen and past election tend not to show up uh in numbers proportionate to their share of the population clearly been trouble elections were in turn out a goes way down compared to presidential years uh and so\nAh the award campaign and and Texas Democrats think that\nUh they have a surgeon voter turnout or like what President Obama did in two thousand eight or similarly to like what President Trump did with white working class voters or non college educated voters and twice sixteen but there's not\nSo far a lot of evidence hurting our data to show that that's going to be the case\n... there was the interesting a data deep dive you did because as you point out Texas Hispanics or Texas Hispanic voters or not the same as Hispanic voters elsewhere around the country\nThey tend to be a little more Republican than a fact of the country and getting twenty sixteen it was a thirty four percent of touch with Hispanics for the Republican compared to twenty eight percent and the rest of the country um but the bigger issue is that\nYou have a lot of these congressional districts in Texas are are showing gerrymandered to get as many Democrats as possible and then and they just haven't seen competitive races are not just for Congress but the can down the ballot for for all races or you know and so that the general\nElections have been a cakewalk short one party or the other\nUh and there hasn't been there's been no add add onto that there really hasn't been a competitive\nStatewide race in Texas for anything in Twenty years uh and so there's not a political machinery to get folks out to vote in the ... campaign has to go back on the fly over the course of the last year and a half\nA and whether there'll be able to do it uh in time for November six of the big question\nFor speaking with Wall Street journal reporter Reid Epstein has written a piece titled Beto O'Rourke draws big crowds in Texas but his voters tend not to vote the reluctance to vote is a presumption that a Democrat can win like what we're what does that come from\nJust no I mean if you ask a Mr or kill tell you that nobody's going to ask for their vote a and he is he talks a in his stump speech about having it all two hundred and fifty four counties in Texas and the taxes the big state uh and somebody's counties are very small uh some of the county is that\nIt is that I was a bit in excess twice this year to visit him a C and campaigning in February when I was down there he was ... counties a inch having more people show up to his him then voted in the twenty sixteen election in those counties a and so\nHe thinks that he's able to draw a\nPeople out who haven't participated before because there's been a little reason I'd have to say quote because that has been so Republican uh one of the things that he says on the campaign trail is that he doesn't believe that Texas has a red state but it's a non voting state or you can just get Democrats to show up\nA then it'll be competitive now the corollary to that is his house district in El Paso or haven't voted much either so there's not while he is certainly been a very compelling on the campaign trail is drawn enormous numbers of people\nUh the evidence that he can get to the show up at the polls is not grounded in in his own history or his house district as one of the twenty twenty lowest turnout districts in the country and twenty six came\nIn and quite fourteen only about Seventy thousand people voted in the general election in his
