S. P. S. so all the mail that they handle so we're talking with tens of millions of packages going through these facilities everyday that's just the volume that you know you can't think about you know how long it takes to\nPut a human being through a scanner or at the airport I mean if he talking about tens of millions of packages I'm you know that this is a an order of magnitude that\nWe simply can't handle when ah you know every single package going through a screener but what they can do and they are doing is training disorders and handlers to identify certain characteristics\nThat up a package that might flag packages potentially suspicious\nThat thinking about is is that they're just a drop in this in some public mailbox so they don't have to walk into a post office in and get whatever there is there's shipping weighed right 'cause they wind up on some sort of security camera is that what's happening\nRight essentially that's what's happening in I think that sort of the\nThe the way that the terrorists often to tend to do things according to the experts in so [noise]\nYou know for the handlers at the shipping companies what they need to look for are the you know basically a package that has so many stamps that you know no one would ever do this you know without\nA some sort of specific reason I'm obviously you know a sort of suspicious address labels or you know handwriting that sort of thing\nUm but you know the good news is any package that put on a plane is screened but the problem is a package that put on the truck is typically not screened that's awesome and ... times the the last line of defense is the handlers at the actual facilities themselves and luckily and all the cases so far they've been able to catch these packages\nFor speaking with USA Today business reporter Nathan booming you get a piece titled why suspected explosive devices are tough for us PS FedEx and UPS to detect um do we anticipate that ah this screening for truck delivery was going to get any better or is it seemed like an impossibility at this point\nWell I Do think that the technology is improving and they are capable of doing you know spot checks random checks so to speak [noise]\nUm and that's a good thing uh you know I I imagine that security protocols are likely tightening up in these facilities as we speak but UPS and FedEx wouldn't reveal their plans right now they consider that to be a security matter and so they don't really talk about it but I think\nUm I got to imagine that they're taking a look at their political here now my understanding is that all the packages that have been fighting so far were sent to the the mail\nThrough the post postal service and so um you know the postal service has investigators who they've deployed to try to ascertain exactly how these\nPackages go through 'em but the problem is ultimately you know tracking these can be very difficult and especially if they ever went to a screener to begin with um then you know there's just the value is just so significant\nThat it's tough to to stop it and that's why all to mainly um you know the less than the last line of defense is those you know the people in the mail room and so and the good news is the government certainly had the facilities to stop these also the private and private companies are\nI think it will really taking a close eye at these types of packages\nGiven the uh I guess technology developments that have occurred since then what about comparisons to a Ted Kaczynski the Unabomber [noise]\nYeah I mean I Know that you know what Ted

the country I'm the chief from being at the Republican incumbents and the district there is retiring [noise] um and so you've got a battle between a long time Republican in the state law or almost became a governor a few years ago\nAnd a brand new political candidate for time a candidate who is a pediatrician from the area and it's where she would play on districts across the country where the suburban\nWomen voters who are ... that risk of losing and the thing about this district which occur outside of Seattle is\nIs a GOP gonna lose those voters set a faster clip than um district was recently redrawn and faster than voters can keep up with the Republican\nI'm so there is a bit of that but also the Republicans in the suburbs I'm voting for Barbara updates like heart before and if they can keep them in the fold then that's where the Democrats have a problem with this district\nHave become above polling to indicate helping\nOut there's internal polling on both sides that show the Pacific time so both sides are convinced that it's going to come down to turn out and you see that playing out across the country where um it's really about who can mobilize voters are the most and we're seeing polls that a national polls that Democrats\nAre more energized than Republicans um and that's kind of turned off\nParts so ah the Democrat who's running your who's the pediatrician that's uh this is Kim Schrier ... okay so her she's been really hitting hard on healthcare stuff [noise]\nThat's right I mean she using it as a direct appeal to people who\nAre nervous about their health care costs that seeing their costs go up um and\nAh who have pre existing conditions [laughter] um and she feels from directly as a pediatrician in their community um she's got a thousand or patients that are in that district um she gives them after type ... diabetic herself as someone who has a preexisting condition [noise]\nUm and he's with that as part of her pledged to support that provision of Obamacare but it's a very direct appeal [noise] um that a Democrat from Washington state and in the capital bleed make her buried\nA compelling candidate speaking with Wall Street journal reporter Joshua ... and his piece is called outside Seattle an election battle between the countryside and new ... the eighth district there the Republican Dino Rossi his his issue is what I Do think he's been driving in particular\nBecause he's actually one of the Republican from they pass the expo last year they thought that it was going to be the number one issue on the campaign trail and coffee actually because the district so abhorrent feels that he can actually be\nOn message on there and he has tried to be and that is one thing that went canvassing with some of his peers and that is the thing that they push that chronic fires stump speeches um and the the\nPower of this district is will that be enough to keep some of these Republicans in the fold or will they send a check on Donald Trump to watch\nBecause this is a long held Republican district\nHas drawn in the Nineteen eighties after the census [laughter] I'm In Nineteen eighty and it has never been a Democrat to Washington or [noise] um but even though it has to come to your question I mean for the Democrats for President Clinton beat Donald Trump there by about three\nAnd a mistrial or you said is getting support actually from Seattle or should not have voters right\nRight that's really interesting I was trying I was out there I was trying to talk to people that live in a purse who live in a district and they kept telling me they were from Seattle uh ended up common um you see that in other races where people um even cross state lines forget it could get into it because they volunteer and money\nI'm sure this is just another example of that where people in Seattle districts are reliably democratic and if they want to be part of the blue wave\nFor what they think will be a blue wave I keep hearing about it on TV and the closer the way they can be part of it is to go to the swing district which is the only pops up or if I write about cookbook port in Washington state so there's a
