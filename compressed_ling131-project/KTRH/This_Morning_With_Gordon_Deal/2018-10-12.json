{"month": "10", "state": "TX", "station": "KTRH", "content": "Yeah I was wondering if there was any studies done on brain injury and\nUh and maybe it's not All right and\nIn Ninety two I had a cat and three and shortly after that I started at a freight trains and some of them became so disturbing that I pray to God that they were nice and and I haven't really had any\nMany brain injuries causing some of these things what do you think\nYes definitely um is also being found in a PBS the post traumatic stress disorder\nNews they John Travolta movie where I think he had a head injury and all of a sudden he was a loon aged into the paranormal what's psychic abilities\nSaint was that called Michael\nNo wasn't that one it was something else but I was a great movie but so you think sold that some kind of injury to the brain could augment your psychic abilities\nYes it it could I could open you left a different dimensions because I've I've heard of cases I Know of people who have had near death experiences and then when they recovered they become psychic and they're able to see or as ... to\nKnow predict the future and they have all kinds of psychic abilities which they never had before\nNext up let's go to Gary in Monterey, California Hi Jerry go ahead\nI uh I like their practices 'cause uh I'm a skeptical person and uh I've got degrees or ... degrees ... and I talked to physics engineering for a year or some kind of a you know that kinda gosh you're\nHowever uh I had a dream that seem to come true uh many years ago when I was in my thirties and a ... and ... says a ... that's disturbing you know are you a space and time\nUh right now doesn't seem to a law information flow backward in time so I thought I Would make myself an experimental subject and I tried for a year or two a record my dream and at first I tried a member of the seventies the portable tape recorders are kind of clunky\nMhm and uh and to record you'd have to hit two buttons I think like recording play at the same time right\nYeah so it turns out that was a nightmare like getting up at three in the morning\nAnd trying to hit the button so I went back and just writing things down on paper and of course then the problem is uh getting yourself up out of a dream I figured out a method for that that took me some of the road reliable\nAnd one night I had a very unusual dream or it doesn't seem unusual and then I decided but what happened later will be interesting\nAnd I ... is a I was a situation where I'm sitting with two other people and we're sitting outside it's some kind of a table\nAnd we're enjoying ourselves having like lunch or something and the one person in the mail and I feel very very close to him and comfortable with him and then there's a woman and I don't know her and uh at one point\nThe the nail says uh and we're outside some kind of a format outside I thought you know couldn't figure out the map\nBut anyway he says a [noise] a very I have to go to the bathroom you know where it is and I said no you know I Do too we were had been drinking a cup of their mind I thought I Do too\nAnd so uh yeah let's go look for it and and the dream rafter ... rock side but some kind of structure outside we walk up a couple of steps and then there's another walkway going both ways more cables and then I Would have a couple of them because like many levels and finally I said oh look a there the bathroom down there\nAnd so I'm walking ahead of them and the and the dream\nAnd I get to the door and I pushed the bathroom door open and there and I'm trying to not be grossed about this but there I see something unusual and it was is in men's room have toilets of course we're you know the doors closing and you're going to vote and then they have you're All right\nSomeone had an error no gun number two\nIn other words [laughter] [noise] so I stopped in my tracks and and he ran in can be the cello and my parents\nAnd he said what are you doing and I know somebody is often here and in Haiti and at that point I had\nA lot of fun getting a college were recruited all over the middle east and ah and and the rage I'm not in Asia Japan on my right\nAnd so I said well you know maybe hurt them another culture who didn't have it and and you know he ... that would apply to go to the bathroom now okay so I wake up\nAnd I thought that we can write that down in some detail I Walk I thought okay so that's like on a Monday I'm almost out of time here so I got to push a\nCouple of days later I get a call from an old friend of mine and how by the we were

rates continue to rise and that's likely not good news for the housing market joining us to talk about interest rates and housing is Laura ... this to the wall Street Journal Laura where we stand in terms of the thirty year fixed rate mortgage\n... four point nine percent for a thirty year fixed rate mortgage and certainly what we're hearing on the ground talking to lenders and real estate agents is a at this point if you want to get below five percent you better have pristine credit and twenty percent doubt I'm increasingly five percent rates are becoming the norm\nA year ago at this time the average rate for eight thirty or fix to us just about three point nine percent now four point nine percent that's a full percentage point higher that is a bigger difference for buyers in terms of a monthly mortgage payment is it not\nYeah absolutely you're talking about you know a hundred and fifty dollars for a typical you know two hundred and fifty thousand dollar home but uh and a lot of places in New York California you're talking about an even bigger difference and even bigger I'm more of a blow to the housing market there\nYears ago we saw rates like Eighteen percent that makes five percent sound low but that's not the case for young first time buyers today I guess\nYeah absolutely I think even I'm a I'm a little bit younger uh and even though I cover this all the time and I know that right to to be cheaper than a it's hard for you to imagine the environment like that I think most people\nHave grown up certainly as adults I'm seeing rates in a three to four percent range and so even though five percent is actually historically pretty normal ah it's going to feel like I think a a shift for people\nNow the mortgage Bankers Association says there's a pain threshold around six percent do you agree\nYeah I mean I I that's certainly what I've heard that the ... than is the point where we are likely to see the housing market really meaningful slow down and I don't think we're going to get there all that soon\nHum with that said though I think that we are observing that the market is a lot more interest rate a center that than it has been in the past that I think one of the reasons is what we just touch on that we have younger people who don't remember rates famous high\nAnd I think the second is because we saw a huge run up and prices when rates were low and I and so I think by or they're already more strength and they often happen in the past\nWe're speaking with Laura ... from the wall Street Journal Laura are the high rates of negative for the refinancing picture\nOh yeah I mean we I mean I don't know who is refinancing their home at this point uh the the average homeowner has a rate of I Want to say it's about three point seven five percent something like that maybe around three point nine but anyway a full percentage point at least below where rates are now I'm so\nThere are no the the odd person out there maybe they just had to get their credit score up or something like that but there is almost nobody anymore who has a strong incentive to refinance\nWhat about home sellers are they being asked to reduce the asking price\nSo we're certainly seeing that anecdotally overall on an annual if you look at it compared to last year prices are still growing up price growth is slowing and I am definitely ... some of these more\nExpensive markets um but I went to somebody hotter markets generally Seattle Dallas Denver a New York we're seeing or hearing more and more up a price productions\nSo what does this mean for the home buying outlook going forward\nI think it means that you bought a home good for you [laughter] I think if you're still looking to buy a I think it's a challenging time especially I mean we thought this is the biggest jump we've seen in rates in two years um and prices aren't going to go on and are going to reflect that right away prices are still high um but I Do think for buyers that just got\nExhausted I'm far from a bidding war Roseanne cash buyers and the real friends say that we've had in the market that has really cold and so I think for buyers want\nA little bit more of a leisurely market and they can sit down and figure out what monthly payment makes sense for them and uh and maybe adjust their prices down we're in a bad I think it can be a good time to buy\n[noise]

for days school schedules are starting to spread across the country to nail hubs of the wall Street Journal joins us now to talk about this trend to know how widespread is the day school week\nYou know it's really growing you know we and I actually reached out to every state all fifty states in DC and I came back with six hundred at least six hundred school districts\nAre doing this in at least twenty two states and just a decade ago that number was about a hundred and twenty school districts so it's really growing it's getting more and more popular and it's you know it's been really on the western side of the map but now it's going east\nWhy has it been mostly in the western part of the state so far\n[noise] you know I Know that's a really good question and where I'm from just talking to different educators it looks like it's more of a geographical situation there where you have\nYou know more district spread out more rural districts because this is something that started in rural districts in is still very dominant in rural districts and um there's just a lot of lot more rural districts out west\nTurnout why did the rural districts decided to go to the four day week\nIt all goes to saving money and when you're in a rural district and you're really spread out east you can spend a good chunk of your budget on transportation because everybody's really spread out\nAnd I'm so initially it's always about saving money and then they started noticing other benefits like wow you know teachers are really attracted to having a three day weekend despite what recruiting and some of the rural areas sometimes it's hard to recruit teachers out there\nI also saw one of the benefits and your story as you were absences that would be a huge one\n[noise] yes and that's it and now they're unexpected benefits that some of these districts initially going into it to save money or is that why you know what it really does help for the kids get three day weekends and you know they're showing up in the same thing with teachers you know there are noticing fewer teacher absences\nWe're speaking with Panetta hubs of the wall Street Journal now if you're a shrinking the week to four days do you add hours to the other days\nYes that's what they're doing there at an hours and you know and some of these districts they had already met the minimum required hours for instruction so you know they might add anywhere from Fifteen minutes a day to Ninety minutes a day it just depends on where they were at when they started\nWhen they when they were all five days if they were already seat in the hours that there is just\nBasically add in time at the end of that day\nThat each state decide its own hours and days I Know here in New Jersey kids have to be in school a certain number of days not ours\n[laughter] yes and and exactly and that I'm ... and it's easier for states and Iran each state does decide you know how many hours kids are going to be in school\nAnd I noticed that the states that have the four days are those states that basically look at ours they don't care\nYou know how many days you're in school they just want you you know the the you know to be in a school for the year for a thousand eighty hours or whatever\nAnd there are some states that still\nTo base it on how many days you're in school and those are the states that it's a bit harder to go to for a day on those states because they look at days instead of ours the ones that look at our ... you know we don't care what your schedule live just make sure your kids you know have this many hours of instruction for the year\nI Would think that there would be some opposition to this plan from parents who have to scramble around to find care for their kid on that and the day\n[laughter] yeah and that's always the big issue daycare daycare on that day and what I found is a lot of these districts that go to a four day\nThey typically have something in place rather they open up some of the schools on that friday and they offer like a discount at day care and some of them actually offer free daycare or there's nonprofits that have like relatively cheap daycare and the\nAnd the school district might provide the meals\nA day to those nonprofit certain in some cases the school district actually might open up on that friday just to serve milk because there are some\nVery poor communities where that might be the only meal the child might be getting you know during the during that a school day period so a daycare has been a really big issue but you know and I went to Colorado where a more than fifty percent of the districts that use it for a day\nAnd and talking to those parents there were a lot of them I talked to that initially did not want it but then they just they just grew to love it it's you know it's you know let them take kind of a mini vacation if they want to you know get away for an extended weekend with the family and a lot of um parents",
