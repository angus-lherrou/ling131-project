station up very shortly\nNow they're doing the types of things that maybe twenty Thirty years ago we as the United states were were just talking about I'm beginning to do while they're rapidly catching up and you know this is caught our attention that's why\nYou know the president and the Pentagon and wrote a national defense strategy that focus like a laser on Russia and China as untrue competitors are near peer competitors across the board\nAnd it's not not just the military it's economic it's diplomatic ah\nIt's all these other areas that show national capability and national power and we're finding that our adversaries are are doing quite well thank you\nHow concerned should we be with the fact that Google arguably one of the most powerful companies in the world\nI knew a monopoly on the distribution of dissemination of information or appears to be in bed with the government of the People's Republic of China and is helping them [noise] censor information in that country\nAnd they're manipulating algorithms so that they\nCan monitor their own population and of course they won't negotiate any longer with the Pentagon on you know those types of things on the use of the cloud et cetera\nUm that that's disturbing um you know they are a U.S company and you would think that uh they would have some allegiance to this country and not become a pawn in the hands of the communist leadership in Beijing and yet that's exactly what they're\nDoing I suppose to a certain degree because they see a rising Chinese economic power and they want to be part of the success of that\nA country you know they will you know by a lot of estimates um be the world's leading economic powerhouse by twenty thirty five you know somewhere around there um and\nUnless something dramatically happens in a very different way they're going to achieve that they're going to have\nA leverage using what I outlined earlier the belt and road initiative which is pouring hundreds and billions of you know maybe a trillion and a half\nAcross the world and arguably at least sixty eight countries where they're buying infrastructure and thereby markets and they're controlling information flow you know you I see the the Internet and what can be used and what can be so they're strategically doing some very bright very smart things\nUh but when you look at their autocratic regimes and their president for life under President Xi and the amendment of their constitution and you're seeing something similar\nUnder putting with the possibility of ruling for a long period of

school week Wall Street journal says more schools are adopting a four day schedule to save money and attract teachers here's this weekend's Jennifer ...\nIt saves money and it retains teachers for days school schedules are starting to spread across the country to know how to the wall Street Journal joins us now to talk about this trend how widespread is this for day school week\nYou know it's really growing you know we and I actually reached out to every state all fifty states in DC and I came back with six hundred at least six hundred school districts\nAre doing this in at least twenty two states and just a decade ago that number was about a hundred and twenty school districts so it's really growing it's getting more and more popular and it you know it's been really on the western side of the map but now it's going east\nWhy has it been mostly in the western part of the state so far\nYou know that and that's a really good question and where I'm from just talking to different educators it looks like it's more of a geographical situation there where you have\nYou know more district spread out more rural districts because this is something that started in rural districts in is still very dominant erode districts\nAnd um there's just a lot of lot more rural districts out west\nSo now why did the rural districts decided to go to the four day week\nIt all goes to saving money and when you're in a rural district and you're really spread out east you can spend a good chunk of your budget on transportation because everybody's really spread out\nAnd I'm so initially it's always about saving money and then they started noticing other benefits like wow you know teachers are really attracted to having a three day weekend despite what recruiting and some of the rural areas sometimes it's hard to recruit teachers out there\nI also saw one of the benefits and your story as you were absences that would be a huge one\nYes and that's it now they're unexpected benefits that seventies districts initially going into it to save money or is that why you know what it really does help for the kids to get three day weekends and you know they're showing up in the same thing with teachers you know their notice and fewer teacher absence as\nWe're speaking with on al hubs or the wall Street Journal now if you're shrinking the week to four days do you add hours to the other days\nYes that's what they're doing there at an hours and you know and some of these districts they had already met the minimum uh required hours for instruction so you know they might add anywhere from Fifteen minutes a day to Ninety minutes a day\nIt just depends on where they were at when they started when they when they were all five days if they were already exceeding the hours there is just\nBasically add in time at the end of that day\nThat does each state decide its own hours and or days I Know here in New Jersey kids have to be in school a certain number of days not ours\n[laughter] yes and and exactly and that I'm ... and it's easier for states and Iran each state does decide you know how many hours kids are going to be in school\nAnd I noticed that the states that have the four days are those states that basically look at ours they don't care\nYou know how many days you're in school they just want you you know the the you know to be in a school for the year for a thousand eighty hours or whatever\nAnd there are some states that still do base it on how many days you're in school and those are the states that it's a bit harder to go to for a day on those states because they look at days instead of ours the ones that look at our says you know we don't care what your schedule live just make sure your kids you know\nHave this many hours of instruction for the year\nI Would think that there would be some opposition to this plan from parents who have to scramble around to find care for their kid on that empty day\n[laughter] yeah and that's always the big issue daycare daycare on that day and uh what I found is a lot of these districts that go to a four day they typically have something in place rather they open up some of the

how could it potentially handled accusations from the Nineteen eighties\n[noise] well I I I think that that that what it would do it we'd go again in ... and and certainly would take the evidence that
