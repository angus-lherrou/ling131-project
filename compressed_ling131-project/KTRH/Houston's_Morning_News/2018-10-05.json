Bush badly but I mean they they practically into praised him compared to what they're doing to Donald Trump it's the most antagonistic\nAnd obstructionist press that I've ever seen but I was a kid in the eighties I didn't see how they treated President Reagan but I've read a little bit about it and can you can draw some some parallels to the way the fourth estate interest treated that conservative of the father of modern conservative president compared to what they're doing to Trump\n[noise] well yeah I mean the the media coverage during the ... was was extremely hostile as well uh you know I think with Trump if it's up to a new level that I don't think we have seen before\nBut with Reagan I mean it was it was constant you know are just you know you had the one of the iconic things with the I had Sam Donaldson out they're always like shouting questions at Reagan you know\nThe most hostile questions and um yeah that was that was a common occurrence and you know with with under Reagan it was they they would you know come up with the the sort of the silliest controversies that they can think of\nUm you know talking about you know we talked about sort of Nancy Reagan and oh she is into strategy and all this kind of stuff and I mean they would just uh you know manufacture\nA every controversy they could think of\nJust to go after the Reagan Administration and then of course you know you have the Iran Contra situation and you know the media just went all in trying to basically take down the Reagan Administration over that issue [laughter]\nSo um yeah the media hostility toward ... goes back for decades and again I think it's it is re ... as you said a completely new level\nYou know again you're still a democracy because it's not just the hostility they show in the way they cover things said things that they leave out that may have a positive spin\nYou know the first lady has been often Africa travelling by herself either solo trip out of the country and she's

vote if you ran all the procedural traps on Saturday if McConnell didn't think he had the votes he probably shouldn't have done this\nOr maybe he's confident he does have the votes that's unclear Mitch McConnell did say a couple of weeks ago that there was going to be a vote on Brett Kavanaugh pass or fail\nThree Republican senators are seen as the key there the swing votes do the Kavanaugh's

even intimidation on these swing voters over the weekend to get them to cave Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh meantime defending his behavior does he have\nTo he's defending his record as well\nBefore the Senate Judiciary committee he did an op ed piece that was published by the wall Street Journal and Kevin I'd miss it yeah he might have been too emotionally times but he also pointed out that he was a man and defense and not only his life his reputation but that of his wife his children his daughters\nAnd even his mother the judges critics say his temperament is another reason to keep them off the court but Kavanaugh in his op ed piece also pointed out his record as a judge and how on emotional and how unbiased and how he is always pledged to follow the law\nHe's been publicly called a serial rapists for three solid weeks how dare him get angry at such things\nI agree and I am basically he said as his comments and his emotion wrecked ... reflected is overwhelming

talking about Trump's daily battles with the media and now some historians liken it to the friction that Ronald Reagan faced in office\nMuch like Trump President Reagan faced daily attacks from the media yet he's considered one of the best presidents of the country has ever seen\nReagan dealt with it but really smartly orchestrating his moments in time in order to be creative enough for the
