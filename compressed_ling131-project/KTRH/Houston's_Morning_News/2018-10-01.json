we thought were the number even legal ... right\nUm I personally and I think most people who look at this don't think it's plausible number because we have other data\nI'm getting back to that sense if if it would have to mean that instead of the Census Bureau missing like a million people\nIt miss ten or twelve million people and the reason we don't think that's true is we other data we can compare it to so for example the there's us that that American Community Survey acts people hey did you have a kid in the last year they they asked women that\nAnd you get about four million women in the survey said they had a kid in the last year well that's exactly what the birth certificate records show and most every birth in the United states is recorded even to those to illegal immigrants because everybody knows you need to have the birth record it if you want your kid to have citizenship\nUm and it's all done pretty automatically hospitals so it doesn't line up and we we we when we look at the I mean does line up the American Community Survey shows the right number very roughly a person in the United states\nIf there were this many illegal immigrants in the United states they have to be given what we know about illegal immigrants about three hundred thousand more births in the United states which there's not we can also compare to school enrollment figures and again that the census asked the Census Bureau in in its surveys ask things like\nDo you have a kid and is your kid enrolled in school and is that a public school and again when we compare that to administrative data how many kids are actually enrolled in school it's not way off\nSo it doesn't look like the census status way off in the sense is that is how we normally estimate illegal immigration and so it doesn't seem like there could possibly be all these extra people in the United states\nI can give you other reasons but that's a pretty good one that the census data when we check it out compared administrative data is not way off\nSo that I had good name sir headline no didn't it if it's your dead\nSmart professionals who deal don't always get a writer gives All right Steven ... thank you
