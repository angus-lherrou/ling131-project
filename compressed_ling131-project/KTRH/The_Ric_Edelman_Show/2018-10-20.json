course Social Security\nSo these are the two aspects of today's limited time offer and investing sense dot com and Andy ... one of the reasons why we're running this free offer is because of the risky strategy that some Americans are applying when it comes to Social Security\nSo there's a there's kind of a good and bad to this nine you're bull market I obviously it's great to see the market do what it's doing but unfortunately this nine year ... market has encouraged some Americans to claim Social Security early\nAnd then they turn around and invest the money\nBut the thing is this could be a huge mistake because you know claiming Social Security before your full retirement age actually reduces the amount of money that you could be receiving a you could be missing out on what is it like basically a guaranteed increase over a couple of years which is what happens when you wait\nAnd you know if you're still working while you claim benefits before full retirement age Social Security is actually going to reduce your benefits even more\nSo so I mean think about it you can't get an increase like this than any other investment period and this is from a guy who you know make a living

N. D. amount what you're going to do is that you're going to add up all of your pre tax accounts\nYour traditional i._r._a. your role over IRA your four one K. if you're not working are you still working right now are you actively contributing to an employer plan\nOr I Am not working part time only but I'm not contributing to an important ...\nOkay so if you were working you would be able to exclude that current four one K.\nBut you're going to add up all your pre tax accounts traditional i._r._a. roll over four one K. you are not going to add the Ross IRA value in your calculation\nUm so what you basically have the pre tax you're going to exclude the Ross ah and then this is actually when we're building um when we're building income plans for people we look at different and distinct uh categories of investments the pre tax the raw or the brokerage account any savings\nAnd so as we're trying to figure out how to you know get people that paycheck that retirement pay check the the money will come from different places\nNow have you ever thought about so you've got this Ross and you've got the pre tax accounts have you ever gone through any sort of Ross conversion calculation have you ever considered anything along those lines\nWere not on a heck of a considered it I'm done on okay about four years ago and I'm I'm going to be doing another one because\nThis is my last year I saw the seven and a half next year I'm going to a second raw conversion from a traditional our right\nThat the issue that kind of um the sidelines a lot of people is that so what what happens with these Ross conversions is you have these pre tax amounts you effectively take a distribution I. E. earned income for whatever you want to move from the pre tax Ira over to the Ross\nSo a lot of different factors um\nYou know kind of old way on the viability of this move what your taxes are now what they're going to be later your overall financial situation but the thing that trips up a lot of people as their ability or inability to pay taxes on the distribution with outside of the IRA money\nSo as long as you have the ability to pay that tax burden with outside the IRA money and as long as you've gone through the calculations you should be fine okay great great awesome will Thomas thanks for calling the show and a really have a great week thank you very much\nNow it's time for this week's portfolio review and this is where Andy dives deeply into a portfolio that's been sent to us\nAnd this week Andy's review has a Social Security twist to it and that's perfect because we're trying to help Americans today with a limited free offer for a portfolio review that includes a Social Security analysis\nNow a reminder make sure you consult with an advisor before acting on anything that we discuss and you can find a local advisor by going to investing sense dot com\nSo now this week's review Larry sent us his portfolio and he writes\n... if you plan to take Social Security and you have a sizable four one K. does the draw from the four oh one K. impact Social Security payments suppose I make Fifteen thousand dollars part-time draw Social Security and pull sixty thousand dollars how will that sixty thousand dollars impact Social Security\nHey great question Larry let me tell ya Larry's got pretty cool story we went back and forth over email the first thing that I asked Larry was when is all of this going to come together you've got his reply\nTo yeah he said I plan to retire in the next eight to Nineteen months I'm sixty one I'll be sixty two in January and I want to work part time next year I have about one point four million in a four one K. and three hundred thousand in cash\nI Know if I go over a certain cap while on Social Security I'm I'm not going to get the full benefit\nRight so the rule that Larry is referencing only applies when you reach full retirement age and that's when your earnings no longer reduce your benefits no matter how much you earn now\nIf you're younger then full retirement age and you make more than the annual earnings limit your earnings me actually reduce your benefits so it's based on this for retirement age right for Americans born between Nineteen forty three and Nineteen fifty for your full retirement age is sixty six\nA beginning with you guys are born in Nineteen fifty five two months or added for every ... year until the full retirement age reaches sixty seven for Americans born in Nineteen sixty or later so what\nAre the ... to the benefits in case you reach the earnings limit\nIf you're under full retirement age for the whole year\nSocial Security ... a dollar from your benefits for every two dollars that you earn above the annual limit and for twenty Eighteen that limit is Seventeen thousand forty dollars\nNow if you can imagine it gets a little bit more complex in the year you reach full retirement age Social Security the ducks the dollar and benefits for every three dollars that you earn above the limit for twenty Eighteen that limit is forty five thousand three hundred sixty dollars but they only count earnings before the month that you reach", "show_name": "The Ric Edelman Show", "year": "2018", "city": "Houston", "day": "20"}
