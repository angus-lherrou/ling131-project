Penn that it's going to make the pet and harder to get that what I'm hearing\nIt can extinguisher rights around the world okay I'm now in the U.S here we get a basically a one year grace period so if you were to start selling something and then think why should protect it it's too late in France it's too late in Japan but in the U.S you have up to one year where you can still try for Penn protection but a vast way\nCome to one of us beforehand let's see if we get a protected before you sell it and that includes an offer for sale on your website okay if you put on your website and say five Ninety nine hundred bucks whatever and make it so they can buy it even if they don't buy it you still offered for sale it's still starts triggering this bar no kidding\nWow that's a small line you need to be aware of\nRemembered that exchange why would they give you this explosive right if you've already given it to the public\nThat's interesting now to talk to me a little bit about like go fund to me and things like that because I've seen hundreds of better mouse traps or something that is they're trying to raise funds clearly they don't have enough money to hire an attorney yet right is that\nConstrued as an offer for sale because they kind of are right\nNow are they offering the invention for sale like if if I were to offer you equity in my company let's say you give me ten thousand dollars and I give you five percent of my company that like on shark tank that's not an offer for self or the invention\nNo you're you're right on that I I guess and and I don't remember specifically but but it seems like some of these is prepaid pre by one and and then we'll finish production for will finish development over then you'll get one of the first ones that is an offer for sale really though well they're not buying equity they're buying a product\nIt seems to me what you're really doing there is donating money at us as part of like a prize you know sixty nine hundred and twenty days later they'll send you something\nOkay fair now All right I got this ... and you're right that would not be be for sale was something you mentioned that uh brings up a great question is the international aspect strike one of those ... uh problems in business right now is a lower labor market type countries China\nAh taking\nIntellectual property and and essentially copying reverse engineering stealing and and producing coming in and competing against a U.S firms or talk to me about some of the international so so you get a pet in the United states that doesn't mean anything and track right\nThat's correct you can only on force your padded rights against a Chinese company using a Chinese fat and and vice versa they can't stop you from doing anything with the Chinese pat and they have to have a U.S Patton to stop you here\nThat's why when I talk to people who are thinking about innovating and like you you definitely want to think about a U.S patent because this is one of your biggest markets but also thinking about Mexico or as I think about it for hours that way you know you might wanna think about Canada they're right here on the north America it's like why does will get that one too\nBut you should also think about ... ... depending on your industry if you're a pharmaceutical maybe China isn't as big of an issue shortage here textiles Taiwan, China should be considered major players\nInteresting and and you understand and it can navigate that those type of issues and ... and handle some of these things\nFor absolute company so what we can do for example this is one option for proceeding if we can follow what's called a PC T application this acts as an international place holder so we get together um I Walk through how how best to protect their invention and give them or a proposal\nOnce we do that if they decide to go forward I'm going to help them either drafter claims I'm going to help them described their invention in such a way is to be compliant with the international community\nWe follow the PC T application they have about two and a half years\nWhere um they're they're basically protected it'll be published in Eighteen months sure but it's gonna be protected for about two and a half years while they decide which markets to go into the PC T acts like an international place holder and tells the world I came up with at first I own this don't do it\nBut when you do when you once you've raised money after about two and a half years you can say I want to go into the U. S. I Want to go into Europe I Want to go into China and then you can pay those costs later on 'cause that's expensive here about a thousand dollars\nJust to entry fees per country so if you're like I Want to own a get a pat and those three\n... you know it might cost you a thousand per se which will take a lot of race that kind of money but in the meantime you're selling for two and a half years you've been selling and if your thinking wow this is something that this is only like ... I cannot lose this is my major product line sure does process is worth its weight in gold\nOkay but if you're if you're looking at this thinking well if selling All right I don't know that I'd actually want to try to sue somebody and shined overhead is just too expensive sure don't bother\nSo let me ask a question that if I understood Gerard if you have a product that you made and you're showing that may be to a big farm in Texas which isn't all farm Halliburton or somebody like that and you've you discovered that\nListening to them this is very unique nobody else on the market as it gets to like you've already so too is that right\nYou have a one year grace period so if you start showing the Halliburton tomorrow you have up to one year to try to fall for a patent apple ... interesting stuff goes up\nYou know we we're out of time though a child's law William child's PHD a chemistry attorney patent attorney child fat log dot com is website thank you very much for joining us they very informative unfortunately that has all the time we were going to go get smart on something else brings a whole bunch more\nNext week in the meantime or go to Texas business radio dot coms through the entire thing and beautiful ... video get your questions in a by phone by website by Twitter wheelchair I get 'em and go ahead and get 'em in for next week we're going to get experts in here to get those questions answered\nA same time same place next week we'll see them [noise]\n\n\nAnd you lose business uses the entire show is beautiful\nIn Israel dot com next week\nVegas\nMatt register your your host of Texas business radio [noise] have you thought about how you look on linked in\nDo you need to generate qualified leaves your business hire some new talent to market your brand of course you do when you need to make sure you're working with people who know linked in internal advisory they're linked in practitioner specialist coaches trainers they either teach you how to fish or they fish for you\nYeah you can show you how to leverage linked in for your branding sales and recruiting\nOr they can just do it for you remember linked in his business not social that's why we work with ... advisory check them out today in terror advisor ... advisory dot com and ... advisory dot com\nEither back leapt your Bentley inscribed in Houston based transactional attorney serving businesses in their principles for over thirty five years in the area is a general business all mergers and acquisitions commercial real estate nonprofit ... from one generation to the next ties are back learn more adviser back dot com\nAre our immediate Texas' from your video production company for business and you are not connecting with your clients are video your competitor and contact them now at our our ... media dot com and see how easy it is to get started are aren't you a media dot com R.

I don't know what Fifteen Years\nAnd we are in fact finding\nBack in a wage that was about a half a trillion\nInvested in each yes that was you know ten years ago today it's not half a trillion it's three point four trillion dollars that investors have placed into ATF\nAnd that is exciting it shows that hey you're getting the message that's that's really fabulous you're paying attention to diversification you're paying attention to investment costs\nAre and you're staying up to date with the investment opportunities which maybe aren't the same as what you grow up with and what you were familiar with but you've accepted the need to adapt\nAnd stay current with the marketplace so I think that's a really very exciting\nOr is it\nIf we take a look at data that has just come out from a a recent survey\nBack ten years ago to the credit crisis of two thousand eight you know it's great that ATF sky rocketed in in value from five hundred billion to three point four trillion you know part of that as market appreciation of course but a big part of it is your contributions into each year\nSo as well but not everybody's been taking advantage of that and I'm not just saying that they're not taking advantage of ATF themselves\nThey're not taking advantage of investing at all\nTen years after the crisis we discover according to this latest survey research that twenty seven percent of Americans stopped saving for retirement they stopped contributing\nTo their four one K. entirely they were so spooked by two thousand eight they lost so much money so rapidly\nThat scared them out of the markets apparently for ever twenty seven percent one out of four Americans no longer saving for their future and fourteen percent have continued to save what they're doing so in\nCash oh my goodness so instead of\nWatching their investments triple and values since two thousand nine I mean that's what the stock market has done its tripled in value instead they've been earning less than one percent a year because that's what you know bank accounts have been paying over the last ten years zero point nothing only ten percent of people in the survey said they invest more today than they were\nIn two thousand eight two thirds are saving less today than they were and\nAlmost eighty percent say they can't explain what happened in the financial crisis they don't get it they don't understand what occurred\nAnd so it's no wonder that Seventy eight percent trust Wall Street less than they did in two thousand eight and only forty one percent say they feel fully recovered financially in the face of an economic expansion unraveled in American history\nWith the stock market tripling and values since the depths of two thousand nine\nThe majority of Americans still say that they are in behind where they were ten years ago and you know what the biggest crisis is about all of that\nEverybody's ten years older everybody's ten years closer to retirement and that's the big problem\nAnd just permeates through out American society regardless of age group according to another survey forty six percent of millennials said they believed that they need at least a thousand dollars to start investing Seventeen percent say they think they need at least ten thousand dollars\nTo start investing that selectively true anymore due to advanced technology you can invest\nYou can open in account with the dollar not a thousand not ten thousand now I'm not suggesting you should necessarily do that before you joined your retirement plan at work or before you pay off credit card debt or before you Bill cash reserves but the point is it doesn't take a lot of money anymore to build investments\nAnd oh by the way\nA lot of parents are are not saving a lot either it's not just the millennials but the millennials parents that aren't saving a lot and you know one big reason for that\nI'm going to tell you when we come back\nHere on the Rick idleman show I'm going to tell

[noise]\n\nBack to the record on the show we were talking in the last segment about the Donald shooting amount of money the parents are spending on their kids who are in their twenties and thirties\nAnd how it's impacting the parent's ability to save for their own retirement and how kids are now recognizing that they're struggling with their own personal finances but it's not just\nThe parents are damaging their own financial security for the benefit of their kids and that their kids are scared that they're not going to be able to accumulate enough money on their own\nThere's another survey that shows the reversal of this that it's going back up line\nSixty four percent of teenagers according to a new survey by junior achievement sixty four percent of teenagers are concerned about their parent's ability to retire\nSo in other words mom and dad you're doing a great job doing whatever it takes to support your children\nAnd you know what your children know it even to the point that your teenagers are worried about your financial future\nAnd what's really so fascinating about this whole thing is that even those sixty four percent of teens two thirds are worried about their parents preparedness for retirement\nSixty nine percent of teenagers\nSay they know little or nothing about financial planning well actually I think they know a lot more than they realize if they're worried about their parent's ability to save for retirement and their parents ability to in fact retire in financial comfort in security\nWell that's what financial planning is all about and teenagers are looking at you mom and dad and they're worried about you\nFirst of all I think there's something a little bit wrong with our country of teenagers are worrying about their parents' financial security but that's a whole another conversation but here's the problem teenagers in fact\nAs we pointed out earlier on the program today they know very little about personal finance one third of teenagers according to the survey by junior achievement one third of teenagers I Hope you're sitting down for this\nAnd if you're driving the car you might want to pull over as I give you this was a strict one third of teenagers believe they will need less than five thousand dollars in order to retire [noise]\nOh my goodness gracious they think they're going to need five grand or less in order to retire\nA hello I'm so clearly kids have no reasonable conception of what life cost they don't understand how expensive cars are or houses or food or health insurance\nThey have no clue and you know why because mom and dad\nYou haven't told them a ... thing so my recommendation my advice for you mom and dad is next time you sit down to pay your bills have your teenager sit along side you have them write the checks on your behalf out of your checking account when you're balancing your checkbook letting them participate\nIn games with them when the time you go talking about investments include them in a conversation your kids are worried about this\nAnd maybe they don't need to be as worried you know kids are grown up with a lot of stress and strife they've got challenges dealing with issues you and I never had to deal with when we were growing up school shootings and and massive drug epidemics and oh my goodness gracious the whole political environment and yet\nThe last thing we need to do is to pile on with them worried about your\nRetirement security so I think the time has come to eliminate that last taboo\nIn American society you know we're willing to talk politics with our kids ruined his talk religion with our kids were willing to talk sex with our kids it's time we started talking about money with our kids as well\nHey let's go to our asks Rick segments as you know You're welcome to send me your questions and an audio file just use your smartphone to record your own voice send it to me by email to ...\nAt ... dot com we had two questions this week on the very same subject which is kinda weird but here's the first one from caster you remember him he's from Brazil you call this a couple of weeks ago there was a castor has to say Hi ray\nCares Custer against from Brazil you seemed a little bit surprised with affects that to your show was listening to all kinds of other us\nBut I think it really showed that because of course I don't pay much attention when they talk about for one case Roth IRAs and stuff like that because the roads here are totally different but\nI Do remember Pina when it comes to principals like financial responsibility a diversification etc location dollar cost averaging or or in my case ... and my question is about one of those general principles budget\nIf I'm not mistaken you said here answer shows that budgeting is not a very good use of someone's time but wells take a look at my case for instance I have two daughters one is eight to ... to ... years old\nThe youngest one would go to a profit school next year just like the oldest so far I've been able to save a little more literal both twenty percent of my income\nBut was this extra expense if I don't make it just meant or want to be able to save as much and I'm going to be saving about ... much of what I'm saving all end all I'd like to avoid it without being lied\nOn starting to work on my budget for two thousand Nineteen so I can see where it can cut the expense of my income is pretty much in this study I Can't do much about it [noise]\nThe shore and part of the costs but obviously everybody knows that the cost of healthcare keeps going up\nAll ... did you talk to go sing you come up with this blueprint for ha charge that model left or something else\nWell there are other health care cooperatives out there\nBut I'm just using this as a model I've done several things in addition to just having the model the healthcare cooperative such as um trying to uh take get patients that really want to be healthy to try to\nPut physical fitness into the equation to get people to follow a healthy diet exercise or\nReduce stress all those types of things to try to get the patience to do their part and then we want to try to also lower health care costs by negotiating prices for cash prices right we can do pretty well it's lowering prices by doing that\nSo many patients in the group so far\nWell uh I have about fifty patients so\nPhil ... and ... and how long is the Houston health care initiative been up and running well just a couple of months oh okay wow okay and do the patients get to choose their doctors in the hospitals that go to court okay yeah it is kind of it's still a self pay ultimately right\nYes in other words what we do is we negotiate prices for tests and procedures in laboratory data\nAnd we put it up on a website for the members to look at people can negotiate their own prices and if they get a good deal from a doctor or procedure but they know they got good service but can they can share it with the group so everybody can benefit\nYeah my wife and I actually tripped over an opportunity to sell papers to memorize years ago where the original agreement between the insurance company in us and the provider\nWas it about twelve hundred dollars and the self pay was three hundred well that's it yeah okay not to have a payment work after upon them doctors want to get paid right after that how how do you pay up if you're in the initiative\nWill we have two two features one of the trust account that that's where we share the expenses and trustworthy expensive costs\nAnd then we have a health savings accounts to pay for routine caution you get a debit card there and you can use that to pay right at the time of service and of course doctors appreciate that they get paid right away\nOr in the whole thing is over with and you can get a much better price\nSo that the Houston health care initiative is essentially it's more of a a negotiating body that's doing two things were number one encouraging patient health in fact almost requiring it really and then and then negotiating on on behalf of the patients for better rights is that about ...\nRi don't require okay a patience to be healthy what we do is we try to provide financial incentives for ... yeah to be healthy fair enough and then try to coach patients and try to help patients to become healthy\nFor instance let's say somebody is a smoker well the cost extra sure we're gonna try\nBy using that financial incentive to say okay if you quit you're going to get a much lower rate for your a monthly payment into the trust fund\nDr Steven ... with us on a fifty plus here so are are from Houston health care initiative so or when you go to doctors and say hey we want you to be part of our deal and they typically receptive to what you offer\nWell I don't know any doctor that doesn't take can\nPoint that's a very good point\nBut now let's let's back up and talk about how you sign up and what it entails to be become part of the initiative\nWill if you're interested to sign up uh you can call and make an appointment we have a free annual physical so you'll get blood work and we measured the routine insurance things like your height your weight your blood pressure and things like that\nAnd try to identify any diseases\nThat need to be a taking care of\nWe also have a requirement that you can walk a mile a thirty minute it's not a high bar no\nOn the other hand you need to do that and if you can't do that I have one word for you\nAnd that is practiced as a very good point so you you get this this baseline physical when you come on board for for obvious reasons for the the initiatives that insurance as well as the patients and and what about pre existing conditions though\nThat's not a problem okay ... in other words if if let's say you have diabetes okay well that's fine but you need to follow the diet you need to take your medicine and you need to control your him a globe and they want to see you get the same price that everybody else if you don't recharge you extra\nAnd we can bring the whole family on board I present of course was good enough but what about cost ... ... how how is how do we how much do we have to pay and how long has this last\nWell of course it's it's a complicated question to answer for for everything right but with the age of fifty to fifty five\nThat's a good that's a good starting point for this audience let me tell you\nExactly uh\nThe trust fund cost is a hundred and eighty dollars a month okay and they say is a hundred dollars a\nMonth in nature say of course belongs to you it's your money if you don't spend that you have it there the next year\nThe hundred and eighty dollars from the trust fund and that belongs to the health care initiative and the sense but this is member own and not for profit if there is money left over the trust from we have a subscriber\nSavings account for that money goes into your account pro router and it builds up over time and so what we're hoping this going to happen is that builds up your premium the amount of money you have to put into the trust fund in the future will go down rather than up\nPatients have to sign up for any minimum length of time or\nNo okay there's no contract that so you do it for two or three months and you say look you know this isn't for me I found a better deal whatever happens you can not signed up no of course the money you put it into the trust fund you can get right with the money that's in the health savings and wants to you\nYou know our money how to help them I saw something about of a free Dr hotline what's that\nWell one of the problems we have in medicine today is that the family doctor is no longer available somebody who knows you that you can always call anytime you do have a health care provider but by and large if you call that doctor's office after hours it'll say something like if you have an emergency go to the emergency room and if\nYou don't know why you're calling now call back on Monday after nine o'clock well\nObviously people don't know if they have an emergency or not they're not a a medically trained to know right whether or not they need to go to the emergency room or it's a minor issue but with the doctor hotline you can call any time of the day or night\nAnd with the modern tech modern technology your electronic medical records is available to the doctor\nOn the phone he knows your allergies what diseases you have with medicines you're taking and so forth and you can ask questions the doctor you can possibly treat you\nOne example I had was for instance the middle age woman husband came home from work\nWas about five thirty six o'clock on friday night of course he says what's the matter with your aunt she says what are you talking about there's nothing wrong with\nMy eyes and said well what do you mean it's all read [noise]\nWe need to go to the urgency room something bad wrong here oh boy\nSo they called the doctor hotline\nSays okay first question I asked them can you see that I okay she says yeah see fine says well that's good to me a picture of you are because you can do that today with a smartphone ensuring up in the wider view it was all with beet red because she had leaving you know most of the time\nThat we got to wrap it up I'm Down to ten seconds wasn't

it we've got some big challenges in big issues in the political debates and\nUh we all know what's going on right but I just want to help you put it into perspective I just finished reading an awesome book I read a lot of\nA technological uh books and I read a lot of early American history books and a and a book I just finished it's called the butchering art\nIf the biography of Joseph Lister this is the guy who er physician surgeon actually who figured out that germs exist and if the cause of infections\nThat surgical patients were dying in the Eighteen hundreds and it's a fascinating story of the history of medicine as we began to learn about a quarter form the ability to give patients anesthesia are recognizing that we can combat germs um\nIn fact Listerine is named after Joseph Lister anyway I Want to read you this very short to paragraph excerpt from the book to give you a contrast of medicine in the Eighteen hundreds compared to today quote\nThe injuries and the ... elections that surgeons dealt with were as varied as London's population itself\nThousands of workers migrated to the city each year not only with these people living in filth due to the shortage of housing brought on by such rapid urbanization but there are jobs were both physically demanding and hazardous a hospital awards were clog\nWith people who have been named blinded suffocated and crippled by the hazardous realities of the modernizing world\nBetween Eighteen thirty four and Eighteen fifty\nSharing cross hospital treated sixty six thousand emergencies including sixteen thousand falls from scaffolds or buildings Thirteen hundred accidents involving steam engines milk hogs or cranes five thousand road crashes and two thousand burns ore scouts\nA newspaper reported that almost a third of these injuries were caused by quote broken glass or porcelain casual falls lifting of weights and cautious use the spokes knives and other domestic implements unquote\nThese accidents often involve children\nWow compared that\nTo life in the workplace today and let me share with you another statistic that was just released by the world bank this week the global population you know we've got about seven billion people in the planet right now\nAnd the global total people who are living in extreme poverty\nHas now fallen below seven hundred and fifty million for the first time since the world bank has been collecting data starting in Nineteen Ninety this is the decline of more than one billion people in the past twenty five years this is truly exciting we had\nOne point seven million in the extreme poverty now its point seven million and oh by the way what do they mean by extreme poverty\nPeople living on less\nThan a buck Ninety a day yeah we still have a lot of work to do but boy we making great progress so feel good things are excited\nWe're taking telephone calls here on the Rick Edelman show we're talking with Donald he's an edge water Marilyn welcome to the show Donald how are you\nVery well thank you nice to talk to you too how can I help\nYou spoke recently of the many advantages of waiting until late Seventy to start collecting Social Security benefits right but you didn't mention two of the biggest reasons that I uh favorite and a one way to eight Seventy to get your benefits or\nIs it is true and it isn't advantageous in the meantime or after full retirement age at least your benefits grow eight percent tax free uh where where else can I get eight percent tax free\nVirtually guaranteed unless the government fails that's a good a good thing and even if you do not live long enough which seems to be a concern of many people\nAre tourists have as much a crude benefit as if you had taken Social Security at sixty two uh if you do wait until towards Seventy or at eight Seventy you're surviving spouse will get a much larger monthly benefit after you are no longer able to collect them\nI think you're raising really too too very important points Donald I'm really glad you did you get it and that's great are a lot of folks really don't\nThe one thing I Would stress is not merely that you earn this extra eight percent for every year delay starting at your full retirement age of sixty six that begins starting way back at age sixty two in other words if you begin to collect benefits at age sixty two you get eighty percent of what your benefit otherwise would be and if you wait", "show_name": "The Ric Edelman Show", "year": "2018", "city": "Houston", "day": "07"}
