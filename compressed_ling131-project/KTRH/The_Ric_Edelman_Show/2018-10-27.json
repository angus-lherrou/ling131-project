O. C. limited liability company\nYou want to get legal advice tax advice financial advice you need a lawyer needed a CPA and you need a financial planner\nBecause if you don't handle this correctly you've got to be aware of the studies that have been done on lottery winners there is a preponderance of bankruptcy I mean how could a lottery winner go bankrupt hey Michael Tyson had three hundred million dollars and ended up bankrupt\nPeople think it's a bottomless pit more okay one point six billion is pretty bottomless but it's not it's only four hundred and Ninety two million metal taxes in a lump sum\nIt's not a bottomless pit like you think it is and when you start going out a lot of money to family and friends and charities you'd be amazed how fast you can plug for the cash so a lot of lottery winners end up bankrupt they end up divorced they end up with drug and alcohol abuse they end up with suicide\nThey lose their jobs are friends even their family and if you're going to say all of a kid growing up my work every day like always know you're not you know why because every time you show up at work all of your co workers are going to be resentful\nBecause they got to be there because they need the money and you don't and they know it and if you're going to go out to lunch and not treat everyone\nYou're going to be a pariah so if you think your life is not going to change Oh yes it absolutely well you're going to lose all your friends you're going to be ostracized with family if you don't give them enough money to satisfy what they believe\nIs how much money you ought to give them\nSo in addition to having a lawyer and an accountant and a financial planner you need a personal security team as well the first thing you gotta do is get out of your house because everybody knows where you live he's always do Google your address not only strangers but crux\nMight come and do you harm they might come and challenge threaten your family members in order to extort from you blackmail you\nSo you need to go to an undisclosed location choose a suite at the rich people were me and have a security detail around your your life is going to change and what did you have never thought possible 'cause you need personal security\nAnd when it comes to gifts to families and friends well let's think about this for a minute how much money you're going to give your mom you just method after tax four hundred and Ninety two million dollars I must be given them a million bucks you ... come on\nYou're going to give her ten million you got a Ninety million dollars how much you're giving your mom\nHow much it given your dad how much you've given your brothers and sisters how much you've given your children your grandchildren let's say that you decide to give ten people ten million dollars a piece that's a hundred million dollars\nGuess what you didn't give away a hundred million dollars because when you give away a hundred million dollars\nYou know my friend not them you have to pay a\nGift tax guess how much the gift tax is forty percent\nWhich means if you give away a hundred million dollars you incur a forty million dollar gift tax now you've just spent a hundred and forty million dollars so\nOf the four hundred and Ninety two that you did you just gave away a hundred and forty of it\nYou're now down to three fifty we haven't even talked about charity\nLet alone Bentley's do you see my point my friend you got to recognize that winning the lottery\nRequires a massive change and lifestyle massive calculation and preparation and planning because your relationships are going to change with virtually every one you're not going to be able to trust anyone because they're all going to be wanting to know what you can do for them in whatever you do for them ain't\nGoing to be enough in their opinion let me give me another reason why I didn't buy a lottery ticket instead of buying a lottery ticket\nIf you were to say take the money you would have spent on three lottery tickets three dollars a day instead of buying a lottery every single day you take that three dollars and you invested into the S. and P. five hundred stock index and you do that for forty five years\nI'm On a bet you'll have more than a million dollars is what you'll have won the lottery of course pest performance was known kitchen future results I mean especially in the country as a federal ... and therefore my friend now you know why [noise]\nI didn't buy a lottery ticket because as I often say to friends and family well okay not friends and family what I often say the enemies may you win the lottery because it's often the worst thing that can never happen to you\nAnd I mentioned all of this for one simple reason trying to make you feel better for not having one\nSubject aren't you glad that you didn't win the lottery I thought so that's why I'm here to help you make you feel good and the reason I'm trying to make you feel good is because you probably have been noticing that not only did not win the lottery on Tuesday you saw the stock market meltdown on Wednesday\nAnd you did notice that not only did you get rich you got a little poorer because of the stock market's performance and we're going to talk about the stock market\nAnd what it means for your investments in what you should do about your investments strategy as a result of the new volatility that we're experiencing in the stock market and the\nBond market and the real estate market image going\nOn the show\nOn line at rice dome and dot\nHost of the PBS TV series the

elements show we invite you to send your questions by audio and that's exactly what George did here says question he sent to ask Greg at ... dot com\nI read this is George from California my in laws are both over eighty five years old and have an investment balance that likely could pay for a long term care for those is needed\nMy question is should they maintain any stock investments since they could earn over three percent in bonds and it is unlikely their life expectancy will expose them to significant inflation risk so Rick what do you think thanks\nSo that's a great question George and a lot of folks face this question in my older years I'm In my seventies my ... my nineties I have far more money than I Will ever need to spend even find curb massive medical costs are long term care costs\nBetween pensions and Social Security and the money I've accumulated over my lifetime I have lots of cash and I'm not spending it because I live kind of frugally\nSo therefore we would argue traditional financial planning strategy would argue that you should place all of that money in very conservative investments you should put the money into bank accounts you should put the money into treasuries you should put the money into guaranteed\nInvestments that they might not pay much interest I not only pay one or two or three percent puts so what you don't need to earn high returns it's more important that you have protection of your money than that you try to double your money because doubling it isn't going to change your lifestyle but losing half of it could\nSo traditionally we would argue don't take any more risk than is necessary\nTo achieve your goals but\nLet me turn that inside out and give you a different reason why you might want to consider a riskier investment strategy and they'll strategy that includes investing in stocks to some perhaps even significant degree\nLet's say that you've got a few million dollars saved\nAnd you're hardly touching it and you don't think you'll hardly ever touch any of it because you get plenty of income off of that money you've got plenty of income from pensions and Social Security you only spend a few thousand dollars a month your house is paid for your expenses are low\nAnd you've got this money now ordinarily I Would you know we would say like I said a moment ago put the money\nThe bill's called today but think about this when you die\nWho gets that money\nI'm willing to assume that you are going to leave that money to your surviving spouse and ultimately to your children and your grandchildren\nIn other words if you have a very high degree of confidence that this money will outlast you and will ultimately be transferred to your kids and grandkids you could argue\nThat that money really isn't yours it's ... and you are merely the steward of that money\nYou're the custodian your the caretaker of that money and if you know that you're going to transfer that money to your children and grandchildren who will use it for their lifestyles and their personal financial needs and the achievement of their financial goals\nFor then maybe we should be investing the money with their goals in mind\nMeaning that if your son or daughter had the million dollars they invested in stocks because they would have a long term time horizon and they would want to earn a return that net of taxes and inflation is growing in real economic terms\nTherefore we could argue you should be investing the money not based on your age but based on ... and if your kids are in their fifties or sixties if your grandkids are in their twenties or thirties then maybe you should invest in a portfolio allocation that mirrors them and not you\nKnow we want to make sure we're not doing so to the point that we are really placing you at financial risk or jeopardy\nBut I think we could strike a healthy balance between protecting you for your lifetime while also having an eye toward the legacy of protecting your children's financial futures as well\nAnd on that basis we could in fact argue that you should have stocks in your portfolio\nTo what degree should it be ten percent of the portfolio fifty percent of the portfolio somewhere in between the only way to know for sure is to meet with us all sit down with one of my colleagues here at the firm\nSo that we can examine the entire family dynamic look at what your true expenses are relative to the income available and the resources\nAnd design what that strategy might be taking into consideration the circumstances with your children and grandchildren so don't automatically assume that the older you get you shouldn't have any money in stocks\nInstead look at it as an intergenerational family dynamic because after all that's exactly\nWhat it is so
