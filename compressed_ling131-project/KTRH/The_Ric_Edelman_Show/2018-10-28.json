A. media dot com\n[noise]\nThe leaders weather\nFurniture made an American studios this piece of news radio seven forty Katie our age bused in orange radio station a Houston\nCandlelight vigil tonight I'm Nicky coordinated twelve o'clock news radio seven forty cagey\nYou could um by half of the islands and the British Virgin islands because of the total GDP of the British Virgin islands has about nine hundred million dollars so here seriously what you ought to do if you win the lottery first number one tell nobody\nThat you won not even your spouse I especially your spouse don't tell anyone as soon as you tell anyone everyone's going to know\nAnd that's really scary because not only you're going to be bombarded by requests for money from family and friends but also total strangers your safety is also at risk and I'll talk a little bit more about that in the second so when you win the lottery what you need to do is take that ticket and keep it somewhere safe\nLike banks safe deposit box no not not under your mattress not somewhere and you know secret police my house no\nAntibiotics that deposit box do not signed the ticket not yet\nWhat I Want you to do is to photocopy it photocopy both sides and then put it in a safe deposit box then get a lawyer get in the state attorney someone who is expert and experienced in dealing with wealthy families because that's what you're not willfully\nAnd left the lawyer tell you how you should sign the ticket should use on it and your name on me should it be join with your spouse should you put it in a trust should you have an owned by an L. O. C. limited liability company\nYou want to get legal advice tax advice financial advice you need a lawyer you needed a CPA and you need a financial planner\nBecause if you don't handle this correctly you got to be aware of the studies that have been done on lottery winners there is a preponderance of bankruptcy I mean how can a lottery winner go bankrupt hey Michael Tyson had three hundred million dollars and ended up bankrupt\nPeople think it's a bottomless pit more okay one point six billion is pretty bottomless but it's not it's only four hundred and Ninety two million metal taxes and a lump sum\nIt's not a bottomless pit like you think it is and when you start throwing out a lot of money to family and friends in charities you'd be amazed how fast you can plug the cash so a lot of lottery winners end up bankrupt they end up divorced the end up with drug and alcohol abuse they end up with suicide\nThey lose their jobs are friends even their family and if you're going to say I'm going to keep going in my work every day like always know you're not you know why because every time you show up at work all of your co workers\nAre gonna be resentful because they got to be there because they need the money and you don't and they know it and if you're going to go out to lunch and not treat everyone\nYou're going to be a pariah so if you think your life is not going to change Oh yes it absolutely will you're going to lose all your friends you're going to be ostracized with family if you don't give them enough money to satisfy what they believe\nIs how much money you want to give them\nSo in addition to having a lawyer and an accountant and a financial planner you need a personal security team as well the first thing you've got to do is get out of your house because everybody knows where you live he's always do Google your address not only strangers but crux\nMight come and do you harm they might come and challenge threaten your family members in order to uh extort from you blackmail you\nSo you need to go to an undisclosed location choose a suite at the rich to be with me and have a security detail around you your life is going to change and what did you have never thought possible because you need personal security\nAnd when it comes to gifts to families and friends well let's think about this for a minute how much money you're going to give your mom you just method after tax four hundred and Ninety two million dollars unless you give him a million bucks you cheap little ...\nCome on you're going to give her ten million you just got a hundred and Ninety two million dollars how much you're giving your mom\nHow much you've given your debt how much you've given your brothers and sisters how much you've given your children your grandchildren let's say that you decide to give ten people ten million dollars a piece that's a hundred million dollars I guess what you didn't give away a hundred million dollars because when you give away a hundred\nMillion dollars you know my friend not them you have to pay a\nGift tax guess how much the gift tax is forty percent which means if you\nGive away a hundred million dollars you incur a forty million dollar gift tax now you've just spent a hundred and forty million dollars\nSo of the four hundred and Ninety two that you now did you just gave away a hundred and forty of it you're now down to three fifty\nWe haven't even talked about charity let alone Bentley's do you see my point in my friend you got to recognize that winning the lottery\nRequires a massive change in life style\nMassive calculation and preparation and planning because your relationships are going to change with virtually every one you're not going to be able to trust anyone because they're all going to be wanting to know what you can do for them in whatever you do for them ain't going to be enough in their opinion\nLet me give me another reason why I didn't buy a lottery ticket instead of buying a lottery ticket if you were to say take the money you would have spent on three lottery tickets three dollars a day instead of buying the lottery every single day you take that three dollars and you invested into the U.S and the five hundred stock index and you do that for forty five years\nI'm On a bet you'll have more than a million dollars guess what you'll have won the lottery of course ... future results on your social the country's a federal ... and therefore my friend now you know why [noise]\nI didn't buy a lottery ticket because as I often say to friends and family well okay not friends and family what I often say the enemies may you win the lottery because it's often the worst thing that can never happen to you and all of this for one simple reason\nTrying to make you feel better for not having one subject\nAren't you glad that you didn't win the lottery I thought so that's why I'm here to help you make you feel good and the reason I'm trying to make you feel good is because you probably have been noticing that not only did you not win the lottery on Tuesday\nYou saw the stock market meltdown on Wednesday and you did notice that\nThey're not only did you get rich you got a little poorer because of the stock markets performance and we're going to talk about the stock market\nAnd what it means for your investments in what you should do about your investments strategy as a result of the new volatility that we're experiencing in the stock market and the bond market and the real estate market and the gold market\nAnd I'm going to tell you all about it when

invite you to send me your questions by audio and that's exactly what George did here says question he sent to ask Greg at ... dot com\nHigh rent this is George from California my in laws are both over eighty five years old and have an investment balance that likely could pay for a long term care for those is needed\nMy question is should they maintain any stock investments since they could earn over three percent in bond and it is unlikely their life expectancy will expose them to significant inflation risk so Rick what do you think thanks\nSo that's a great question George and a lot of folks faced this question in my older years I'm In my seventies my ... my nineties I have far more money than I Will ever need to spend even find curb massive medical costs are long term care costs\nBetween pensions and Social Security and the money I've accumulated over my lifetime I have lots of cash and I'm not spending it because I live kind of frugally\nSo therefore we would argue traditional financial planning strategy would argue that you should place all of that money in very conservative investments you should put the money into bank accounts you should put the money into treasuries you should put the money into guaranteed\nInvestments that they might not pay much an interesting about only pay one or two or three percent puts so what you don't need to earn high returns it's more important that you have protection of your money than that you try to double your money because doubling it isn't going to change your lifestyle but losing half of it could\nSo traditionally we would or you don't take any more risk than is necessary\nTo achieve your goals but let me turn that inside out and give you a different reason why you might want to consider\nA riskier investment strategy and their strategy that includes investing in stocks to some perhaps even significant degree\nLet's say that you've got a few million dollars saved\nAnd you're hardly touching it and you don't think you'll hardly ever touch any of it because you get plenty of income off of that money you've got plenty of income from pensions and Social Security you only spend a few thousand dollars a month your house is paid for your expenses are low\nAnd you've got this money now ordinarily I Would you know we would say like I said a moment ago\nPut the money into those call today but think about this when you die\nWho gets that money\nI'm willing to assume that you are going to leave that money to your surviving spouse and ultimately to your children and your grandchildren\nIn other words if you have a very high degree of confidence that this money will outlast view and will ultimately be transferred to your kids and grandkids\nYou could argue that that money really isn't yours is ... and you are merely the steward of that money\nYou're the custodian your the caretaker\nOf that money and if you know that you're going to transfer that money to your children and grandchildren who will use it for their lifestyles and their personal financial needs and the achievement of their financial goals\nFor then maybe we should be investing the money with their goals in mind\nMeaning that if your son or daughter had the million dollars they invested in stocks because they would have a long term time horizon and they would want to earn a return that net of taxes and inflation is growing and real economic terms\nTherefore we could argue you should be investing the money not based on your age but based on ... and if your kids are in their fifties or sixties if your grandkids are in their twenties or thirties then maybe you should invest in a portfolio allocation that mirrors them and not you\nKnow we want to make sure we're not doing so to the point that we are really placing you at financial risk or jeopardy\nBut I think we could strike a healthy balance between protecting you for your lifetime while also having an eye toward the legacy of protecting your children's financial futures as well\nAnd on that basis we could in fact argue that you should have stocks in your portfolio\nTo what degree should it be ten percent of the portfolio fifty percent of the portfolio somewhere in between the only way to know for sure is to meet with us ... sit down with one of my colleagues here at the firm\nSo that we can examine the entire family dynamic look at what your true expenses are relative to the income available and the resources\nAnd designed what that strategy might be taking into consideration the circumstances with your children and grandchildren so don't automatically assume that the older you get you shouldn't have any money in stocks\nAnd said look at it as an intergenerational family dynamic because after all that's exactly\nWhat it is so George thanks so much for your question and if you would like to have this conversation with us you can do so just calls to Tripoli to plan wreck or visit us online at rice element dot com\nThey always got some of the aftermath of Hurricane Florence and Michael we've seen just astonishing devastation those storms came so quickly especially Michael\nAnd left so quickly but a huge amount of damage in the way a gym and I are heavily involved with the boys and girls clubs of America and\nWe have now gotten reports from them that Thirteen of their clubs sustained damage from Florence and Michael significant roof damage water damage ruined computer labs in game rooms one administrative building was destroyed one of our staff members had a heart attack and died\nTo be one of the participants they please you know take whatever I'll travel the whatever samples and and and that started with me and just getting involved at the patient thing you know please study my case\nThen I asked Dr Brewer is\nThe director I Want to help in any way possible because I'm so excited that there is a clinic that purely dedicated to try and get a headache because I was in tears for years because\nThere didn't seem to be any organization out there so it really started\nWith how can I help and they said you want to join the board and I absolutely I you know we could we all need to come together because there just isn't enough focus or a research on headaches\nAnd the money's headaches of yours Heidi our cluster headaches started in two thousand six what what's the difference between them and migraine headaches\n[noise] you know I'm not in my ... but it is a you know the broad strokes cluster headaches they can let 'em extreme amount of regularity very frequently and it it's a shorter intense pain\nOr you feel like for me it feels like a knife is carving your eyes to the ... it only last an hour or two but during that time you just\nUh it just feels like you're being pummeled where migraines I think it's a different kind of misery where it my last hours and days and weeks and you're just\nA ... if you want to go into a dark room and and you know right now where headaches it actually what I Want to do is kind of move around in my head against the wall and trying to track myself that's\nVery different sensation is very different remedy is just self\nHelp it will uh and and let's establish right now that migraines and plus your headaches are way different from a hangover or the one you get if you skip your morning coffee aren't they\nAbsolutely it as it is a difference between something that you can feel sort of function you don't feel well or maybe\nYou can take an aspirin and take a nap and in a few hours later the gun and you move on gun and you move on with your life whereas a cluster headaches and migraines and to build a penny headaches it truly does drop you of your life you might still be breathing but\nYour life at you know it it it you you can't function you can hear a job you can't take care of yourself your family it drains your financial resources you're taking it you know a high level of medicine\nAh so it really is the distinction and I think that is unfortunately it's unfortunate that we don't have a better understanding of headaches because I Believe there are different conditions and different levels and because they all get lumped in there are people like oh I had a headache yeah that sucks\nBut it just it's hard to convey that there is truly a trend and when you're on at ten it's nothing like the one you know to me it's like saying oh we all have stomach aches when it might be your your liver your kidney your intestines and then and so I think there's just an opportunity to\nUnderstand and research and make a distinction between different conditions that we can properly diagnosed and really find cures\nI write not really an underserved area of medicine\nWas a good opportunity Heidi Heidi but they're all joining us here this morning from the will Irwin headache research foundation for the will or when headache research foundation I suppose a good opportunity for you to explain just what that is and how it came to be\n[noise] fell and twenty or ... or when a a local cup and a couple of inches and they lost their son twenty four year old son well to the cluster headaches battle or kid write all this like only known where these\nOff off with drug for him with migraines and at the ... cluster headaches and at the age of twenty four he just said I Can't do this anymore and he he lost hope\nHe took his own life and I understand that decision because when I Am a hundred days into my cycles I often go to bed thinking I it would be okay if I didn't wake up I don't want to live like this way when I'm not in my life is beautiful but it it's awful\nAnd ... and Jimmy day um I my hero because they took that grief and their pain and channel\nToward establishing the foundation which has found in twenty fourteen and they said we are going to cure the cutting had headaches they hired an Internet neurologist and partner with lots of other medical experts in the area\nAnd so far they've raised two dollars that um and that's a great start but there's so much for it yet to cut her and her and so\nIf we can come together and clinics again you know when when I first got diagnosed at six I remember asking my neurologist you know what the future like and what can I go get for treatment he said I'm Sorry I did because I'm just not well served area\nThere really isn't much progress and so that's why this clinic is so special because it it's going to focus on headaches\nThat leads us right into the next thing on my list is how important it is for people whose headaches are persistent in our serve beer that they deal with a headache specialist and not just a neurologist right\nAbsolutely 'cause I wasted a year going to like a different neurologist and they would tell you the migraine and you and me and then a tractor when\nFinally when I found the right headaches that's is that you have a headache and\nEven if you can take at least afford paying you can't get them to come and they are yet to see a headache specialists if you have it and and know that you're not alone there's so many of that out there\nOn and get an opportunity to support each other and together can find a cure and I'm currently set for the surprise you probably have a covert girls love one friend that doesn't talk about it 'cause they don't want to\nBurden but um it really is an opportunity for all of that\nYou know since my wife had started getting these headaches like this I've had to explain that to a couple of people in\nAnd help them understand kind of what she's going through and I every time I turn around I run into somebody else's oh gosh yeah I've had migraines for years or I've had severe headaches I I don't know that I've ever heard anybody use the term cluster headaches but they talk about the same levels of pain and\nYou'd never know they're out there kind of been the world she's had a really hard time even functioning ... just getting out of the house for two and a half years is getting better but I Know exactly what you're talking about in this gives us an opportunity to to talk about how it affects the rest of the family to\nAbsolutely because yeah you you can imagine number one you are not there for them you know thank goodness I you know I'm I'm older and I don't have a lot of responsibility that father's family I feel at ease but\nMany people do and you're not there for that number one number even if they want to be there for you it just to help but feeling because you're just in pain and really\nThe only other than that has lots of side effects may or may not how they say yeah you ... your shadow yourself not to mention your doctor's appointments out of the time to train your financial resources\nAnd it just gets an athlete it more than just the person and it's all this around people around you that care about\nMy wife had trouble with it because we're we're trying to ...
