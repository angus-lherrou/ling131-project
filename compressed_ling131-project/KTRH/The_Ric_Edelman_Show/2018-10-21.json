{"month": "10", "state": "TX", "station": "KTRH", "content": "[noise] so what is this is a two year old company right this is a company that that that fairly recently started what is the hole in the market to us in a fight that required the starting of another company what is that you saw what problem did you decide to come in and saw a for the marketplace\nA lot of our customers and it quick service quality product and we were able to come and fill that need and do it at a really competitive price\nWell was quick service a very often and and I used to being the gear business myself years ago a when something's broken\nQuite often that's not the only thing that it affects that shuts down to a pretty major operation right getting something back on line and turning again becomes very very critical uh to that in customer what were they not getting in the market where they just not finding the folks to be able to come in at a you know it was short notice and make something turn again\nI don't think that was the case I think they just you know we have we just came out of ... a large downturn in the economy and I think a stewardship was one of the things that was last year to you need to be a good steward your customer you need to look out for their money\nOr do a quality job at a competitive reasonable price and that's that's really where we wanted to be we wanted to come in and provide that are not just because the customer and he'd just\nGo in and take advantage of that situation we wanted to write and really grow a lasting relationship\nWell and so what industries are you serving right now because he got started doing a because oil fields in a downturn you started doing some power generation what all industries are you in a ... at this point\nAt this point actively a power generation oil and gas\nBen what part of oil and gas what type of of equipment are you actually going in and working or\nAre we are just in terminals right now uh so there you have your small small framed took pops a small auxiliary equipment things of that nature okay\nCompressors things like that can you you you the name of the the company's Texas compression but you actually have a fairly small amount of your work is compression\nRhetoric we originally our goal was to go after ms drink compression wants to market came back ah\nWe've been following the lead of our customers and adapting to their needs and that's why we've maintained a presence of our generation and uh now we're steadily moving into oil and\nGas now the skill set required to work on compressors is the same skill set required to work on a lot of a very in times of rotating quit my correct\nIt is it is your uh\nMost of your reset compressors they don't really spend a\nSeventy ever crank shaft about the only thing that spans anything that spends a but you know it's a\nIt's just the disciplines are the same uh\nInteresting now talking about the uh people side of it you where you would talk to them at the beginning of the of the segment where do you go about finding people with this very specific skill\nSet a well\nI myself I started in the field so we know\nJust by nature we have a good network of mechanics that we've kind of wrenches within the past churn through those individuals they say it's more of a network of finding people through people and then looking in identifying young talent seeing\nWho has the mental aptitude for it I mean when you think about a a a large range turban and okay a couple of hundred times and to think that that piece of equipment is brought into within a couple of thousands tolerance sure there's there's some magic to that there is some skill and some crap that goes into that and the attention to detail\nWell you know we've talked throughout the trade show the labor shortages\nThan a thing that came up time and time again right and and I think there's an incredible opportunity out there for for young people that uh uh can pass a drug test and show up recently on time right yeah to to earn a very very nice living learning a skill\nA and I'd be willing to bet that most young people don't even know that this is a thing right\nHave you know it's uh it's amazing you know when I I've done all quite a bit of traveling and when you think about like some of the power plants that worked in in the northeast that were a hundred years old these were things that you know our grandfathers and they're ... it's there's some there's some history there you're\nIt was something on you're putting your hands on a piece of equipment that older most things in Houston sure and so there's there's a little bit of\nA romance associated with it using that term but this is a it's a craft or something to be proud of and there's a lot of opportunities for young individuals who don't feel that college is the right avenue for\nWell and it isn't the right avenue for everybody nor should be the right avenue for everybody credit\nOr your reference that ah there's a lot of work right now that a lot of work has been put off because of the downturn trained you go into that a little more [noise] so\nYou know we've all kind of roll back when we had the shortage and you know things that were critical had to stay on the line they got addressed a\nAnything that was operational the maintenance was tougher and because of that you don't run it to the point of failure now you're playing catch up now that you\nGave me an hour pay me later they decided not spend the money on a maintenance during the downturn and now they gotta catch up\nTo catch up otherwise it could cost them\nWell and and these are very very expensive pieces of equipment repair keeping to maintain as a whole lot cheaper and easier than uh than than trying to replace right right absolutely no interesting stuff what is the easiest way ah for somebody to learn more should they want to learn more about Texas compression\nGo to our website WWW dot Texas

going to earn ten you're going to earn ten minus the costs so if you have a diversified portfolio as the Ohio public employees' retirement system does they're projecting seven point two percent a year\nSo we need to keep this in mind for two reasons number one to make sure that your expectations are reasonable and realistic and number two to make sure that you recognize\nThat this is a long term projection and at any given moment this month's performance the last quarter the year to date the past one or three years\nAnything can happen in that short a period Ohio isn't suggesting that that's the rate of return that they're going to hit in twenty Eighteen they're not suggesting that the return they got in the third quarter of the year or year to date they're saying that over the long term they're expecting targeting\nAnd there's some question of seven point two percent and oh by the way\nThat's before fees because you know\nOhio doesn't pay the kinds of fees that retail investors had 'cause you don't have a hundred billion to invest and we all know that people will invest a hundred billion don't pay the same cost that retail investors who have one million or one hundred thousand or ten grand et cetera et cetera get my point now let me take another step further\nWhen you are making your investments\nWhich investments is it your assuming are going to perform well because a lot\nInvestors think that the key to generating six festival returns is by picking the right investments in other words there are Thirteen thousand mutual funds out there which one are you going to pick\nWell let's look at it this way according to temper on in twenty twelve\nThis is six years ago\nThere were five hundred and Ninety us stock mutual funds that beat the S. and P. five hundred that year only five hundred and Ninety out of the thousands of mutual funds that exist only five hundred and Ninety of them be the S. and P. five hundred so I Want to ask you the question do you think you could pick\nThe fund that's going to beat the overall market first of all the odds are probably not since such a few number did that in the first place but let's assume that you manage to successfully pick one of the best funds of the year good for you\nFive hundred and Ninety of them in twenty twelve of those five hundred Ninety Gino how many of them beat the market again the following year in twenty Thirteen\nHundred and forty so of the five hundred and Ninety who did it in twenty twelve only a hundred and forty of 'em did it again the next year and of those hundred and forty how many of them did it again in twenty fourteen only twenty two\nAnd a twenty two only three of them did it in twenty Fifteen and of the three only one of them did it in twenty sixteen in other words of the entire universe\nOf stock mutual funds up the ... of them that exist over the five year period from twenty twelve to twenty sixteen only on\nCBS and the five hundred every year for five years in a row one out of thousands so unless you again do you think you can pick the funds that are going\nTo outperform the market\nI don't think so I don't think we can do it and are from we don't even try instead what we do is provide passive investment\nApproaches for our clients instead of trying to beat the market we're trying to provide the return of the market minus fees and taxes and expenses associated with the investing exercise and guess what\nIf you're investing in that kind of a pattern you're not trying to beat the market you're trying not to get beaten\nBy taxes in inflation so that your money is earning a competitive rate of return which should be sufficient to enable you to achieve your financial goals and objectives and that's really the point it's not about beating the market it's about achieving your goals think about it this way two thousand eight in\nTwo thousand eight the S. and P. five hundred stock index fell thirty six percent so have you picked\nAnd above average fond of funds that beat the market instead of losing thirty six maybe you lost thirty two is that like you know any consolation at any time\nYou know I mean we should be feeling really good we didn't lose thirty six percent of our money we only lost thirty two percent of our money you see my point meaning the markets and that's the goal that's not you should be trying to accomplish what you should be trying to accomplish\nIs making sure you are long term\nFinancial goals and objectives are met and to that and I'm going to cite a new study that just came out that shows that forty percent of middle class Americans forty percent are facing poverty\nIn retirement [noise]\nForty percent nearly three quarters of American workers say that they are going to have to work past traditional retirement age because they don't have sufficient money\nSaved and invested so instead of saying the key to my financial future is beating the market wrong the key to your financial future is making sure you have sufficient money saved on a regular basis\nAnd that the money you're saving is earning a competitive return if not\nBuying a lottery ticket and hope you get rich quick\nJoining the latest hot fad getting into what's hot and avoid and what's not that's not the key to achieving your long term financial goals our goal here\nFor you is to make sure you are not among that forty percent of the middle class who's facing poverty\nIn retirement your financial future is much more up to you than it is up to the markets and if you're not sure if you're saving enough if you're not sure whether you're saving in the right way if you're not sure you're saving and investing strategy is designed to get you where you are trying to go\nWell that's why your call us

to retire and this must be a sixteen year old he quote expert I sixty four\nI'm lost a tremendous amount of money during in the market my husband who passed away a had a hedge fund and I'll make a choice to say that I had nothing other than my Social Security and I and against sixty four jak\nAt should work until Saturday because the guy in there\nTo provide money for their retirement is you know it's not just saying I can recall hearing number one number two the other thing that should be considered in one's life\nOn their finances is the quality of their lives and many times working can be very exhausting I'm ... that are stepping day and um and Seventy five I mean I think that it's an incredibly um thoughtless\nComment she has made on the show this morning\nAnd I'm horrified that he is agreeing with everything she has to say why don't we get swept Jill where Ninety or totally guy maybe that's the thing to do\nThat is now worried with our finances\nSo I'm Sorry that she saw upset but it's not my fault that her husband lost all of his money and the two thousand a credit crisis by investing in hedge funds and it's not my fault that she's now finding herself and retirement with nothing but Social Security\nAnd so when we say that given that situation you really don't have much of a choice but to continue working I I guess all I can say is well maybe the truth hurts\nUm and maybe this is why we need to plan butter and we need to more effectively get\nProfessional financial advice before throwing all of our life savings in the hedge funds just in time for the biggest market melt down in our entire lives I feel badly for her but I have a feeling that I'm just the messenger reflecting on the severity of her personal situation\nUm but here's another voice mail but I got and this boys you might recall hearing before with listen\nI'm calling to say that I got on the couch with quite a while\nAnd I decided I Would never invest and Sam August company take us on

said back then\nAnd maniac on and on one second maniac planting you can ask us man and the cat to count\n... tang individual in there\nAnd\nIt had life depended on it I Am I I I didn't know him and his crazy ranting game hen house and shame on hand by God\nMan but now what was fascinating here is look I I I don't know if I'm really doing anything wrong at all because she's still listening to the show so obviously I'm doing something right to get her to keep tuning in and I'm not quite sure why psychologists would be recommending psychiatric help\nOr she should be recommending psychological help but anyway uh it gets to just chose to go you not everybody's a fan\nOf the ... show so I don't know maybe I should have you know some regrets of hell I'm handling the show why but I'll tell you who does have a regret\nSuzie Orman has a regret\nShe says that she has a major money related regret that back in Nineteen Ninety seven she bought five thousand dollars worth of Amazon's stock and sold that just a few years later is she still owns the shares it would be worth more than six\nMillion dollars [noise]\nSuzie says quote it makes me sick to even tabulate at unquote she says she purchased the Amazon shares because she liked the branding she said quote\nI thought it was such a cool name for a stock I could identify with the idea of me being a woman that wanted to be an Amazon\nThat was the due diligence that's Susie Orman did for choosing an investment but she also says quote\nWow an old man that I Am now being close to where I live near a jumped him I knew ahead of time and I jumped in my truck and went home and got a pair of pants I felt like such an old man\nA guy [noise] um I don't\nKnow yesterday are parents that are granted Harry's oh don't even say that\nThere really is a scientific proof\nUp around those well I don't know that you that I Know that my grandmother used to call me every morning at least up a couple of times a day\nEspecially that usually she'd call comedy and tell me about the weather was going to be like you know and when you're in your twenties thirties and forties usually busy life but she did she say look I just want to make sure you got an eyebrow I Know that you're taking your ...\nOr ... I never thought about why why so I always\nFigured that she was watching and pick it up and um my sister shared with me one day that that wasn't the case that she would actually feel the weather in her choice for one and\nThere is a true scientific fact is that studies on it now and\nOf the reason I Know that this is research for some online content and kind of here but it's those who have osteoarthritis especially if it's something you might want to check tends to happen to people all over the age of fixate\nOn what you're talking about go ahead [laughter]\nThey're metric pressure and then some atmospheric pressure as well as you're actually do you feel it and\nOh my gosh back you know what I think we might have found a way to put the weatherman at best as if you just get a group a sixteen year old in Iran that I'll have osteoarthritis I can tell you when it weather's changing\nThat would be so much more entertaining to just get one of these assisted living facilities and pick out the\nThe you you guys kind of like the view you're going to have to have a real men one and real friendly one or the happy go lucky one and the grumpy when and if you're out there and let them all talk about the weather for about ten minutes that would be awesome I Would love to do that well\nI did a little research too and one of the things that I found out that from a physiological standpoint like nobody in our age group would notice\nBut we're burning fewer calories from day to day just just getting around and because of that we're not generating our own heat and when you catch a little cold snap like this it tends to get to our circulation is not as good the whole did just it's all one big package that says grab a sweater\nExactly exactly well then let me ask you are you going to be one of 'em that sure adult to get a sweater for every day it's going to have no\nNo you know well here's the difference when I was ten Fifteen twenty Twenty years younger let's say\nA as winter came along I went about my day to day business but didn't really think much of it and I almost never threw a coat end of the truck\nBecause as long as I got my truck I can stay war if I may lead tier I could sit there and if I get out and change it that's going to war me up even through a Houston winter most winters anyway\nNow I Do keep that I'm probably starting this week I'm just going to throw a light jak jak I don't need a fur coat I'm not Liberace I I I don't need that but I Do\nI feel more comfortable having not needing it versus the other side of that coin you know\nI guess having an emergency cat a whole new meaning\nTo go ahead and her [laughter] you know he's been in that\nMedicines that\nYou know from a female perspective\nWhat's amazing about that are often I Love it is that I can start wearing scarves now mind you everybody looks at me a little bit kind of funny it started off on it but yeah you're that age where you think okay I don't want all this land and so I Know that it's you know the middle of September and I'm going to wear a scarf\nSo I guess it's kind of like that in their ties back on it\nI have found the older I get the less I feel the need to explain myself oh yeah and and it just embrace that\nYeah why not just be comfortable\n[laughter] that's it well I certainly understand now probably more than I did get out much younger age as to why people were migrating\nIn the winter to Arizona and Florida sure but I'm the death of North Africa yeah well it\nIt is funny talking to people outside of the state of Texas I was on the phone with somebody from um Montana this last week and they were talking about how cold it was there and oh my gosh it has been so cold in Houston you know I I actually pulled out to my\nHead hurts and wetter than taking it really so how how did it get Seventy [laughter]\nFor\nAre you ... ...

transparent digital asset that is collateralized to US dollars they're calling it a stable coin one of the big concerns people have had about ... coin\nAnd other crypto assets is that the volatility as massive well if you have a stable coin something that is tied to the U.S dollar it's designed to solve that problem is it any wonder that there's now an escrow company in California that now let you buy a home using bitcoin\nAnd the block chain which is a technology that allows bitcoin to operate is now being used in voting in West Virginia they allowed\nMilitary members who are West Virginia residents who are serving overseas\nTo use the block chain to vote they get it there the first state to have allowed it and they did it in the primaries this past may and they say they're now going to allow it to be used in the November elections\nFor some of the residents in West Virginia by using the block chain there can be no voter fraud\nAnd that's the whole point is that it allows a hack proof means of logging transactions in this case votes and West Virginia is proving to be a pilot for the entire country it's quite possible as predicted in my book the truth about your future but the twenty twenty presidential election\nWill be done on the block chain meaning you won't have to go to a voting booth to cast your vote you'll do it using your smartphone\nPretty exciting stuff on the other hand there are still worries about what's going on the FCC\nAnd the CFCC that the commodity futures trading commission leave issued alerts warning investors to watch out for frauds because there

taking telephone calls here on the record woman show heading off to valley college in New York Welcome to the program Greg how are you\nIra thank you for taking my call um my wife and I have a six month old baby girl she is our first one uh she has already accumulated around five thousand dollars in cash\nFrom regulations first of all on your daughter's arrival and she's already got five grand\nTheft chefs are very proud of that I'm\nCurrently and we have the money just sitting in a custodial a savings account\nSo my question would be is should we leave the funds and that seems like ... or ... moving into a five twenty nine plan which we are already contributing fifty dollars per month or shall we invested in the market\nFor a long way away one whoa whoa where we've we've just covered two very different questions here I don't want to make sure that we separate them because that's\nKey the first question is when are we going to use the money\nIn other words are we going to use the money for diapers we're going to use the money for preschool we're going to use the money for ... we're going to use the money for\nTheir first car we're going to use the money for college or are we going to use the money for them buying a home in their thirties we're going to use the money for their retirement so what would you tell me is the expected use and timing of the use of that money\nI'm the sort of be a more in the long term\nSo we would say a college\nOkay so we've got Eighteen years before we're going to use the money\nAnd theoretically it might not even be Eighteen years it might be twenty four years because you don't necessarily have to use the money in their freshman year daughter's freshman year of college you might use the money and your daughters senior year of college and the average kid today\nTakes six years to get a college degree so the money might be able to remain invested not just for Eighteen years maybe for twenty four years so good that gives us a a good\nA basis for the conversation because the timeframe is what determines how the money should be invested in other words if you had told me you're going to use the money for diapers or a ... in three years my answer would be leave the money in cash leave the money in a bank account a CD a money market fund\nA savings account checking account something\nA U.S Ninety they treasury bills something very safe very liquid very available something that wouldn't be subject to market gyrations because I'm a short period of time who knows what could happen I mean look at two thousand eight right it took years for the markets to recover from the debacle of two thousand eight\nSo if you're dealing with a short term time horizon you can only choose or something very safe like cash\nOr cash equivalence but if you have a longer term ... something as you suggested Eighteen to twenty four years now we can take a much different point of view since Nineteen twenty six according to but it's an associates and no Fifteen year period or longer has stocks ended lower than when they started\nTake any period you want since Nineteen twenty six any here as a starting point go Fifteen Years later the market was always higher so if you're telling me we've got Eighteen years maybe twenty four years to go\nThat gives us a very high degree of confidence of course I have to stress as you well know that past performance there's no guarantee of future results in the assertion of the country as a federal offense right we know that\nBut it's the only thing we have to go on so we can with a pretty high degree of confidence say that if I've got a Fifteen or Eighteen or twenty four year time horizon putting a hundred percent of the money into stocks makes a great deal of sense and so that's what I Would recommend for the account for your daughter\nNow your daughter's not allowed to own an account she's a minor minors can't own assets you as the parent has to create a custodial account on behalf of your daughter it's called a U. T. M. a uniform transfer to minors act\nA UT amazing account it simply says you're going to set that money aside for your daughter and uh the problem with it\nIs number one you're going to pay taxes on that camera manual basis and number two when the child reaches the age of majority you have to turn the money over to the child and instead of using the money for college she might use the money to buy a Corvette", "year": "2018", "show_name": "The Ric Edelman Show", "city": "Houston", "day": "21"}
