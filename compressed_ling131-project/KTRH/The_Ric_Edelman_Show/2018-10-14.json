{"month": "10", "state": "TX", "station": "KTRH", "content": "We we have life cycle methodologies which we call our intellectual property it's it's the best practices put it in a way that delivers the best results and our model again like I said is very unique is that we go in with\nThe clients and get and help the clients use these best practices so kind of like what\nWe've talked before and I've told many classes that\nYou know we're in this world out of the information age digital ... the ability to uh put the new tool in together all this information well if you do that and the organization doesn't have the skills and capabilities to use it typically you don't get the results you want we go in and we helped the organization prepare for that\nTo go through that change process to build those capabilities and those experiences\nAnd get the work processes put in place\nTo use that that analytical information the most efficient way and for many CEOs getting information and be able to put it in place very quickly to deliver the business results in a changing environment is very important and that's how we help most of our class\nSo I Love the idea of best practices that is what it's all about yours maybe slightly different than somebody else's there's maybe like not meaning you got your client what's required slowly but you need to have somebody understands best practices and how to apply in your business\nOf course I was in automation and we always need somebody like you guys to come in and let's go an automated the wrong way let's have somebody like you come in and line up the best processes for performance backs was ocean and then we bring the software to match it to what you come up with that kind of like what you're talking about\n... year hit it right on you know if you don't if you don't put the best practices in if you don't help the organization changed the way that they get work done\nUh before you put the automation process in or the the the new computer system that is going to get the data and start to make the process changes that are needed\nIf you don't prepare that ahead of time and you don't change the way work is being done and that's not just the day to day work it's also how you buy raw materials how uber cure good how you end up having your final product go out to the client how it's applied to the class\nOf all that's not integrated together and changed\nThat most of the time that new tools that new computer system the new automation typically doesn't deliver the results we typically see in the industry that most automation when they're when it's implement it probably only get sixty percent of the results that they want\nWhat we said when we help clients and changing the processes and working to build that capability they typically achieved Ninety eight percent Ninety nine percent results\nKey word here change management one of the hardest things for a CEO or a business leader or a delusional leader or a man of change management getting people to change and change in the right way what's what's the trip to that 'cause that's what you guys specialize in well\nKnow we've learned over time and because of all of us being in the industry and facing this ourselves and our in our leadership roles that we had the thing we realized is that\nIt's engaging the organization it's how you engage you can't just telling organization what you want done\nYou have to be able to bring experience and you have to be able to bring a methodology that helps people prepare theirself the capability\nAnd so what we kind of talk about is like a project we go slow at first to go fast at the end and a lot of people trying to make change occur fast and then they go slow at the end\nWe take the organization through a very strong very clear methodology of building their capability to accept change\nThen to lead change through the organization and when the organization picks up the leadership for all the speed almost doubles and what we said there is they own the results they're changing their making the change is necessary they're holding their self accountable\nThey know who is responsible and accountable for doing what task and what activities the organization\nWhen that all comes together that's what makes the change\nProcess occur most people skip the accountability and responsibility\nThat sounds like and I this is very interesting that\nYou bring on experience be thirty five your your upbringing on twenty girls who just graduated from what I like twenty eight year olds who got well we all do we got to have because the twenty eight year olds become to thirty five year bridge later but the cost of some of the big firms ... you can do it for half the price for somebody with thirty five years experience\nAnd so when you come in you're not just shy of just what you need to do you're able to say\nLet me explain why this is important\nGuy they've got the background and experience to know is that's very powerful\nIt it is and and we get a lot of compliments from our clients that when after we've been with the client and lead them through this process the feedback that we get through either they're wanting to share with another prospective clients or they shared directly back to his is\nWhen your when your team came in\nThey slow very quickly became ... by the organization they were not an outsider they weren't a consult they were part of the teen helping with the change\nOf helping is one of the keys to go to a change management UVA so tell me when ... when somebody calls and we'd go CEOs business leaders out there what what's the right time to call\nIf I ... I Would tell a CEO and I've told our our\nAnd our car class if you have a change that urinating to make you're going through a business environment change maybe you've had a a an issue occur a significant a business opportunity or ... process issue that occurred incident\nAnd you need that change to occur and you need the organization to rally around that change\nThat's when I think you need to call us because that's what we focus on we focus on helping clients worked their way through those kinds of issues ah we also deal with a lot of\nYou know a private equity firms that want to acquire a new asset or they're doing it for a reason because they believe that they can improve that and in turn around to a profitable business\nWell we believe is that we can help them identify and get their quicker\nI Love it I Do love a very important change management management performance assessments somebody wants to learn more or do they go\nIf they want to learn more they needed to go to our Web page WW Sinclair group dot com or just at any time off the Web page we have our phone number ... give us a call we would like to have a great discussion with you\nOr I don't you gotta thank you for the story and congratulations on your Twenty years success thank you Jay ... we'll be right back folks don't go anywhere\nUnfortunately that has all the time we have we're going to go get smart on something else brings a whole bunch more next week in the meantime or go to Texas business radio that comes through the entire thing and beautiful ... video get your questions in a by phone by website by Twitter we don't care how you get 'em and go ahead and get 'em in for next week we're going to get experts in here to get those questions answered\nThe same time same place next week we'll see then\nYou lose me to do business for the entire show is beautiful age in this radio dot com and don't forget next week\nVegas\nMatt register your your host of Texas business radio have you thought about how you look on linked in do you need to generate qualified leaves your business hire some new talent to market your brand of course you do when you need to make sure you're working with people who know linked in\nIn ... advisory they're linked in practitioners specialist coaches trainers they either teach you how to fish fish for you\nYep you're going to show you how to leverage linked in for your branding sales and recruiting\nOr they can just do it for you remember linked in his business not social that's why we work with ... advisory check them out today in ... advisory in ... advisory dot com and ... advisory dot com\n...

who on earth is going to put a hundred percent of their life savings into the stock market\nI wouldn't I don't think you would either because although the stock market has been historically the best performing asset class we also know it's a very volatile outside class remember two thousand eight\nOf course you do and that's the problem is that we don't want to expose ourselves to the possibility of suffering\nMassive losses in a very rapid pace and that's why you only have part of your money in the stock market so up until Wednesday people have been saying\nHow am I I'm a minority that I'm not doing as well as the stock market how come I don't have all my money and the stock\nMarket because the more diversified my portfolio is no worse it's been doing relative to the stock market because it's been the u._s. stock market that has been out performing everything else of course that's what they were saying up until Wednesday on Wednesday everybody started changing their tune to\nBoy am I really I don't have all of my money in the stock market boy am I really glad I have a highly diversified portfolio boy am I glad I have money and investments other than\nThe stock market see my point in other words just because the given asset classes performing well and even might be performing better than\nAnd alternatives doesn't mean that you ditch the alternative instead we have to recognize that every dog has its day\nAt any given moment fortunes can change as we saw was striking evidence on Wednesday and Thursday when the Dow fell Thirteen hundred points this is why you don't place all your money into stocks\nAnd it even goes beyond that because what Wednesday and Thursday demonstrated for us was something else that's really fascinating\nYou all know what's been going on with General Electric right we've been talking about G E for a few times throughout the year because this company which was at one point one of the biggest companies in America and one of the best performing companies in America certainly one of the oldest companies in America\nHas been doing terribly over the past several years the stock was down forty percent over the past year GE he was kicked out of the Dow Jones industrial average earlier this year\nWow really awful so far this year\nGee is still in the S. and P. five hundred but its stock performance in the U.S and the five hundred year to date through Tuesday\nRanked at the four hundred and Ninety six best stock yeah out of the five hundred came in at four hundred and Ninety six only for stocks were worse than gee\nYou're the date but as a Wednesday for the past week jeeze stock performance is now number one [laughter]\n\nIn other words nobody wanted to own Ga all year long because of all the terrible things that have been happening in that company but suddenly with the stock market dropping so much on Wednesday compared to everything else gee did fabulous and became the number one performing stock for the week through\nTuesday of this past week I mean this is why you really can't try to decide what's gonna happen next because you're probably going to blow it in fact it wasn't the just the G anyone from among the worst to the very best for the weekend and Tuesday\nIf you look at what's been going on in all of the deaf filed the top ten percent of all stocks compared to the worst ten percent of all stocks there has been a complete flip flop\nYear to date the three best performing stocks of the S. and P. five hundred or advanced micro devices\nA bio med and Netflix they were the three best performing stocks of the year but now as of Wednesday they fell to number three hundred and Ninety three number four hundred and eighty one and number four hundred and forty three respectively\nThey went from being the three best\nSoup for the past week as a third Tuesday among the very worst in the marketplace there has been a complete flip flop\nAs a result of the changing of fortunes as of Wednesday the very best performing stocks have become the very worst and many of the very worst have become among the very best this according to analysis published in the wall Street Journal on Thursday\nSo what we have to recognize is that all of this is fleeting the ability to make an investment decision based on how things have performed in the past well that's just a suckers bat and therefore my message she was very simple number one\nLet's not get overly anxious and fixated on point declines in the Dow Jones industrial average number two this is an argument a reinforcement for why you need to maintain a diversified portfolio based on your goals and objectives and number three to maintain your focus\nOn those goals and objectives if your goals and objectives have not changed if your personal circumstances have not changed if your attitude about risk has not changed than there is absolutely positively no reason for you to be making any change in your investment strategy\nThe fact that the stock market had a lousy day one day this past week is not in and of itself enough of a reason to make a change in the portfolio now I'm not suggesting that we aren't going to see continued volatility in the market my point is very simply\nWe can't draw a conclusion one way or the other nor should we attempt to make a prediction about what's going to happen next instead look at the economic fundamentals unemployment is at the lowest level in this country since Nineteen sixty nine wage growth is at its highest level over the last ten years\nThe economy is still humming along just fine and on that basis the argument for staying fully invested in a diversified portfolio remains completely\nIntact and so if you're upset about it if you're watching the news and worried about what you're seeing\nStopped watching them lose it doesn't mean you should change your investment that means you should change much at all that's the most effective

or you don't fall\nAnd my question is about the option of taking a a lump sum pension briefly I've been given the opportunity to take on an wanted your input on it\nSo uh the question is whether you take the lump sum a or a series of monthly checks for as long as you live and uh it's it's an important question isn't it because once you give them your answer you're like stuck with it forever [laughter]\nSo uh yeah it's like they're no reduce no do overs and such like that and that's why it's pretty vexing for a lot of folks the good news is this it is straight math in other words we simply want to look at\nHow much money they're going to offer you on a monthly basis\nVersus if we take the lump sum\nPay any taxes associated with that invest the rest how much income can we reasonably expect to produce from a a an investment we make with that lump sum and is that money going to be equal to what you would have gotten from the pension\nSo the good news is all requires is a bit of math and I can tell you this usually\nWhen we do that math for our clients the answer is take the lump sum and invest it on your own to produce your own monthly income usually not always but usually that is the more\nCost effective more economic uh the the superior answer given the two choices they always say usually and here's one big case where it's usually not true\nOf great or stretching our federal employees and the reason is that in some pensions the pension amount you receive will grow over time they will actually increase the amount of income you're receiving sort of like Social Security increases the sheer they just announced that there will be a\nVery small Social Security increase for folks mostly about thirty or forty bucks for most Social Security beneficiaries\nUm so if you have a pension where were the monthly income you're receiving will rise annually than a clearly that are in most cases is the better choice but most pensions don't do that most pensions it's a fixed amount\nWhatever they are giving you one day one is the same you're going to get ten years from now Twenty years from now Thirty years from now and that's a big reason for choosing the lump sum over the monthly pension because when you take the monthly pension\nThere are several pieces of fine print\nNumber one is I just said that amount will not rise which means overtime inflation will take its toll on the value of that monthly check\nThe the ability to buy goods and services diminishes because those costs rise with the check your receiving doesn't second is that when you die that pension benefits stops are you married Paul no single\nOkay so it's not an issue for you if you don't have a spouse or partner you don't have to worry about that but for people who are married to have a partner a vet pension check stops when they die and that leaves a huge crisis for their surviving spouse uh so that's a consideration a that's not a problem for you\nSo not as big a deal another major one his lack of liquidity once you take the monthly check that's all you ever get as a monthly check if you ever need access to the big bucket of money it's not available to you whereas if you take the lump sum now invested and generate your own income\nYou can increase that income whenever you want to keep pace with inflation you can reduce that you can start it stop it if you need a lump sum it's available to you you have greater flexibility and when you die whatever you didn't spend stays there for your heirs so the lump sum has greater flexibility that is often\nSuperior to taking the pension benefit but here's one final point in favor of the pension\nYou don't have to worry about your own habits in other words some folks if they are given a lump sum\nWill blow the cash and they will discover at some point that the money was spent on vacations and on jewelry on on big screen TVs on lottery tickets and beer and they have nothing to show for it in ten years and now they're in trouble whereas if they had taken the monthly check\nThey can be pretty confident that they will get another monthly check next month like Social Security checks and so they can protect themselves from their own\nA tendency to get my ... so you have to know yourself and you have to know can you be trusted to receive this lump sum manager permanently properly for your own personal benefit or will you be your own worst enemy\nAnd he would say the best thing to do is put it and I are a\nYes or assuming you're eligible and in most cases you are you roll the money over to an IRA and then you begin making withdraws from that account whenever you're ready to start taking it if you want it right away you can start if you don't need it for a while you leave it there until you do need it\nAnd you go from there so in order to find out the answer for sure we need to do that math we need to do those calculations to evaluate how much money is your employer offering you and can you reasonably expect to generate a similar amount of income from an investment strategy crate on your own\nAs I said usually the answer's yes we can do that but not always\nAnd that's why we need to go through the exercise we actually have an office in Troy on in your neck of the woods and so happy to sit down with you and go through this one detail looking at the amount of pension benefit your being offered and contrast that with the lump sum they're willing to give us an alternative to the which strategy is best in your situation\nThat sounds good\nSo yeah but then there's there's like I said it's largely straight math that doesn't require a too much judgment will show you the spreadsheet analysis and say here's what you have this way and here's what you got that way which number looks better to you and it'll be pretty self evident\nYeah if you sit down and see the growth uh especially be taking a ten years before I eligible anyways for the fall out so there's a lot of room for growth that money yeah those ten years\nI'm having to scramble to get him\n... in memory care unit and to monitor her characters in the hospital for about three weeks she recovered that had to go into rehab uh so we ended up having to sell their house I get it cleaned out now that car and get them re establish while each and that was a\nYou know had a pile of obligation that we need your attention to it wow\nI can show really believe me I was in town already but other than having to jump on a plane and go somewhere I'd right beside you every step of the way I Know exactly what you went through a really good and it does it happened so quickly it's just a blink of an ... all of a sudden\nYou're this caregiver and you do it out of love you do it out of not not obligation but ... is your mom for heaven's sakes or somebody else in the family somebody you care about you can't stop you can't give up\nAnd you end up getting exhausted don't you\nWell and it is on intense and especially when you were a monitoring their situation for what ended up being three years here in Florida and then my father died a we rambled to bring her up to Annapolis and then\nUh when it really got hands because I was I'm\nWinding up a job retiring for position and that I also had my six year than a four or five year old granddaughter that I was caring for a couple of days a week well I'm so juggling\nUh my mom in an assisted living facility because although she couldn't live with me at that point she was a too frail right and she and she ended up staying a for fall for a really bad fall in\nThat period of about four or five months and every moment you expect a call saying she was being sent to\nThe Maryland over or do I know feeling believe me down at you and your your mom and this is something I really stress on the show every opportunity I get we're going to do it again I'll let you do with this stuff\nAnd you and your mom talked about any just in case scenarios before that initial fall like if if this happens to me I Want to be here there wherever\nMy mother I'm an amazing woman I was not a ... sound anything when it came to understanding our own mortality mhm and uh we did not have this conversation so uh what was ... on me is the oldest of four but ah to make those decisions for her\nSo boy is not easy you can appreciate that I can I can tell\nYou know what what's interesting is that since all of that um has occurred and you know one of the problem is I think in our country\nAnd that the unpaid caregiver is seen as obligated to do so even though they're sixty five million of us here in the United states and a hundred million in Europe which is roughly the effect of a population\nAre up in the United states um we contribute mightily to the health care ecosystem in the United states and the unpaid caregivers as you know because you are a threat in that direction and largely unrecognized and courted by our society and it's a major problem\nTalk about were embracing chairs comes in what what role they play that's the organization that sent me to you are connected me to you or\nI think Aaron Nathan organization at that Global Initiative that\nNot only recognizes a critical role of caregivers and I'm the health care system but it's trying to actually move uh the needle on making sure that they are adequately supported true health care and financial assistance and rested care\n'em and they're looking to do a for things and wanted to collaborate with other organizations which the court caregiver and if it as\nA drive greater visibility an awareness of caregiver challenges and to support increased policy attention and action like ... it in a as well as creating opportunities for a health care system integration I'm In the United states\nHi I'm I'm support systems\nFor and take care of it right you know to the community through a financial assistance time off but nothing seemed much he can hide pockets throughout the government trends and that\nUh find various levels of support 'em a national family um\n[noise] um [noise] oh man\nI'm with you but I'll help you in addition to caring for the person you're caring for no you certainly have to navigate all these possible sources of help and that's another full time job well it is she better have\nThat most people can't do it no I don't have the healthcare let her see at the financial literacy or the ability to navigate the bureaucracy and they're um we largely do not reading or in a country people who are taking care of their family members\nAnd that very well to\nA dying dying or Alexander on fifty plus with is let let's focus on what the caregivers need so they don't wind up in need of care as well you've got to take some time off and how do you find somebody if you're out of town\nAnd your your caregiving purse or whether you're into her out of town I guess at some point you got to take a break who who gives you that break if you're the only one\nMan Karen I'm In the very end even again for the United states I get most\nOf us look to other family members as we possibly can take them or if they're willing to step up and and I you may have found that the truth well a ... they have their lives and they are not the primary caregiver and it's a challenge sometimes to have them take over\nAnd my sister my sister was five six hundred miles away and couldn't just drop everything in in quit or leave her job even a as easily as everybody would think it would be and so it was difficult for her to help out in the she did what she could but yeah it's tough\nYeah and and they are are definitely do what they can but unfortunately there in that kind of a position like my sister was across the country and yeah and my brother had other obligations ...\nUm they I guess you then look to that paying somebody to make sure that they are taking care of you know adequate land in my mother and she was an assisted living facility\nUm when she required a tremendous amount of care and um although it was probably one of the better it away and\nThe ... the\nThe requirement for health care act is not always at the highest level that you might which\nIs the best way to put it\nWith you or how do we it's\nImportant also I Want to I Want to get to this for a run of the time it's important that we take the time off and not feel guilty about warning needing it we do need that don't we\nWe absolutely need it I mean it is a very stressful situation and and I would imagine that many people are not only taking care of\nA a relative who

talk a lot here on the program of upcoming Social Security crisis and the important that we get Congress to take action now to help us further\nThis conversation I'm very excited to bring on the program Alicia Munnell she's the Peter of trucker professor of management sciences at Boston College is Carol school of management and more to my heart she's the director of the Boston College Center for Retirement Research that might not sound like a big deal you but in our circles and the financial planning world\nThe Boston College Center for Retirement Research produces some of the most important data are useful in the financial planning world so leash I'm really excited to have you with us on the program today\nOh I'm delighted to be here and I like your endorsement\nAlicia is a former member of the president's council of economic advisor she was former assistant secretary of the treasury for economic policy um so how is the retirement outlook these days for today's workers\n[noise] it it's not good Rick I'm though we calculated in in ... shows about fifty percent of today's working households are not going to be able to maintain their standard of living once I stop working\nWell that's not very exciting and ... is the situation been this way for a long time or has the landscape changed in recent decades um\nThe landscape has changed a lot in recent decades and has gotten a particularly ah or since the financial crisis\nI mean to some to them me why what we should ask why we lost\nA lot of money in two thousand eight and a lot of house values and those items haven't totally returned\nWell wait a minute hang on I mean if you sat through two thousand eight and took no action I mean the stock market back then was at fourteen thousand before the crisis\nUh today the bows pushing twenty five thousand housing prices back you know seven weren't as high as they are today in major markets so shouldn't people actually be better off today now that we've had an extra ten years of savings on top of it\nAnd yet you're saying that's not really true in a lot of cases\nSo that's a sharp and the stock market the people hold stocks are and the people in the high end conference so if you look at the top third and yes they have equity holdings and they have 'em in their stock values have gained to an end\nTheir stocks have gained it value um but for the bottom two thirds of households they really don't hold very much stocks and I think the housing a story is yes for almost back to where it was our our most recent data strict two thousand and sixteen and hadn't quite gotten back to the off\nPeak of the bubble a by two thousand sixteen bought the house values have really high on the ... as you know in Boston New York and California and and not so high in between and not even high in all parts of California\nAnd this is I think the point that a lot of folks really don't fully comprehend them and we see this every day and our financial planning practice that\nAlthough it's true that people who own stocks and oh seven had they held through today that'd be a lot better off the first fact as you pointed out as most people did known stocks at all second those many votes\nDid hold stocks into southern panicked and nine gold at the low or near it and so they're kind of frozen in time there are ... are pretty much were they were even though we're ten years later\nThey haven't enjoyed the run up in value because they didn't hold on to their investment for having continue to add to their investments and so they are still stuck where they were ten years ago\nThat that's right and it's and it's a lot of people lost their jobs between a two thousand seven in two thousand nine and had to turn to their four one K. and rich other retirement holdings to make ends meet during that period\nSo even if I hadn't panicked events just demanded that they were throwing money at all on\nMarriage issues medical issues other family issues they just didn't have the luxury of holding on to their investments [noise]\nSo that means people are now in a conundrum because here we are ten years later everyone's ten years older retirement is ten years closer\nAnd they might not have the retirement savings account values today that they had hoped they would have by now that is forcing people to work longer but is that as viable or an answer as you might hope\nSo I'm a great fan of people working longer I think it's the most powerful lever Pete that people can control and have a huge impact on their wellbeing a in retirement\nSo we've got the issue that people in order to improve their situation and generate income for themselves what they want outlive is one key working longer the longer you work\nThe more money you're writing your investments to more but those investments can grow in value and let's face it the longer you work the shorter your retirement will be and that means less money also when we need to accumulate so it was a double benefit or by working longer\nIf you take your Social Security benefits Seventy instead of sixty two it's Seventy six percent higher and so your lifetime benefits will be the same but your monthly benefit will be um that Seventy six additional present\nSo work longer so that you have or saving more your investments can grow more value your ultimately going to get a higher monthly Social Security benefits and all that money isn't going to have to last as long as it otherwise myself exactly\nRight but lose the only one other asset that's left that a lot of people I think ignore and that's the equity in their homes is that a potential resource for\nOh I'm just I I Love the house almost as much as I Love working longer um you're right for many people their houses their largest asset outside of the\nWealth that they have them in their Social Security benefits and\nA tapping home equity I think is actually going to be part of the answer and going forward
