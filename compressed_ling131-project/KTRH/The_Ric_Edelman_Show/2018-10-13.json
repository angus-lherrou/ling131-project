nationally recognized certified financial planner professional\nAndy Smith with just a couple of minutes away from this week's portfolio review first we have a question for me I was calling from Massachusetts hello any\nKind of fell on my question is forty eight years old [noise] um my husband\nAnd I make I said I think about the ah I only have about eight thousand tonight thousands of dollars on a friday or a and I would like to know how much I Need\nTo put away I Can't retire maybe when I looked at it like\nQuestion okay great question um so you know kind of the easy answer is\nI usually tell people save as much as you can for as long as you can and so we kind of on top of that then you've said All right so if you're ... you want to work until you're seven day you've got about twenty two years and so that's a good amount of time\nTo get a fair amount of money or you know socked away or inside the Ross IRA here's what you can keep in mind so with your Ross IRA\nUm and then you know the same could go for your husband as well so with your author raise each of you can contribute up to fifty five hundred dollars a year\nBefore your age fifth book made me before you turn fifty so you're forty eight how old is your husband\nIs younger than ...\nOkay so each of you can contribute fifty five hundred dollars a year now once you turn fifty you can actually save you can save an additional thousand so you can save sixty five hundred dollars a year went on sixty\n... would know when you're fifty so here in a couple of years you can start saving sixty five hundred so what I Would do is just kind of have in your mind you know for these next however many years however long you're working you plan on saving fifty five hundred dollars a year before age fifty\nAnd then sixty five hundred dollars a year for that twenty year period of time between eight fifty in Seventy now when you when you retire so you want to work until you're Seventy [noise] the other thing I Want\nTo do that but at this point what choice because I thought\nOkay you know and I would say that you know I'm you've you've got the savings you're going to be working one of the things that we've found that that is most helpful for people's um you know to to help them find success with their retirement is just working longer\nSo the fact that you want to work until I Seventy yeah might not be the thing that you thought was going to be the best thing in the whole world but it really is going to help you because the longer you work\nThe the less you have to pull from your investments or you don't have to claim Social Security uh you know for\nA you know for anything for that so when you retire at Seventy you're going to have Social Security and then you're going to have your investments to live off of\nUm do you have any debt right now no tail that perfect All right so no debt um any other short term cash need that you see here in the next twelve to twenty four months\nNo okay I I I don't want a house because I'm ... ... ... talking and it went right now okay so I feel like I used to own a house before my mortgage was so funny that a lot of fucking run it out as a mortgage saying OK\nI'm putting money away for something for our\nPerfect perfect and if you're paying you know fourteen Fifteen hundred dollars a month in rent now the mortgage earlier was less than that you you can that's just budgeting um when that when that comes into play 'em so really what I Would have you do right now is you know for twenty two years\nOr however long it is you know that you're going to be a working you know plan on saving that fifty five hundred bucks we're sixty five hundred bucks into that Ross IRA now or do you have access to email I go\nOkay um when you are in a position to send me some more information about the Ross I can put some more ideas into an email for you just send me an email to ask Andy\nAt investing sense dot com but the the things that take away from the call right now you're going to save fifty five hundred sixty five hundred will get your squared away with some different investing ideas for those Roth accounts\nAnd then pass that every three months or six months or so give me a call dropped me an email will kind of get your squared away for the next couple of of quarters\nAnd really will just kind of approach it from there once you get to you know
