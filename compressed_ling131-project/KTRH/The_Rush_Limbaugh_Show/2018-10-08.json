I don't I don't want to fall back on that to suggest that this uh anger they feel is not legitimate is legitimate whether they're being paid or not I don't think that means that the real enthusiasm a

be all wet that could totally get it and they could be promoting it and which is probably closer to the to the truth than not\nBut for those that don't get it it amazes me that it is possible that these\nProfessional Democrats are like Nate Silver do not consider these protesters to be members of their party and representative of\nThe ah the party have large here's J Christian Adams writing is

passed into law by the elected representatives of the people except for Obamacare\nAbortion the American people haven't decided that that was forced\nOn the American people by a leftist activists judge and a majority on the Supreme Court\nAnd any other number of cultural issues which are designed to strike out at this white power structure that the left so despise isn't so hates\nThat they cannot beat they cannot win they cannot do this legislatively they need\nActivist judges dominating courts in order for what they want to be forced on every ... this is the point what they\nBelieve

Obama never tells the truth about their agenda they would not win the presidency if they were honest about that which they intended to do\n\nIf Obama had been honest about the way Obamacare was going to end up and how much it was going to cost you and how much you deserve to pay for it because you've been getting a free ride all these years if Obama had been anywhere near honest about that or what

it they don't have the ability\nTo to win any of these issues legislatively\nAre you left us you can get mad at me all you want out there but you cannot review this\nEvery thing they want everything they have achieved outside of Obamacare has been forced on the country the country has been bludgeoned into accepting it\n\nThe country has been bludgeoned into looking the other way and if you don't look the other way and if you find it then what do they do they sue you\nThey try to ruin you or they bully you or they harass you or what have you this is not the behavior that does when things

the\nAlexandria Ocasio Cortez fame and it just it it just after nine stupid I Wish I could remember it it's in our show our guys but this is the first I think maybe we've had a sound bite her before

read that question again it feels devastating to me\nIf white women cannot have a public life a private life for\nShould a life or in protest then what are we to do\nAnd here is the brilliant answer from Rebecca Traister\nAre me angry that it has to be white women before we take they started seriously or or it I think it's an do we also acknowledge that we need to wake the white women and their power their products more power can be useful in ruins nailing the degree to which women are still oppressed\nAnd then in fact in this strategically necessary and this goes back to the question do we need white women question that every candidate\nIt's an electoral question every candidate needs to ask do we need white women [noise]\nNow this wouldn't be happening if it hadn't been for the

itself in such a way\nThat men were stolen met the league guilty simply because they exist\nSimply because they are capable\nIn fact [noise] let's see there's actually a story with that exact point may the here and I think I moved to the padded bottom of the stack\nBut it is it is a woman making the point that Kavanaugh is as good as guilty because he could have done it\nAnd he could have done it because he's a man\nHe could have done it because he has male genitalia that's all this woman in this story requires to believe\nBall Z forward that Kevin ... could have done it well if you're old woman with the sons and a husband that you love and sort of brothers and you're watching this you wouldn't miss\nWhat is transpiring that men are automatically guilty all it takes is an allegation the obligation doesn't require any evidence in fact the fact that there's no evidence adds to the fact that the allegation is likely to have happened\nAnd I mean the Democrats learned insurgency they become a political uncertainty and as you noted thirty the there to feed it they just change tactics\nAnd the new tactic um you know they employed with a judge Kavanaugh with Christine ball before they had a two for that someone that not only educate our youth\nThat someone that was going to put on a suicide vest for oh I just think that this is the new battlefront and thankfully we tromp

have talked to was willing to address the issue do you think that this insurgency as you've described it which is this behavior but just that we've seen the last two weeks do you think that kind of behavior which was widely\nPublicized Democrats loved it the media loved it they tried to make heros out of these people they didn't try to hold them back\nWhere they want to disrupt the Senate vote they disrupted the Senate vote when they wanted to get in the halls of the Senate Russell office building they did so they got an elevators they shouted these people down to the Democrats have not once called out that activity they've never once told outside their side to stand down do you think\nThe American public watching that\nIs going to be turned off by it and want to vote against it or do you think the American public\nDoesn't care one way or the other and doesn't even really notice it [noise]\nI think it's largely going to be turned off but like you said they've they've completely changed their base now they've given up on the working blue collar class and they're now they're now trying their hand and see if they can somehow\nUm increase the numbers with women on these type of issues but I think largely that that the American people are going to be turned off and\nI I think it's all going to come down to a who who was able to get out get out the vote in a month but that had\nWell see my point twenty twenty\nLet me okay this is my ... I don't think given what we've seen the last two weeks among people in the public who watched it I don't think the Republicans need to do when he got out the vote this was that\nIn my scene and just world the Democrats are just exceeded and getting Republican turnout larger than it's ever been for a mid term I Know I'm probably wrong about that but that's how I look at it that's how it ought to be and I'm the king a book's title the way things ought to be an automated people were outraged by this\nIt ought to be that people can't wait to punish this bunch of ... for the way they have treated in this country the past two weeks alone the Republicans are not have to spend the time getting out the vote based on this but I Know that's not the reality kinda frustrating to me but that's the case [noise]\nDemocrats thinking they're going to turn out here that dwarfs anything the Republicans have to show up on election the Democrats think the whole country is except they really don't they know they don't have enough Americans to win legislative battles but they think that\nThey're going to be able to put together enough people to dwarf whatever Republican turnout there is\nAnd they've got new stories predicting that very thing so people are going to be reading it people are gonna be reading Republicans don't have a chance\nYou may replied\nNo I I agree and um I think they energy I think they energize the base and they did exactly what needed to be done and I think this is the issue that you were speaking of a month or so ago\nThat the event hadn't happened and with twenty nine days let it happen\nA true yeah when I'm when I said the events that were going to shape the midterms hadn't happened uh thirty days ago I was exactly right and there are some people saying that this is going to be forgotten by the time the election comes around\nA lot of people I saw him on Fox they a lot of learning puns and commentators oh this was going to be so old by then actually heard a couple of people say the things that people are going to vote on probably haven't happened yet I just to have the tropical [noise] um\nSo I can I can see what the passage just ... you cannot maintain this river passion for long nobody can\nWelded but we're talking about I'm Talking about reasonable people I'm I'm ...

Bush and Republicans in memory of Paul Wellstone Republican senators who were friends of Wellstone who's doing it fully showed up at the arena\nThey did this arena in a place that whole Fifteen thousand people if my memory serves ten Fifteen thousand people\nIt was some time after a while most of them died in the plane crash and it was some time after that but this was the official memorial and it was I don't think it was ever intended to be a memorial I think it was a political event from the get go disguised as a memorial anyway Republican senator is not knowing up from damage I'm Trent Lott and the boys\nAll showed up thinking that they were showing up to a memorial a religious memorial to honor their form and colleague Paul Wellstone\nThey worm boozy and bullied and harassed out of the place within thirty minutes of having arrived in sat down it was identical\nTo what we saw the way Jeff Flake and others were assaulted in elevators animal hallways of the Senate office building\nExcept this was after memorial and this was a Democrat voters going up to the worthy Republicans receded in getting in their faces and pointing fingers at 'em and Boeing at them\nThey thought they were there to participate in a solemn occasion they got up and they walked out and they left\nAnd this memorial turned in to a hate fast a hate fast aimed at George W. Bush a hate fast aimed at George W Bush's policies they couldn't even set aside what had happened on nine\nEleven for this memorial this Morial took place about fourteen months after nine eleven\nTook place so then the men terms a curve\nAnd I remember I was invited to the last time this happened I was invited for election night coverage on NBC Tim Russert asked me to join him and Tom Brokaw I Do to fully accepted\nAnd I went and I was not on camera all night maybe four or five times while they they cycles other people through\nAnd they brought me and after it was clear that the Republicans hadn't gained ... seats on heard\nOf the Democrats just like now we're supposed to win big because Democrats told everybody hated Bush everybody resented the wave of Supreme\nCourt stole the election for Bush\nThat Al Gore had won the popular vote just like reached and the the American people felt betrayed by Bush and the Supreme Court and nine eleven and Bush's general stupidity and competence and as such couldn't not wait for the Democrats didn't take back control of what is right probably\nThere's Washington DC except it didn't happen the Republicans gained ... seats Tim Russert was great broke all brought me out and so what do you think happened here I said the Wellstone memorial\nBut Wellstone memorial is what happened and I went on and told them why and the truncated version of what I just said they knew they were shell shocked they were shell shocked is just not in the formula the party in power does not pick up seats\nIn mid term elections the first ones after a new president is elected so that's a formative experience for me and if it's I like\n... if it's happened once it can happen again something that hasn't happened before probably won't happen but if it has then it can happen again and this is a replay of that except\nThis is a replay of even more outrageous behavior the Wellstone memorial took place on one night the Democrat Party has been insane on display for
