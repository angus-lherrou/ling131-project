forefront of his supporters minds so I've been studying the media to try to get a handle on who actually might be behind this\nAnd here's what I have found today CNN is spending\nAlmost eighty percent of their time on the show ...\n\nEighty percent may okay even if it's just sixty percent of their time on ... they're not focusing on the care of him\nThat tells me\nThat if the caravan wore a Democrat idea designed to embarrass Trump that they would be covering it and building it up\nAnd with people down there interviewing these people creating sob stories that would be there'd be man on the street interviews with a mean guy Trump is are they just want to come to America to and that may yet happen down the road but CNN\nIs is not wall to wall but they are predominantly focusing on the show gave and of course whatever CNN does just to try to damage Trump let's look and see\nThe CNN is so ticked off because Trump's approval numbers are higher than they've ever been now\nAnd there are higher than Obama's war at this stage in the ah in his mid terms of the same point in his presidency after two years there just beside themselves none of this\nIs happening the way it was supposed to happen now there's more and more stories about how the blue wave may not happen hint hint it never was going to happen I don't think anybody has ever known whether it's going to be a blue wave they've been relying on polling data but nobody knows for sure that was that the media narrative\nIt was a meeting that was not born of any evidence that couldn't be any evidence for a blue wave or a red wave the election hasn't happened yet nobody wants to\nRely on polling data to suggest that it's going to happen but the polling data hasn't been accurate either starting in two thousand sixteen and the presidential race\n\nSo we've got this caravan chugging north and I think you know put some things in perspective on this again the way to look at it is is as a a\nMicrocosm of what's happening every day and our border every day this is what's happening\nNot seven thousand a day but but but every day this is what's been going on for decades and it needs to stop\nAnd Donald Trump is the only person that's ever talked about working to make it stop now the Democrats\nIf there are behind this one of the strategic ... besides getting somebody hurt\nAnd blaming that on Trump maybe what they're hoping is the Trump actually won't do anything about it\nMaybe they're hoping that Trump will be all huff and puff talk about sending the military down they're talking about setting a National Guard up but not actually doing anything they might be rolling the dice that Trump isn't going to do anything because they think they have rattled Trump\nWith their stories earlier this year about how he separated families the border and how Trump didn't like that and that was the infant didn't want it to last and so he did what he couldn't to change it I\nI Do know this\nDespite everything that you think you wouldn't know the common sense there are still Republicans elected Republicans would look at this caravan and their solution is to let them in\n\nAs elected still there are so you're about peace yesterday they are so scared of this issue they are so scared\nThat when ever the subject to legal immigration comes up Democrats automatically when Republicans think they've got their show they're not cold hearted mean spirited and all that let them they're not publicly saying this but I Know that there\nMay be the Democratic gambling is too is is is a wild guess at Trump's actually not going to do anything after huffing and puffing and I'll tell ya\nIf Trump doesn't do anything if this caravans allowed to get to the border and come into the country what do you think that wouldn't do the Trump there's one issue that could separate Trump from his voters or at least make his belt voters begin to\nI don't doubt is the right where they would be my totally disappointed particularly after Trump has said over and over again that this\nCaravan is not going to get to him if if if if some\nRepublicans are behind this then that that is obvious uh but I just somebody has to be\n\nSomebody has to be making this happen folks we're talking with we we've got how many two thousand miles\nStop and think of this from Honduras\nTo the southern border of the United states assistance and Arizona is around two thousand miles\nSeven thousand people one day\nJust decided to start walking to the United states two thousand miles\nI also think if you're looking for people behind this you have to look at the drug cartels and if you want to start trying to analyze will what their politics in this be that opens up a whole new can of worms but I don't doubt that they are playing a major role in transportation\nBut there has to be political involvement here too because money has to be available there has to be money being spent on this so you've got seven thousand people who all of a sudden and decide all of a sudden because nobody saw this coming and there was no advance word of it\nSeven thousand people decide to start walking to a thousand miles\nWe don't see pictures of of of where they're using the bathroom\nWe don't see pictures of them gathering or getting food and eating it\nI mean look at random video you might you might see some people truly think but I mean we don't see how this is being handled we don't see the port a potties we don't see and are they just urinating and rivers and streams that what the environmental wackos think about that if that's happening\n\nWell I guess you you may have a point welcome to San Francisco they could already be accustomed to it especially the deaf occasions in the street and they get maps in San Francisco for the tourists can blame the piles of human feces\n\nSo how long would it take to walk two thousand miles along with a ...\nRemember they're vowing together I just hit the southern border of Mexico they're vowing to get here by mid term election day\nSo I don't walk enough to know\nHow many miles a day you can walk if you just start walking and you take a periodic break and after twelve or Eighteen or whatever you stop and slow down and rest\nFor the next day that people tell me that they would have to be walking something like twenty miles a day\nFor one hundred days I mean if it makes sense to a thousand miles twenty miles a day for a hundred days without any rest a hundred days for those are real limited that's over three months\n[noise] and the objective is to show up right\nAs the polls open on mid term election day [noise] so if they had been walking for what two and a half months have we seen video of the walk and it's beginning\nRemember the caravan was originally thirty five hundred or four thousand people now it's swollen just seven thousand and the word is it may become ten thousand [noise]\nAnd then of course ah ladies and gentlemen the caravan now has been joined

was in Mexico city over the weekend said we're concerned that these migrants may be victimized by human smugglers are others who what exploit them we're also deeply concerned with the violence\nProvoked by some members of the group as well as the apparent political motivation of some organizers of the care of it by the way the [noise]\nThe details on that story are from the uh\nOh here's one from NBC and they are literally outraged over what ... saying sectarian state pumped pale raised the stakes last night as thousands of Central American migrants invaders\nHeaded for the United states as they marched into may go claiming they were inciting violence pond pay also they're inciting violence under the influence of politically motivated the leaders\nHow was it raising the stakes\nTo point out what is happening what is the secretary of state Pompeo raised the stakes Sunday night how was it raising mistakes to point out what's happening\nEspecially when\nWe have a party a political party that believes in open borders a media in a party that believes in open borders they will never report anything\nNegative about these invaders\nRight mind would want this who in their right\nMind would want any of this illegal immigration who in their right mind would promote this didn't want this who wouldn't want a mob an invasion of seven thousand now eight thousand people to storm the border in the world wouldn't want that and why\nIt makes no commonsense under the umbrella of what's good for America\n\nWhat ever motivation for the people who want this to happen it's not for the good of America it's got to be for something else so Pompeo goes down and promptly identifies what's happening here NBC says raising mistake what's cakes\nWe have somebody finally pushing back on this because remember of the Republican Party up until Trump never didn't push back on this they they came up with their own reasons for wanting\nAmnesty for illegals and for you know having a fall push on securing the border on Sunday night ... who met with the Mexican president went on the offensive alleging in a statement that many of the migrants were criminals themselves\nBy definition they are if they intend to cross the border illegally they're all criminals but at the world is so damn hard\nTo understand about this I think it's a classic illustration of how tough this country is getting\nAnd one of the reasons this country is getting soft just because the elderly or senior generations are turning over everything to the young who haven't lived long enough to know what's\nBest for being driven soulmate by emotion govern stolen by a motion not any any kind of common sense\nAnd because of some odd quirk that's happened in our sociology adults today seem unwilling to teach young people right and wrong or to help them benefits from the wisdom comes from having lived a bunch of life and having a mess\nThe bunch of experiences there is no way under the sun this makes any sense what so ever\n\nWe may as well not have any border if this is something that people want to advocate for permitting and allowing may as well just to raise the border and said to the world come on in\nBecause that's in essence the impact of this if it's not stopped it but it's not dealt with\nThe people of the world do not have an entitlement to the United states taxpayers back pocket but the Democratic party assumes or seems to think that they do the\nDemocratic Party is calculating that there are more people who want to get in to the American taxpayers back pocket then there are American taxpayers\nAnd saw the Democratic party is siding with\nThe people around the world who have nothing who thinks that because the United states has a lot\nThey should just be able to come in and get whatever they want almost as an entitlement we have a political party pushing this we have a political party promoting this this political party ought to be no where near winning any thing in the next elections\nThere is not a single reason to vote for these people under any breakup commonsense\nTake a look at the things they advocate take a look at the people they try to destroy take a look at the things they are promoting\nIt defies common sense to support this\n\nAnd frankly I don't think they have as much support as the media narratives would indicate I don't want somebody to tell you right now I don't believe and I haven't believe for a long time that there has been a slam dunk blue wave what we're being told right now\nThey have you with\nInformation station every facet

the\nCase of ... to get killed because he was an ally of Osama bin Laden I never said any such thing I said that in fact the exact opposite so yeah\nYeah a lot of people worked up about that here on the other side of the glass I'm going to get to it or in due course same thing on this transgender business a drop of a distraction is attempting to eliminate the whole classification and I'm going to tell you why I agree with that but all of that coming up here's the final Louie Gohmert bite again bill hammer\nOut we're concerned these migrants may be victimized by human smugglers are others who would exploit them were also concerned or is this ... saying this we're concerned about violence promote by some members of this group\nAll of these people trying to force their way and\nIt's called an invasion and thank God we have a president that will stand up to an invasion of like this but under our constitution that Governor thing call out military troops just stopping invasion and I've heard people on TV so called experts say well you can't use the military because a positive comments out is look\nThat normally prevents military from being used against its own citizens\nIt has nothing to do with using the military to stop an invasion from another country so\nThere's nothing unconstitutional illegal about the president knowing what went through a Wilson did put tens of thousands of people on the border and make sure nobody forces there way\nIt's a no brainer folks get is a number of the president can do that and has committed to it you would dare you you you\nHe may not send the military and I may call as a as a congressman government says there but there's no law since he can't\nThis isn't about what is what is seven thousand Russians were about to force their way into the okay what uh seven thousand Russians are about to force their way for the southern border\nTo try to affect the mid term elections\nWhat if we could make that case what do you think that people will be demanding Trump do stand aside and let the seven thousand Russians in so they can hack our computers and make sure the Republicans win them in terms of it's a joke folks at the junk you never know who's listening I'm just asking you what if it's seven thousand Russian communist thing goes trying to get in\nAn invasion either way you look at here is Mike in Youngstown, Ohio getting a call in here in the first hour welcome sir how are you\nGood good Russian I Hope you and your family's all good\nListen I I think this has all the makings of a bad set up\nFor Trump because of the optics are I don't care if you're militarized border if they bomb rushed the border like it is down in the southern side to Mexico where they tried to stop what's our military supposed to break out the times or water hoses or\nGas that's just going to look so bad that Trump is going to take the brunt of it but he needs to do is call a a house and the Senate back into the emergency session and do a national address and put everybody on the line not just try to deal with this themself\nSo bring him back in for a special session or do what passed legislation specifically saying that this mob is seven thousand can't come in\nSomething though that sort\nI mean are you using Trump needs to share the burden of providing the obstacle that if Trump soon as a military down and they started cracking the heads and it looks bad for Trump exactly so you think that's what the actual intention here is whether people playing this thing\nExactly and that's where he can try to deal with this on his own she needs to put everybody else's but on the line get them on tape on film or whatever what should we do what would you like to do if they come across\nActually like that in a way I like making Schumer and Pelosi stand up for letting these people in\nAny way it's a good point it's a it's it's it's a it's a dangerous situation but it isn't a whole lot of different ways that will be back my

anybody found a hundred thousand people trying to get into a Beto O'Rourke event\nYou have a venue that holds Seventeen thousand people you have anywhere between Seventy five thousand in a hundred thousand people who want to get in that is not the kind of thing that happens\nWith in a political party that is losing losing favor losing support losing elections every where Trump goes these

they could email it to me they had to run it at twice normal speed\nAnd it's still thirty five seconds long it never ends and then there's a note\nThis is that this doesn't even show that people ... through the parking lots to get in there was a mile long line of people to get into the Trump in Mesa, Arizona the media is not reporting this aspect of the Trump rallies\nThe media is not telling you how many people want to get in are trying to get in and how many people are showing up and standing in line because if they did local media may I don't know national media CNN PMS NBC ABC NBC CBS are not showing us because if they did it would put\nThe lie to the notion of all the energy is on the Democratic side meanwhile there's not a single Democrat drawing anywhere near these\nKinds of rallies

this isn't about civility this is about what I brought up three weeks ago this is not how decent people behave\n\nAnd I said decent people don't know how to deal with this kind of in decency which is what we're up against on the Democratic side whatever you want to call it lack of civility in decency whatever it is it is not the things you associate with winning\nIt's not the kind of behavior you associate with good times good vibes positive outlook\nThese are people in a rage and angry disappointed depressed what have you\n\nThe the contrast here is striking and that's why you do not see any news coverage of the size of let me tell you something\n\nThe ... the number of people the size of crowds to get into a Donald Trump rally\nIs ten times the size of this mob that is invading the country currently coming up through Mexico you've seen those pictures the media is happy to show you those pictures the media can't wait to show you this so called caravan of seven thousand people\nSoon to be a thousand people and they claim might end up being ten thousand they'll show your pictures those people all day well here's what you need to do when you see that picture a seven thousand people or what is said to be seven thousand\nPeople multiply that times can that's the number of people trying to get into a Donald Trump rally in Mesa, Arizona and even more than that at a rally in Texas\n\nI Wish they use AT and T. stadium is Jerry Jones palace where the cowboys play put a hundred thousand people in there so you think\nThat Democrats can get together a mob of seven thousand people have march ... through Mexico\nMan look out for those people were really and we're supposed to sympathize with if they don't show you\nThe thousands upon thousands standing outside lining up twenty four hours in advance to get into a Donald Trump rally and I'm telling you that kind of thing does not happen to people losing elections who are about to lose elections who are losing favor with the American people it does not happen\n\nOkay back to the phones we go to a certain floating\nIn Macon Georgia great to have you with us on ER network Hi thanks for having me on Russia appreciate it you know Ben Wilton it's great to have you here\nLike the reason why I called I spend a lot of years the military are retired from the branches although we are very good a lot of things we are not good\nAt basically civilian type a non lethal warfare we've gotten much better at it since Afghanistan and Iraq started but that is one saying throughout the years we not be good at so their situation and look I'm One hundred percent for putting the military before but this one is perilous and we have to be careful\nWell when when you said the military is not prepared for an invasion you're talking about this this is not a military invasion and talking about a ... a human way of uh invasion of people\nThat are largely are going to be thought of is starving thirsty poverty stricken this kind of things simply demanding\nLife what am I got to let it play\nIn the military is not used the standing up to people like that certainly not in Flint thing and the harm on them is that what you're saying\nYeah I think the difference is you know when it comes to locality we're very good when it comes to less lethal we that's just not something we do that well we're individual you're sort of very good at it but that wouldn't be enough\nTo okay what about this what about just the president's here's the U.S military standing at the border you will not cross\nOkay what happens then if they do and whether or\nNot the problem that's the peril is part of the problem\nWe're but you don't you and your ... your ears bullet you use ah one of the dummy is called I forgot that the use you use some kind of force but not leaf all\nWe have a quality of the things you but you know all it takes one person going down and squeal and like a pig and then as we just have to follow up I don't see anything good coming out of this but the president would be tremendous\n[noise] but the presidents would be okay so there's ... you think the military showing up is let me just put words in your mouth and you tell me if I'm right or wrong in interpreting you you think the military showing up as a lose lose proposition\nNo ethic initially is a great idea but we have to be prepared for the next step\nWell but you say we can't take the next step because the next step is not what they're good at they're not used to it don't know how to do it\nNow that's the power you know I ... I think we should but we'd have to be prepared politically and militarily\nWell then what is it what's the preparation it'd be ... you'd have to be prepared to use deadly force off like\nOkay well let's let's let's let's let me give you a scenario then okay I'm just doing this in the interest of time I'm not that may it may sound\nIncense I don't mean that they hold the line I hold the line provide a visual presence a visual obstruction they send the signal not welcome do not cross there will be constant warnings but somebody dies and they have to shoot one or two\nThen what happens that we'd have to shoot one I'll tell you I think you'd see a lot of people fall in line at probably with Bush or I'm Talking about members of the the immigrants illegal aliens but we'd have to be prepared to take that one or two it's terrible but that's what it\nTakes you don't think if one or two got hit with storm that caused the mob in rain storm the military just in and and and it it essentially stormed the bullet storm ... you'd think they would cease and desist\nI think they will cease and desist I'll tell you there's a lot of times you'll talk guys have a tendency to fold up when they were met with equal strength and we just have to\nBut even if there is a casualty or to the drive by half of their story Trump Terry fires on harmless or an armed hopeless people\nAnd there's the peril yeah\nOkay so the alternative is to let them in\nNope nope half to hold the line and and like I say somebody's you know what the Democrats are always saying hey somebody's got to tell you one for the team they're closer legalized sleep it's unfortunate but this is what they what they take it all by taking this just\nOwn okay All right so the responsibility for what happens to them has to be on them you would think the media is going to allow that that this is um [noise] I left I I look I Can't start another thought because I couldn't\nThat is should we got to take a break\nRush Limbaugh making radio rain again you're listening to the E.

believe this folks\nThese people are not rational right now\nHaven't been rational for a long time and their irrationality really was jammed up\nAfter Trump won but there's a companion story ... all of the people showing up for Trump and that is not up for the people showing up providing the Democrats are sending Joe Biden out to try to draw crowds for various Democrat candidate\nAnd it isn't working now by showed up to do a rally for the Democratic candidate for governor of Florida Andrew Gillum who as an aside and he'd debated rounds of samples last night on CNN [noise]\nAh this this this guy Gillum for those of you who live in Florida I I Know he seems attractive to some of the wind and Obama like way\nA would be the first African American governor ah is is supposedly just filled with love and ...\n... the guy is a full fledged\nLeftist Marxist that really makes no bones about even just talking about Florida as a collective\nYou know that's communist ... she was talking about Florida as law or a collective he hid it would be a disaster for Florida right now to elect anybody like this guy\nBecause of what he will do\nIn wrecking a growing economy do you know the Florida and Texas economies are growing like gangbusters ... and it's not just because of of senior citizens moving here from other areas of the country it's about tax policy\nFlorida and Texas have no state income tax as such people are moving here in droves and businesses in Florida are growing left and right and this guy wants to shut it down this is this guy is a ... is Andrew Gillum is a classic classic modern day Democrat leftist\nWho doesn't want there to be in the private sector success\nBecause the private sector is corrupt it's unfair it's it's illegitimate I and and it it's it's not everybody's treated equally in so far this guy wants government in charge of virtually everything\nFor his express purpose of determining outcomes based on what he thinks is equality in fairness\nHe doesn't know about running businesses like every other Democrat in the world that's never run one has wanted an open criticism for them and the people around them and the people who found them and the people who start them has a deep resentment he's part of the Elizabeth Warren Obama crowd you didn't build that\nYou didn't look that up a\nWould just be just bad news horrible news with being Zach worst time\nFor anybody like this guy to be elected governor\nOr in in Florida Rick Scott the outgoing governor gosh I Hope this guy beats Bill Nelson he's running for the Senate down here and he is Rick Scott\nIs one of these guys self made and as as a has gotten become very successful and as governor he tackled a whole bunch of emergencies and disasters in just came through with flying colors and and and now suddenly has become a just a static flat line\nJust a a walking echo chamber for whatever left us leadership in the Senate wants done whether it's a benefit the Florida or not but\nThe Santa would be great defense is is a is a regular night conservative Republican who happens to have a good relationship with a with Trump a but Andrew Gillum ... this is the exact wrong decision to make there's nothing\nIn it's not just Andrew Gillum this is no time to be electing people\nWho want to put the brakes on what is happening in this country right now we've got more job openings than there are people to fill them we have people getting raises getting bonuses businesses are growing left and right the economy is rising we've got trade practices coming back into balance now\nWe've got people feeling more optimistic about America at least in surveys then they have expressed in quite a while the trend is constantly upward people have have ah\nExceptionally positive thoughts about the future and electing any extreme leftist Democrat as governor or senator or even as as president in two years would be an absolute disaster\n\nIt would constitute rolling back every achievement that has been made in the past two if you want to go back to flat line the economics of decline where the president tells you this is as good as it gets and you've got to eat better get used to it because America's greatness in the past really wasn't deserved\nWay way stole a lot of what we have we mistreated people all over the world if you want to invest in the idea that the United states is the problem in the world and not the solution then you'll elect these Democrats I Can't\nI Can't imagine people\nWho are engaged and thinking about this and living lives actively involved when ... in any way want to put the brakes on this\nAnd for what reason because they don't like Trump tweeting because they don't like Trump's manners because they think Trump has goldfish or whatever some of the silliest stupidest reasons that's not why Trump is supported\n\nTrump is supported because he's the last line\nTo hold off on this attempt at transforming America into being something that it was never found it to be if you want if you want America to actually be determined by shaped by\nLike this this mob seven thousand people demanding entry into the United states and demanding benefits from the United states because they are deserved because America is responsible for what's going on in their home countries if that's what you want America to be that you got to vote Democrat\nBecause that's what the Democratic party of today wants to happen successful American needs to be punished whatever\nElse is going on it's still boils down to an age is old argument over philosophy and it's\nThis are you better at running your life or is the government better at running your life\nThe Democrat Party believes your not capable of running your life and they don't want you to learn that you can they don't want you to learn that you can be self reliant and achieve great things they don't want you to realize that you can be happy and content\nOn your own the Democrat Party wants people to believe all of that is only possible\nIf government makes it happen or let's have happened but more and more what leftist actually want government to do is punish\nThe Democratic party has become a party of groups\nOf victims and these victims have turned over to their own futures to the Democratic party they have decided that life is too unfair and to me in and they can't overcome any adversity without the Democrats running interference without the government running interference\nAnd so more and more what they want by voting for Democrats they want Democrats to punish\nThe successful or anybody that these people believe is responsible for their unhappiness the Democratic party has become a party of mean spirited extremism\nThe Democratic party has become the home of people sadly when psychological disorders who are demanding that the political system of the country address those disorders and normalize them and that's not the purpose of the United states government and it\nCan't succeed any way I mean this is just hands down in this Andrew Gillum personify is personify the exact\nTotal wrong direction to take at any time but especially now let me go to these photos put but one of these up\nOn the digital camera if you're watching this is Joe Biden at a rally for Andrew Gillum the media is trying to hide the fact that nobody is showing up\nThat is one view of a ...
