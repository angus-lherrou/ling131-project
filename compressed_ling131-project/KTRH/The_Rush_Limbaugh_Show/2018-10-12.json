Maskalyk gaming\n[noise]\nBut because while this guy is jumping all in my chili\nListened to this story this is from the federalist papers liberal professors says hurricane victims deserve to what thank God because they support Republicans\nNow do you think these clowns in Boston with zero in on something genuinely get range like this no they're going to make up the fact that a bunch of people like me who noted climate\nAnd man made climate change is a hoax are somehow responsible for people having lost everything including risking their lives\nDoes University of\nSt Thomas engineering school in Minnesota thermal and fluids sciences professor Dr John Abraham he's a professor actually believe the Florida Panhandle residents deserve to get hit by a catastrophic hurricane\nBecause they elected climate deniers here's the headline\nIn an article written by this guy was published in the guardian not some obscure little rag or penny saver\nThis was published in the guardian\nOn Thursday victims of hurricane Michael voted for climate deniers elections have consequences denying science has consequences and we are reaping what are we so\n\nPeople just like this are teaching your kids and they're being paid a lot of money to do it\nThis is the logic and the reasoning that he is teaching at ease engineering school the guy is still range this is this is hyper political partisanship disguised as science\nHe thinks that voting for Republicans causes hurricanes to hit red states and the people in red states\nWho voted Republicans deserved to get wiped out by hurricanes for voting for Republicans and his name is Dr John Abraham a University of St Thomas engineering school in Minnesota\n\nDespite the lack of science to support his case Dr Abraham blames Michaels in tends to be on manmade global warming there isn't any evidence for it it's not the most intense hurricane ever hit the panhandle\n\nYet he blames the intensity or manmade global warming are needing to his subsequent claimed that southern voters brought this upon themselves by voting Republicans into office\n\nIt's a wonder that a state like Florida which will get pummeled by Michael couldn't vote for somebody that denies climate change this doctor wrote\nPointing to governor Rick Scott andme to Senator Marco Rubio and his argument is that in the last Republican climate deniers or voted out of office that more hurricanes will bring more death and destruction others op\nSo this clown who is disguised as a as an engineering professor literally is saying that if you want to stop\nDestructive hurricanes striking where you live vote Democrat he literally there's one that's what he said\nIn an unrelated story a bunch of ... which is somewhere are putting a tax on Brett Kavanaugh this week and I'm not making that up and they are disguised as Democratic Party activists are hacks on Capitol I'd I'd I don't know what the nature of the Higgs is\n\nI mean this [laughter] if if it if it weren't so irresponsible that would be funny meanwhile you have the entire left now attempting to destroy Kanye West\nAnd what Kanye West Dan is simply venture off the liberal Democrats plantation that is a no no if you're an African American you venture off the Democrat plantation they are going to destroy your meanwhile idiots like this professor\nA professor of engineering literally tells people that if you want to stop\nHurricanes from blowing up where you live vote Democrat it's because you're voting Republican and and denying climate change that these hurricanes are coming after you know do you remember after Hurricane Katrina you people might have thought that I was joking there weren't people\nIn the leftist medium\nWho literally and we're trying to tell people in New Orleans that George Bush wanted that hurricane to strike Louisiana\nHe wanted it specifically the strike New Orleans this is why there weren't any warnings it wanted it to strike New Orleans because Bush knew that residents of New Orleans would have to abandon the city\nAnd go to Texas where as Democrats they wouldn't be absorbed and wouldn't affect any political outcomes but in Louisiana you can turn the state Republican if you can get rid of a bunch of New Orleans Democrats and sort of people out there saying that Bush\nActually wanted to hurricane to wipe out New Orleans so that residents will have to leave\nWould have to go to Houston\nThere were some even saying that Bush was doing what he couldn't just steer the hurricane that Bush was responsible for it because Bush told the weather service to downplay the warnings\nWell I didn't want to mention it but I'll go ahead and mentioned there were some there now these were not mainstream media people but they did repeat this there were people out\nThere talking on a tax on the Internet who are claiming that Bush was steering the hurricane\nRemember that\nThe Bush was steering that hurricane Bush himself the president was fearing the hurry and and what this guy\nIs professor at the University of St Thomas is no different by claiming that simply the way people vote determines where a hurricane goes how stronger hurricanes going to be and whether or not the hurricanes gonna wipe you out and he doesn't know yeah it's the redneck\nRiviera and yeah traditionally the panhandle of Florida blow both Republican but he doesn't know there might have been some democratic voters got wiped out the odds are there were\nBecause so many people didn't get wiped out you know we we we look at these events are these people do as one off political events [noise] some of these people who have been wiped out you you look at that devastation and you say how are they ever gonna come back\nThey didn't have much to begin with\nI mean it's just some of these photos that you see from that area do look like they have been leveled with explosives or it is just heartbreaking to see what happens and they only upside as it was not\nYou know a densely populated area but that doesn't change the impact on the people who lived there ... there were some who didn't they evacuated and I made up their minds themselves the media found them talk to them they want to stay they wanted to hang in they wanted to see what it was all like\nEvery hurricane has those people who are hell bent they either want to protect the homestead or they're curious to hear how devastating and how big it how rock is the Starman storms aren't they want to see it\nAnd they roll the dice thinking that they'll survive it or what have you [noise] it takes all kinds of people but this one I when I saw just today I thought it had to make sure this is not you know some satire sight and it isn't\nClimate deniers making these storms worse by stopping action on climate change so see\nIf we hadn't just not gotten out of the Paris climate accord and if if Trump would stop at Limbaugh on trumpet stop making fun of the UN's ... plant mental whatever it is on climate change then the hurricanes and get their message\nHurricane to go somewhere else they're hurricanes wouldn't get so strong but the hurricanes no hurricanes know that they're attacking Republican voters who is therefore don't believe in climate change their hurricanes are targeting people for destruction of wiping them out and these people need to know that they're making it happen because of the way they vote\nThis is the youth Radio's seven forty Katie our age used in the news weather traffic bad the IRA radio stations the FEMA chief\nSays the death toll from hurricane Michael will

sex in two thousand four ... attorney Benjamin Brafman\nArgue that the charges be dismissed due to Evans previously describing the sex act to a witness has consensual a witness reportedly told this to the YPG\n\nSo Brafman sudden a press conference this is not about suggesting that a woman who comes forward should not be believed this was about a witness who came\nForward and committed perjury before a grand jury now wait a minute\nJust to Brafman we're coming off the Kavanaugh hearings were we were told women can't lie and we were told that women don't lie and we were told that we're not to think women lie anyway and you are now saying\nThat a\nCharge was dropped because a witness who came forward and committed perjury perjury before a grand jury\n\nDon't worry Harvey Weinstein is still a creepy pervert out there still has five counts against him\nBut in this case he found somebody who was willing to sell in what he wanted and they reduced the five to six charges to five

in a conspiracy with Russia\nDuring Wednesday nights campaign rally in Pennsylvania Trump told the crowd there had been collusion and he said well if you look at it when you think of it there was collusion between Hillary and the Democrats and Russia there was collusion\nThere was a lot of collusion with Russia and lots of other people by the way and he's right what he's talking about here\nIs the Clinton campaign of Democratic National committee hired fusion GPS\nFounded by Glenn Sampson who's refusing subpoenas to testify to Congress claiming the Fifth Amendment\nFusion GPS took the money from the Clinton campaign the DNC and went to a law firm cut out called Perkins ... this was done to make Hillary and the DNC money to look like they were buying a legal advice and campaign advice\nBut the law firms then followed the money\nAfter laundering they're Christopher Steele and he then went out and created this lying stinking phony dot CA\nThe one that has the story that Trump hired a bunch of prostitutes in Moscow to urinate on a bad that had been slept in Bible rock Hussein all and Michelle my bell oh\nThe ... is is not a single bit of it has ever been corroborated like balls the Ford story not a single bit of corroborate nation no evidence whatsoever and yet that dot CA was used to get a finds a warrant to spy on the Trump campaign\nAnd that dot CA is what kicked off in a truth ... special counsel investigation and try to find collusion between Trump and Russia to many of his old news but that's what Trump's for learning and Trump is exactly right the collusion here between anybody in Russia is Hillary Clinton campaign the DNC\nAnd the route is Hillary Clinton Indians say to a a\nFusion GPS then on to Perkins collie and then just deals with the money still got went through a bunch of different layers before he got it but they essentially commissioned an opposition research hit piece on Trump that they tried to sell everybody was legitimate until Trump supported miss out\nHillary goes bananas she can't believe the truth is being told about her she can't believe that they can't let this day and so she has to\nTrump is the guy that asked that Russia's had me he did it on national TV Trump is the guy that he would and they have tried to make this case\nI it's the funniest thing in the world Trump was down in Miami up his resort down

[noise] engage in this kind of storytelling insult mongering here it is John ... never Trump or ... or it's\nThe Democrats blue wave is drying up oh that's that would be a disappointment don't God you're elections before they're hatch that's the lesson of the past couple of weeks or so called fundamentals that supposedly govern the twenty eight teams mid terms\nStill point to a good a great night for Democrats there the out party the out party generally does better than the party in power\nBut\nTo generic polling question this week have Democrats up twelve and Thirteen points respectively that would suggest a so called blue wave in which most house and Senate seats in play will likely till Democrat and it's in line with the twenty ten of Republican numbers around now\nYet yet now we pointed\nOut that all of these national generic polls show this gigantic way but if you go race\nI race if you go into the state's district by district you don't see this way if you don't see the evidence in the polling\nAnd people have been asking how can this how can this disparity be how can you have a generic ballots that shows that Democrats plus proper plus Thirteen but then you don't find any single congressional race that shows Democrats plus twelve or Thirteen well it must mean the generic ballot doesn't mean much Muslims is\nHow could a generic ballot the lemon name on it by this time when you start pulling people a month three weeks away from the election you start asking questions about how they're going to vote\nWithout a name and the question what do you think the result is going to be a\nState level polls over the past two weeks showed no blue wave certainly not in the Senate\nThey suggested Democrats appear to have almost no serious chance of winning the authority and the Senate that would require them to pick up three Republican seats and the whole day every other state that they have they\nHeld by incumbents that at this moment it's far more likely Republicans are going to pick up one of their seats\nSo [noise] it's [noise]\nAnd it goes state by state to show her this is all happening and then the evidence against a blue wave is primarily in the Senate\nBut [noise]\nThe conventional wisdom here is not rooted in specifics but conventional wisdom is rooted in just that conventional wisdom and hope\nThe left hopes that this is a\nTraditional here party out of power wins big that's what they're hoping they've got their generic ballot polls would say that's exactly what's gonna happen but then you're going to the states state by state race by race and you don't see it see why to close races summit could go either way\n\nBut they're still hanging on to hope they are reporting the hope they're reporting the hoping hoping that reporting the hope will turn the hope into reality\nNow before we get too much in the hour I Need to tell you a little bit about a movie that is a opening tonight it probably has opened in some cities or reading of certain theatres it's God's Nell\nThe trial of America's biggest\nSerial killer now ... is an abortion doctor who got away with the ... murders in Philadelphia got away with the wanted murder of\nThousands\nNobody can get the media interested in the story even after he was charged and convicted and put on trial and the reason is that climate guys now\nWas the worst thing that ever happened to people who want to keep abortion thought of and\nCategorized as something other than what it is the media wouldn't cover it and nor the trials very much\nThere have been a lot of people who did covered Michele market was one of the leaders also people at the end Morsi an hot air was was hot on the trail of guys and I think they rolled over a hundred and sixty\nDifferent articles so that trend has been how do you do a movie about this how do you get it made me in\nMovie equals Hollywood how'd he get stars had to get people to start it how do you get money to finance it how do you get it made and how do you get it distributed\nIt how do you find the theaters\nThat will exhibits that thing how your door and they they ran into every predictable problem that you can imagine but they ... and they got it done and the way they got this ... this is a movie about the trial of ... guys now it's it's it's a\nIt's a procedural moving like a procedural crop cop show crime in a cop show on TV meaning it follows a formula\nIt doesn't get overtly political it doesn't it doesn't want to limit the audience by getting political even with a trial this movie has a rating of PG Thirteen and it's about wanting abortion murder there is not a lot of\nHardly any abhorrent Gore and violence\nIn the movie and it's to pick them in a in other ways it's not meant to shock it's meant to entertain and educate\nIt's an attempt to you is a movie\nIn a responsible way to do things in movies are supposed to do entertain entertain entertain enlighten maybe informed it's not the political movie that the left would make\nAbout a story like this it can avoid the politics but it is\nExceptionally well done for the subject matter you're you're not going to be if you go see it you're not going to be watching people advocating for a cause\nYou're not going to see a movie designed to separate you from your money in terms of political fundraising you're gonna see Hollywood professionals who happen to be pro life producing a movie about something that really happened\nA mass murderer he was a mass murderer of people\nIn the room that nobody on the left one at anybody to know about\nWhat he did ... guys now was despicable but he was a charming guy even engaging smile and laugh even and his trial it was said that he was charming people now are oh buddy Nick Searcy\nDirected this\nAnd I don't know anything about directing movies but I can imagine some of the challenges in in a movie like this you don't want to preach and you don't want to make your movie of target but you want to be truthful about it and you want\nThe message to be delivered\nBut you don't want to turn people off you don't want people to think that you're being they're they're they're being preached or any of that\nAnd so\nWhen I looked at it I didn't I didn't see Nick Searcy use a bunch of special effects or other things to distract you just let the story tell itself and it's basically the trial there some set up\nThe story itself is all anybody needs to know the number one mass murder in America which he was never referred to as as because of course the\nLeft abortion is not even human it's viable tissue mass or what have you uh it's got\nStars people that you know people put their careers on the line to star in this movie the odds are that they're going to have trouble getting cast and other movies having been identified with this deem came as one\nOf the ah the actor who plays a guy's now himself as a as an actor and I think ... commercials name is Earl Billings\nAnd for somebody that's only widely known as an actor in TV commercial this guy does one heck\nOf a job it's probably the finest role that he's played for the best performance that he's had a I Would guess\nA as an actor but I just want to let you know that if it if you're thinking about going to it's PG Thirteen we're not talking acts we're not we're not even talking are here so you're not\nGonna be immersed in a bunch of\nRepulsive Gore and again it's it's thought that they don't need to do that tell the story of the story itself tells itself the\nTrial of America's biggest serial killer there are a lot of people who have put everything in their careers on the line to get the movie made they got it made\nLot of people to put their careers on the line agreeing to appear and start even Searcy a

that's\nA thousand a year in a way you know this is really a great\nPoint and you're you're you're making a really great point here and and because it you're right on the money out Gore had said\nJust in general that current shorelines and he has he has mentioned Miami in South Florida in Manhattan he has predicted when they are going to succumb to rising sea levels would be underwater and he did say about Miami\nThat it was only a few short years at Miami certain parts of it would be inundated by rising sea levels and one of the places where he said so they are breaking ground or one of the biggest malls in the country do you have to ask yourself\nWho in their right mind would go out and get the financing\nAnd make all of the decisions that hire all the architect everything else has to
