have learned just in the last twenty four hours that woman was brilliant that well then has caught Christine Ford in lies\nIf there ever needed if if it's ever needed doing supposed is what I think people are going to try to get through this without exposing Ford for what she is\nYeah yeah yeah I'm going to talk about what Trump does the Trump did not mocked her last night he made fun of her claims he did not imitate the way she speaks\n... but look I understand Republican senators being alarmed about that but you gotta look at it as a Trump is simply providing cover\nTrump is giving them ... to go ahead and vote the way he did Trump said what needs to be said but these guys aren't going to say it her timeline alone has shifted\nWhen do you think this incident when Kevin all the alleged incident happened because she is described it as early eighty to mitigate any to sometime in eighty three hurt timeline is changed based on who she's been talking to\nAnd that has been documented the fact that she has lied openly now about not knowing anything about polygraphs not helping people pass them\nThere is a signatory to one of the support letters written for her Monica McLean retired F. B. I. special agent her best friend for life\nAnd she is named as one of the people that Dr forty helped pass a lie detector test in her appointment application for the FBI\nMonica McLean\nIssued a statement to ABC I have never had an Christine Blasey Ford or anybody else prepare me or provide any other type of assistance whatsoever in connection with any polygraph exam I have taken it anytime\nI ... I think they've been caught big time and I Rachel Mitchell if I have the time I I've just got enough data on this right before the program again I didn't have time to assemble it\nBut the questioning that we all thought was a waste of time has exposed potentially Dr Ford just so many lives that if it ever came became necessary to use them she can be destroyed the credibility credibility can be destroyed\nA and I think everybody's going to try to get past this\nOr through this with out\nAny any challenging or Dr Ford because she's a eliciting such sympathy and one of the way she did that was with her speech pattern which I Am one of the only people in the media that I Know of a pointed out her speech pattern I look\nYeah I'm a professional and highly trained broadcast specialist\nVocal work a voice\nCapabilities voice talents excuse me again art that not many gotten it out of there that time we'll see\nAre especially of mine I recognize speech patterns I Am able to attach speech patterns to personality types you can definitely do this\nWell a voice actress in Hollywood\nDecided to post on Twitter her impersonation of Dr Ford afterwards and the Twitter universe came down on this woman on mercilessly [noise] so we have not mentioned her name it's out there but I Want to protect her or at least here\nFrom any further assaults taking place but\nHere is what she posted and it is so spot on\nHold aren't anybody and personal ... mind about fat ... high ... ... ... even ...\nI talk about an attack by a car and I found out about ... volts per pound [noise]\nThat her as far as ... even now I'm back\nOn the back so it's kind of a team hockey puck down without a fast and [noise] you can read like how many [noise] so\nI plan running down about bump their prices by ...\nAnd ... that speech pattern what does it make you think you're dealing with a child here the elite up talking at the end of every sentence its its vulnerability\n... is it fringe ill at the almost in a way or maybe even somebody nervous and traumatized and scared and that is exactly the a\nPersonality that I think she wanted the FX and she succeeded with it and it's because\nOf that but I think I don't know no matter what his learned about her and how much she has\nLived if you will a which again Rachel Mitchell has if necessary [laughter] could blow this woman out of a water that's what I had nobody else has put this together by the way that I've seen I've just in random show prep Reno story here story there I've been noticing things\n\nWill be a little reference to what Rachel Mitchell asked her about subject a and her answer it and you read another story and there's one more reference to Rachel but you can put all these together\nAnd it it\nIt's almost as though Rachel Mitchell knew going in\nThat\nShe knew a lot more about balls the Ford than anybody has eluded to she knew about Monica McLean she knew about the polygraph why she asked him this\nWhy why are you this is not what this is about Canada why aren't you asking her details to confirm about her story instead this prosecutor was asking all about seemingly unrelated or not really important things\nSo we will just have to say again Monica McLean retired FBI and this by the way brings up or conjures up\nFBI\nFord has a best friend in the FBI who read ... resigned retired in two thousand sixteen\nI'm Wondering how many people working on the Trump case that the FBI trying to establish collusion that Dr Ford and ... McLean no matter what kind of a possible connection here is there maybe\nSo it's it's it's I'm fascinated as is the letter from the from the ex boyfriend\nAnd the primary reason the ex boyfriend says he broke up with her is how she lied about using his credit card he took her name off the credit card when they broke up and she can tend to use that she turns about six hundred bucks on it\nA\n... was asked directly in the hearing if she had given tips on how to pass a polygraph she said\nNever never\nRachel metro have you ever given temps or advice to somebody who was looking to take a

test\nAnd has a gimmick ask for the therapist notes and the polygraph the audio visual they want to see it rationally and the committee want to see the notes of her meetings with her therapist and they want to see the polygraph test that Ford took\nAnd Ford's lawyer's have returned that reveals attorney any of that over\n\nSo they're not being forthcoming with things that that are a crucial now

times did a year long investigation of Trump's taxes now I I don't know where they got the returns that\nIt's illegal that they have them obviously somebody at the IRS doesn't care I mean the left is infiltrated everything obviously that's how this happened what does it matter wants the times has um that that but\nThey've had them now for a year and know when the story runs\nThey ought not be trying to crowd out the Kavanaugh story right this is something ideally you'd want to wait until closer to the election\nYou want to make me wait a couple of weeks but no they ran this thing yesterday and now there's a companion Showtime network documentary on this so there's been some collaboration might even say some collusion on this\nWhite cover up the Kavanaugh story with the this is providing a huge challenge for the cable news networks what to do what to do we've got Trump out there they claim he's mocking balls e forty wasn't mocking or walk I\nI understand Republican senators saying what they're saying oh my God this is on the acceptable I don't know why president that\nHe did it for some reason everybody's pointing out that the Trump just last week was saying she was very credible yeah he did and we knew when he said that why he said it\nHe had to everybody has to before\nAll this is a investigated and put your but you can't run out there and start ripping on her even if it's desert even if it's warranted last week you could not read up on Christine ball the board there was nothing there is no upside to doing it no matter if you were right\nEven if she was lying to her teeth and you can demonstrate a last week was not the time to do it so Trump joys of course\nI find a compelling I find her very credible will now\nShe's not so credible she never was but now she's not so credible is all kinds of holes in Trump just pointed out all Trump did is playing out the flaws in her story which should have happened\nDuring the hearing last Thursday but the Republicans were not going to go there and they were not going to challenge or because it just wasn't\nSmart [laughter] specially with that voice that she was affecting to go after her in any way that would seem like an attack or like you didn't believe her\nWhether or not been politically useful but in a in a normal congressional hearing committee hearing her allegations wouldn't be challenged in tests that they were not that's all Trump did\nTrump pointed out the mistakes or the ... or the difference is the prevailing occasions she can't remember where when who the people she says we're there says they weren't that's only did Republican senators should have done that last week but they couldn't\nSo Trump's given uncovered Trump's writing shade for them\nLet them go out and rip him for doing it if they want to understand that by this time we have to assume Trump knows what he's doing when he goes off script he doesn't step in it it might look like it\nBut he doesn't but that's not the big takeaway [noise] the big take away from me as this one year the New York times has been investigating the trumps for forty years they've got tax returns going back who knows how long\nAnd guess what's not part of the story guess what is not part of any income tax story on Donald Trump\nGuess what one word you do not see in the report anybody want to take a guess\nWhat\nI often just say no that's not the word what one word is not in this entire New York times story I'll give you a hint it was the sole reason the left I wanted to get their hands on Trump's tax returns\nRussia a tendon for that yet they want to Trump's tax returns because their tax returns they said\nWould prove Trump colluded because his money came from Russia because his wealth was be causing due to Russian connections that's what everybody on the left was convinced was true and now here's the New York times story\nYear long investigation Trump's taxes going back more than forty years and they're not able to find any Russian money\n\nSo now they didn't find any Russian money and I guarantee you they expected to\nThey're the ones who said this they're the ones that said I'm Talking about everybody on MSNBC CNN go back a year ago back to the two thousand sixteen campaign when everybody was hell bent on proving\nThat Trump was a potent storage\nTrump was it Tony Trump was compromised by Russia because it was Russia that enabled Trump to get rich\nAnd his tax returns would prove it they said so I guarantee you when the New York times got these documents the first thing they did\nActually or whatever is on somebody and changes are seen mostly are too young to remember\n[noise] a bottom line and I know what had happened to a woman I'm sort of political thought\nNow what grams point is there's a lot of young people in his audience that don't remember the Clinton years in Nineteen Ninety two when James Carville was trying to destroy all of John's\nHey you never know what you got to know when you got to be able to print it by like what you're going to come up with just like you're not going to you're going to come by women like New Hampshire where the ... not a Bill Clinton\nAnd that's Hillary Clinton was right in there trying to help destroy those women and Lindsey Graham was referring to these people in the audience didn't know what they thought he was talking about Ford\nAnd that's when he stopped and said I see that's actually a reference to something somebody said James Carville most of you are too young to remember this\nSo not only did they live in denial than it ever happened now they're trying to shut down anybody who brings it up you know the Clinton years in what they did the women supposed to go down a memory hall [noise]\nNo I have a transcript and anti Kevin all protester was confronted and I'm a Republican senator and he pushed back this was an attack or a confrontation walking down the hall\nOr any Kevin all protesters have flooded Capitol Hill and they've been allowed to get into the hallways of the offices\nIn Senate office buildings how does that happen\nBut what we all know that what happens but they're they're one of these protesters approached Republican Senator Bill Cassidy of Louisiana on his way through a Senate building walkway Monday\nAnd she said why are you supporting Kevin ... where are you supporting capital Cassidy did not ignore her he took the chance to push back he asked her if she would like it if her loved ones were destroyed by uncorroborated charges\nCassidy why wouldn't I support Kavanaugh protester because rapist or bad Cassidy wait a second everybody there send it didn't happen either rape anybody so why am I gonna so you're gonna you're gonna believe mark judge over a woman no I'm going to believe her best friend\nWho says it didn't happen she wasn't there her best friend didn't say didn't happen her best friend said she wasn't told about it her best friend said she didn't remember it\nProtester so you're okay as a doctor to harm a woman Cassidy wait a second you okay as a person to go ahead and do accept a non collaborated charge to destroy somebody's life\nIf you destroy your wife your son's life or your husband's wait a second answer that question if it was your husband your son your father whose life has been destroyed by uncorroborated would you like that protester I Would support a full FBI investigation when dealing with appropriate robots I'm Glad Cassidy pushback that it's a lost cause on the protester\nThe protester is not even hearing what he says she's got program dancers bought and paid for by George Soros\nAnd she hears key words in what he says knee jerk reaction causing things replies accordingly\nCast that you know no would you like and on cooperated charged destroy I wouldn't marry somebody that was a drunk so the protester\nHold on wait a minute uncorroborated answer the question I don't think you're able to because you know it's unfair protester I Would stand up Cassidy you know it's unfair protests I Would fight and I would make sure women heard clearly you're okay for rapist goes on the Supreme Court castle you know I'm not\nBut then on the other hand clearly you're okay the absence of evidence obviously means nothing view protests there is evidence looking at a standard how many people are in jail for laughs\n[noise] so what this ... unless somebody like me gets hold of a transcript something like this and help people understand if it's a total waste of time to engage these protesters especially if you're trying to persuade them you can't persuade them I just like you can't persuade the media\n[noise] you know I'm I've told the story when I was first at this\nVery young wet behind the ears naive and the media wouldn't want to talk I thought just because they're really interested I didn't know nobody's ever heard of me a radio shows taking off I thought they were legitimately curious and that's how I went into early interviews I found out that's not an all they weren't curious about anything they were simply there to discredit me\nMake fun of me to raise doubts it took me\nLonger than I Want to admit to figure this out you cannot persuade these people you can't change their minds and debate it's why I say the only option is to defeat them politically and that's happened\nThat

Rachel Mitchell ask her some questions which now turned out to be brilliant but at the time\nWe were all kind of curious what what's the purpose was a all Trump this is reminding everybody what she said she doesn't know she doesn't know the people she says we're there say they weren't there\nThis is not mocking her and this is a sign of what really is wrong in this country and accuser comes forward and you can poke holes in\nObvious places you can't point out obvious discrepancies you cannot reference or make mention\nOf the differences in her story from depending on the day she's telling it\nWhatever it is it is it is not mocking Christine balls the Ford now\nTrump has a lot of people saying well this is crazy rush because last week Trump was saying that she was credible entered testimony was compelling\nI have explained this before and I'm going to explain it again Trump all ways eventually will tell you what he really thinks about anything and he may not do that out of the batter's box\nI have a name for this I call it pacing Trump\nWasn't necessarily go out with a general opinion like on gun control after a shooting or the dreamers are in this case Dr ... for your caller credible testimony compelling and he'll even go so far to say that yeah if if she's telling the truth yeah they're my nomination might be in trouble yeah I'll agree with that\nThat gives him credibility it makes people kind of cock their head and they don't think Trump can be that's fair I'm Talking about the meeting on the left Democrats they don't think Trump can be that that's a reasonable\nBut he does it to them every time it gives them the credibility even later to be\nCritical and to step away he said yeah I found a credible I've found her compelling then as we learn more and then as events play out Trump is able\nTo parlay his original statements into what he really thinks based on\nWhat is not a knee jerk reaction if Trump were to happen ... initially when he said last night at the rally\nWhy there would have been held up pay but now he can back it up now there's all kinds of evidence that her timeline doesn't make any sense we've got an ex boyfriend claiming she is a polygraph expert and has taught people how to beat them\nWe have people challenging her account we didn't have that last week it is perfectly fine for Trump to do what he did\nIt gives him a credibility later to be critical step away it's a common technique you use as he does it on everything\nIt's why I've always told you don't take his first draft statement or his first tweet as a sign that he's caving or flipping you people you I'm sure you remember there haven't been many instances in fact I may have fallen for one myself that's how I learned\nThat Trump will tweet something or say something it'll make you look like he's about late ... before he pulled out of um the Paris climate accord\nWhat did he say\nClimate change her serious thing and we have to look at it than we are looking at it than moving to the right\nTo oh he's on record as being open about then later on when he's learned when he needs to learn comes out tells you what he thinks really thinks\nIt's a pattern it's a technique it paid trumped developed I don't even know if he developed or it's just how he does it naturally and instinctively\nBut I call it pacing now Republicans have not built up this reputation Senate Republicans having Trump has Trump has a ...\nThat after he makes it an initial statement on somebody and he can make fun\nOf things and what really irritates ... he gets away with it I cannot tell you how it irritates them to he shouldn't have survived the Access Hollywood video he shouldn't have survived anything they've thrown at him the fact that he has ... continue to prosper in triumph I cannot tell you how the lions Lee insane\nIt has made them with rage\nOther Republicans have not developed the golden adds to do this\nAnd pull it off\nTrump hasn't been attacked so much we're now if you go back to two thousand Fifteen when this campaign started this is two thousand eight this was three years\n\nIn fact it's it's it's three years in three months Trump gets in in June of two thousand Fifteen Trump has been attacked so much he doesn't care anymore\nIt doesn't bother him anymore is my point he's not willing to take the arrows he's willing to take the hits for everybody else that's why he is needed folks he is willing to do what he did last night I Know Murkowski\nAnd Collins or shorter ringing cowering in the corner with the vapors\nOh my God it was horrible with one horrible everything he said is true\nIt was not mocking her the actress\nVideo audio we played mocked both before Trump didn't\nHe just said we probably she she can't backup she cannot corroborate there isn't any cooperation from what she said why is that not relevant why does that not matter\nWhy have we gotten to a point where any woman can come forward and accusing any man of anything and it's gospel\nAnd then be joined by a so called movement called me to wear all women can joined the can you imagine if there was something going on they can you imagine of men organized

them to the gym and guarantee\nQuote from a National Review um the more time I spent covering politics the more I'm convinced that a significant chunk a grass roots political activists are not really arguing about politics at all\nThese people are actually struggling with personal psychological issues and projecting them\nUnder the world of politics bingo I've been searching for that description for years I have no problem admitting that I was unable to put this together as one of the rare moments I was unable to this is exactly right\nWe're dealing with people who have suffered some kinds of psychological disorder they've turned to politics\nFor the solution or the river bed is actually what they're looking for and they don't just want revenge against who ever did whatever to them they are now demanding that every representative of the group that or the individual that did something can\nBe made to pay a price for it that's what the ... this this um ... well\nThe me too movement in large part was never bipartisan it was thought to be said to be but it never was\nA and even if it if you okay even if it was it's been co opted by the Democratic party look at look at the uh [noise] Occupy Wall street move but look at black lives matter I take take any left wing group that you want it's made up of people\nWho for some reason I think they have been unjustly mistreated by somebody and instead of dealing with that in their lives they enter politics and they demand that the Democratic party take up the cause of the Democratic party willingly has the Democratic party has become the party\nOf all of these disparate constituency groups\nWith their singular causes because the Democrat Party realizes that they can combine all of these things into a singular assault on the concept of America that America is responsible for what happened to these people\nThey capitalism is responsible that the power structure that the founding is responsible\nAnd so people with psychological disorders are being granted the status of normalcy\nAnd then the big donors come along and underwrite them and fund their efforts and they become political movements\nAnd then they become victims and that of course allows them to blame everybody for what has gone wrong in their lives and then they demand reciprocity or revenge or what have you and I can tendency given that most people in our side have no idea how to\nDeal with this no idea whatsoever so we ended up and debate about whether\nBoys want to pretend to be girls so they can go on the girls' bathrooms and becomes legitimate I'd say it ... it in in many nuts\nA Pacific way but just the whole concept of what is happening here and it is a violent bullying intimidating\nMovement that has been constructed to push all of these disparate various agendas\nAnd the target is America the target is America is founded the target is American Capitalism and so when our caller says that Kavanaugh is simply a stand in for men who have abused every woman out there he's right\nBalls the Ford will end up being supported by other women who've been abused whether she's telling the truth or not it doesn't matter\nBecause it did happen to them these women we do know that are out there watching this did happen to them and by God somebody's going to pay for it in this case I mean capital that's how they're going to be heard\nRather than just deal with the specific incident that happened to them it's the same thing I think with black lives matter or the NFL players kneeling for the anthem a all cops are bad every white cop is rape every black convict is in is\nIn every instance here points to the country as large as being responsible in unfairness in bias and discrimination in racism all of this the\nDemocratic Party is the organizing party the collection agency for all of these complaints\nDemocrat parties happy to make victims out of anybody who wants to be one and Democrat Party is happy to promise these people that they'll fix it and they never do they never the range of me angered never ends if only gets worse because the Democrats don't fix anything and finally\nIt doesn't even depend on\nBeing fixed it just means somebody's got to pay in this case capital he's got to pay\nWhether he did it or not\nNow Sarah Sanders White House press briefing is going on she just lay the end of the press and she said exactly what I said if I don't mind saying so she said Trump didn't mock anybody last night he simply recites\nDid the facts\nAnd he said all of this can be laid at the feet of the Democrats they are to blame for this none of this needed to have happened in public they had ... forge email or in a letter ... way back in July they could have done everything that's been done to investigate her claim\nOff record behind the scenes nobody knowing about it but they didn't do that they waited to use it as a Hail Mary\nShe dispute the idea that Trump mocks she said all he was doing was reciting the facts here it is again this is what the press the media everybody is out now ripping Trump claiming that he mocked Christine walls before\nAnd here it is that there's this they've been even the Connecticut Senator who himself has been a target up attacks from Trump the target of attacks from the guy was flat out why or what do you mean the target\nOf attacks from Trump trumped an attack anybody told everybody who the guy is\nAnd here is Sarah Sanders from the press briefing just now exactly as I said she got a question from John Roberts and it was all about do\nYou think that maybe the president should have done it marking her like that because it gets Collins and Murkowski ended me in the way they vote horrible you'd think the president for maybe should have not done it\nThe president was gaining the facts and frankly facts that were included in special prosecutor Rachel Mitchell's report he was fading facts that were given during Dr Ford's testimony innocent it has to make a decision based on those facts\nAnd whether or not they see judge Kavanaugh to be qualified to hold the position on the Supreme Court every single word judge Kavanaugh has said it's been picked apart every single word second by second of his testimony has been picked apart yet if anybody says anything about\nThe accusations that have been thrown against them that's totally off limits an outrageous\nExactly right young cat challenge her so Trump did for everybody else who doesn't have to go ... to do it Trump did it in yeah he's providing a little shade for some of these people hide under\n[noise] and I'll guarantee you they may be publicly saying I Wish he hadn't done it that's outrageous what prompted their thinking everybody did it privately\nSomebody has to say it it's the freaking truth\nOkay back to the phones and we go to Tom's river New Jersey ... is next and he is Fifteen Years old I'm ... I'm Glad you waited you're next on the program thank you for calling\nHey rushed great to speak to you again a right to have your back\nYeah it's great to be on again anyways so I'm watching this whole thing on me too movement watching the Kavanaugh hearings I'm I'm Fifteen I'm just regular straight guy\nThat's into a normal but I think that I really cannot believe any of these women that pop up on TV anymore you can't believe any of them or come an old guy raped me the guy did this to me did that to me you know he had to draw on CNN or a couple of months ago saying that a guy raped or because he asked her for her phone number [noise]\nCan't believe any of them and I think that what this this whole me\nTo get away ... ... ... ... that that is my exact point I Believe that woman I Believe she thinks she was raped when somebody asked her for her number that's how she's been conditioned\nWomen's studies on campus the the outright hatred for men you know I keep talking about it but it's relevant Catherine Ken and this was back in the nineties\nShe was a professor of women's studies at Michigan She taught women in her class the all sex is rape even the sex of marriage and the women were lapping up and women have been taught for two generations now that men are basically predators and that their own kids are not safe from their fathers\nAnd it's not random it's widespread it is part and parcel of higher education today so you have a woman and she could be acting I mean she could be making this up could be a political activist but it's entirely possible at the same time out from that the cause of what she's been\nTaught and heard on the news and talking to her she may literally believe that memory I have no right to ask for her phone number is the same thing as bullying her raping her\nThat's my point she may really believe that\nIt goes well rush of you know the same woman that are screaming about how they've been raped or off the ones who want to have the right to having abortions it so they could have unlimited sex\nOr have you\nUm [noise] um you're right sex without consequences but you better\nNot but then they claimed that all men are predators but then they run to run hook up and then they want to have abortions for free when it's there I\nThen everything's fine if not better I by the way here's an it does ... you're also random it's not all women but it's been made to look like that isn't it\nThe me too movement supposedly includes women women on across America who do not think this way are being lumped into this movement\nAgainst their will\nIt's just an assumption that the Democrats and the drive by media or making I think I Am from your young you're growing up I think you're going to be OK finding a woman but you got to be real careful about it just get written permission for every move you might get it notarized after that date\n[laughter] and you're listening to Rush Limbaugh ... voice on the rise Tom but by the MIT for\nThe backyard looking great Rob thanks man I was planning on adding a deck to no one could contractors why don't you just ask home advisor home what\nHome advisor dot com you just tell them about your project and they match you with local pros that can do the job nice but how much does it cost ... home advisors totally free to use plus you can reach customer reviews check pricing and book appointments for free\nWhat's the website again home advisor dot com or just download the free home advisor ...\nDoes your dog H scratch danker shed like crazy come to die to fight for help order Ninety Days supply of dynamite pick up two bottles of liquor jobs get the third bottle free new improved liquor chops with the mega six omega three vitamin E. and now six extra directed microbial even better for the digestive tract and immune system\nAnd dogs love it try liquid shops by to get one free this is Henry look authentic for died by an hour I Can't [laughter]\n\nCan't fill me with Gulf Coast windows or window of opportunity sailors on now call by October thirty first received one hundred dollars off each window and pay no interest for six years called Gulf Coast window suddenly won three eight or nine fifty four fifty for for Gulf Coast windows dot com\nDaniel dean land clearing and dirt work can do your project at your ranch at your home whatever you need done erosion control retention positive tension ... storm drainage keep the water flowing off your land they'll help you choose the right plan for you\nBecause ... where we live in a region that gets a lot of rain gotta deal with Daniel ... artwork to eight one three five six dirt to eight one three five six dark\n... more than a piece of land in some place where you create memories ...

B. I. D. O. J. people that were doing this\nAnd I think the objective of Christine balls before this whole thing not her specific maybe I'd look I think she's an activist and then on it but that's neither here to there the objective of this was to get Kavanaugh to withdraw his nomination or to have Trump pull it\nNow that that hasn't happened this case is beginning to collapse you see stories all over the media about how all this so called evidence just isn't fair\nThey thought that the mere allegation\nThat that Kevin I Would not sit there and let his life to be destroyed like this they fought Trump wouldn't sit there and let his nominee need be destroyed like that because they think Trump's ego was such that he will not be allowed to be made to look bad because of what somebody else did or didn't do so they thought there would be a giant cave on this and there hasn't been\nSo now it is panic and scramble time\nSo the zero in on flake\nAnd Trump couldn't hold it in any more last night at the rally he just on ... on the fact that Christie and Ford doesn't have any evidence is changing her story\nAnd the media is all over the place now saying well you know there's just many screwed it they were ... ski and Collins they both think that Trump was horrible and they both now might not vote for Kavanaugh\nOkay well ladies and gentleman I told you some things yesterday but I'm sure people have forgotten but there are no different today than they were yesterday [noise]\nDemocrats senators in red states are in heat big reelection trouble in fact there was news yesterday polling data late polling that we may be looking at a red wave and the Senate none of blue wave\nIn North Dakota which Trump carried by thirty six points Heidi Heitkamp is in deep doo doo after having come out against cabin on the latest poll taken after the\nDemocrats began smearing Kavanaugh but before the committee fiasco last week showed that Kevin Cramer to Republican opponent to hike camp has opened a ten point lead\nOver I Am\nJoe Donnelly in Indiana is similarly nervous Claire McCaskill in Missouri is losing their her challenger Josh\nHawley Joe Manchin of West Virginia they've all been hoping that McConnell when wimp out\nOr that some Republican senators wouldn't wimp out and not vote for Kavanaugh so that they would be off the hook and not have to know the words these free Heitkamp Donnelly my cat what's actually for Donnelly McCaskill mansion and Heitkamp have all been hoping\nThat Collins caves that maybe even McConnell would cave and the Murkowski when cave and that flake will continue to flake and cave\n\nBut in their states there's held a pay in their states people want Kavanaugh confirmed in fact in North Dakota voters back Kavanaugh's sixty to twenty seven\nPolling has been gun heading the wrong way for Heidi Heitkamp so my point is it may not it may not matters or matter what happens to Collins and Murkowski\nBut if they if they actually don't vote for Kavanaugh simply based on what Trump said last night\n\nWell that would be embarrassing for them [noise] [noise] now\nSince Trump's on the record as questioning the veracity of Dr Ford I Want to share something with you I found today a power line Scott Johnson one of the contributors in power line right that a reader of theirs\nNoted the changes in the timeline that Dr Ford herself presented the power line reader refers to himself calls himself an engineer with a specialty in data visualization\nAnd he made a graphic it created a chart in essence\nBased on public sources based on the Washington Post and other legal documents and it is the dates the varying dates the different dates of the sordid event Dr ... says happened\nAnd the dates float she's not even consistent with the ... so the timeline of her story doesn't even add up\n\nThe reader notes the sudden story change correlating with the time progression in the story date column I'll get to this and just a second his question of why this sudden change\nWithin a few weeks after July sixth of two thousand Eighteen the answer is that's when Dr Ford came into the Democrat or bits of Anna Eshoo democratic California and Feinstein and their staffs\nAnd the highly partisan Democrat lawyer Deborah cats recommended by Feinstein right after that foreign changed her story two more times in two months\nShe grew more specific after she began consulting with Democrat activists\nAs they conspired to destroy Kavanaugh\nSalt\nThe charge here and try not to try and served a difficult to convey but this is a text charge there is some ah some bars in this thing but it isn't title Dr Christina ... ever changing story multiple inconsistent stories of the date of the alleged incidents\nIn the therapists notes the incident is said to have a current and the men the Nineteen eighties the when she was in couples therapy\nThe therapist notes from when she was an individual therapy say that the story occurred not in the mid eighties but the late eighties\nIn her text messages to the Washington Post she's back to saying that it happened in the mid eighties\nIn her letter to Dianne Feinstein she said the incident happened\nIn the early eighties\nIn the hand written statement at the time she took her polygraph high schools summer in the eighties and early is crossed out\n\nEarly eighties could have been eighty eighty one\nIf the Senate Judiciary committee hearings she said it happened in the summer I'm Nineteen eighty two she had never said that\nBefore she had said mid eighties late eighties mid eighties\nEarly eighties highschool summer early eighties she specified summer Nineteen eighty to these changes occur as she is in consultation with all these Democrat activists the staff of Feinstein and an Anna Eshoo and Deborah cats the the lawyer\n\nAnd hurt changing story leaves her short on credibility put aside her emotional performance\n\nHer testimony reveals her as a witness was memories change at her convenience\n\nThe problem for Dr Ford is not that she doesn't remember everything if the everything she remembers changes that her convenience first Ford's testimony the assault
