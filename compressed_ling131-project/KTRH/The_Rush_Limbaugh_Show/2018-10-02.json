grand in Iran's banks get two hundred two hundred [noise]\nOh my God no Harry the polls are tightening my God no well what what does that tell you what what [noise]\nWhat what what's going on\nHere we are so many races that are within the margin of error Missouri Nevada Tennessee part on the list goes on and on and on we have all of these close races which means we have a better estimate about what might happen in the Senate come November\nBut it really could be a democratic wave or could be a Republican wave at the polls are often wonder how can wave in the Senate and the house and the ... not in the house\nRepublican away in the Senate all know that means no impeachment of Trump\nThat means that impeachment of the Democrats get the house and don't think so but if they do it ... it would die in the Senate unless there's a bunch of Jeff Flake clones in there because they would never vote to ah to convict if the Republicans hold the Senate or even swelled the ranks\nSo the panicked host Jim shoot I couldn't believe when he heard their blue wave red wave in the Senate\nShe says there was discussion of a blue wave been generic battled advantage for Democrats do you notice it tightening their as we get closer to the election\nI Will say the generic ballot does seem to be tightening a little bit which is good news for Republicans but you know there's a lot of talk oh with Brett Kavanaugh on this whole confirmation math that in fact that might hurt Republican but it doesn't actually seem to be so far we're actually seeing some tightening in the Senate races and one that we're seeing tightening of the house races\nI'm going to let your little sigh and observation about this but what did I tell ya he's generic ballots way back last December that's when they first started harping on\nThis and back then you know nine months ago the\nDemocrats had a twelve point advantage and that's when all the talk of a blue wave began and that's when all the talk of the Democrats winning back Congress began and it went all through the year Democrat advantage in the generic ballot was twelve five seven and the Republicans pulled even in a couple of them are Democrats once again broke away\nAnd all during it I your host of been doing this a long time and it doesn't matter\nIt doesn't mean anything\nLet me remind you of a motivation technique utilized by the coach of the New England patriots won bill that will check\nPrior to one of the super bowl the patriots were empty might do it frequently I but I Know one time\nHe gathered the players for a team meeting and so we're gonna have and will fund we're going to watch horse race he had videotape of a horse race that nobody had seen it was not a big race they don't allow the players to make friends leave that send away Andrews on who was going to win\nSo the players made their bets and Donald ... starts to tape of the race and stops at at the first term it's OK layer about somebody who's gonna win players go nuts making their choices\nTape resumes that much ... stops at at the halfway point anybody want to change their bed anybody want to double down players go into gear making their beds\nHalf the final turn ... stops the tape of the horse race again asks the players if they want to make an additional beds or get out of ones they've made\nPlayers do what they do that much jak resumes taped to the finish line makes the point it didn't matter at any point in this race when I stopped the tape\nThere is no way anybody could have known as the first term at the halfway point or at the final turn who is going to win yet look what you were doing you were making beds you bring guessing somebody you're probably were certain bottom line is\nFinish you never know before it's over who's going to win no matter what any kind of expert tells you\nIt was a motivational technique designed to get the players to realize first quarter half time third quarter finish doing your job\nSame thing here posing January in front of ... election doesn't mean anything polls in June July don't mean anything\nThey're interesting for the media which is trying to shape public opinion with these polls but at the polls do not give any indication the final outcome appalled in July or August would not contained any of the Kavanaugh\nNews so how relevant could've been answered none ... zero NATO\nAnd so now here we are on October second CNN is panicking\nRacist or typing in the house this wasn't supposed to happen why they had all their pre election polls they had the generic ballot they've had this in in in the in the can that's been in the bank since last December in their minds it's been over it's just a matter of letting the calendar play out\nNow all of a sudden house races are tightening and there could be a blue wave in the Senate\nBut wave red wave and the Republicans could come out of nowhere at about final current and take over\nWell\nWe don't know if the Republicans were ever really far behind we don't want anything because there wasn't a vote back in December or January or July or August we don't know anything\n\nAnd we don't know anything now and we won't know until the day after\nElection day or maybe later that night [noise] now one of the brief observation here once again do you notice Mr engines knock it in there\n\nI think you know there's a lot of talk Brett Kavanaugh this whole confirmation mess that in fact might hurt Republicans it doesn't seem to be so\nLadies and gentlemen high and the reason he saying this and everybody else because of my viral prediction of last week that if Republicans don't confirm Kavanaugh as the Democrats are going to win everything that production\nOf mine went by blood drive by is loved it they love it when the leader of the G O P in their minds me starts ripping the Republicans when I start predicting on Louis that's when I become totally credible that's when they run the sound bites me protecting all over the world\n\nYou notice how easy it would be to trick them they run with that and they right now all of a sudden it's just the exact opposite\nHe's just the exact opposite why all this attention on Kevin on what the Republican is actually going to help on how can that they live on just said they were going to lose\nThey are totally totally confused\nAnd as I said yesterday what what what is the sense in saying that we have to lose in order to win you know people that will lead Kevin I'll go down that really find them up at a fire buddy up no the way you get on the bandwagon the way you get people on the bandwagon the way you get people wanting to be on your team is when\nIncluding winning the capital nomination now let's go to further news at ... some of this from the hill dot com ran

gone\nFar I'm telling you foreign policy wonks is not getting any coverage is Kevin O's morphing everything but I'm here to tell you that all these invisible swamp dwellers who live and die\nBy such things as NAFTA are beside themselves that Trump that this done [noise] it is a huge middle finger to them\n\nNot to build burden is just pray Limbaugh Albany show talking about training on Kevin Kevin O's not inspiring anybody how can anybody listen this program and things that are\nCreating NAFTA took these people years Trump guts it\nHe replaces it in months and do an insult to injury that Mexicans and the Canadians want to be part of it they ask to be part of it their noses or not out of joint they're not crying and moaning about the loss of NAFTA they want in on this new Trump deal and that is also\nProfoundly insulting to the swamp dwellers they can't see straight this is just more hatred for Trump this is just it's blinding them\nAnd now\nThere's a companion story didn't have a chance to get through it yesterday the child comes\nAre getting ready to lower their trade barriers on us exports because of Trump's tariffs it's all we're getting\nThis is something these guys never even tried to do\nTo straighten out the trade imbalance with the ... the swamps rollers never even tried to do that that was just\nAnother circumstance we had to accept in the modern world and watch what's gonna happen next I'll tell you right here and now Iran is going to come to the table you watch when that happens\nThis is all falling into place for Trump exactly as he said exactly as he is making happen\n\nI don't know how many of you do wire transfers but there is a form of wire transfer called swift and if you're goes ahead and puts on a replacement for swift Trump is liable to freeze the Iranians out of using it meaning it may have trouble moving their money around\n[noise] that's why I brought it up because it is such a huge deal in\nSo many ways it's a huge deal in turning the swamp upside down on the inside out and it is a huge deal for Trump making America great again putting America First and following through on a deeply deeply\nCommitted in highly touted campaign promise trade deals were among Trump's top three\nCampaign issues\nIt's not an accident that Ninety thousand people tried to get into the trumpet Johnson City Tennessee Johnson City Tennessee after the NAFTA deal is done ... ... ... ... that the people in Washington the drive by media are totally missing this it's not sexy told them it ... it's not a big deal NAFTA trade deal yeah screw Trump for doing it but\nThey they don't have any ability to see its connection\nAnd its relevance and its importance in Trump's supporters remaining ramped up\nAnd loyal and then there's this\nOne more song by featuring your host CNN this happened and just before the conclusion of the previous hour I said ten minutes to one CNN aired this\nThere are some Republicans have have it all went down if he was defeated organs for through with raw that that would just jammed up Republican turnout because the quarter is there a holy grail and they would come rushing out his Rush Limbaugh saying don't bet on it\nIt's very easy to sit here to say in the midst of all the Democrat trickery that it's going to fire people up on the Republican side to going to be some ticked off in Seoul man are going to show up and vote like they never voted before\nBut his that's going to be the attitude if he's not sworn in because if that happens take that moment where Kavanaugh is not sworn in meaning he is not confirmed in the Senate you think it's going to be easy for the Republicans who say\nYou see what happened to Kevin all were in the majority that we couldn't get him confirmed you need to come out in ...\nHow does that work how does that work pretty good point I Do think that that's an important point that if Kavanaugh goes down it will be because moderate Republicans decided not to vote for him and that could depressed turn out in some ways that could lead to a number of people saying what's the point\nThe point I was making is and I I've been hearing this from a lot of people that have capital goes down it's just going to fire up troops because Republicans are saying and trying to make it happen and if if it goes up here\nI didn't\nUnderstand the thinking but it just flies in the face of human nature and beyond that why do we have to use\nIn order to win I never understood that why do we have\nTo lose Kavanaugh in order to gin up turn out I I [noise] ... depending on how it would happen I'm not sure when Jenna turnout anyway you got the majority party saying they couldn't get their nominee confirmed and they go to the voters say we're not majority we tried we tried but we couldn't get him confirmed you need to vote for us and you need to give us more Republicans in the\n... and there's a disconnect there [noise] anybody\nEver heard the name Chris theme watcher

Rush Limbaugh executing assign has donated last night as is the case [noise]\nEach and every busy broadcast day [noise]\nFor those of you watching on the\nDental cam I Want to show you something for those of you will not watching on the digital camera going to post what I'm going to show there's no camera at Rush Limbaugh dot com you'll be able to see it there\nAre but first before I assure you that there's two cartoons I Want to show you Scott grabbed the cartoon of the firemen carrying the baby and put it into sweater let's let's use that one first go ahead and take that live\nUp this cartoon ladies and gentleman was drawn shortly after the Oklahoma City bombing\nAfter President Clinton a set of angry voices on the right speaking out against ... there was only one voice on the right in Nineteen Ninety two I was at least on local talk shows but\nCNN's the only cable out there is no Fox knows there's no blogosphere theres no new alternative media uh aren't really conservative websites start everything's starting to ... to to block it at that point but but this program nationally was still at four years after our founding\nAnd Clinton have blamed angry voices on the right for Timothy McVeigh blowing up the uh building in Oklahoma City federal building and of course uh I I\nWas living there was not going to accept that would challenge the White House automation a correction claiming oh we were talking about the Michigan Militia shortwave radio\n[noise]\nMichigan Militia short wave radio Timothy McVeigh was listening to the Michigan Militia shortwave radio isn't that by the way there's more evidence of of why you should have no doubt I Know what I'm Talking about here I haven't been subjected to this\nLiberal machine and the way it operates a number of times I Know them I Know I Know how they lie and make things up and strategize\nI Know their their techniques their strategies and everything better than they do so a cartoonist by the name of Chris Brecht was his name drew up a cartoon of a fireman carrying a dead\nBaby there was actually a cover of time magazine this picture of a fireman carrying a dead baby from the rubble was a cover on time magazine artist than his cartoonish\nInterpretation of it and the fireman is thinking as he is carrying the dead baby damn right wing radio\nOr one of the local hosts at the time John Carlson on the radio in Seattle got hold of that fireman had him on the air wanted to know if that's what he was thinking as he was performing rescue duties\nAt the Oklahoma City bombing the fireman said no no no no we all love Rush Limbaugh we listen to Rush Limbaugh in the firehouse\nWell\nThat cartoonist is back\nRemember during the hearings Brett Kavanaugh said that his ten year old daughter was praying suggested the family pray for the woman meaning Dr Ford and judge Kevin I'm starting to break down and tear up at that point talking about the wisdom of his ten year old daughter same cartoonist is back\nSome public and the Illinois southern Illinois journal or some such thing but the cartoons now gone viral all over the Web but of course on Twitter and parts of Facebook they love it switched that show this to the people watching other digital camera this is the cartoon\nIt has Kevin ... daughter praying at her bedside the description the upper left hand corner Kevin O's daughter says another prayer\nAnd in the speech bubble in the cartoon Kevin ... daughter says dear God forgive my angry lying alcoholic father for sexually assaulting Dr Ford\nNow as I say if you're not watching the program on the digital camera which you can do as a member at Rush Limbaugh dot com will have the cartoon eventually at Rush Limbaugh dot camera and you don't have to remember you'll be able to see if I'm not doing this was like come on for membership I'm I'm just we have the ability to show these things rather than to describe them\nSame cartoonist Nineteen Ninety two two today it's just vital\nIt's filthy if dirty and disgusting it's despicable and sick and of course has accomplished it's subjective it's gone viral and people have seen that people are reacting to it\nAnd I weighed whether or not to give it the attention that anything talked about by me ultimately gets and I decided to go ahead and do it\n\nIn my never ending quest to have people understand who liberals are how thick and given men did did\nThey are\nThis is what passes for humor on the left this is what passes for comedy this is the kind of stuff that makes them laugh Kevin ... says another prayer dear God forgive my\nAngry lying alcoholic father for sexually assaulting Dr Ford\n[noise] not a single element of that speech bubble has been established as anywhere near true [noise]\nAnd it's just it flies in the face of decency you know you run out of descriptive adjectives\nWhen trying to describe this kind of thing that's why I have settled on the fact that we're really dealing with a bunch of people who at some point in their lives of suffered psychological and some of the events that have led the psychological disorders and they found themselves now as the mainstream of the Democratic party\nThese rallies will be urging Trump to drop Kevin offering a second the party and the second term presidents that was the exact\nOpposite so don't tell me on this on to what these people in the media you have so much invested in their power\nIn their self esteem related to their power that when they see evidence that people are ignoring what they say it hurt some to the quick\nIt disturbs them any time you can demonstrate to them that what they're trying to make you think isn't working you will succeed in upset at them and you might even get lucky enough to hear him talk about as high just did\nOn CNN NBC News desperately\nTrying to convict Kavanaugh at the same time they've been trying to convince Trump colluding with Russia NBC News this had to admit that they are unable to independently corroborate the claims of Julie sweat\n\nOn able to independently corroborate what makes claims and has not spoken with anybody who says they saw sweating Nick at parties with capital they can't find anybody can place or there\nBut she says she was at ten parties where Kevin on his buddies running rape trains gang rape trains they can't find anybody who saw what sweat make was a college student when Kevin on his buddies were high school students everybody's asking what's a college student female hanging around with a high school a party for and\nWhy keep going back to the gang rapes if that's what's happening these parties your lawyers center that\nHer lawyer said that she was doing research\nYeah Julie sweat and they kept going to these gang rape parties\nTo gather evidence to do research but NBC and believe me they're looking at NBC can't find anybody\nWho says they saw sweat Nick at parties with capital Kavanaugh has said he doesn't know sweat Nick and his call her claims a farce\nEx boyfriend\nSays what next threatened to kill his unborn baby was exaggerating everything look Julie swipe Nick is incredible just like Christine foreigners incredible I mean to insult anybody urban\nBeen through a thousand times for nobody she says was there says they were she doesn't know where when she doesn't know what she said afterwards or how she got home she doesn't know anything other than to have it all there is no credibility in either to sweat like sweating\nIsn't credible Ford is a leader Feinstein is not credible the Democratic party is not credible the media is not credible\nThere is no credibility on the allegations side of this entire Kavanaugh story\n\nLast night uh Laura Ingraham show on Fox News\nJulie is what next ex boyfriend or Richard ... Venice see details why they heard Kavanaugh accuser is unreliable ministry says that swept Nick never mentioned having been sexually assaulted by him\nThe ex boyfriend who Julie sweat Nick at third woman to make uncorroborated lure read the allegations against Kavanaugh told Fox News is that she had threatened to kill his unborn child and at times even bizarrely ask him to hit her\nRight after I broke up whether she basically called me many times and at one point she basically said you will never ever see your unborn child alive\nRichard fantasy ex boyfriend said that last night on the ... ankle according to Venice the sweat and they told him at the time I'm just going to go over there and kill you guys\nSo I think as represented by Michael ... who didn't immediately respond to the Fox news requests for comment but in an interview on CNN Monday Night he casts doubt on the boyfriends credibility and characterize them as an a strange ... ex\nBoyfriend\nNBC again we can't corroborate any of the claims made by Julie sweating it can also her claims have now shifted\nSweat ... said she saw boys congregating outside rooms but vote I didn't know what was it\nWait a minute you started out saying that we're getting wage going on right now she says I don't know\nAnd she says that she never saw a capital in the room but he was outside she shore and that's not a\nHuman ... showing that\nI Love the gym you sell sunspot correct or its might go to product every day I have sun spots and age but I think you'd see a definite difference in my skin since using it that's according to Renee from Boulder, Colorado raving about the brand new junior cell sunspot correct or watch sunspots eight spots even read inflamed patches banished right before your very eyes\nAnd like Rene quicker call right now and you'll get the junior cell sunspot correct or absolutely free Jasper trying genius fell for bags and puffing is watch stubborn sunspot Spanish now before you get busy for the holidays and bags and puffing is gone and for results in less than twelve hours the junior cell immediate effects is also yours free\nGo to a genius L. dot com now or called eight hundred eight to five nine four one eight hundred a two to five nine four one order this week and receive Germany's luxury micro Durham abrasion also free\nRejuvenated uncalled pours were instantly radiant baby soft skin order now in shipping is also free\nEight hundred eight to five nine for one or go to Jim you sell dot com that's genius L. dot com\nGenius L. dot com\nYou're going to be with Gulf Coast windows because you're so those bait and switch tactics take advantage of her off or if you call by over thirty first you'll receive one hundred dollars off each window and pay no interest for six years Gulf Coast window second when three eight or nine fifty four fifty for\nIf you dial eight four four seven hundred land until the folks at Texas grand ranch dot com that you're on your way out and you want to check out the new state park acreage home sites there at Texas grand ranch you're going to love them\nA limited release a one to two acre home size from only fifty nine with over two thousand acres protected state park land right there in your backyard Texas grand ranch dot com eight four four seven hundred land\n... more than a piece of land in ... in some place where you ... memories ... leave a legacy sounds like a dream capital farm credit will help you make the most experienced rural member in Texas and cooperative\nRoom with you every step of the way your goals are because no matter what your dreams my we're all in this together together we're better find out why it capital farm credit dot com equal housing lender and and my last four nine three eight to eight\nPlateau land in wildlife is hosting a landowner kid wildlife happy hour Wednesday at the arboretum called eight six six to one nine twenty five sixteen or go to plateau wildlife dot com to learn more\nIf we can take the high caliber got tiring target shooter collected or if there's something for everyone has a high caliber gotten to see if we can if it isn't as high caliber guys show guy handle on here it's all at a high caliber guy an interest in this week the their [noise]\nJimmy ...

your lawyer which this last minute claim out there\n\n[noise] I I Can't use the NBC is starting to get deflated all ready or they think they've got the gold mine of interviews they've got to get\nOf gets they've got Julie sweating Nick\nProblem is her lawyer didn't properly vet her because of the lawyer didn't think with the media it'd be necessary media would accept what every tells them because the media wants to get Kavanaugh to\n\nNBC I don't I don't know if they're really vetting her or just trying to get confirmation here to add to what they want to do\nSo case no then says did you see Brett Kavanaugh spiking the punch that you'll see him putting grain alcoholic in the Bronx\nI saw him given red solo cups to quite a few girls during that time frame and there was green punch it those parties and I would not take one of those classes\nAre half ... half blocks I saw him around the punch a painter is I don't know what he did but I saw him by them yeah\nWell now what [laughter] excuse me what's happening\n[noise] first\nHe set up the gang rape trains he was responsible for drug gang and alcoholic going up but women now well no I Can't say here so and she apparently was assaulted in any which way you can imagine\nBut she can't name him and then then then when it comes [laughter] did you see him spike\nThe punch [laughter] [noise] the punch a\nRain out but what I saw it with a lot of red solo cups I wouldn't take a ... couple of bread Kevin on them and what you gave me\nSo now we've got the fear\nOf the ... how do we know it was a solo ... there's a lot of different manufacturers of cups clothing Playtex how do we know that it was a solo cups\nSolo is being subtly here that their cups are being used\nIn the abuse of women\nThen NBC admits they cannot locate two of her witnesses one says one of the witnesses she names as he never heard of her and the fourth witness that she named it is that\nWe haven't heard from us so last either people alive today I had I had a party so yeah there are people that now that both parties\nThis morning sweating it provided for names from she says went to the parties with her one of them said he does not recall a Julie sweating another of the friends she named is deceased we've reached out to the other two I haven't heard back [noise] [noise]\nIs the sound of air coming out of a balloon or\nAny other inflatable object next me go to sweat\nNext former boyfriend was on the Ingram angle last night on Fox News channel is is a Richard\nVennochi is the pronunciation the question\nYou claim that ms sweating it threatened you after you broke up with her what types of threats are you alleging out there\nRight after I broke up for her she basically call me many times on a woman points to basically say you will never ever\nIn your ... child alive and so I just going to go over there where they can you guys [noise]\nShe said she was going to kill you yes\nRight after she dealt with the unborn baby is going to do that first\nYou will never ever see your unborn child ... the Democrats really want to\nStand behind this\nIs this what they want to vouch for they're backing off this is again I don't mean to be redundant but Dianne Feinstein all of a sudden this after the bringing up the fact that we need to start looking again at his roe versus Wade decision women's reproductive health and is assault weapons or a thinking on why\nThat's been that long ago and you didn't have anything to oppose him there so you imagine how they feel about this\nThat mean they're fools to believe this was real in the first place but they're so damn desperate [noise] uh [noise] one let me I Need to go back I Need to find Sheldon Whitehouse is number nine Sheldon\nWhitehouse this guy's money this is a Democrat who on friday morning the morning of the vote held up one of the enlarged pages of Kavanaugh's Kevlar and said that he had figured out how to translate it and the date in ... he figured this could be the gate where the incident Dr foreign described happened\nAnd he sought to try to translate some of the nicknames and phrases that capital used on his calendar\nOf course in incriminating ways a toward capitalism so on good\nMorning America today George Stephanopoulos of the Clinton war room is talking to Sheldon Whitehouse is a demographic Rhode Island are you satisfied with the scope of the FBI inquiry can they finish this by friday\nI think I'm satisfied we don't know\nAll the details yet but clearly if they haven't been given a free rein to interview whomever they want so that's a very good sign the last thing we want as a sham investigation\nI also think that there is a fairly small universe of witnesses here at a very big FBI so yes I think they probably should be able to uh get the sun by friday if they really\nPut the effort into it now wait a minute [noise] that just makes too much sense that just doesn't fit\nWith Chuck Schumer today on the floor of the Senate who we have we have audio soundbite number eight this is Chuck you he went to the floor right after the turtle did\nAnd basically made the uh the case that\nWe're nowhere near ending this FBI investigation as the turtles that the Schumer and the Democrats are moving the goalposts\nWe are looking at what judge Kavanaugh says at age fifty three not what he did at age Eighteen\nWe're looking at his credibility now is grown adult and if you believe Dr Ford\nJudge Kavanaugh\nNBC News recorded that either judge Kavanaugh people close to the judge Moore in communication with his classmates to get them robot allegations by Deborah Ramirez it seems that judge Kavanaugh was at least very misleading to the Judiciary Committee about ... story\nSo now it's about capital lying\nIf I catalogue perjuring yourself and that means he's not qualified what they've got to make up their minds first he's a serial gang rape is now the throws ice on people at a bar Denise negative falling down drunk and now\nHe's a liar their flailing\nBut Sheldon Whitehouse totally out of character with his majority minority leader in the Senate Chuck Schumer yeah I think friday night yeah there's not too many people to talk through here FBI's got a lot of short or we can get this\nDone that's just to central maybe White Houses out their\nTruck in the spirit here to be the public face of a reasonable Democrat Party while everybody else stays insane\nBut they are moving the goalposts but and yes for\nA delay but they're also trying to move the goalposts as a target where they can catch Kevin in anything\nUh there's one more that I Want to play and I'm looking for it and I just found it I Want you to go to audio soundbite number twelve [noise] the question of who leak Dr Ford's letter to Dianne Feinstein\nYou don't just dozens of leaking this letter my memory and this is kind of fuzzy but I remember Feinstein during a press conference or either on the Florida ... judicial committee or I remember her showing the letter\nHolding it up or talking about it\nI remember I don't know if that was the week but she clearly talked about it and said that she'd had it since July and that\nShe told us all about it that whoever Senate didn't want to be named and didn't want to go forward and she didn't want to do with it she's holding the thing I don't know what I don't know what to do with us\nI was all part of a strategy salt\nLake yesterday afternoon on Shepard Smith reporting 'em ups Fox News channel trace Gallagher was sitting in for ... Smith\n\nAnd he had the legal affairs correspondent for National Public radio on their Nina Totenberg he said Mitch McConnell sudden friday he thinks the Democrats won't agree that we're limited scope and the FBI investigation\nNow today they're asking for twenty four witnesses to be interviewed what are your thoughts on that ...\nI remember when I broke the story I thought this was the closest kept secret and I managed to find out about it I found out there were probably a hundred people in Washington this secret and kept it for a very long time you and I\nAre not stupid people we may not be praying for I not stupid and once you get us on a case like that on lots of people are talking to each other one leads to another\nThis is the youth Radio's seven forty Katie R.

people classmates at Yale are\nClaiming that that capital has lied about his binge drinking but there\nAren't any witnesses that can show that in the wake of a\nKevin laws testimony before the committee last Thursday the media have doubled down on efforts to turn up evidence\nOf illicit behavior in the school and college because they're trying to bolster for they're trying to\nFind anything because Ford doesn't have anything you've been trying to find anything to save her story\nAnd they can't they can't find anybody that that can confirmed what these late arriving witnesses\nRamirez and
