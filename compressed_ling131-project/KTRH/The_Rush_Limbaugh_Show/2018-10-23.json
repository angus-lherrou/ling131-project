behind today and I think for the remainder of the time\nFor these\nNext two weeks and that is Trump's spreads lives and stokes beers a head of election I fought when I got in here and saw that\nOne time I figured it was just you know a graphic car ride and graphic to represent what they were doing at that time but every time I looked up at the TV over the next three hours I saw that that that better it didn't matter what else was being\nIt didn't matter who the guests were then I saw the Washington Post thing and so I check the New York times and there it is spreading fear\nTelling lies a hand of election this caravan thing you know I [laughter]\nI continue to study this and try to pick it apart to analyze it in and make sense of it from a political standpoint and I still can't find\nAnywhere in the media any concern about it\nI Can't find anybody concerned are worrying or thinking that it's anything abnormal about it\nIn fact what you find in the drive by media isn't tired total miss characterizations these are desperately poor people run into are full of people fleeing poverty in their homeland\nAnd that's not an all what they are they are part of an organized mob\nThere is no question about this is an organized mob and like everything else in the left is behind some point in the future we're going to learn exactly how this thing was pulled off we're going to learn who did it we're going to learn who paying for it we're going to learn who scripted it's\nJust like we've learned how they did the Kavanaugh thing with Dr balls the Ford how that was structured how that was planned how it was kept in reserve part is that nothing that appears spontaneous or organic\nWhere it benefits the left\nIs spontaneous or organic is all structured it's all planned it's all scripted it's all paid for its all focus grouped\nIt's poll tested from their perspective\nAnd the the obvious there's there there there's no you look at this you look at this caravan and it is\nIt ought to scare everybody is exactly the threat this country has faced for years we now have a focused concentrated microcosm of it with seven thousand\nPeople and maybe a thousand or ten thousand if they get here by election day there's still a thousand miles away yet vowing to get here by election day at the drive by claiming they're walking there not walking they can't they'll never cover a thousand miles in two weeks have been walking it's physically not possible\nSo when the cameras aren't there some of these people have to be being driven but it is\nAll orchestrated none of this is organic none of it is real from the standpoint that individual totaling eight thousand people decided on the same day or in the same week or even in the same month to start walking\nFrom Honduras to the United states that just didn't happen and it doesn't happen somebody is making this happened somebody set this up\nIt obviously is a bunch of left is to set this up and when you look at that and examine it from that standpoint you've you've got to wonder what it is that makes them think they are going to win the massive elections and it is clear to me\nNot only examining the caravan the mob see there I go I even got caught up calling it what it is and it's not a caravan that's a mob it's uh bought and paid for and structured scripted mob\n\nThe Democrats clearly believe and they have believed since the two thousand sixteen election\nThat the way\nTo win back their power is to stoke and create Trump hatred that they think they're getting ... natural really exists in either a majority of Americans or close to it and that's what they're trying to capitalize on is massive Trump hatred massive Trump resentment\nThey're not doing it by talking about issues in an individual campaigns you'll hear Democrats promise to repeal the tax cuts and roll back the things that have led to economic prosperity but in terms of the national message from the Democratic party you're not getting one you're getting\nTrump fear Trump hatred promoting an exacerbating it or what have you and it's\nIt's silly it's not the way you build a movement now\nLet me share with you a couple of uh stories today on the polling leading up to the midterms because it is all over the place\nAnd it is contradictory as it can be five thirty eight as soon as the adored and the indispensable and the eagerly anticipated Nate Silver\nWho has now said and the Democrats have an eighty five percent chance of winning control of the house of representatives the Republicans have only a teen and a half percent chance of keeping the house\nThis is almost identical to five\nThirty it's forecasting two weeks before the presidential election in two thousand six Dan where Hillary Clinton had anywhere from an eighty eight percent Ninety two percent chance of winning the presidency and Trump pan\nWhat twelve percent to ... percent chance of winning which was effectively zero and even on election day throughout the day and that is how five thirty eight and the New York times reported\nAnd we all know what happened Charlie Cook considered the dean of political analysts\nAnd this company analyzes races individual house races and Senate races and reports on which way they're going to go\nThe cook Political Report today has shifted it ate house racist toward Democrats and two in favor of Republicans were fourteen days to go before the midterm election the non partisan election forecast and there is no such thing\nAnd Charlie Cook is not nonpartisan Charlie Cook cares about the outcome of this stuff Charlie Cook is not nonpartisan but that's how this stuff gets reported\nThe non partisan election forecaster Charlie Cook Political Report rejected Democrats will have an edge in key swing districts\nFollowing the party's massive fundraising haul in the third quarter of this year\n[noise] so those are the two stories but then\nIf you turn to NBC News in the wall
