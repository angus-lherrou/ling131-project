{"month": "10", "state": "TX", "station": "KTRH", "content": "And it really told me a lot about our discussion of things like this\nIn this case had that that this story had happened about a week after a case in Vermont where a guy had raped about ten eleven twelve year old girl and he'd been sentenced he'd been given probation so everyone was angry\nSo I had a lot of conversations about this after I went on O'Reilly show people would say well how do you account for what happened in Vermont where a jury gave the guy probation for raping a twelve year old\nI said juries are comprised of peers Vermont hers are more liberal they don't view sex crimes in the way we would in Texas in Texas that guy would have been given a stiff penalty just how how different we are in our sentencing\nAre representation and our criminal justice system should reflect our values and the values in California Oregon or Vermont or simply different than they are in Texas Alabama or Louisiana and that's okay that's the way the system is supposed to work\nSo he said so people would email me and there's I Can't believe you you're you're you know you love pedophiles you and I said you know it's so easy for you to make such a stupid statement like that\nBut and I would write to people you know your son is going to be Seventeen going to have a fourteen year old daughter a fourteen year old girlfriend and she's going to be a week away from her fifteenth birthday they're going to have consensual sex\nAnd later he's going to be arrested for statutory rape\nAnd he's going to be tagged in the same way that a fifty year old man that but there was a four year old boy is because we've taken that the desire to create these criminal\nSentences that don't allow a jury or a bench to consider the facts because in every case the facts are different and as human beings we trust a system that allows humans to look at him\nWell we don't always liked the way humans decide cases the OJ Simpson case for instance but the answer to that is not to say well I don't like what happened in the OJ Simpson case so from now on when someone's accused of murder we're just going to say you did it and we're going to put you to death within ten minutes 'cause it's easier\nIt's easier than grappling with the difficulties of the human foibles inherent in a system administered by humans\nBut if you think you can put every situation you can you can shoe horned that into a set of statutes that is what people want they want laws that are self enforcing okay\nIf you're driving over sixty five on the road\nIf you're driving sixty six will automatically say that you were speeding and you get a speeding ticket and will make the the penalty tough but what about if you're an ambulance what about if you're playing a criminal what about if you're rushing to the hospital in the middle of night there's nobody on the road and your husband's dying of a heart attack\nHas happened to a friend of mine [noise]\nWell no sixty six you know what we're going to pull you over in impound your car [noise] you know we are a reasonable people we're a civilized advanced society [noise] we're not some third world Muslim theocracy [noise]\nAnd we need to stop this\nAre sexual crimes needs to be updated our discussion of this issue needs to be improved because what we're doing right now whether it's Kavanaugh or Seventeen year old kids it's not good [noise] let\nMe throw a crazy number it you\nTwo hundred and thirty six thousand eight hundred and twenty dollars that so much in additional lifetime income a recent couple would recede to maximizing their Social Security benefits\nAnd living only to today's average life expectancy high it's got man was said money was got man dot com Sundays at ten am if you're over fifty with five hundred thousand dollars or more you may be effectively retired in just don't know\nAre there really way to get potentially tens of thousands of dollars in additional income from your Social Security benefits in retirement why yes there are get a hold of my annual report as Social Security decisions guy five Social Security traps that could cost you thousands in retirement\nIf you say three hundred thousand dollars or more be one of the first ten colors today at one eight hundred six three six zero three three to\nThat one eight hundred six three six zero three three two or state money was got manned dot com don't get cheated out of tens of thousands of dollars in retirement [noise]\nHi this is Dan Patrick proud to be your ten and governor today I Want to talk about fake news when exactly what it means\nHonest accurate reporting is important you may not know that before I began my public service my main career was in radio and television and the TV anchor radio talk show host and reporter\nThe facts matter to me and my colleague we worked hard to earn the trust of the public too often today reporters and anchors ignore the truth and the facts and instead push their own biased to create negative stories about conservatives often based on nothing more than rumors or fly outlaw\nThe press has always been biased against conservatives but what we're seeing today is total disregard for the truth is fake news\nReporting the news accurately regardless of politics is critical to our democracy and it's the right thing to do put it in ... Oregon stay tuned for more conservative conversations about Texas political I paid for by Texans for anti\nCollectors firearms is located at the corner of Richmond and founder and where they've always been more guns under one roof than you are ever going to see including at a gun show and there's no admission cost\nPlenty a park and for you seven won three Seventy one Nineteen sixty and now they do guns missing gun cleaning the whole deal gun storage\nCollectors firearms dot com that's collectors firearms dot com seven three seven eight one Nineteen sixty\nThis report is Roger you buy atlas foundation repair old friends are the ones you can trust like I ... and repair Houston has posted that listens Nineteen Seventy seven for foundation driveway sidewalk and under slab plumbing repair\nAtlas is the answer local experienced trusted atlas foundation dot net [noise] Jimmy\nAnd they say I'm going to stay in the grass and then there are others that I Want to stay and I'm going to protect my home I'm an eye hanging here with my home stand I'm going to stay here with my pets I Am not leaving you can't kick me out so there will be some people\nWho will hang on and state now this area is popularly known even among the locals as the redneck\nRiviera\nIn modern political parlance it means a bunch of poor white privilege people live there and the drive\nBuys ours are surprisingly interested in this I say surprisingly because there's not a syndrome major population center\nThat can be totally wiped out that they could equate with see see how dangerous global warming is\nBut there is a midterm election coming up and there is going to be a federal response to this and as far as the media is concerned is an opportunity to federal response won't be any good and so they can call this Trump's Katrina don't get mad at me for talking about this because I'm telling you\nRight now is exactly how assignment editors and producers throughout the drive by media are looking at this\nThey're looking at this as a potential political event that they're hoping might be somewhat helpful to them in the mid term elections that are only three weeks away there is a heated governor's race in Florida mayor of Tallahassee Andrew Gillum\nRunning against Ron this answers and then Rick Scott the current governor is running for the Senate against the incumbent Bill Nelson so there's a lot politically at stake here you can't deny it folks and you can't you cannot ignore the way the media is\nPreparing a bunch of different scenarios to report on this um it's it's got the global warming component that's number one\nAs a category four hundred and fifty miles an hour lots of destruction of a human\nA destruction as well it's it's got all the ingredients there it is the Republican voting stronghold of the state in in the in the views of many [noise] no no\nIf you look you can get mad at me hold you I'm just telling you I Know the media you may think insensitive\nMe\nTo be speaking this way I'm not I'm telling you how they drive by maybe our planet and they'll react at some point little Brian spelled or go out there\nI Can't believe that these kinds of things were being showed about ... imminent danger of ...

crazy but do you think\nThat Dr buys might be looking for a bit of a respite from all this Kavanaugh's stuff that\nYou don't think so and you don't think the hurricane is providing just a moment Terry

being on civil given the opposition the Republicans and if they win\nThe house then they can go back to being civil if they win the Senate then they can return just civility\nI mean they're making the

announce it I haven't heard one the elected Democrats attempt\nTo distance himself or herself or the party from it I haven't heard one be elected Democrats suggest to these deranged protesters to dial

of ideas anymore we're not in an argument over ideas they don't they don't they're not even looking at any of this is about ideas\n\nThey see America today as flawed and illegitimate and therefore in
