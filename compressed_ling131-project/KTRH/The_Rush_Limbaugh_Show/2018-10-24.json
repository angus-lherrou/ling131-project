politics average of polls\nAnd political experts from across the aisle site real clear politics and trusted as an unassailable source so combat and cofounder of this place was on ah the Fox Business Network today\nHe said that if there was a blue wave that it would be cresting at this point meaning it'd be building we'd be we'd be seeing the top up here\nAnd Tom ... all the polling data that they have it real clear politics and analyzing it's not there is no crafting there is no blue wave if a wave was calming\nIt would be building he says and it isn't but on the other hand the generic ballot is holding meaning the\nDemocrats are not running away with it they still have a ... depending on three to five point lead in the generic ballot but they're not expanding it there's no growth there is no Democrats pulling away as what happened with a blue wave Trump's job approval is rising\nDemocrats are in the advantage ... says but they're not building on anything there's no way that's got to wash everything away and leave only Democrats standing\nHe says the house races are really tight they are race by race real battles hand to hand combat is how he described it\nHe forecast that Democrats might win the house that they do have an advantage right now because they have a range of Seventy competitive races\nAnd the range of pick up as they look at polling data now is anywhere from Democrats picking up ten to forty one seats\nThey're projecting a democratic pickup of twenty five and a half seats which given the slightest bit Democrats need to pick up twenty three that's the magic number anything above that Democrats have an advantage in the house the range of the pickup according to the polling data real clear politics takes a look Savage anywhere from ten to forty one seats\nThey project a pick up a twenty five states plenty of of that sort of two and a half seats more than they need but with even a tiny shift in just a couple of races there GOP can hold the house [noise]\nSo all of this synthesized and stripped away and it went to bear essence there isn't a blue wave there isn't this blue wave that's going to sweep every Republican away and leave only Democrats standing\nThe generic ballot is not moving in Democrats' favor Trump's approval numbers are rising all her on the Senate side that Ben and real clear politics project the Republicans are going to gain two seats two weeks ago they were predicting no change\nThe Republicans wouldn't gain or lose any two weeks before that the Democrats were going to pick up seats in the Senate so in the

certainly is and\nI don't know I ... and and now with somebody left us tweeting this is typical this is Donald Trump has engendered so much hatred and so much anger their life in America is not safe it just it's just too packed\nIt it's just it's it it it's too obvious it is becoming what\nIn form ... and a educated suspicion about this would tell you that it is a we'll see we'll let time on the phone here in the meantime we go back to the phones Andrew in Cleveland it's great to have you with us or hello\nHey Rosh ... and there was a kid ah riding around in the car with my father it's a pleasure speaking\nWell thank you I appreciate that you very much\nRush you know it's you're talking about this passing the smell test I'm I'm sure the drive by and on this will be that uh\nA dangerous dreams right we're out there putting these bombs in the mail [noise]\nYou know that really were the case where it is a redneck right wing hillbilly which I'm sure that's how this will be owned by the media where did they go about getting a mailing address is I mean George Soros Hillary Clinton Iraq saying oh\nYeah that that information out there for the masses of pain you know there were never any country these devices to make their way to their intended target whoever put them in the mail\nAnd I don't know if it's right away to point fingers at certainty but my gut is telling me this is a left wing smokescreen wanted for them to be discovered\nDemocrats they've proven time and time again there's simply no loans that they want to do everything for they've tried to do to derail Trump or the hot and might video that came out during his presidential campaign to Russia to even gone so far as to try to ruin the line of judge Kavanaugh nothing has worked\nWhat makes you think that they wouldn't do something to do it ...\nAlong along those lines if you want to look at it that way\nIt doesn't make any sense for a Republican or conservative to do this if they really care about winning these elections just makes no sense to do\nThis is going to be instant fodder for the Democrats in the media to blame it on Trump and his supporters and or his uh there's there's ... it doesn't make any sense for a Republican or conservative to do this if they care about the elections none whatsoever but flip\nThat flip that around\nWould it make a lot of sense for a democratic operative or a Democrat in cocaine and the lunatic to do it because things are not working out the way\nThey thought do not forget this is why I've spent so much time dwelling on this today and the psychology that's that that's attached to this this is not going the way they have a short us\nFor the last nine months it was going to go more importantly it's not going the way they believed it was going to go they believe they're allies remember they believe their pollsters\nIf the polls are telling there's a big way based on the generic ballot they believe that they get it in their heads and they believe it then they start reporting it and they just compounds itself and it becomes even more intensely believed it becomes gospel\nAnd then it doesn't\nAnd then the things that are supposed to cement it like the Kavanaugh trek backfires and these mobs are backfiring they are not achieving their objectives\n[noise] so if you flipped this around you've got this you've got this this this mob of people flooding the border by intention\nThere's no way that helps the Democrats and the Democrats as I said let me grab the let me grab the uh the sweet here it's really strange ladies and gentlemen I'm going to quote the creepy porn star a lawyer but Here's Michael ...\nThere is too much at stake in the mid term shut the Democrats do allow the Republicans to use this caravan which is so obviously a set up\nThese are all deep state leaders that these quote unquote bombs are going to Hillary and and you know and and Cuomo and all these guys and then Brennan the deep state\nAnd this is right out of the play the Clinton playbook if you ah go back in time to I Believe it was two thousand eight when Hillary was going against uh Hussein Obama\nThe uh iron my shirts folk started coming out I don't know if you recall that or not I'm sure you do with your memory\nOr yeah and I think I'm responsible for that because of a joke I used to tell about Hillary ...\nYeah and so Michele milk and you know put that to bed as far as it was you know it was a plant\nOr tell people what it was ... tell me 'cause I stepped on it tell people what it is\nOh sure sure so back in two thousand and eight or in order to garner sympathy and empathy for the ... um there was a gentleman or series of gentleman that were walking around the Hillary camp for president campaign of two thousand and eight\nWith signs saying iron my shirts iron my shirts of course because of you know can have a woman for president those you know those sexist Republicans\nRight and we'll watch or we're going to do Hillary and be a domestic beer housewife an iron my shirts didn't fix dinner and get my slippers that kind of thing right\nIt was a point it was a plant it and it was all it was all nonsense to garner apathy and\n... it was already planning to go to waste their was Hillary's plant there was nobody legitimately anti Hillary doing that\nRight correct that's another time telling you I gave them the idea but anyway I don't want to step on keep going with the story\nSo so anyway Michelle milk and came up with a good teeth and basically quit it's a bad from a follow up that this was a plan\nAnd it was all a facade like everything is with the Clintons at great professor called the ... rush she taught me one time with the ... there are no coincidences and there are no\nAh you there's nothing that's set in stone with these people not everything is manufactured everything is made off and so I don't trust them look at Nancy Pelosi down in Miami\nFor someone who was quote unquote running for her life millionaire Nancy was taking her time walking down the stairs or somebody who is open the door for her while she's being shouted at I Believe that's set up I don't want to sound like in conspiracy theorist here but take a look at it it's a bunch of nonsense\nAnd I don't trust the Democrats never have you never let a good conspiracy theory go the way I could never let a good crisis\nGo to Zach writing rush no you're you're you're right about the Clintons is there are no coincidence is with them this is a this is a philosophy that I have a stone for four years on this program asking people to never forget there\nAre no coincidence and ... and the fact you know you say that Israel deep state players a Soros bill and Hillary a Obama and so forth\nUm if [noise] it is curious they're they're they're not even on the radar in in the mid term when you get down to what other then they're trying to get themselves on the radar but\nSee that's I think they're trying to get noticed the Clintons desperately need\nTo be noticed all the time and Obama is trying to recapture some glory trying to show everybody thinks he can still move the needle isn't working now the reason I think I'm responsible for the\nWhat was it iron my shirts\nUsed to the rush to excellent store open up some funny jokes line stories and so forth and I would tell people that I just met Mrs Clinton a week before\nAnd it was the strangest strangest thing and we ended up in an elevator together and just the two of us and she said you know I could never say this outside this elevator but\nI

lying about once a close friend of ... this Corey Feldman is at the center of the FBI's long running investigation into corruption in Tallahassee\nNo one's been charged with anything and Gillum has said that agents assured him he was neither a target and or a focus of the probe just like call me told Trump\nGillum has repeatedly given vague answers to questions about who are paying for the New

lot of people why if it's a big deal okay a trip to New York Hamilton tickets big\nGuy won't tell the truth about it is the big ... up but I\nThink this is chump change compared to what's really at stake here I I think it chump change is wrong because it is a window into he'll Gillum is and he is somebody that wants to parlay his positions of power\nIn too positive influential goodies for himself\nHe is a classic a politician in that regard who believes the holding high office equals an entitlement to perks and ah and other things is willingly a desirous of seeking them\nAnd it's a [noise]\nIn in this in this era where everybody feels the need to denounce the special interest and not being beholden to them a Gillum can't make that statement now let's look at the polling data Quinnipiac University poll yesterday\nShowed that Andrew Gillum is ahead of just ... fifty two to forty six among the light ... voters and he has a double digit lead among women Hispanics and independence\nAnd it's the third such poll in about a week ten days to show Gillum with this clear to lead as as overall edge in public polling why do its largest level since October first [noise]\nOkay so Gillum is a character he is a person with clouds of suspicion\nThat are hanging all over him in addition to that he is a hard left wing activist tack who refers to Florida as his collecting he looks things in the white communists in Marxist do\nHe does not believe in the power of the individual because that leaves the inequality an unfairness\n\nHe wants everybody to get free health care here and a free medical care over their Medicare for all he believes in a guaranteed national income these these kinds of things that\nIf ever implemented would bring to a screeching halt in Florida everything that's happening nationwide that is building the economy\nBut who is dissent is a lot of people may not know much about Ron's defenses so let me step in here and tell those of you in this vast and wide audience in Florida who he is ...\nAnd Harvard graduate who was a decorated jag officer in the navy judge advocate general\nHe has a solid record of winning achievements as a representative from Florida he has resigned his house seat\nIn order to devote all of his time exclusively to his campaign has got a great family his wife or is is all in for this has got a young kid is just the\n[laughter] the epitome of a decent solid American citizen who has achieved tremendous great things\nNow on TV I think it was this morning he was on on Fox\nAnd he very calmly and very simply outlined a pattern of corruption by Andrew Gillum\nHe pointed out the FBI as had yellow monitor radar for years as they said an undercover agents to catch him for breaking all kinds of laws and accepting bribes in return for development deals pay to play so to speak\n\n... graduated from college was given awards by socialist organizations which propelled them of the young age to get elected to the city commission in Tallahassee then he became mayor for three years he's been under some kind of cloud or investigation ever since he wants to Florida to be a sanctuary\nState he wants to Florida to be open borders for any and all illegal immigrants he is the classic\nAmerican socialist to believes America is the problem in the world and the poverty in Central America and the southern hemisphere is our fault because we've all been stolen\nToo many and too much of the world's resources and William hoard it at all and we have denied it to our neighbors William stolen America from the Native Americans and so forth there's nothing decent about the American founding the constitution is all\nOut David now and the guy is a classic throwback he is a walking talking Iraq Hussein Obama on steroids if that's even possible\n\nAny if you compare the current crop of Democrats can get Andrew Gillum is not unusual among the dead the Democrats are putting people like him up all over this country and in many places they are fighting the blame you heard what's happening to Heidi Heitkamp did you hear what she did\nShe just [noise] I'll tell you in a minute as time unfolds here she is down third teams in her Senate race she voted against Kavanaugh\nAnd then thought she'd be able to recover some Republicans that got mad at her but she has blown that sky high\nShe's just missed judge things terribly details are coming up I don't wanna get sidetracked here the point is\nThat the Democrats are nominating waves eyes socialists and and and people have problems with America all over
