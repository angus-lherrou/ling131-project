whatever\nProblems they have the the or their grievances that they think they have it all revolves around the age old argument for the purpose of government\nIt really is used to take all of this that's happening domestically and then when you synthesize it now when you boil it all down to its essence it's about the role of government\nAnd it's about the fact that the Democrats do not want to

we're going to find out how really intellectually vacant that woman actually is and the same thing with Cory Spartacus Booker\nThese people survive on an image and reputation built by the drive by

and not only have they failed he has\nThrived so all they have is rage and the rage is actually the anger associated with failure\nThey have failed in every ah tempt every effort\nTo get Donald Trump's approval numbers down to the thirties and forties so one of the primary parties in America the Democratic party has now become a party of range and violence mob like bullying behavior it's their only angle\nAnd they're actually paying people to go engage in this kind of behavior\nLet's review some things that were in the news twenty\nFour seven and the reason they were in the news twenty four seven because this was how to drive\nBy media working with the Democrat Party was going to get\nRid of Donald Trump and yes folks I mean get rid of Donald Trump I I don't think what this has been about as simply waiting until Republicans lose an election and such as the midterms I think they've actually sought\nTo have Donald Trump for being moved from office since the day after the election I guess what ... about that is what the collusion thing is about that's what every one of these stories has been about\nIs somehow magically forcing Donald Trump out of office and effectively canceling the results of the two thousand sixteen election this is not about been not been about setting the table and making a case for removing Trump\nSay at the ballot box in twenty twenty or having the Republicans lose the house in twenty eight teen this has been about literally removing Donald Trump from the White House that has been the mobilizing energizing thing that's gotten them all out of bed every day\nEverybody from the drive by media leaders to the Democratic party leaders to the enraged abnormalities that make up a Democrat base\nAnd I mean that specifically I guess one of the reasons why the range and anger is now so out of control is because usually these people are able to accomplish most of this kind of thing against any other Republican they want to destroy Mitt Romney or\nGeorge W. Bush they pretty much they know they're going to succeed\nThey've tried everything they know what Trump haven't even made a dent really and it's all\nBeen about having Trump thrown out of office twenty Fifth Amendment that's now that's not two years down the road day how many times that they brought up the\nCabinet needs to get together to determine this man's not fifth say they want him out of office every day\nNow the failure compounds the rage look at just some of the issues that were twenty four seven for at least two weeks\nAnd then no particular or to hear all of these were designed to take out Donald Trump Kristin balls e forward\nThat was a two for that was get rid of Kavanaugh as well in that case they didn't care if they destroyed Brett Kavanaugh's life his family his career

years there's only one thing that the Democrats have won on and that's the wall and as a Trump supporter every time the the issue of the law comes up I get aggravated that it's something that they want on income trumpet caved on\nAnd I think that they've done that fit this time just to put an exclamation point on and they emphasize the Trump is not the winner that he says he is\nYou know that's an interesting thought\nThat it that the idea to flood the border to demonstrate that Trump does not have the wall can't get a phone call maybe isn't going to get the wall so maybe people should abandon from do you think that would work\nWell it's not going to work on me but let me tell you as a as a Trump supporter that is the big thing that aggravates me every time he finds one of these uh one of these things to keep the government going that's got nothing in it it burns me up\nSo are you are who are you a little concerned that Trump is not really trying hard enough for the wall\nYou know I I mean I've got a political theories as to why it hasn't happened yet maybe\nYou know Trump Trump I trust in Trump I I think he knows what he's done a ... it could be that he wants to do their next year right before the election to get everybody energized you know I don't know if he's a ... all I can say these are smarter than I Am\nA navy but but I\nThink they said that your theory is really quite insightful but it requires ... for the Democrats to pull it off a lot of Trump voters would have to believe he's not trying not trying hard to and for for the Democrats to capitalize on flooding was known with\nFour thousand people that get into the country just to demonstrate the Trump hasn't been over wall Trump really can't stop these people that Trump therefore as ineffective those people in order to abandon Trump would then have to conclude he's not really trying very hard and I I don't even think they would have banned it in this soon yet over\nOr I don't I agree I I Know I'm not and I don't think most of them well\nBut my question is what else do they got\nWell they've got my behavior a lunatic insane range\nRight but I mean on on Trump they got they got nothing they can they can put up the Trump hasn't been that he's promised and that's the that's the uh\nNo that's exactly right and right\nThat's that's four in the Trump supporters that we haven't got the wall and we want if not even you know that they aren't even begin\nI'm ... and I didn't even start so it really aggravates me personally but this is something that they just keep the continuing resolution then leave things to keep the\nOh hey yeah I'm with you all of that you're talking about all of these spending bills we've had new budget deals we've had continuing resolutions um we Democrats\nCan't stop anything in the house they can in the Senate what what here's what Trump's up against and I'm ... before you go to I don't want to get your thoughts on the Trump is still up against the fact that the leaders in both parties do not want that wall\n\nIt's not just the Democrats are opposing Trump on this it's all so there are a lot of Republicans don't want that wall because of Republican donors the Trump is still pretty much fighting the establishment the swamp on that\n[noise] they they didn't want tax cuts either no they didn't and there's a lot of other\nThings that they didn't want that he's he's a\nA that he's come through and he's twisted I'm a into doing what he wants\nOut and many of them are in the ... I think many of the Republicans have blocked the idea that Trump was going to be a garner a before now I I they are so convinced the media will get\nRid of whoever the meaning of targets\nI I think first is certainly the first six to eight months of two thousand Seventeen Trump's first year I think the Republicans didn't do anything to help him because they didn't think he was going to survive\nAnd it it that's one of the reasons that the Obamacare repeal and replace it didn't go anywhere because of the ... the Republicans just bought into the notion that most of the country actually hated Trump despite the fact that he had been elected [noise]\nAnd it's been a slow reversal than a slow realization on a part of the Republicans the Trump is the guy and the Trump is immensely popular particularly on the Republican side well\nWe'll see if this story on the caravan turning around ... pay or is there a palm pay all left Saudi Arabia after having met when king Solomon and Mohammed bin saw him on the crown prince you flew to Mexico\nMy hand ... six point for nine percent a PR financing now through December thirty first twenty Eighteen senior dealer or major usa dot com for more information take advantage of rock bottom prices and test drive on the Hendra today at ask go equipment inbred up or visit ask\nGo eat cue dot com that's A.

I think that's just I think the Democratic party deserves to lose\nIn the single biggest the electoral landslide defeats in my lifetime meals they actions they've taken just in the last month\nOkay so that bite and bite\nLit up the Fox news channel today our first stop is America's Newsroom they'll hammer a answered ...

very very much in jeopardy\nWhere you are not buying into this scenario hold it Rush Limbaugh said they'd hold if they don't count votes like I Do and I ran a congressional committee I've been doing it a long time\nThere are Fifteen states that are now gone nine of those in the open seats there's another twenty five to thirty that our our seats that are in play has only about two or three Democrats in certain places on the on the defense everything has to go our way to basically break even\n[noise] let me run through that I see this is the stuff that I'm going to be honest with you I I Do not get into this stuff this is this is wrong or stuff\nAnd to me this is totally ... um any any what what's the word personality or I mean this is just raw numbers are based on data that is the result of polling and\nI Know as well as anybody that polling sometimes is right sometimes it's wrong and and I just sat in the bite\nI'm just suspicious of of polling units because I think I don't think these people can take their passion and their desired\nOutcome out of their work and we know that they know we look in the presidential polls in two thousand sixty and I mean that those people were all literally caught short there was no way Donald Trump is going to win it was just not possible Hillary was going to win in a landslide maybe not the biggest ever but Trump didn't have a prayer\nAnd there was one maybe two polls that showed that he was really in it and couldn't win at Rasmussen was when they were ignored and\nWe've got a replay here's what informs me what makes me make these kind of productions is reality and as I also mentioned last night since ... rock Obama was elected in two thousand eight starting in two thousand ten including the midterms in two thousand twelve\nAnd the midterms in two thousand fourteen ... election or two thousand sixty in the Democratic party has lost twelve hundred seats\nThe trend is people voting out Democrats\nAnd that was happening while the Democrats were in the White House with Obama there that could be a factor Obama's gone so maybe the anti Democrat ... is not as high as it used to be when he was there because I Do believe he was a drag on the Democratic party\nBut then I asked myself what has happened in the last two years to make people all of a sudden want to elect Democrats again\nAs everybody's telling us is going to happen house is gone rushed the Senate yeah we're probably pick up a couple of houses gone\nAnd then they say because rush these house races have nothing to do with any of the way you're looking at this these are really local races and they are have have to deal with things that are not on any national radar will not true if these races are being nationalized by the various candidates in him\n[noise] but anyway what has happened to make people all of a sudden stop rejecting Democrats or the Democrats have they done at one eighty are made now performing and executing an behaving in ways that make people love them again\nWell no not in a just an insane world the Democrats aren't doing anything that would grow\nSupport their promoting rage and anger there promoting insanity\nAnd the lunatic behavior so then okay maybe as a Trump is\nThere's this much opposition to Trump from people who didn't care one way or the other two years ago has the media succeeded in creating a bunch of anti Trump sentiment\nIn a mid term turnout profile of voters well that would have to be what it is because the Democrats are not the Democrats\nSay the justice associated with the Democrats are doing is landslide defeat the Democrats are not responsible for anything good happening in this country\nAnd they're not even trying to be associated they don't even trying to claim credit for the economy they did for a couple of weeks they tried on Obama out rumor Obama's trying to say the economy was his well that went on for like a land balloon\nAnd they died with it so they abandoned Matt and outside of that there hasn't been one attempt by the Democrats to associate themselves with anything good happening in America\nThey haven't dad continued to try and portray America as as unfair\nOn just on deserve\nExceptional superpower that discriminates that violates that ...\nThat [noise] it's all negative so I'm just so where is this body of evidence that suggest the trend of voting against Democrats is reversed again I acknowledge house races are\nNot the same as a presidential race with a national issues of national turnout on balance Shannon dream last night Fox News at night with Shannon brim a wonders what my strategy was in predicting what I predict\nAlmost no calling says that the Republicans are going to hold on to the house so where do you think different coming from with Rush Limbaugh what's the status\nI tend to agree with him um and I think what we could be saying is again the predominant ... the Pony Express called the spiral of silence the shy from voted to the shy breakfast votes as a kind of people who know that it's not a dumb thing necessarily to support a particular view but secretly in the polling booth that's what they do\nThat Steve Hilton who has a weekend show on Fox and he was instrumental in the Brexit vote in the u._k. and so a\nReason why one was Limbaugh getting this I mean there's not a single pulled out of the shows\nThis happening precisely my point it's not a single poll not a single poll shows so from this where to conclude and these people live and die by polls I'm telling you folks nine out of ten of people in D.C living die by their gospel\nAnd I really think um if I Lived in Washington each and every I I don't I couldn't I I wouldn't it be ostracized after not too long I just couldn't get with the program living there I have known that for for many many moons\nSo he'll just yeah I tend to agree very much I think there's a lot of people don't tell the pollsters the truth a lot of people don't even answer when the pollsters call I think\nYeah I Am down to the south down an accident and\nKatie road ahead just cleared and now we're also looking at and I had ... found that minor lay
