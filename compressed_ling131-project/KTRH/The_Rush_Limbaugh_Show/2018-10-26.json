slated for two thirty\nThis afternoon they don't know if any more pipe bombs out there or if he has sent everything that he had the latest to recipients by the way our Cory Booker\nIn New Jersey senator and the former director of national intelligence James Clapper worried the recipients that I also saw Fox News is reporting that law enforcement is telling them\nThat some of these bombs none of them have gone off but some of them have been detonated because they were judged to be\nSo unstable that they couldn't even transport them to a Quantico, Virginia FBI lab to study them they had to go ahead and detonate them of blow 'em up because they might have blown up in transit\nAlthough none of them have gone off none of them if they were ever intended to they must do a lot that isn't known here\nAnd a lot of people are rushing in trying to\nPhil in blanks and this is typical during events like this from everybody becomes a journalist that everybody wants to have the first\nNews on every everybody wants to be the first to learn something the first to pass it on\nAnd on to law enforcement says what they're going to say about this at all is a speculation our law enforcement so I'm definitely going to be leaking\nBetween now and two thirty to various members of the media that they light trust or what have you so there's going to be a day or use of information on what happens during these periods is that the first thing people here is what they ended up tending to believe\nThe first thing they hear the first thing they see is that it makes the first impression\nAnd that is why during this whole week some of the some people have been concern that the media without waiting just went ahead and signed this guy as a pro Trump anti Democrat guy\nIdentifying the the people as Trump targets they make America Again a great again bomb or the ... bomber because it creates first impressions it it's created this worldwide presumption that the bomber was an angry Trump supporter\nSet up at the people Trump is this is this is the uh [noise] the narrative\nIf you will drive buys attempted to establish before anybody knew anything because everybody knows first impressions are\nWhat are matters of same thing is happening\nToday with the economic news we have a GDP report today that growth was three and a half percent but that's below what was expected and so the drive\nBy reporting that economic activity has slowed down it's not nearly what people thought it would be trying to create that first impression among the people in their audiences that there's something wrong with the economy\n\nThere's nothing wrong with three point five percent growth the reason why the economic growth\nIs it didn't come into the ... to predict in three point eight to four percent is guess what the tech stock sector is taking a bath specifically\nGoogle also on his alphabet and Amazon have reported earnings and every day stunningly disappointing\nAnd it's causing sell off it's causing a big problem on the NASDAQ which is where many of the tech stocks report where they listed in\nAnd saw the same thing is happening now and with intensity because we are now at a period of time or less than two weeks before the midterm elections and what better time for the drive buys to reports that the economy is slowing down\nEven though it's shocking to ride along jobs are still being created everything's my three and a half percent growth nobody ever saw that in the last eight years of Iraq Obama we didn't see that much before Obama wait and see it very often this economy still struggling right along with the drive laws are reporting the day\nThat it has a slowing down there could be trouble on the horizon and then there is this from the media light a headline Trump unfortunate the bombs stuff is slowing Republican\nMomentum going into the midterms nobody talks about this yesterday this was a I thought a left wing media narrative that had been created\nBut apparently Trump has signed onto what President Trump to today complained about the pipe bombs being sent to prominent Democrats lamenting the scare has distracted from news about the terms and even Sloan Republican momentum\nSaid Republicans are doing so well in early voting and at the polls and now this bomb stuff happens in the momentum greatly slows news is not talking politics very unfortunate what's going on Republicans to go out and vote that's this tweet\nI did my own little informal survey and I asked people if they've seen any signs of slow down or loss of momentum or all that and then nobody nobody has\nYou know like this is I sadly I Wish it weren't the case I think Trump is half right here I think it is a reflection of what's in the nose and what is it and if there isn't any news\nAbout the Republican early voting dwarfing Democrats than the perception is that it isn't happening or none of this stopped or it's not newsworthy enough anymore so the bomb thing has come along I mean it dwarfs the caravan that news stopped being reported but more and more importantly all of the news about the\nHeavy Republican turnout dwarfing the Democrats late Republicans pulling ... I've got a\nPool here today from strategic good strategic strategic [noise]\nIn the poll running to Santa has pulled ahead of Andrew Gillum by a point it's a respectable Paul it's a big deal\nAnd so ... this is the kind of news that is not being widely reported and therefore people in Florida are not being told this and it's one of these a sad reality is that the daily reporting the news does affect what people think their perceptions\nOf ah of what's going on and I think that's what Trump is ah is talking about here complains that bombs have slowed Republican momentum\nUm\nIn fact here's another as I said it's a media story I don't know who wrote this but listen to the next paragraph Trump's tweet while someone nonsensical\nSuggests the president might be falling from a false flag theory being pushed on Fox News this week that the bombs or a Democrat operation to get out the vote for the midterms\nHis tweet comes moments after police intercepted two more devices sent to Cory Booker and James Clapper with Trump's tweet while someone nonsensical\nReally help to know who wrote this suggests the president might be falling for the false flag theory being pushed on Fox News the bombs or a Democrat operation to get out the vote\nIf the bombs or a false flag operation they're designed to do to to cover up in the news of anything good maybe have favorable the Republicans at Trump for being reported\n\nIt's a false flag operation it'd be designed to to um it'll make it make it appear like the Democrats are\nBehind this we'll just have to let time unfold on this ... this is a little frustrating trying to get all this information coming in and not be able to share it with you because I Can't confirm it myself and I don't want to be out on a limb so we're just going to be patient was just going to wait and as I learn things that I can\nPersonally confirming vouch for and what have no trouble explaining if somebody question about that I'll pass it on to you know

but I think they know they're in trouble with these elections I honestly beginning to think that the Republicans are going to gain seats in the house or or you are not nearly going to lose as many as

elections are over I think the real investigation is going to move forward on that face a document and that dot CA and I think these people are terrified the deep state I mean they cannot let that

I think this package bombs are means of disrupting these elections to the point where they can then say\nBetween ... between these crazy right these these national strike group planting bombs and the Russians conspiring we cannot legitimize the win in the selection for the for the Republicans and I think they're going to try to throw the whole thing into turmoil I really do\nI so you think that as we sit here today the deep state thinks they're going to lose their not an American to win the house back Democrats than the state thing not going to win the house back not going to win the Senate back\nSo all of this is designed to create so much chaos that whatever the result is and the Democrats in the deep state loses and they can say election invalid too much was going on we can't we get our democracy can't function this way you ... and you really think that the\nThe deep state here set this guy or prevent he's part of a flag operation\nDesigned to make it look like a Trump supporters gone nuts here and hates the left when in fact they orchestrated you think that\n[noise] do you do for the FBI and CIA and the Justice Department could have been corrupted to the extent that been corrupted over the past four or five years I mean I like I said rush three years ago I Would have said I'm Crazy well I I can put nothing pass them of course when you think about what the repercussions could be for them if they don't\nOh yeah that's on top of each hour and\nJimmy and share it will be the key word defected when grand in your hands on seven forty Katie our age rookie locally by my computer career\nVisit my computer career dot edu and take a free career evaluation you could start your new life as an IT pro in his little is form on my computer career dot edu training for a better life [noise]\n\n\nBreathing talking back Rush Limbaugh to cutting edge of societal evolution\nTo Alexandria, Virginia this is Tammy Ron open line friday welcome great to have you with us high\nOn my God what a privilege I could imagine I can remember that the river which for me to have you here too so what ...\nWhat I wanted to let you know I've been listening since Nineteen Ninety One when the federal judge I was clicking for introduced me to your program um and so it's so great to be on here so many years later I wanted\nAnd I loved that pedigree look at where you come from you ... you have a federal judge was working and that's who recommend that you are so that that that that's a wonderful pedigree ethic that's like a great resume that when you went to the Institute\nAnd by the way I recently gave them a gift of a twenty four seven subscription so I'm sure he's listening today\nOh that's awesome that that is that what I Can't tell you how sweet that is you know what you bring that up I have to\nSay we we we are ...

comes back with false positives\nBut I'm my my hands on even hit the table at ... just wildly just sticky waiting around to her in my fall alert has been triggered him to watch that's what [noise] just interrupt me but my my point is it this guy here\nHas been screaming notice me and how here comes Dana Bash from CNN justice after the CNN sucks sticker on this van [noise] CNN sucks [noise] here we go\nThat image than ... course the president in Iraq that he's not technically of responsible for that but if it's possible for not just allowing the chat than on south at his rally soaking\nMaking clear that he likes and all you need is one forgive me crock pot\nAnd we've been saying this for two years and looks like one may have emerged and that is the danger and that is the reason why leadership is the way it is and you can have an enemy you can have a political discussion you can have political discourse\nBut when you've crossed the line it is extremely dangerous and that has what has been giant on mission and everything we've heard from anybody at the White House\nOkay so in CNN's as that's Trump's van and its Trump's bombs\nAnd you know in a in a vacuum and in a narrow world what Dana Bash just sent here would be perfectly fine\nBut the thing that really irritates me about CNN and the rest of these people in the leftist ... is that they permit themselves to say all of these incendiary things about anybody they want\nThey permit themselves to attack the character and the intentions and the decency and the honesty of any of their targets\nAnd they can call every president Hitler like they did George W. Bush like they do Donald Trump\nThey can accuse these people have some of the most outrageous things in the world and of course there's never any danger that at one of their crackpot viewers is going to take action except the theory is\nCrock pot CNN viewers shut up or Republican baseball practice crock pot CNN viewers storm buildings where there are Family Research council members and think about letting loose with gunfire\nWe have example after example\nOf attempted violence against conservatives when right when he was in fact one of the one of the central elements of Democrats strategy in this campaign is the public threatening and the public bullying and the public harassment\nOf Republican elected officials in restaurants in public places and these are genuinely threatening people and they are confronting people and demanding that they leave\n\nAnd and there's not there's never any condemnation of the ... you never hear CNN condemning any of this\nKind of behavior they chalk it up well you know this is what Donald Trump ... this is what Donald Trump's presidency is meant there says what Donald Trump is doing to people he's making them insane is creating all that so it's it's a one way street what these people\n\nThat I Believe Donald Trump is reacting by the way\nCNN starts this with their unfair biased coverage and unlike other Republicans who just sit there and take it\nAnd ... about the stuff well this is politics you know it's hard wall you got to be able to take it and I'm sure the people's the inter find people that are that Trump fires back at them\nAnd that's what hasn't been done before Trump fires back at him\nAnd a lot of Republicans are very excited about this fighting back because for ... for too many years we've had to sit here and watch\nPowerless late as CNN and others in the media have taken potshots of us and our issues they have lied about them if they did them is characterize them they have attempted to impugn the character in honor of conservative\nPeople spokesman policy people and so forth now all of a sudden\nWhen an actual Republican get shot by a gun in a bullet there is no ringing of hands over what's happening to our politics because the shooter was a Bernie Sanders supporter\nSo we talk about where of course yeah I was ah mentally unstable Trump would do that to anybody comes down to the Trump\nHow lot of people say but Russia or something like two wrongs make her I'm not talking about two wrongs make a right I'm simply I I'm not talking about who started it I'm Talking about these people that want to sit here and high judgment over everybody else while exempting themselves\n\nWhereas they said Donald Trump is turkey perfectly capable and responsible for any behavior on the part of his supporters CNN is it\nThey're not responsible for how many of their viewers act or how any of the people on their side of the ... act and then there's this demand that they have for insulation\nAnd to be exam\nFrom having any impact on people that frankly offends me but this van I mean if you [laughter] if you wanted to\nDecorate and dress up a van that says noticed made and if you wanted everybody in the world to know that you are a Trump supporter who was unstable and a little over the top are major over to stop\nThis is what you would do so my two cents for now here's

which is reported so far today and you add that\nTo what you know or think you know about all of the various political players involved here and do you think for example that the\nThe deep state not ... the Democratic party see I Can't ever put out of my head what has been done these past two years on this totally bogus investigation to prove Trump colluded with Russia that is so big\nThat is so outrageous what has\nBeen done in these past two years ignoring the real collusion and the real criminality and not even investigating\nPlanting spies in the Trump campaign why the president about whether he's a target or not literally trying to set up Trump employees\nStaffers and so forth sets them up so that they behave in certain ways as to give the impression that Trump is colluding with\nThat Russia was involved it somehow that election was illegitimate that project is still ongoing it's ongoing in the form of the Mueller investigation\nAnd all along that line George Papadopoulos who at one time was the guy the FBI told us was the reason this interests\nShouldn't be Dan George Papadopoulos is now claiming that what he has learned in these past two years he's thinking of withdrawing his plea agreement with Mahler\nJust briefly to recall Papadopoulos was a young eager beaver so called foreign policy advisor on the Trump campaign you never met Trump he never\nGave him any advice but he was hired early on because the media was happening Trump or your advisors obviously fills out these positions Papadopoulos was set up he was invited to London by one of the spies the FBI embedded the Trump campaign a guy name Stephan helper\nHe was in it or just a professor from Walter named Joseph ... who planted in his mind the idea hey George do you know this you know the Russians have a whole lotta Hillary's emails\nNo I Know that Stephanopoulos twenty four year old kid he thinks he's being told something really big so they tell him this then he finds himself having adult beverages were the ambassador from Australia at a bar in London\nAnd the ambassador\nTo step in options you know [noise] told the we we know that the Russians have a lot of Hillary emails\nSo this ambassador goes back and reports to the FBI what Papadopoulos told them well they planted it in his head he didn't know what independently because it probably isn't even true\nSo Papadopoulos spreading the word that the Trump campaign knew that the Russians have Hillary emails at one point that's what they told us was the starting point for the investigation to go get the ... orange what's all bogus that was not when the investigation started it started way before that\nMy point is how much the deep state wants their government back\nWe don't even really understand we think we do but we don't have any idea these people have an entitlement to our government the strings the levers of power their positions in at the un I cannot relate to\nWe can do our best to try to understand it but they think they own it hits there's\nThey are scared to death that the actions that I just described the mother and but this whole two years silent ... who\nThey are hell bent that none of what they've done it ever really see the light of day that nobody ever find out and the fastest way to making sure\nThat nobody ever finds out is to make sure the Democrats win control of the house and eventually get to the Senate and the White House back and then everything's cool the cover up we'll continue nobody will ever know what really happened\nThese people who might be facing jail time or other serious criminal problems will be spared that's another reason why Hillary had to win and the Mueller investigation I Believe is an attempt to distract everybody and and be a cover up\nFor the real conspiracy and the real ... and the real collusion that without well if I Believe all of that to be true and I do and I know it is true I'm not I have no doubts about it\nI Will those
