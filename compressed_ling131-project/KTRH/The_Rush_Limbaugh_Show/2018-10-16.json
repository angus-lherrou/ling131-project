{"month": "10", "state": "TX", "station": "KTRH", "content": "Heard so many different versions of proposition and usually I vote if the mayor of sport I'm against it but what is your opinion of of\nThe fire in a request for a\nPay raise or something [laughter] [noise] well [noise] it is a very complicated issue and I have not come out for or against [noise] um it is not a simple issue I Will tell you that um I was on the phones ... very late last night\nCoordinating um to get the mayor to come on the show\nHe and I used to be very good friends back in the day [noise] and so what I have asked is that he come on and once I have the day\nI'm going to ask Marty lengthened with the fire is technically not a union I forget what the firefighters association [noise]\nUm\nGoing to ask the two that I'm going to have the two of them on we're going to do it in the eight am our we're just coordinating the day\nAnd I'm going to moderate and what I'm going to do is give each of them\nAn opening segment of about seven minutes and then I'm I'm going to cultivate questions from listeners it won't be a gotcha I'm not going to let them interrupt each other\nUm I'm not going to allow it to degenerate into name calling and and uh ignorance\nWe're going to have a public policy discussion the truth of the matter is a lot of\nTimes people want to make complicated public policy discussions about whether you loved firefighters or whether you love the cops or whether you loved the mayor or\nAll sorts of things like this um I Can't give you a short answer to that question\nIt is\nI served for six years on Houston city council and I will tell you that the way policy has been made and the white policy gets made at the city is piecemeal patchwork\nAnd when you when you do things that are piecemeal patchwork\nOver the course of Thirty years it's really back to about Nineteen Ninety One well actually you you could you can really look too about Nineteen eighty five for where the current problems start um you have a situation\nWhere the firefighters um\nThe firefighter package is not where it should be there's no doubt about that so now you're put it into a situation where you say\nIs the passage of ... be\nUm the answer well it's a pretty\nAccelerated true up and that is a pretty dramatic effect on the city's finances is the ... going to go bankrupt overnight it probably passes no but it's going to have a dramatic financial effect overnight and\nYou love semester turn or you hate semester Turner and I understand that the firefighters are crossed ways with Sylvester Turner and I understand why but this is not also best returns problem in fact\nVery little of this problem is actually Sylvester Turner pro this problem goes back to um it really goes back Thirty years and and uh\n[noise] you have to account for the fact that firefighters and police officers do very different jobs\nIn very different ways firefighters work twenty four\nOr was on um [noise]\nHow long you're on how much you have to pay to be competitive\nThe various levels of danger the various levels of expertise\nThe the pension plans which are different these two classified positions it is I Would tell you if you love public policy if you love figuring out how the dollars are to be spent in what you want to accomplish with the city budget\nIt's a it's a worthwhile conversation to have\nUm unfortunately that is never what these campaigns are about their about picking sides [noise]\nUm and and that's unfortunate because I I've heard some negative statements made by firefighters that they're lazy\nI'm all they do is he and I was I have a lot of our father buddies and I was a kid with them about that but make no mistake a kid with everybody I kid with Ramona kid with felt that um\nIt is also difficult job\nAnd I'm the firefighters have a reasonable case for a pay increase and and and some things that they're looking for that should be accomplished this is a big bite all at once and that will affect the city's finances so I don't have the right answer I Wish I did I\nI Wish this situation had been dealt with\nThirty years ago a in a more reasonable manner but every mayor for the last Thirty years\nBears responsibility for kicking the can down down down the road and that's that that is a reality that Sylvester Turner inherited so regardless what you think of him or any other issue that that is a reality that he inherited\nThat now because he didn't choose for this to be on the ballot but now that it is he's in he's in a tough situation I'll tell you who's in an awful situation to say I'm paying you\nThat the police chief of the the fire chief\nBecause now the fire chief in a situation where if if this happens he's got a department that the budgeting is sort of taken out of his hands and he's got to do the best he can with what he has it it is not the whole thing is a tough situation there's just no way around that\nBut this is what cities the city's grapple with tough public policy issues and they figure out how to solve them\nOr that might sound like a non answer it feels like a non answer [noise]\nBecause it's not an issue that is an easy issue I Wish it was in a way in the coming days I'll let you know when we are going to have the mayor and Marty Langston on in our studio for an hour and we're going to there's a lot of rumors out there there's a lot of\nUm [noise] untruths a lot of distortions and we're going to get to the root of\nBig watch party like your show up on\nTheir motto is to bring control their name is MSN Thirteen

fourth Peruvian one one thousand twenty fourth Colombian and mushy trace maybe to the drug cartels in Columbia\n\nWhy is there a dearth of Indian DNA why is there not much Indian DNA out there\nOr was the problem bustamante couldn't find any matches for Warren using only Indian DNA so he felt the need to expand it\nTo include South America when other\nReason there isn't much in the DNA is because they are very very wary of\nThis the Indians themselves the Cherokee tribe leaders will tell you they don't use DNA to the terminal limit engine they use junior logical trace\n\nKnow who has one of the best junior logical trace apparatus was in this country in the Mormon church out in Salt Lake City has one of the most advanced\nSuspected documented genial logical pray organizations that you'll find I have I've seen their work and it is [laughter] it's amazing\nAnd that story I get is that many Native Americans have been very leery of granting DNA because they're leery of how it's going to be used\nThey already feel like they were discriminated bunch of people but I'm the same token there are some benefits that have been extended to them as a result of this\nAnd they just don't want to upset the apple cart so they don't even realize or utilize DNA if any of this but the media of course has a role here because everything they reported about this turns out to be an abject lying separatists inclusion by the Boston Globe that there wasn't any Native American DNA\nAnd by the way this is not what Trump that her anyway Trump that her that she wouldn't have to take a test from little kept wandering around you can you can do a very rudimentary DNA test\nAnd he wanted to present her ... take the kids take the take the test of his kids using it in a debate future debate and that's what he\nMeant that she wouldn't do and he bet that she wouldn't show up as the Indian if she did do it\nBut you talk about talk about a meltdown and its Trump that is causing this\nTrump is literally causing these people lose their cookies compass causing them to go in the same and I think it's happening throughout the Democratic party ... out in the American left and I have I have developed\nAn even greater reason for it and it all in all relies on things that I have previously known and told you about and most of it is related to my curiosity here and my suspicion and my my dubious\nA nature when it comes to this blue wave business\n\nWe've been hearing for the past how many months that there's going to be a blue wave there's no question about it there has been no question about it the Democratic party is poised to retake everything they can in this next election why\nWell the media tells us the American people are fed up after two years of Donald Trump they realize the mistake they made they wish they could do it and go do it over\nMaybe take back their vote for Trump and this is going to be the first chance they've had to actually do that until the Democrats are going to retake the house and a massive landslide and at one point to we're going to take the Senate but then if you look\nAt the reality\nOf voting patterns just in the past eight years let's say ten there's nothing in the world using common sense that orders for a Democrat sweep or blue wave\nThe trend in the past ten years is Democrats losing elections left and right and it all started with Iraq Hussein all in two thousand ten [noise]\nDo you remember how many times I reminded you that during the\nFirst six years of Obama go through the two thousand fourteen mid terms\nThe Democrat Party lost over twelve hundred seats nationwide seats in the U.S house seats in the U.S Senate state houses a governorships a you even go\nTo a local often like mayor or town councilman if you if you factor all of those races nationwide the Democrats after six years of Obama had lost\nWell over a hundred seats they were losing everything after the two thousand sixteen election\nThey continue to lose even more and the and the dead and sat lock to women in a landslide Hillary Clinton got beat in ... near electoral landslide electoral college landslide\nI'm not a robot shouldn't run ever going to sweep may never going to wipe out the Republican Party once and for all Hillary Clinton was going to be this winter they had they couldn't they had it any better this guy Trump won the Republican nomination\nSomebody did know when he was doing a gigantic buffoon a walking set of gas they thought this guy would be easily swept away they believed all our polling data\nAnd we know what happened they continue to lose to the point that after the two thousand sixty eight elections the Democratic party had the least amount of power in terms of elected office is held in Washington DC since the Nineteen twenties\nNow there's two thousand sixteen election was only two years ago so from two thousand ten the first chance people had to vote\nAfter having stomach two years of the Obama administration which you want to talk about people wanting to get their votes back you want to talk about people wishing they can do it over you want to talk about people wishing they haven't voted the way they had go take a look at the two thousand ten midterms\nIraq Obama singlehandedly my friends has destroyed the electoral prowess of the Democratic party\nNobody knows it because of the things I just told you are never reported instead what people hear every day is this coming blow away this gigantic Democrat landslide on what evidence is this going to happen\nWhat is it that has stopped the trend\nThe people in this country have been voting against Democrats in ways unprecedented I mean to having the fewest number of electoral seats since the Nineteen twenties is pretty astounding it means a lot of people have been voting against you so what is it that's happened\nThat is going to cause this gigantic one hundred eighty degree shift\nMake people stop voting against Democrats and vote for them why it's none other than Donald Trump so says the media so says the Democratic party\nWell on the basis of what\nIf you take a look at Trump's agenda and the economy and policies in so far there's no reason to vote against it\nIn common sense there is no read Trump hasn't done anything to worsen anybody's lives quite the contrary\nAnd in fact there's a story from CNBC today that you're not going to see the widely reported we'll see [laughter]\nProbably what you see him be ... survey slowing economic optimism points to no blue wave in two thousand eight ten is this is the NBC\nPoll or survey America is experiencing a record breaking era of good feelings economically speaking optimism about the ... do you know that there are seven million jobs open in America today\nActual number seven million one hundred thirty six thousand job openings in America\nFor context the U.S never had even six million vacant jobs open until April of two thousand Seventeen\nNow

with that many job openings it is and employ ease market if\nThere's that much demand for employees the employers can set the terms based on their level of expertise and experience or whatever it is they're applying for none of this\nIn the world of common sense suggests that people would be unhappy by or about it and want to reject it and yet that's exactly what we're being told\nThat the

to see where this\nParents' House news have been reported so we got Washington Times the Daily Caller Daley wire Russia Today a PJ Media Breitbart News you know cure report back there is no way piece

E. or cellular to connect your watch is connected to it by Bluetooth\nIf the to get separated let's say your watch your your phone is on a wife I network\nThe watch is capable of why but only\n... the\nIPhone that it's paired June knows that wide network\nFor example when I'm at home um I leave my phone in the library when I go walk the dogs the state has a massive yard so I'm Out of range so my phone is not with me but my watch connects via wife why\nBecause my phone is connected to wipe viable watch learns that but I still I have to manually answer\nThe why fi password on my watch for it to work it did not automatically translate transmit the uh the password from the phone to watch\nIt took me a while to figure that I'm Out there walking the dogs and the watches connecting on ... ... what the hell's going on so I checked and I found out that I have not entered the password for my wife I'm at work on my watch\nWhat I doubt that Jamal ... phone had why fi connection to the Saudi consulate\nIf it's password required and his wife is sitting outside with the phone she might be able to see the wife I network in there but if she doesn't know the password the phone's not going to connect to the Saudi wife I end up the phone does it come back to what the watch will not\nKnow if he had a history of going into that conflict with his phone and if one of previous visit he had logged into their wife I work with the password then his watch would connect to be a wife fight if she had also entered\nThe wife I network password on his watch that's just the phone is not nearby\nI just don't think any of that happened I don't know how proficient this guy was with tech ... it is possible that he'll watch could have recorded everything\nOn why fight if he had actually answered the consulates why fi network password independently on his watch just because the the phone has has been long gone with the password does not mean to watch as\n\nDevice connecting do a wife I met were half\nTo go through the password nothing is automatic now Apple's got really simplified beard you know you'll people may not notice ... and may have happened to you to know what I'm saying let's say that you are going over to uncle weeks house\nAnd uncles he has a wife I network and you're going over there and when you get the uncles weeks house you ask ... for the password to his wife or you don't have to do that anymore all you have to do\nIs make sure uncles IQ is in the room with you in whatever room you are in the house\nAnd then on your phone you go and turn on the wife I network find a wife I network at the minute you do that I'll go leaks phone will get it alerts saying do you want to share your wife I network with others in your house and uncles equal click yes\nAnd that will send the password for his wife I network to your phone you are the guest and his little do this automatically that way hosts do not have to remember their passwords and do not have to give them the gas that happens automatically as an Iowa eleven\nYou should try this if you don't notice\nIt's fascinating it's it's it's amazing how apple has continued to idiot proof and simplify all this\nBut I'm just telling you that the shell game would have had entered the wife I network password to the Saudi constantly ... on his watch even if it was already done on his phone even if needed to do it on his watch in order to activate the wife ... worker access at\nIf he'd done that if his watch works on why fight you met constantly then he wanted to have been able to record everything that happened on the watch if he had done it on the map\n\nOne of the current wife I Know it it it it it because he didn't pardon me out of range for it but but it would still need the password still need\nA [laughter] [noise] well I don't know if they would say no or not I mean he's a he's a journalist up until this visit was probably will find the empty okay who knows but\nI doubt that his car had a wife or that would require you to have a hot spot\nFrom whatever cell carry over their offers them but even even if that were the case um\nLook in another example of trying to explain this you're going to a city and you get an a car picks you up the airport or whatever in the car service has wife Ryan it it's just a hot spot\nThe driver gives you the password if you're not sort of your log into it you're watching is not logging on to the network your ... your watch is connecting to the phone the phone and controls your watch as long as the tour in range", "show_name": "The Rush Limbaugh Show", "year": "2018", "city": "Houston", "day": "16"}
