now they're built like they were meant to be ... their whole lives and then you have those people it's like they just got fatter and fatter and fatter but it's almost it's almost small chassis just

awful blonde hair piece that's just stuck down on top of it\nAnd he's got a mile speech impediment\nAnd he is so funny he is one of the funniest comedians I've ever seen and he gets no credit speaking a funny comedians have you seen Chappaquiddick I watched Chappaquiddick last night in gym gaffe\nAgain plays a serious role in yeah he's the U.S attorney in Boston who's close friends with the Kennedys I thought you know they're going to end up making it okay for Ted Kennedy\nOr they're going to make you think Ted Kennedy's worst human being era they actually tried to play it pretty straight\nI did learn a lot about the whole thing a lot that I did not\nAlready know like I didn't know that after he got out that he and his two buddies went back to the site and his two buddies went down on the car went down and and they see her in there and then they come back up\nWell nobody ever reports and she's she's dead in the car that has sunk and he managed to get out somehow\nI'm of course he's looking out for himself\nAnd then the rest of the movie which is the bulk of the movie is about how everyone around him including her dear friends that all anyone is worried about is how do we save his his presidential uh aspirations how do we protect Ted Kennedy because he has to be president\nAnd I thought that was quite telling and quite accurate\nBecause people like that the Clintons are the ultimate example people like that everyone around them is a non human ... an a non factor because all that matters is that person's aspirations\nEveryone else is expendable everyone else's disposable everything is focused on that it's as if that person's career\nIs its own being which is even greater than the individual you know they talked to Ted Kennedy like he's an idiot because he is but then when when the the specter of his presidential aspirations comes up it's as if that new being is in the room and that's the thing that is worshipped\nAnd use since that with a lot of politicians and if you've ever been around them if you've ever been around someone with that\nLevel of ambition you know exactly what I'm Talking about you know the type of people\nThat you can never actually be close to them you can never actually trust them because they do not have authentic legitimate emotions of love and hate him beer and intimacy and friendship and revenge\nEverything is\nSecondary to their ambition and their ambition it it it it makes them like an automatic on there they will pretend to make friendships they will pretend to love they will pretend to connect but it is always related to that thing out there that ... in the air\nAnd in the movie makes that point very clearly Mary Jo ... best friend when she finds out her her friend has died in the car\nShe doesn't blame Ted Kennedy she doesn't even want to know details about how it happened her immediate reaction is what do we need to do to protect you senator what do we need to do to make sure that you will still be president because that's what we're here for\nAn end Mary Jo compact and it was part of what they called the the boiler room girls\nWhich you can you can and get the impression that the Kennedys have their way with any of them they want at any given time but these are the girls that that answer the phones these are the girls at work on the campaigns and they're just kinda passed from campaign to campaign and he inherited them all from Bobby's campaign [noise]\nUm and in marriage ... and it was was one of those which meant there nothing they're expendable their their throw away a bubble it it really doesn't matter\n[noise] this mentality of this sense of entitlement and I've never seen anybody since the Kennedys who had it as much now there's some that habit but\nI've never

talking about here now is Natasha on a top response\nI think that the president controlled himself as that ... last night at his rally that he was poking fun\nAt the whole idea of all I'm not going to talk about the things I'm going to be presidential which is a centrally saying to the audience you know what I'm thinking and then this morning he tweeted that it was\nCNN his fault which basically is I can tell if a woman gets actually thought that was her fault for wearing shorts cart has been completely ... saying that CNN and was responsible for that because the fake news that they're spreading this is one fall into ranged maniac that offending does\nI Hope of all let me just advantage as you want to be on the record of metal pipe bomb showed up and not culpable\nFor the python culpable for the rhetoric that we're seeing back and forth than anyone an anchor on that network indoors to play in Central Park to pick the me assassinate the president\nSaying that the leader right\nNow you heard Natasha on a top there say you really you you want to be on the record\nSaying that when a pipe bomb showed up how about\nHer analogy that Trump blaming CNN as they can to because they got about ... is like blaming a um a a woman who sexually assaulted blaming her for the assault\n[noise] [noise]\nI mean that's that's that's the logic that's the analogy she used okay so so um the conversation continues here now you'll hear in a senior writer for Washington Free beacon Liz Harrington or join the conversation at resumed here by by Natasha on atop\nThe kind of rhetoric at the ... than ... than a thousand things for years he recently commanded that Congress men about body slamming the reporter he has called the ... the enemy of the people have to say they're getting paid ... for anyone who got him some a lot about the\nLast what about the language is\nAn outlet and every time than my own hair and running\nAnd CNN had a choice yesterday you saw the president come out saying is abhorrent white American stand for black ... when it's ten inches you can blame it on the president can blame it on ... John Brennan echoing that how\nDoes that move forward forward at fighting the low road President Trump the highlights whatever inclined said last week we cannot have the ability\nRight we cannot have civility so what your hands are you in on a top actually trying to blame all of this on Trump and of course using this I'm\nFrom the high road and I'm I'm from ah I I'm from propriety and so just simply because she's on the on the left now before we go to the break\nWe're going to we're going to we're going to switch gears have written just a bit to talk about the caravan 'cause I saw this coming up right after I saw the soundbites that you just heard and I switched over to see it and I caught the governor of Ohio there John\nCase it and he is\nBeing interviewed I I don't know who the reporter was at the CNN does it matter being interviewed about the caravan and America and how to deal with I just I just want you to hear this we have to buy your number one\nWe have a caravan coming north we don't want all those people coming across our border and there are ways to deal with it I Believe that if we would check those who were legitimately in need of asylum could be vetted before they even get to the border\nBut you know what we're born in America you know how lucky we are to be born in America and not be born in Guatemala where they would say to your daughter deal if you don't do what we want we will rape your daughter or we will kill your son if he's not a drug meal now\nThey're marching north and you know what it could easily have been all of us\nThat we're in the caravan there were marching north trying to save our families and save our children\nAll right so what is the ruse here or the technique here is a moral equivalence\nThere but for the grace of God go live Phil Donahue or use it as all the time so down even host the show and when the subject of illegal immigration would come up he wouldn't be start preaching about the accident of his birth\nNo I was born just a few miles inside the U.S border and it's it's look different it's made for me and if they started at stolen the guilt if he felt over how the accident of his birth resulted in him being an American how basically on there that was\nTo watch other people in the world as bold being born into a country of prosperity and decency is something to feel guilty about\nAnd it\nMay be something to feel very grateful for I have no quarrel with that but it's how you deal with\nThis that matters we simply can't take and everybody in the world the answer the solution is to spread our area of dominant influence\nAnd to get rid of tyrannical regimes and dictatorships which treat their people like dirt\nAnd condemn that and do our best to spread our way of life around under the belief that it's good and decent but they're way too many people don't think we're the good guys and they think that the American way of life is an imposition\nTo others we don't have the right to impose our views on people but somehow we ought to stay on the side and let everybody who wants him in\nBecause of our guilt and he says uh you know it did their Marjorie nor is it could easily have been all of us that we're in a caravan that we're marching north trying to save our families and save our children\nBut it isn't\nYou know you can deal with what ifs and couldn't be ... and all of
