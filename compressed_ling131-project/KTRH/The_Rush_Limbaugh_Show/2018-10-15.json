I think one of the most effective ways\nOf getting people to think about this how many people have you heard people say this is the most important election in our lives and that's why it's not\nThis is not the most important election of our lives to thousands sixteen was\nIf Hillary had one in two thousand six that that's what we need to focus that's the kinds of stuff we need to ask people to consider what would be happening in America right now in the past two years if Hillary had one\nWho would be running various cabinet posts and agencies what do we know today that we would not know if Hillary had one\nIncluding names of people and what they've been doing\nIf you have people between the eyes with what would America be today if Hillary had one\nIt's a different way of getting people to focus on the importance of elections uh the the drive by their formula and it's rooted\nIn the desire they have it everybody hate Trump\nAnd so that desire becomes narrative and then that narrative becomes the result of polling data\nAnd says the media so have strong they want everybody else to therefore the trend is pro Democrat in the mid terms in their polling data because people have a white realize what a mistake they made voted for Trump none of that is true\nExcept on the hard left where it's always been true there is nothing new about it and it's not confined to Trump patronage hatred of everybody that isn't them\nLike I said just based on the last two weeks of the Capitol hearing the Democrat Party today as constant deserves to lose in the biggest landslide in a history of landslides and Democrat Party deserves to get by\nFor the tactics they have engaged in for the actions taken by their lunatic and paid supporters\nYeah it\nIs just outrageous the kinds of things that they are engaging in and then the decent world and in a sand society they wouldn't be punished greatly\nIn the midterms I still hold out hope that they could be my point is we don't get to all of this as the day is unfold\nIn this weekend in coming weeks but here we go with Donald Trump and Leslie stall on sixty minutes provide providers that are soundbites work I'm not confident now so the only way to know is to give it a shot the first one is Leslie stall\nTalking to Trump about the supposedly the hostility that he has created between the European Union allies and us\nWell I I mean what's ally we have wonderful relationships are a lot of people but we don't teach us much worse than the European Union the European Union on line was formed in order to take advantage of us on trade\nAnd that's what they've done is high and yet they it's not hostile sounds hot sauce on the way they treat us we're not how somebody can in daily within within this country for so many years are you willing to get rid of that western alliance now I like NATO thinner side\nBut you know why we shouldn't be paying almost the entire cost of NATO to protect you and then on top of that they take advantage of us on re electing a don't any more they understand okay\n[noise] so what once again we have here the concept but just so hostile the hostility it sounds so hostile it sounds so mean it sounds so it sounds so it's this it's confrontational and of course in the eyes of the left\nWe want to be Europe they want us to be Europe they want us to be western socialists\nThey think still functioning at a democracy but but that's that's what they want us so we shouldn't be forthcoming\nAnd tolerant we should be welcoming we should be in ... ourselves and this by the way this is just Donald Trump keeping a number of promises\nWhich say what you want this guy has kept more promises probably all politicians in history combined\nThe problem with that is that so many people expect politicians to not keep their promises but I don't know how big of a scoring points that it is for Trump but it does add up to the fact that you can trust them you can count on it it will review says he's going to do something he's going to do it to die trying\nOh I'm just sitting in traffic waiting di do many try and do more living\nMorning every ten minutes on his hands and after news on the ... the news radio seven forty fifty are age\n... news weather and traffic Alexa play ... radio\n\nGame minor correction it's a it's a variety in which the effort\nBy Leslie stall his ripped to shreds not Vanity Fair it's six of one and a half dozen varieties not so much a celebrity focused rag against Vanity Fair is a but they are both left wing entertainment oriented and they do comment on left wing entertainers actors\nActresses TV so called journalist and so forth and and it it's just a little minor correction I get them confused occasionally here is uh just another sample from last night\nTrump and Leslie stall\nIs it you know General Mattis that tells the reason for NATO and the reason for all these alliances and say prevent World War three no it's not true my frankly I like General Mattis I think I Know more about it than he does and I know more about it from the standpoint of fairness that I can tell you finish high and one more time\nOkay yeah I Know unless you're not to try again [laughter] I Know that whole anti my has the answer is this\nI Will always be there with NATO but\nThey have to pay their way I'm totally in favor of NATO but I don't want to be taken advantage\nOf white and general manager so I think I Know more about it than he does I Know more about it from the standpoint of fairness that I can tell you\nHe's talking about the fairness of do is the fairness of all the NATO members paying their own way he's also talking about people like Angela Merkel making a side deal with Russia and potent for natural gas shipments\nExplosively into Germany ignoring other NATO allies and you'll notice it sixty minutes isn't going to Angela Merkel and asking her why she is undermining NATO\nTrump already called her out on it for doing this the Trump supposedly in the pockets of the of the Russians but Trump knows what sixty minutes or less may still trying to do here that's what they don't get\nThey can sneak up on people anymore particularly Trump he knows\nHe in fact you know one thing he says I don't know if we've got it in a roster coming up probably do but he said something to her that is as as honest in true as anything you've ever said because I Know Donald Trump I've known him a long time I play golf and I've known him a long time before he ran for office\nAnd he would ask me about various Democrats asked me about Obama and I can tell that sometimes when I told him what I think he doesn't agree especially when discussions in the media came up\nHe thought I was maybe just a little bit over the top exaggerating in some of the things I Would tell him but my opinion is that the media he said to her\nI had no idea and I'm being really serious with you Leslie I had no idea how dishonest media is until I ran for president I had no idea I'm being really serious with you he said\n\nAnd I I think that's probably true as a New Yorker and immersed in New York media where he was a star\nWhen he wasn't running for office it was a local New York state you know he made fun of him and they laughed but but he was a big get he appeared everywhere and they loved him and he was great front cover back cover of the tabloids the daily news and the post\nWhen he ran for president that's when all of the good vibes about trauma there were some bad things too I mean he didn't get universally loved praised coverage but it all vanished when he ran\nAnd he was surprised in a way kinda like McCain was\n\nSo when he said to her last night I had no idea I really telling you Leslie I'm really shocked that was really surprised\nBy this honest that's the word he uses instead of biased\nI can tell you that that's true now what else has he learned that he didn't know but thought he knew\nBefore he ran for office and I think\nLot about the left a lot about Democrats particularly liberal Democrats but he hadn't thought of in ways you an idea but now since he suffered the treatment is full\nRush Limbaugh legal\nFees

Democrats say if you have one drop of blood that was black you're black\nOr this was this was a grotesque cruel her her for senator so small\nThey don't have ... excuse me second hasn't that rural been adopted by civil rights activists now to that that if if you have one drop you can be called black\nWhat that's exactly right intersection analogy requires quantification yeah\nAnd so when we need to know how much of a percentage of pressure you are versus oppressed\nThis ... this this rulers is grotesque widely discredited used by the KKK in the thirties use can Nazi Germany against the Jews\nHere she comes again this is actually a dog whistle to her base it's not meant for Republicans it's not meant for conservatives is about her future run she needs to tell her base\nI'm On board with intersection analogy look how much of an oppressed ram and let's find out your percentage of a pressure to\nWould you define the intersection out of it is a relatively new leftist

that's why I'm a good host I have ever that no one can little thinking and asking when they listen to a caller savings\nI agree with that look a intersection touted comes straight out of Marxism Marx said that at every one is either on a presser or oppressed they're either bourgeois or proliferated\nAt its later is now being adopted to the idea of being able to declare percentages of what you are how oppressed and how much of an approach where you are\nIt's called intersection nowadays because instead of just being one camp or the other it spread across race gender sexual preference and other variables\nYes okay that's it intersection out all the foreign me\nGreat on washed you're you're talking or you're you're\nSpeaking in language of ah people formerly educated on Marxism many people aren't that's why it's so successful um yes any intersection out all the action is basically something that has been constructed by these Marxist\nJust saying that all of the different leftist organizations meet some when I'm a Islamic feasts that then with illegal immigrants and their activist and we're all of these people intersect is where the unified\nYes but it also applies to the individual because of these let's say five different dimensions you you are on a different scale and all of those and they intersect into a single number quantifiable says that this is how much of an oppressor or oppressed you are this is where you're on the scale\nCourse this is the root of all this recent white privilege stuff pops out some absolutely\nSo now Elizabeth Warren because she wants to uh justify her cultural appropriation of a Harvard professor ... has to claim a particular percentage of intersection now or the oppression\nTo speak their language so she is saying that she is an old press she's arrested him anyway she's a woman therefore she's impressed by the patriarchy and now as a one thousand twenty fourth Indian she is oppressed by the white man\nWhich is a a again a resurrection of the one drop rule this percentage is so low as to be a joke you know I if I can say I can I took a DNA test about four years ago and of course you don't normally you've never seen me but believe me I'm whites\nHowever when I discovered was zero point eight percent sub Saharan Africa well that doesn't mean I'm going to Harvard and going to claim a professorship in African American

people really get confused here in coming from from India\nOr over to sub Saharan Africa is below the arid desert a which is where most of the population of Africa is most of it there is some north of the Sahara Desert as well\nAnd I get I I I get your point a and her reason for doing this all of that and not withstanding\nThe accuracy of it not withstanding the left is pretty upset that she chose this particular time to do this because they think it is totally self serving it does not do anything but distract\nFrom the mid term elections which are three weeks from tomorrow a away and so there

Washington bureau headlined Republicans worry that Trump\nAnd his aides have no idea the hell that may await\n\nThis article by Anita Kumar uses an anonymous interviews with Washington Republicans and

soldiers in Africa to the sluggish response to Hurricane Maria according to people that worked for Presidents Clinton Bush and Barack Hussein oh [noise] now\nAt first glance you would think that this is a story that Trump and his buddies are not aware of the show lacking they're going to take in three weeks that they are blissfully on aware that they're going to lose\nThe house maybe lose the

with him that's going to happen and I can't believe companies people aren't aware of that\nUm\nI think it's why Trump's doing for rallies all week\nI think that's why Trump is working harder than any Republican at this moment to keep the Republicans in control of the house in the Senate\nIdea Trump doesn't get what's in the door if if if if this happens but specifically aside from all those things that they're going to aim at Trump the policy initiatives that have led to this great rebound and recovering economy is going to be brought to a screeching halt walks\n[noise]\nYou can say goodbye
