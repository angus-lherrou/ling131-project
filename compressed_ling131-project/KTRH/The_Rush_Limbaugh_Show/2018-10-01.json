to water whoever the liberals or look at the I'm sure the ... than the right thing and then when they speak they were constantly ...\nAs their ... you just keep going you're you're cheap going you're going to that you're doing\nYeah you're not\nBelieve there's a woman I Would bet Milan paycheck that this was made up I I'm not a big conspiracy theory trust me I'm not but you know don't blame you that this was brought up at the last minute\nAnd then we have this week long thing you know twenty five an hour now that it was just come out of the blue\nYou know and that guy in a fire staying at a whole lot to do what\nShe did she's been involved since day one\nSenator Lindsey Graham calling for an investigation as to how exactly the information on miss Ford was leaked crazy Mazie Hirono over the weekend would not deny that maybe the Democrats did leak it\nNow if we're to believe miss forward that she was not prepared to come forward that she wrote a private letter to miss Feinstein and that she intended for it to be kept private\nThose of you who watched the hearings no if there was a moment where\n\nThe room entered this looming issue of well who really shore information did you seek to come forward I did not\nI wrote a private letter to a a discrete letter to miss Feinstein in fact several Republicans referred to that as a secret letter it was not intended to be discovered that's where we were\n[noise] and she said that the reason she finally went public is because reporters started showing up at her workplace to remember that\nReporters were the words stalk was used\n[noise] let me say I have said before and I will say again I Do not believe that the first amendment gives the press any sort of protection or privilege to come on to the private property of an individual\nNot to go knock on the door to get a statement\nI don't I think it's wrong I think that there is wholesale harassment that occurs by the press in this country that most Americans have tolerated gleefully because we enjoy seeing the picture\nThere was a reporter in Houston a few years ago um who was running back for the Texans momma was accused of having a mistress [noise] it was a star running by a area and foster there was a reporter who's a friend of mine he went to the door knocked on the door area and false\nIt came out he had on flip flops flip flops was Sox shorts and tee shirt he had that look that I have when I'm picking lent out of his naval lucky just woken up walked outside\nAnd he was like man why are you doing this to me why are you doing this and that reporter kept asking him questions you ever do you have a mistress issue pregnant give them a couple man a guy's house it's going to do that at a gas house\nWell if the media did stock this woman\nIn the media is on trial and should be how is it right if in fact she is you you've painted her as a victim why are you now read victimizing this woman\nBecause it's so important that this come out publicly that that this man what 'cause he's going to continue to raped women on the court there's no claim against him in thirty five years since you don't believe that\nThere is a process for removal of federal judges we had a federal judge removed for a similar incident a couple of years ago right\nHere in Houston right here in the greater Houston area anyway Galveston Beaumont it happens\nSo she claimed she was stalked she claimed she was given no alternative by the media and that's why she went public I don't know the truth\nBut that means that the Democrats Dianne Feinstein specifically who we're stewards of a discreet in confidential letter betrayed her\nEither they or their staffs which by agency is the same as them so what does that say to the next woman who says I Want you to consider this but I don't want to go public\nI don't want my Fifteen minutes I don't want to become a household name I don't want my child what if Mrs Ford\nHas a child with a severe disability what if she has a child that's within three months of death you can't drag people into notoriety kicking and screaming Hu resist it\nIf in fact she didn't want to go public that should be respected it\nIs for her to determine whether her story would be told publicly now I think she wanted to tell her story\nBut the story she tells is that the media dragged her out so don't tell me that you're out to protect this woman who was supposedly assaulted thirty five years ago when the life she's built over the next thirty five years you were so eager to destroy\nYou didn't mind that she was collateral damage that her husband's dragged into this that her extended family is dragged into this you don't care about her and you don't care about destroying everything around her because in order\nTo sink judge Kavanaugh all you have to drown her in the process and you did [noise]\n\n\nHi this is Dan Patrick proud to be your lieutenant governor\nI've been fighting to rein in property taxes long\nBefore I ran for office\nTexans pay some of the highest property taxes in the country and that's got to stop\nAll of us want our property values to increase but we shouldn't be tax beyond a reasonable limits on the increase value [noise]\nLocal property tax increases should be limited to four\nPercent per year more or less\nShould require a vote of the people\nYou don't have that power now your property taxes can increase eight percent or more per year and you have no say\nProperty taxes should be frozen for people's sixty five and\nI'll continue to fight to cut property taxes because it's the right thing to\nGo to Dan Patrick dot org and stay tuned for more conservative conversations about Texas\nPolitical I paid for by Texans for that pattern\nOf folks I'm right man very co owners day water Molly

to know part of it they asked in the last moment hey don't forget that can we be why did this to Rob said come on in a reporter just asked Trump what about just meaning into terrorist jumps in hell no I mean the end of tariffs\nIf the European Union continues to send unfair trade deal related products into the United states we're going to slap tariffs not remember how to\nDrive by and the Democrats

pledged to take steps to increase imports that means products from us\nThis year amid rising tension with those some of its biggest trading partners such as the United states bottom line Trump said he was going to do X Y and Z and a B and C in trade and if we started a B and C I think he's pretty much closing in on see\nHe has rebuilt the economy he has created new jobs is economic policies have uh the elimination of onerous regulations which is an ongoing thing continues to show vast benefits\nFor Amri ordinary American who makes this country work\nAnd it's something he said could be done to only he could do and in fact he was the only one that thought it was necessary to do and it's now done here is the president today at the White House Rose Garden we have three ... I have long contended\nThat NAFTA was perhaps the worst trade deal ever made since NAFTA's adoption the United states racked up trade deficits totaling more than two trillion dollars and it's a much higher number than that\nWith Canada and Mexico and lost vast amounts of money at the last four point one million manufacturing jobs and run in four or do jobs lost about twenty five percent of our jobs even more than that throughout the campaign promise to renegotiate NAFTA\nAnd today we have kept that promise\nFor the last half hour the pres maybe even longer than maybe forty five minutes I'm\nIn an extended the statement\nOnly recently started taking questions will tell you what Trump is doing here which is something that I Belong advocate that he wasn't just announcing the deal got done he was teaching why it was important including the drive by media who for the most part are clueless\nUh don't understand capitalism a think that it's a big bad Mimi\nAnd Trump is taking the occasion of all this attention to actually explain how trade works\nAnd how the United states has been victimized over the course of many many years because of American leadership believing well you know where the super power in the world where the richest we can afford to take it in the short now and then it promotes good relations with our allies and Trump stood up and said there's no reason we should have our back pockets\nPicket there's no reason that we should just let people have what ever they want from our treasury\nThere's no reason we should feel guilty about being powerful and wealthy and doesn't mean that because we are so much wealthier and powerful that those who are not having the it was on what we produce those days are over that way of thinking is over\nAnd he went through the whole process and explaining how trained works why it is important and how the United states was getting the shaft\nBut more importantly why it matters to ordinary everyday people and their jobs and their careers\nIncluding farmers and a number of other type people about\nWhom Washington thinks not very off and thanks very little it's been a masterful performance there is no question\nThat Trump not only knows what he's talking about he is the architect of what he's talking about any kind of run the rings around people in this in discussing the process and in discussing this substance\nAnd the details of this new agreement just it puts anybody else it's ever tried this to shame everybody that has the chance to listen to this is going to understand exactly why it was important what happened why it happened and why we benefit and why that is good\nAnd you know teaching as well as a noun Singh is fundamental I Believe that's why the Republican Congress Nineteen Ninety four actually\nSquandered its majority after a while it's because they stopped teaching what they were doing and why as they did it\nMade the fatal mistake and believing that the Republican victory in Nineteen Ninety four men somehow that the majority of the country and overnight turned conservative and so when they began to announce this cut that cut this reform that reform a lot of people didn't know what they were talking about I got scared to death\nAt lesson hasn't been learned by none other than a dozen oldest Trump here's the next bite Trump saying it is a privilege to trade with us\n[noise] [noise] it's kind of thinking we haven't seen\nWe've seen thinking but both parties who who believe that that it's up to us\nUm to earn the\nRespect of authors it's up to us to show them that we don't intend them any harm it's up to us and Trump just turning this a hundred and eighty degrees around so it's a privilege to trade with us we're the world economy\nWhere the future of the world economy where the future of world freedom and liberty to the days of the America as the world's piggy bank are\nOver steel will also imposes new standards requiring at least Seventy five percent of every automobile to be made in North America in order to qualify for the privilege of free access to our markets is a privilege for them\nTo do business with us and I'm not talking about Mexico ... I'm Talking about everybody everybody\nIt's a privilege for China\nTo do business with us it's a privilege for the European Union who is treated us very badly but that's coming along to do business with U.S Japan every country is a privilege for them to come in and attack the piggy bank\nYeah it's a privilege to come down and as I as I say if folks it's it's a new way of seeing ourselves and our country without the need to make excuses without the need to apologize\nMe really we really haven't you know you can see evidence and fines or that's what our own culture of be achieved any accomplish somehow people need to apologize\nFor it or to downplay it as some sort\nOf new definition of humility rather than having used as a teachable moment there's something inspiring\nIs this Trump points out we want every country making that country great we want to every country putting our country first we want everybody doing it that way that's the whole point for everybody\nTo do better but not by piggy bank in the United states by doing it on their own these kinds of things are just they're ... they're far in the United nations types diplomatic types here's the final bite\nOr don't don't forget who told you this was not possible do not forget\nIt was ...

on friday before the vote came\nSomebody raised the question of how when the world did Christine ... forge a letter to Dianne Feinstein week\nBecause it was it was we're\nMade to understand that the letter said that she didn't want anybody to know her name and she didn't want to come forward yet the woman they have written the Washington Post\nShe called the Washington Post tip line the New York times she has an op ed published in the Washington Post but all along we're told she don't want to go public\nSo people were trying to claim you know for all this talk about what Kevin O's done this for a woman it's the Democrat Party and the Democrats on this committee that have taught her for a busy you most a nose ring or\nIs it fair it's spotlight and it became\nObvious that there could be only three sources for the week because of limited possession of low water one would be Senator Feinstein end or her staff\nThe other when you have to be a somebody in the media or the lawyers for Christine Blasey Ford who had seen the letter\nAnd so some senators began to say that it could well be Senator Feinstein and she sat there and filmed while this was happening and as all the other possibilities were mentioned\nShe eventually ask for point of order the chairman Grassley and and said a German wrestling I I Need to react I Need to respond to this out rate just allegations that I or my staff had lead\nThis letter I just took a record I just asked my staff I just asked my staff at any of that Lisa and they have a short me that they didn't\n[laughter] but what we saw when she was she turned around to her staff sitting behind her\nAnd she starts now that we can't hear what she said 'cause it's off Mike but she's obviously asking them did anybody here to leak it she turns or did you did you look at ... she turns back to the camera we need to like Mr Chairman we didn't Lincoln and Trump made fun of this and mocked it in his West Virginia appearance on Saturday Night\nBy say only is this how we're going to determine who leak something she gets to turn to her staff and asked them and they deny it and that it meanwhile Kavanaugh sits over here and as to undergo his seventh FBI background check his accuser has no\nRobert ration and no evidence and he's presumed to have done it and Dianne Feinstein gets to turn around and ask her staff hey did any of your late this letter and nice loan nor nor was it was with us she turns back around so we we didn't do it and it's a German as though case closed it wasn't us they had to have done it\nIt was strategic just

was a it was a an aid at an attempt to help him through his problems it was not a memoir and in this book it talks about safe way a lot and he works there didn't work there so she automatically places

it is devastating be\nInconsistencies in her stories the variables in her story\nFact that none of the stuff that matters can be proven the fact that the people she said in the room the number kept changing from the original letter to subsequent interviews and then to the\nTestimony she had the idea that she was afraid to fly and yet here she is vacationing almost like a world how did she get there the idea that she refused\nWalk to the committee even in California we learn that she didn't even know the committee had offered to fly out there because we're lawyers didn't tell her\nBy the

been genuine I think it's all orchestrated I think a lot of its focus group that I think it's scripted\n\nAnd I just I because none of this past is any kind of a smell test well anyway back to mark pencil very quickly\n[noise]\nAmericans believe her and both believe Kavanaugh if the FBI finds no corroboration of the charges sixty percent believe Kevin all should be confirmed\nAccording to a weekend harbored a Harris Poll of the thousand three hundred and thirty registered voters sixty six percent of Americans support the decision to have the FBI investigate that includes eighty percent Democrats sixty nine percent independence with only forty five percent of\nRepublicans who are in a smart ones\n\nHuge numbers in the weekend poll reported seeing parts of it or reading about forty percent thought she alone was credible\nTwenty three percent fought\nKavanaugh was twenty seven percent said both ... if you combine all that the poll findings indicate sixty seven percent found her credible in fifty percent found him to be\nBut the credibility of their testimony doesn't appear to be the decisive factor in ... the question comes down to collaboration is the standard for tipping public opinion on whether Kavanaugh should've summed up the high court in terms of the overall needle after the testimony was heard\n\nThirty seven percent say confirmed the nomination forty four percent say rejected Eighteen percent remain undecided Democrats going one way Republicans the other but but but but but the hang on no get depressed\nOnce the borders are told that the named witnesses deny any knowledge of the allegation it ships from forty four percent of fifty seven percent in favor confirmation meaning\nMeaning the people in this poll do not know did not know many of them did not know that the people she places in the room have denied being there\nAnd when the pollsters told them that in fact the numbers of people who thought he should be confirmed jumped from forty to fifty seven\nPercent and then up to sixty percent\nIn a hypothetical question if the FBI after a week agrees there is no cooperation for her story\nAnd they've already done that but now we've got to call me entering the picture now we've got a call me\nUrging the FBI to keep digging the same FBI that's been running a silent coups FBI leaders trying to get rid of Trump\n\nI Want to grab a phone call because this guy has a great point and I want to add something to it this was a ... Jason Muskegon, Michigan Jason thank you so much for waiting I appreciate it how're you doing\nAnything no problem I'm concerned that may be part of the excellent [noise]\nWell I appreciate that you are you are here as part of the excellence by association [laughter]\nI was thinking on that uh there's no better way to um motivate a group by attacking them and by attacking Kevin nah they're basically essentially attacking the entire Republican base\nWe showed up and sixteen and voted Trump and I'm part of that reason was for the Supreme Court nomination and here we are\nDemocrats are going to make the midterms about a Supreme Court vacancy and they think that they can last year twenty twenty so they're not really pressing issue as hard as what Republicans could and knowing that if we want to get our guy in there you know we're gonna have to show up in midterms are going to they're going to have an adverse effect that they keep the ...\n[noise] I've heard people say this I I'm a ... Jason here thinks\nAll of this is going to backfire on the Democrats would motivate Republicans to show up and vote not just now two thousand Eighteen but again for Trump and twenty twenty\nOr let's go to the audio soundbites on those Jason thank you much we're going to start here this is a boxing friends weekend on Saturday morning\nRachel Campos Duffy was one of the hosts is talking to CBS em political corresponded David Brody about all this\n\nAnd she says well we know the Democrats all ready men really energized about the midterms I don't know how much more energized naked get but I'm sensing that Republicans have become very energized this week this hearing has really fired and the Republicans\nUp from my reporting and from that deplorable evangelical base I can tell you they say the Democrats dirty tricks have riled them up like never before and I know Rush Limbaugh has talked about how if Kavanaugh is not confirmed it's going to be real tough for the Republicans actually if Kavanaugh is not confirmed\nThat would even rile up at the horrible evangelical base in the jail the base I Believe even more at least the people that I'm hearing from and so I think that that's a big part of what's going on here\nNow you can't blame David Broder you for being fifty percent of informed because\nI I pulled back that original production after it had gone viral all over the drive\nBy media that's why it's still prominent in people's minds and my retraction of that production has barely received a whimper because it doesn't serve the drive by is any good when the drive by here me predicting Republican doom they can't help themselves\nThey got to put her all over the world in the media Rush Limbaugh says Republicans are going to lose ... capital not confirmed that production was based at a specific point in time on if the Republicans caved\nIf Republicans didn't fight for Kavanaugh if Republicans just went bird out I predicted that what happened but once this began to unfold\nI retracted that production and said it could end up being the opposite here but of course that prediction didn't go viral\nAnd I want to Jason in Muskegon I Want to thank you for bringing it up so that I could make the case here is one more a bite on this this uh CSPAN Washington Journal Saturday morning Jess Holland is talking to a correspondent at the Weekly Standard\nAnd Andrew anger about me\nThere's been several conservative including Rush Limbaugh who warned that Republicans could lose their majority if they don't get half a mile from the Supreme Court is that something that Republicans in Congress are really thinking about mid term consequences\nArguments like the one that Limbaugh makes our little convenient on whether or not having to get through I think the whole situation that's really fired up Republican voters\nNow once again somebody else you can't blame 'em folks don't get mad at him because my original production\nEverywhere I literally all over the world it was an Saudi TV was on the BBC it was on Russian television I think even a North Korea does the little pot belly dictator mentioned it in his Saturday\nPosted on the downside of bell for it

is [noise] you can expect that Democrats to go stick\nThey're expecting at least ... that's what's lake was a short I don't know how it's Fox is running it as a source they've got [noise]\nThere's nothing to find the FBI has looked at Kavanaugh this'll be the seventh time folks Christine lousy forward does not have any evidence for them to track down she can't even tell them where no walk she can't tell them when they look\nUnless she starts suddenly remembering it now and I guess they would say that that's credible the trauma has awakened repressed memories I put nothing pass them\nBut she can't remember when not even a year she's not even short of the house in wherever it is and by the way how are you able to draw floor paying for a plan of a house and not know where it was\nShe

what it's about this is about delay delay delay the leg that's all the Democrats want here\nSo whenever the FBI producers which results and whatever the results are the Democrats have an answer for it if\nThey exonerate cabin on the investigation was not thorough that Trump told the FBI to overlook it much they can they can accuse\nTrump Kavanaugh of anything and be confident the media will carry the water that allegation\n\nIf the FBI find corroborating evidence well people are going to have to ask well how come you missed it six previous times over who knows how many years you've been looking into this guy how can you find any evidence which she didn't tell you where to go look\nAll well and\nAnd did you talk to Michael ... the FBI didn't talk to his client and it didn't smart ... I'm telling you no matter how this if the FBI exonerate Kevin all whenever they do it do you really think the Democrats because okay fine we we we we got what we wanted number prepared to go about you think that's gonna be the result it will not but [noise]\nNow folks [noise] one of the thing here\n[noise] we\nAnd that we don't want to become them but it's time to start playing this game the way they do I made the point you don't have to become them to beat them at this game we didn't have to become Hitler\nTo win World War two we didn't have to become the Japanese emperor when World War two and the\nPacific theater that's always been a bogus we cannot go after these people want to risk coming who they are with Pam what a crock that's nothing more than some\nLimitation that's in other denial of people who are already found the bay of a\nFine character you you can you can you can enter into tough battles without losing your morality and your moral character and so forth\nBut as an example of how we almost do it now and then but then we pulled back I call your retention last week the window Lindsey Graham on loaded on the Democrats\nThe on loaded on him and he was a thousand percent right in every allegation he made a couple of other Republicans echoed gram but with no passion and with no energy they just echoed ... grams said\nIntellectually now\nAccording to our caller that should have been the starting point people should have been picked up one grams opener and run with it and it shouldn't be calm\nThe daily identifier of the Republican Party they should have been throwing back firing back right at the Democrats in their faces every hour of every day exactly what Graham did make that the ongoing about put them on the defensive\nMake let media repeat these charges ...

know why fake news\nNow during the Q and a a Cecilia vague go\nABC News the White House correspondent said in a tweet this weekend you said it's incorrect to say that you're limiting the scope of the FBI investigation into Kevin what your own statement on friday made it very clear you said this investigation must be limited in scope so which is that\nThis is our seventh investigation\nOf a man who

NBC News which is complicit with the Democratic party in most things later trap accusing Trump and the White House of trying to limit the FBI ice go because you see there are things to find and Trump wants to cover it up Donald Trump has had so much control over the FBI the last three years\nSame FBI that's been doing is level best to get Donald Trump thrown out of office somehow Donald Trump has been able to walk in there and tell those guys to limit the scope of their investigation\nSo Trump person I'm not limiting the scope of anything I've told the FBI the look at whatever they need to look at oh OK thank you Mr ... two weeks we're going to go to waste so the White House is not claim there aren't any limit to see how this works\nIt was a trap it was a set up and Trump tweeted out he's not limiting the scope NBC in Hawaii of course they're lying it was a set up\n[noise]\nAnd so now it's out there that we may not be enough now Fox News is reporting along with Fox Business news\nAt the FBI is saying they might have this wrapped up tomorrow but then the question becomes what to do with that if the FBI has finished talking everybody talked to\nThat one of the Republicans do with that so they hold on to it till friday and art art art or do they move on it\nWill just tell you if this ends tomorrow if this is all accurate\nAnd the Democrats here but the Democrats are going to be fit to be tied to the thing didn't go on till friday and they're going to demand they're going to start saying that this thing is rigged they knew what was going to be reading and they're going to demand even more time\nTo fix the fact that it was read they're going to do that anyway\nThey're not going to let this thing and on friday if we let them have their way this investigation isn't going to end on friday it won't be long enough besides Trump said\nHe's not going to limit on the FBI so why are they stopping now it isn't possible they could have found everything there is to

right now yeah so one of them I say this as a Seventy one and all this out and they have to say like ... or ...\nMatter is very very very very\n\n\nJust took a long hair doesn't drudgery for during the break at what am I see what is the only the headline on the drudgery of all let me read it to her you're White House expands FBI problem is that what the hell is that so I clicked on the like\nHere's what it is [noise]\nMy formerly nicotine saving fingers in the New York times working in tandem with NBC News headline of White House tells FBI to interview any one necessary for Kevin inquiry and this is because of what they claim Trump said\nAt his press conference today where he's now I don't want to limit anything I said guys that that that that they run a fake news story NBC does claiming Trump is limiting the investigations and trials not that's fake nose\nSo then they've got it on record Trump not limiting investigate which means you can go on and on and on and on and now they're broadcasting and everywhere White House tells me I interview where they want to necessarily [noise]\nThat was right on schedule\nCNN reports that the Democrats are submitted a list of twenty four\nPeople they want the FBI to talk to\nThis after Fox News had an earlier today that the FBI is about to wrap up tomorrow\n[noise] this is gonna have to be shut down at some point this cannot go on all this is\nDelayed delayed delayed the way and I'm going to tell you what needs to happen\nThere is an assumption operating out there that needs to be shut down and that assumption is that the investigation that has taken place since Kavanaugh was named is somehow insufficient\nAs somehow incomplete somebody needs to stand up and say if the exact opposite that this is the seven now Trump has but somebody besides that needs to make the point\nThat this has been a thorough investigation that every last minute Jack in the box that's popped up here has been looked into and the effort has been made but there's only so much you can do with a woman who doesn't remember where or when what ever happened to her happen\nAnd there's only so much you can do when the people in the room she says we're their claim they weren't\n\nThis investigation somebody needs to stand up and vouch for it somebody needs to stand up and promoted\nIt needs to be spoken for\nThis has got to be stopped because the it's not real\nThe Democrats are allowed to make it up as they go submit names they want the FBI to talk to\nThey dug it investigations don't work that way FBI follows evidence leads at when they don't find anything I'm like Bob Mueller face stop\nMueller's been looking for collusion with Trump and Russia for two years in hasn't found any but he's still going and that's exactly what this is going to be if somebody doesn't stand up and stop this\nSomebody on the Senate Judiciary committee needs to stand up or Mitch McConnell needs to stand up and start vowed Jang for the investigation is taking place there are six separate FBI background checks and Brett Kavanaugh\nSomebody needs to speak up for him somebody needs to vouch for um somebody needs to stand up and say they haven't been thorough and they haven't found anything or you wouldn't be where he is now sitting on the DC circuit court of appeals\nBut that's not happening somehow weren't letting the media get away with the idea that the investigation here in the Kavanaugh has been half baked lukewarm and or incompetent\nBecause of Christine Blasey Ford coming around at the last minute with no evidence no cooperation and nothing yet she's credible cabinet is not\nSomebody look we had a caller earlier how do you stop a bully you smack them in the face somebody needs to stand up until the Democrats the shut the hell up that they've gotten everything they've asked for this thing and there just isn't anything there and they go home\nThe idea of this investigation is not thorough is incompetent is incomplete or has been Rand is absolute bogus another making things up the Trump is going to limit it he did no such thing\nBut he sure felt for the bait I Am not limited to thing I've told the FBI to take us wherever it\nTakes them promptly Democrats well here's Twenty one people we want you to talk to\n[noise]\nHave you called the FBI say there's there's some people in my town here really really screwing approach and I need to get something done about an IRS in when you go talk to them but it doesn't work that way does it\n\nLook rush rush this was the United States Senate clearly that can happen to know is that\n[laughter]\nAnd one of her thing you know one of the one of the movies I have recommended over the years that people rent they haven't seen that go watch it's called the lives of others and it's a movie about East Germany during the Cold War essentially how the government literally spied on every citizen\n\nThe German chancellor of the time was Irish hunter\nHe's the guy
