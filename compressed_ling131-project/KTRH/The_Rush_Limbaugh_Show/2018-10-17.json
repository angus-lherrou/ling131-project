and throw it in the trash and they were going hungry or middle school teachers pleading administrators pleading you don't understand the kids won't eat the food was horrible\nHorrible so what was better that they ate food with more calories than Michelle wanted or that they were calorie starved and yet refused to eat what was being offered\nYou know people don't always make the decisions that we would like them to make the question will be will we allow them to make the best decision for them\nWill we allow them to decide what they'll put into their body incest simple\nWill we allow parents to raise their children will will allow adults to make decisions for themselves\nOr do we know better than them\n[noise] the the trick do is to talk people into handing over power\nOver their

what you don't even know what you did yesterday I said well yeah I have a good memory and I I remember what I did know you don't know you don't remember what you did with your with your watch story I said you mean about the show ... said yeah I said well what do you mean\nYou blew up the entire intelligence community excuse or a story\nOr having evidence of how your shoulders died they were out there saying that there were probably going to get proof of his interrogation and murder because it does apple watching here you come blowing up the whole thing pointing out how it's technologically not possible\nYou blow it up and you didn't even know what I said well no because I wasn't aware of they were using the watch as that Central Asia at at elements\nProving their case but then when ... said this to me I have the pause I had to contemplate and then I have to consider he has a point\nBut it was one of these things I wasn't contemplating or calculating at the time I just know it's impossible there is no way that Jamal ... watch ...\nHave recorded anything can happen to women there's no way it couldn't have\n\nTransmitted or transferred it to his iPhone which was in the

last ... had entered the password for the consulate why do you find that work on his watch\nWhich I Know he didn't do because most people don't even know they have to do that most people don't even have a watch don't even know there and watch will work on why five most people think they got to have the phone right next to watch in Ninety nine percent of the time it right\nBut if you're a watch learns a wife and I work like at your home that your phone logs into regularly then the phone to watch can access that I find that work independently of the phone if you're not close together but only\nIf you have entered that why fi networks password into your watch\nWhy five settings [laughter] I Know that this guy didn't do that [noise] [noise] [noise]\nI myself didn't learn you had to do this until a couple of years after I got my first walk I mean that's how old's your a setting that it is anyway certainly since you just blew up\nYou blew up\nThe reason all these intelligence people were giving for knowing how he died you blow it up now they have to come up with something else\nAnd I said well I was totally unaware you say well you should be aware because they're mad at you [noise] nobody's supposed that they they say\nThe show was recorded the events of have to record on watching everybody will say well that's cool and then you come along and say no it's not possible\n[noise] another headline you probably have seen this so should've pressed Trump tells the a P he will not accept blame if the Republicans lose the house\n\nThe truth of the matter here is there are more stories today two or three more about the dissipating\nBlue wave including none other than they do I am\nA Democrat National Committee cheating and electric and bringing\nDown to Brazil\nWho strangely enough showed up on Fox that I showed up a bill hammer Donna Brazil did not go to CNN did they get rid of her because they found out she was sending answers to Hillary [noise] that's right so see and I got rid of Fox\nWillingly open our middle aged had done in Brazil on an hammer was asking are all about the blue wave and other Democrats are planning to do this and that's well you know twenty days is a long time in politics bill\nAnd I don't scramble my eggs before my chickens hatch I said who is listening to hear Dan Rather\nIdled scramble my eggs until mine chicken hatch she said naming there's so much she left it couldn't happen we don't know that could affect the outcome here\nExactly my point the impact of the election the events are they going to do that may not have happened including Kevin ... although although there\nIs even more survey data now that the Kavanaugh story was a one way benefit to the Republicans that it has not benefited the Democrats and the Democrats are seen as the angry party\nAnd that the Kavanaugh scenario as it played out benefited and continues to benefit Republicans\nHold a media is getting a little worried the Elizabeth Warren focus this thing blows up to the point they can't continue to carry the water for her it's dead\n\nBut rock Obama is refusing to hit the campaign trail the drive by Senate Democrats are stunned and shocked where is but rock where is our savior they're asking for Iraq's nowhere because you know what but rock knows he doesn't help people on the campaign trail\nHere think Obama's going to put his reputation on the line here the only way Obama wouldn't put his reputation on the line here start campaigning is if this blue wave weren't a\nDeadlock if the blue waiver why are you still hear me [noise] oh yeah I got a couple of stories Democrats something worse Obama they're asking where's Brock at least villain Hillary are going on a stadium tour nobody wants that\nThey can't find mama I'm telling you Obama is not going to GO Campaign and the situation because the blue wave is not a walk and that's the only way he would show up for Rocco mama doesn't help Democrats go take a look he doesn't have a coat tails\nIt's during Obama the Democrats lost those twelve hundred seats and in right he campaigned for Hillary\nTwo thousand sixteen remember how he did it do you want a third term\nOf mud ... if you want me since we continue you know did you vote for Hillary at what happened I\nDidn't know the Trump was the match it late at night Hillary Rodham running them\nAnd so he's not there\nSo it's all falling apart and these two or three stories here on this on this dissipating blue wave and Donald Brazil's Enron now I'm not sure you know it's a long time twenty days\n\nSo the a P pulling out all the stops Trump tells a piece he won't accept blame a GOP loses this is not what he said and this is why Trump is in the media all day it's the only way he can counter the fake news in the lives that they tell about it\nHere's how the story begins facing the prospect of bruising electoral defeat in congressional elections president Donald horse faced Trump said Tuesday that he will not accept the blame if his party loses control of the house in November and a wide ranging\nIn is there any other kinds of interviews and wide ranging\nYou think that's not a cut and paste job in every media is how about a narrow scope interview we ever had one of those [noise] [noise] no they're always in a wide ranging interview with three weeks before election day Trump dismiss suggestions\nThat he might take responsibility as his predecessor to Denver midterm losses or beauty outcome as a referendum on his presidency said no I think I'm helping people\nI don't believe anybody has ever had this kind of in fact that's what he said he never said don't blame me\n\nAnd I read the transcript of the interview this is CNN's transcript of the AP interview and their headline Trump tells a piece he won't accept blame a GOP loses house ready [noise] three to\nOne\nA pie reporter okay so my question is if Republicans willing to lose control of the house in November sixth or a couple of days later depending on how long it takes count the votes do you believe that you'll bear some responsibility for that no I think I'm helping people\nLook I'm forty eight and one in the primaries actually it's much higher than that because I endorsed a lot of people that were successful\nThat people don't even talk about but many of those forty eight hours you know where people that had no chance in some cases we look at Florida you look at Donovan in Staten Island he was losing by ten points I endorsed him he won I can give you a long list of names\nLook at Georgia governor many many races and I will say that we have a very big impact I don't believe anybody's ever had this kind of impact that I'm having they would say\nThat in the old days and if you got the support of a president or if you got the support or somebody it would be nice to have but it meant nothing zero like literally zero\nWell some of the people live indoors to have gone up forty and fifty points just

Trump's Foley election by shooting including what the Russians [laughter]\n[noise] and when this story broke that Muller is not going to deliver a key findings adult after the election you man Jimmy anger and the frustration not so much with elected Democrats 'cause they know the they know the game here but they're there and look to take\nThe reins psychologically screwed up base\nIs probably beside itself because this is really ballgame for this is what they have been counting on they haven't been\nThey've bought it they drank the Kool Aid that Mueller has the goods that Trump treated with Russia mother has got it he's going to announce it trumps finished after them in terms wait a minute why\nNow there are two things about this books\nThe rules of this game which are going to be a baby here\nInclude that air report such as this from a special counsel will not be released\nWithin this close proximity to mid term elections it's an unstated rural India is a it it's an establishment or deep state rural and frankly I'm I'm surprised that it survived\nI Would not have been surprise surprise to me it's a it's a it's one of these unwritten rules of gentlemanly Washington procedure\nThat a bombshell report if any nature will be held until after the elections I thought that would blow up I thought that they would somehow find a way to release this thing wrong if not that leak it if it's got things in it that they like\nWhich the ladder is still possible\n\nSo Mueller and his buddies in the drive by media rather than break the rules and released a report prior to the election\nThey're going to do the next best thing they're going to start talking about it all the time such as this story Muller ready to deliver key findings in his Trump probe sources say\nSo each day we're going to get references to the fact that ... Don rollers wrap it up his mother is gonna be releasing at\nAny moment they're going to be talking about\nBefore the midterms in hopes in the hopes this is what they're hoping they're hoping that the acknowledgement that Mueller's report is done we'll be perceived by voters as the proof that Trump's do the election\nIs imminent that is what they're hoping they're hoping that you and well I don't think they think you're going to fall for it but they are hoping that the great on washed up near the ill educated under educated on educated miss educated are going to believe\nThat it's only a matter of time before this report is made public proving that Trump colluded with Russia\nAnd that will then influenced the way they vote that means they will vote Democrat that's what the effort here is they will create this cloud of suspicion this cloud of danger that port\nHandles disaster for Trump they'll reference this each day leading up to the mid term elections\nAnd you'll hear people in the media speculate oh it could be Trump will be removed after the midterms\nWhen mullet releases this report it could well be Trump's going to have to be removed to report might all of this is going to happen to one degree or another to second thing\n\nThis tells me is that Mueller himself is waiving just see who will be running Congress before he decides to really in\nThis because his report goes to Rosenstein\nWho is technically his bosses at the department of justice and to Congress and there is deciding whether or not\nOut there for for my when does your support for Trump again during the campaign OK okay or the campaign and one of the reasons that I think\nDuring the primaries are during the day after he won the nomination\nPrimary primary okay against a seven anyway he um [noise] I became a Trump supporter one reason was because she's got to be so good for the country and he is and I'm ashamed that Democrat my whole life that these people aren't happy to see the country doing well\nThat's what amazes me the most I mean I was always brought up the Democrats for fair and my dad was a Democrat my mom and that they sort of the country\nWhat you thought the Democrats for for the little guy looking out for the little guy in trying to help the little guy make it economically and overcome obstacles Republicans wasn't away\nExactly and so so I'm very proud to be a Trump supporter but I'm about to pack it in I'm going to tell you why frustration is so high right now for not only myself if you put in a neighborhood because she said it before with Stuart gardening um he said the Trump ...\nAnd he says is the only reason the only way I can get my message out well his tweets are good but not that many people really here and I can understand why he is not addressed the nation I don't understand [noise]\nWait a minute when you say when you say packing it and you mean you're about to abandon from\nThat advantage Trump but I'm really losing a lot of energy in frustration I really am because so many people don't know the good things that are happening they're not gonna learn preaching to the choir which ... most of the time and a press conference ... they skew anyway\nSo if he addresses the nation and he should he should be proud of what he said this is the greatest time economically that I can ever remember it I'm sixty six I can never remember anything like this\nIt is amazing in it but you know you said something here very by I Want to I Want to circle back to something you said an observation you've made of the modern day Democratic Party that they don't\nSeem to be happy right now the country's doing well they don't they don't seem to be encouraged or want to be included in it they don't want to even try to get some of the credit for the country doing well in that shocks you write\nYou know not anymore it's a ... year and a half ago but I'm starting to realize they don't care about the country they really don't care about social issues they care about taking this guy down who I think the strongest guy since Reagan I've ever seen\nHow we can take the bullets day after day I mean he's ... guy\nYour frustration is noted and I think it's shared by a lot of people what you're you're really\nYou you made it sound like your frustration is with us from because he won't do a national address and try to reach people that his tweets don't read your audience that he that he doesn't reach but your real frustration with the U.S is with a news media and many people in the same boat\nWho were doing their best to hide all of that and make sure people don't know it's\nIt's a joke amazed the frustration I've never been so frustrated in my life I Can't ... it ... me that was me out of the country so it was so well and so many people are going to go out and vote and they have no idea newscast and they\nWhy do you think you are well why do you think you're one of the few people that led realize how great the country's doing if you think about why why do you think more people\nHave listened to you if they raised\nTheir but the economy you you said you've never seen anything like this in your life you don't need me to tell you the economy's doing well you see this on your own\nThree point seven unemployment are you kidding me with all the jobs and all of them a wage is going up or might never seen anything\nMy point is I think you can be a little confidence that you're not alone in seeing all of this and that more people are aware of it then you may know\nAnd of course you can be a it'd be understandable if you fear people don't know because the media is doing everything they can to hide it or even worse lie about it\nAnd you are of the impression that most people get their knowledge information from the media but\nI think what happened with a lizard with Warren here they could not carry this October surprise they could not cover for the fact that she's bogus they used to be able to do that they're not able to there's a reason for that and I think it's also helping get the truth out about Trump's achievement\nWe take a break for that has to have much to say it\nIt's probably ... be met

mean the bias well there's that but that it's it's it's more than that it's about ruining people it's about targeting and destroying people how do you think resumes are built\nJournalist ... little medium size markets are small markets don't target somebody and they if they run a profile or or on a piece on somebody\nThat can be made to look accurate that nails them as guilty of this transgression or that transgression particularly against the little people in that report or is going to get noticed and that's how that's how that reporter climbs latte if you go back to the early days of sixty minutes it was all about that\n\nAnd it remains so today it's just\nIt's it's evolved to adapt to the current climate which the only person they want to destroy the day now is Donald Trump and any Republican who gets in the way like Kevin on it's all about destroying people the thing about this series is it makes no one's about it\nI I don't recognize the names of the writer or writers I don't\nRecognize the stars and I've never seen them in and things for [noise] I don't recognize the names of the producers and I haven't taken the time to Google any of them but I watched this\nI've seen two episodes so far out of the ...\nAnd I catch myself my mouth is wide open it's agape a couple of times watching this thing at how brave in early on is this is one of the the editor the head of ... of the of the tabloid paper is one of the most is fixable human beings I've ever seen portrayed\nWho is not set up as a criminal who's not establish he's he's just two years and he is totally on affected by life\nTo him every body is a bad guy you just have to find out why his favorite his philosophy in life\nAnd the way he guides us journalist is the world has no solutions I'll stop what what if that were your world view of the world has no solutions\nAnd he's telling you it's not your job to fix things it's not your job to feel bad about who you destroy it's not your job they're trying to solve problems because the world is not about solutions it's your job to sell this paper it's your job he the one episode\n\nWent to great lengths to show how this this sleaze editor\nWho has some kind of a secret relationship with the prime minister the u._k. no no no no not sexual just up there that they have some kind of a relationship not pretending like each other but they owe each other from way back before the series began\nAnd the editor\nRanges a cover story about appear to file and then puts a picture of the prime minister on the cover with his his picture only an inch away from the word ...\n\nYet the story is not about the prime minister being Pete if I was about somebody else the prime minister is limited and outrage calls the guy in in the editor says you don't run me you don't control me and it was a mistake I I'm Sorry well then you wish you want to ... I'm not apologizing for anything you don't like it live with it\n\nAnd the private ... I didn't want to do the story in the first place I didn't want to pursue the pictures the editor says you did I mean this guy has no empathy or feeling for anybody\nHe doesn't [noise]\nIt's just it's quite it's it's perfect if the kind of personality you wouldn't have to be if your job is destroying people\nNo conscience\nThe belief that everybody is flawed that everybody's a dirt bag that everybody is a rapper ... and at some point their time to be called out is going to happen\n\nNobody's decent nobody is white [laughter] it's amazing how this in the eyes of a journalist an editor\n\nNow I imagine real journalist I gotta look at this thing some of them are going to marvel at it and think it's wonderful others are going to have it because it's\nIt exposes too much uh\nPeople have never had encounters with reporters have never been targets I don't know how they're going to react to it other than the entertained by it it it starts kind of slow but it picks up speed\nOr\nMany of the primary characters are women\n\nThe competing editor of the clean paper the above board and paper is a woman who gets out smarter than tricked into not publishing one day because she can't confirmed the pita file story while the other paper puts it on the cover having confirmed it\nBecause the editor at the other ... doesn't care whether it's true or not wondering calls they got as Peter found just get it up there and get it on the news ... whereas the female editor didn't have the guts\nStill run it and sell the paper doesn't rot and I'm thinking\nThey obviously are not worried about me too movement here ever put the same thing I said the name up in his press I have no idea it's it's I think it it just completed airing\n'cause I've got all six of them so I just competed completed it's um it's run cycle in the u._k. which means it's going to be on Netflix\nAmazon Prime wherever and I don't know where it's going to be but it won't be long and if you remember me talking about it here and if you watch these kinds of things\nIt's it's fascinating 'cause it's not about politics not about current but it's not about Trump it's not about conservatives liberals any of that if they had some bad hit everybody everybody as a rubber Bates including the people at the papers\nThe reporters [noise] um\nI I have to admit I was so [noise] anyway here's Donald Brazil now I was I did not lose my play she's ... bill hammered a day and they're talking about the blue wave where she thinks we're headed\nAnd remember now this is a woman that used to be one of the head honcho those are the DNC the Democratic party who in hurting normal countenance would be out there so oh yeah boy way Democrat's gonna win ... gets it's our time people are

fact Trump's approval rating is now higher than our time with\nThree of the past six presidents at the same point in their first terms he is currently tied with Obama at forty four percent he's above Clinton at forty one percent Reagan at forty two percent at this time in his presidency\nBut there's a broader point here Democrats in the media keep describing Trump as a hugely\nDivisive figure but the polls show that his approval is starting to line up with previous presidents and what's more ... low numbers are almost entirely because Democrats are universally opposed to win another poll quote\nAt this point in Obama's presidency ten percent of Republicans approved for the job he was doing and that was after the failed pork you was\nIt was after the signing of Obamacare in after the signing of Dodd Frank and other policies highly antagonistic to Republicans Trump on the other hand\nGets approval from only five percent of Republicans and that's where it's been throughout his presidency so Republicans in other words were far more forgiving of Obama the Democrats have been if Trump\nSo who actually is being divisive\nCrumbled the GOP or the Democrats who will hate Trump no
