kick a bunch\nOf people off welfare that we all agree are able bodied Americans [laughter] we can't unify there\nIf you did that Democrats would lose elections worse than they already do number one\nHow about we unify over the fact that we simply enforce the laws on the book with regard to immigration\nIf they're bad last let's change 'em can't change them because the American public wants those rules and effect so they break the rules that's how they get around it we have a limited enforcement up\nWell let let's all agree that we will strictly enforce our immigration okay maybe we're not all on the same\nPage here [noise] I Will say this I think that reducing the size of the welfare state would deter some level of illegal immigration I also think it would be it\nGood fiscal

the implication is that people in Trump's base are just teetering on the verge of sanity and Trump knows that and he's trying to send your over the edge with this stuff to make sure you're go vote it's again\nA classic expression or illustration of how they haven't the slightest idea who the people are just voted for Donald Trump who remain supportive of Donald Trump [noise]\nBut back we'll get to get more details that I ... back to my little test so I read of these people at the event last night it's going to be a red wave Russia and listen to you every day and I'm telling you it's going to be a red white but I said I Hope you're right but let me\nLet me tell you what we're up against forty five Republicans have announced their resignations forty five I mean that is a huge number many of them are\nCommittee chairmen not all but many of them are committee chairman and they are resigning are retiring because they don't want to go back to being shown\nYou know just regular house members it's a it's a big come down so they want to try to parlay their years in the house\nInto private sector success I spent forty five seats incumbency has has incredible power\nReelection power certainly old back me up on those these are students the incumbent in house races windows Ninety eight percent of the time well we've got forty five Republicans who are not incumbents we've got forty five Republicans would never run before\nNobody knows I mean there are districts they're known but they're not as known as incumbents are known as well known so that that makes some of this somewhat iffy\nI and and then there is the traditional statistical aspect which says that the party that\nHolds the White House in the first mint terms after a presidential election all ways loses seats so forty five seats they cave and\nTough to defend\nAs opposed to if those forty five had not resign and we're still in the house you can count on a lot of those is reelect that you can't count now Israel legs and this is what the left in the dry buys are counting on\nIs that many of those forty five of flip\nAnd then you've got a contest of all races are in in other parts Senate of course another thing now I mentioned this to all of these people they didn't care and they said they're aware of this they knew about the resign\nResigning members of Congress retiring they ... they didn't know the number not all of 'em did\nBut their attitude was that it doesn't matter it doesn't matter uh the American people are fed up and they are sophisticated\nAnd the people who are elected Trump know exactly what's at stake they're not going to send home they're not gonna twiddling their thumbs they're not confident they're not sitting there thinking that job was done when they went and voted in two thousand sixty and it was kind of pleasant to um\nTo what the here although there was a lot of emotion and I'm like I Can't deny that night interestingly I ran across a piece today at a website called America dot com and it's by Dr Gerard Francisco slum arrow expert on the forecast models [noise]\nUm I'm not familiar with his work by his headline is ran wave coming in the house and the Senate\n\nMy forecast for the twenty H in congressional elections he says there will be a conservative red wave in the house with two hundred and twenty five a two hundred and twenty eight Republicans elected\nTo office and in the Senate with fifty eight to sixty Republicans elected to office let's look at some of the reasons that went into my forecast Dr Merrill rights\nAs you remember from my book great news for [laughter]\nWhen my mother my great book grading the presidential election of two thousand sixteen was both an historic and critical election that ushered in a new American constitutional era that I called the conservative era long range trans as well as short range trends came together to cause a fundamental shift\nIn ah in each of our two major political parties in addition the other major changes took places well those were predicted unexplained\nUh in addition to lower Democrat voter intensity among democratic voters Democrats have another major problem there are movements of democratic voters that are abandoning their party and voting for conservatives\n\nAnd it's all being ignored he says by the drive by media these free movements of democratic voters abandoning their party are the walk away movement the reading\nPill movements and the great awakening movement and he goes on to describe what these what these are I've I'm no I'm unfamiliar with the red fill a movement but\n... says he's got eight productions here that'll happen in the near future and they appear to be happening as we approach the mid term elections\nWe've witnessed a series of fall surprises including the capital hearings October surprises caravan of crisis mail bombs to some Democrats synagogue mass shooting we've seen outstanding economy tempered by considerable volatility a Wall Street we have seen extreme by it but that's another thing you know what the consumer confidence numbers are over the top\n\nConference board consumer confidence numbers over the top these numbers are not the kind of numbers you see in an electorate that's unhappy and angry and looking for radical change\nAt least that has been the case or in in the past question comes down to just how important a factor is\n\nThe economy in elections of um [noise] candidates in this in this climate or the drive\nBy with like you to believe the economy doesn't matter hill of beans but they always say that when the economy is going great with Republican administrations ah the effort to give credit to Obama the attempt by Obama to take credit for the economy however would argue that Democrats and the media think it is a problem\n[noise] there's talk all over ... that Hollywood leftist are promising blood in the streets if Democrats do not win the house\n\nAnyway back to our production here from this doctor Dr Gerard Francisco alum arrow what has been the impact of these false surprises and the other events this is his personal thinking and again these these events these false surprises he\nCalls them we call them October surprises the Kavanaugh hearings that was that we know what that was the I mean that was totally trumped up made up charges to derail Trump's Supreme Court nominee along the way it toward the railing Trump\nOr we have the October surprises the usual the caravan of crisis mail bomb so some Democrats synagogue mass shooting what's what's been the impact of these false surprises and other events\nWyo intended to hurt President Trump and keep Republicans from holding the house\nAll of the above surprises in advance have worked to enhance the conservative\nRed wave according to this guy instead of creating or building a blue wave of the red wave continues Republican voter intensity exceeds the much heralded\nBlue wave you by the way this is your what a blue wave would be what we need to properly defined a blue wave would mean the Democrats win everything they take back the Senate they'd take back the house by a large number if the Democrats win the house by two or three seats for and that's not that's not a blue wave\nA blue wave means a massive massive realignment and it doesn't look possible they're gonna they're going to win the Senate if they don't win the Senate there isn't any blue wave I'm Talking about unreality not in terms of media lingo they'll call us whenever they want\nIf they emerge victorious but all of these events were designed to cause this blue wave weren't designed to create this massive voter intensity and the turnout\nBy Democrats and even now in the early voting Republican turnout is much larger than democratic turnout unheralded that's unprecedented Republicans seldom show up this while in early\nVoting it's hard to explain it away but the conclusion is it there has been no blue way there is not even been a blue ripple that you might even say there hasn't been a blue drip\nSome blow bubbles are bursting recall the blow bubbles are areas of blue support logs\nOur families are quite south

Dan in Manchester, Connecticut welcome sir great to have you here\nThat could rush I wanted to thank you for telling people about the truth intent of sexual on an amendment fourteen because I've been trying to do the same thing for years and people aren't in the midst impression that it simply means if a child born to illegal aliens in this country automatically becomes an American citizen\nYou can't blame 'em it's been the case since the sixties and it's it's it's a\n... ... ... it it it it's ... we're we're dealing with mass ill education that's taking place on a lot of things in this country that's why it's so important that we've got a president willing to push back on it yet right what's causing this is causing any discussion of it this is how it happens\nI've told everybody that this is what pushing back is going to look like so\nWhat you were talking about Dred Scott as a reason why the fourteenth amendment was ratified which was actually on July night they teach sixty eight but\nAnother reason why it was ratified is because it goes back to the thirteenth amendment that abolish slavery or the southern states weren't going to accept that so they passed laws are ... that were so restrictive the plaques that it's actually made them slaves once again and they were called the black codes so then Congress said okay you want to play that game\nThat we're going to formally recognize former slaves of citizens which will make them subject to all the privileges or immunities to the citizens in several strays ... article for section two claws one\nSo after that the dose black folks were abolished and that's why we have a ... you know the fourteenth amendment\nAnd matter of fact you know the one of the ... the the guy is considered the founding father to the fourteenth amendment was represented by the name of John ... from Ohio\nAnd he made some remarks about the fourteenth amendment if you're a few years later and you can find that in a house reporting number twenty two dated Eighteen Seventy one January thirtieth\nSo it all explains how this joint committee passed the fourteenth amendment so President Trump with all due respect to him he wouldn't be not be ending birthright citizenship because it never happened he would be upholding the U.S constitution\nWell that's the point that is exactly the point that I made is why he should do this and that's his point\nPeople have looked into this may have found different rationale than you did but the point is if you look at the original intent of people who were involved in writing the fourteenth amendment all Trump is doing is enforcing the constitution and taking it back to its original intent the fourteenth amendment was never intended\nTo confer citizenship on people here illegally or the sons and daughters of ambassadors are foreign agents it was expressly\nWritten looking first citizenship on slaves and now it has been expanded and again that you can trace it back to the Nineteen sixties\nWhen this began which coincides with the Democratic party wanting to re open immigration you know I I still run into people who do not believe me when I tell them\nThat as a nation we suspended for the most part I mean ... there's always been\nA people being rapid citizenship but we suspended mass immigration from the Mets\nNineteen twenties to the mid sixties pretty express reason of allowing all of those who would emigrated starting in the late Eighteen hundreds all the way through the Nineteen twenties to assimilate\nThat's what immigration was people were coming here to become Americans and they wanted to be Americans\nThey didn't have to give up their birthright they didn't happen and they they settled in uh in neighborhoods\nAre Irish had their neighborhoods in New York and Philadelphia the Italians ... ditto but they wanted to become Americans they learned English uh and they became part of American culture at ... of which there is a distinct in unique American culture which is rooted in western civilization\nThat's what's different now there is no interested in that [noise] we don't even make a serious effort at assimilating we're Balkan icing\nIf they use this term tribal but we're Balkan icing our population because modern arrivals don't all seek to become Americans people trying to get them on the on the legal immigration side of course are\nBut this this mass illegal immigration has an entirely different purpose behind it and political support is entirely different for it then for standard uh immigration so what Trump is doing is simply with his executive order if he does this\nWill be re establishing the constitution or re asserting it so yeah no you're exactly right about that so two calls to great points that the guy who from Pittsburgh who asked a question he lives there and he watches the news and he's been blamed\nFor the Senate God surely [noise]\nWe've got to tone it down and we are going to come together and we got to do this we've got to do that\nAnd if it's being set up that's being said in the media you know it's all aimed at Trump and his supporters appreciate the call again Southampton in New York build your next great to have you with us or Hi\nThank you Russian thanks for all that you do for us yes you ... ... with the ...\nUm with regard to the fourteenth amendment why not take it to the Supreme Court or is that where this is going to end up actually show that they can decide\nOh it'll be their language says it'll get there and I'll get there okay yeah it'll\nIt'll have to get there that no Senator Graham is going to offer legislation that in the Senate ah [laughter] look we're way way far away from\nThis we're just getting the conversation started here which has to happen\nThere there there needs to be a pretty big re education of the American population in general on the whole subject of immigration and so Trump and his\nUh maybe long term a economic relief for any nation having problem is a greater does that capitalism but there isn't the political climate for that and many of these countries there their dictatorships one degree or another\nAnd\nThis is an immediate problem that's going to have to be dealt because if it's not they're just going to keep coming and it's\n...

understand that and the fact that they make no effort to understand it or understand Trump and his motors is what's largely doing them in\nThey never understood that you already believe what you

were talking about with your friends and that's why you're glom onto what not because you were sitting out there in your relative ignorance day in and out all of a sudden started learning things so the presumption is that you're so stupid and you're so mindless\nThat's been ... can tell you how do you think or tell you when they go start blowing things up or window started shooting people\nAnd now we've even got never Trump conservatives or out saying this kind of thing\nAnd it all boils down to you know what I keep the essence of things that keeps\nWorries they're real anger at directed at you think it's Trump and it is but the real anger is for you who voted for him\nThat is where they are fed up beyond their ability to express it and the fact that they can't talk you out of supporting Trump there to be tied\nYours the reason that this was all going because you have the stupidity of voting for the guy and now you're blowing things up and you're shooting people\nJust deeply darkly

I'm In the last two callers have been speaking a mile a minute and I've been unable to hear enough of what they were saying [noise]\nTo comprehend so I had to put it together after they hung up the most recent caller\nI lost her when she was how families will gas light a the weakest number of the family I've I've never seen that so I'm rolling it back and forth on my head but then I finally heard when she was talking about her definition gas light\nA I got ... her point was that the Democrats the media and get to define everything\nThey get to define that get to decide everything what they say is is what is it anybody isn't that then of course as abnormal or want to have it and that that that has been my point is is a different way of saying that\nIt irritates the hell out of me too I watch the media that my my favorite example of it and I'm Sorry for being redundant here Indiana and there are countless examples here Indiana passed a religious freedom Restoration Act the media hated it it was in response\nTo people not being allowed to tell gay couples no I'm not going to make a cake for your reception I my religion doesn't allow me to do that so these gay couples but then they would target these places hoping for that reaction and they filed lawsuits trying to put these bakeries and photo shop businesses out of business\nAnd the media would come right along and act like that was entirely justified\nThat these big it would refuse to bake a cake or take photos at a gay wedding reception or what have you uh so when someone when when Indiana passes along Pence has the governor the media was outraged and they began\nTo report on this as ... whole country was outraged that Indiana was somehow a loan out post of racism and bigotry and homophobia\nAnd it's this this this\nAttitude and all things that they do wear what they report in the way they reported what they say is what is normal and they get to decide who the big gets are and who the uh the racists are and once that happens your tag you're it\nAnd then they ran around and they started knocking on doors asking businesses\nWould you bake a pizza when you when you make a pizza for ... and they found a little girl Twenty one year old woman\nA running a pizza shop for her family you know we wouldn't it would be against the salt they zeroed in on this one a one year old woman and they wanted to make her out\nBe the typical Indiana Mitt and she was just answering their questions naive really an innocence\nShe was just trying to be honest with them she bought that they were really interested in what\nThey were asking about they were looking for a victim they were looking for a target and she fit the bill and so for however long the reporting of that went on Indiana was odd the people in it are odd weird racists bigots sexist ...\nI Know exactly what the caller Mitt Democrats get to decide well let me tell you something folks\nNot true anymore that may be the way they report it and they met that may be what they try to create but\nPeople rebelled against they've called Donald Trump people rebelled against that the Democrats since Obama had been losing elections don't lose sight of this starting in two thousand ten the Democrats have lost over a thousand maybe it's closer to twelve hundred electoral\nSeats at federal state local level and there's a reason for this they are being rejected and the media is being rejected as as well and sell gas if if if what the media dead due\nTo the state of Indiana is gas lighting is if that's what the definition is now heartily endorse it and ah and accepted and it's this\nArrogance and just the primacy of superiority that goes along with that kind of coverage and it's it's everywhere it's\nYou have a the synagogue shooting ... obvious the obvious explanation is that Donald Trump and his conservative media posse are radicalizing and this becomes the narrative this becomes just the way it is I mean everybody thinks this\nIs is crucial for the maybe the weather report these things to make it look like they are the majority and they are what's normal went increasingly they aren't and what really is happening here is that people who know they're not by definition\nSpic numbers normal are trying to turn everything upside down so that what they are is normal and what everybody else is is the one that's odd ball abnormal the media's right in their facilitating this I'm telling you\nIt isn't it used to work like a charm\nAnd on many people still does we still have a lot of people in our side still want to couch how the media still wanted to find whether or not conservatives or Republicans are succeeding by virtue of one of the media as being nice to them or not it's frustrating to know when when I run into people like that and they're out there\nBut the\nElectoral results just in the past two years ah indicate that people are more and more aware of this and pushing back\nAgainst that uh to see what
