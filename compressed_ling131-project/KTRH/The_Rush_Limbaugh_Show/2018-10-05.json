and Susan Collins\nI think they have\nTo be credited for doing the right thing they are both facing enormous pressures\nFlake is getting pressure like you can't believe for not only members of the pain\nProfessional mob squad on the left but other Democrats are in the Senate and on the Judiciary Committee\nAnd\nI don't think for for as far as flake is concerned he voted today for\nKavanaugh in us it's not technically a vote for Kavanaugh to vote to go to a final vote\nAnd the rule of thumb always is that as these procedural votes goes so goes the final vote but but but you can't make book on that simply because of the abject real frightening threat to these people are getting\nAnd I think the vote for flake today was really hard I'll tell you why he went from being a yes vote to being harassed on the elevator\nTo becoming a yes vote with the FBI investigation they got what he wanted and they're still leaning on him he's leaving the Senate this was his final term\nOr the easy thing to do here would be to vote against Kavanaugh and receive the praise of the mob and receive the praise of the Democrats and he went ahead and he voted\nIn what many of us think is the right way he did the right thing is going to be attacked vicious late he is going to be a cost and by the left all the way through the rest of the day tonight and tomorrow\nThe same thing with Susan Collins a senator

announced that she's going to make a statement after three o'clock today\n\nOf course everybody's on pins and needles wondering what that's going to be now they're thinking on this goes that that there is no way she wouldn't vote yes on the procedural vote this morning\nIf for intention is to vote no down the road if you're going to kill the nomination do it now not tomorrow I don't think any

and there's a poll out here today this from the Daily Caller de Paul is a buzzfeed news thirty one percent of millennials identify as democratic socialist according to a study that has been taking a [noise]\nYou know you'd like to not believe this by the facts on the grounds as to what you see\nEven though maybe anecdotal evidence indicates that a lot of them have fallen for this millennial men were far more likely to identify as some kind of socialist and women a total of forty percent responding affirmative late to the question now how would that help can that be\nBecause there is one thing or something just doesn't jibe with socialism you know what it is self reliance\nSelf reliance taking yourself seriously standing up for yourself believing in yourself relying on yourself\nBeing a man just does not jibe with socialism socialism does not work well with self reliant people socialism and communism attempt to her race self reliant people self reliant people people that do not need do not depend\nOn anybody but themselves their immediate circle are a huge threat\nTo social is in Congress or how the hell is this happened\nHow is it forty percent of millennial men have become socialist more than women it ought to be the exact opposite\n\nWell hello modern era feminism\nWhich has had as one of its targets that the masculine as they should have men and they've been very open and honest about that they've even conjure up terms for it toxic masculinity\nDangerous masculinity they are doing their best to erase mailed natural male characteristics\nFor as many young guys as they can and since guys want to power around with women whatever women want is what many end up doing on balance I mean you have individual exceptions of course\nYou got Clint Eastwood's or you've got

say they're reading it or try to become conversant and it\nJust the nature of things and so they're being highly highly successful and targeting America and its founding\nNot just targeting capitalism it's targeting the concepts of individual liberty and freedom and targeting\nConcept that government is the institution that needs to be limited most in a representative republic than the emphasis of

on trying to get somebody to handle a polygraph\nProbably yeah that's another story by the way the boyfriends letter has yet to be reported in\nMainstream media nor has the story of Monica McLean pressuring Wheelan Kaiser to change your test of those two stories have not been reported ABC CBS NBC Washington Post New York times Associated Press people have not heard either a ...\nAnd there's

Ford wrote the letter that's where she was she was an ... a Delaware with McLean yeah\nHere's my question there's there's an emerging picture that there might be a lot going on but beyond that behind the scenes here that hasn't come out yet I I'm Wondering if not is it is the Democratic oddly enough or not better off holding this vote now for more of this comes out\nIt's going to go through at the last minute change one of the people that things are going to vote changes it was certainly it goes down and a quarter and then because all this is about to come out\nNo it's not about to come out that's the whole point you know it but it's not going to come out it hasn't come out yet it's not going to come out now one thing it has the lead when Kaiser a pressure to change your testimony that

about anyway that's up to McConnell a turtle ...\nWell the question is why when Republicans make make a greater effort for it to come out\nWhy would have made reference to ... uh uh\n[noise] uh it's in the FBI report and Republicans and Democrats can see it it's the the the Monica McLean aspect is in the FBI report\nThey discovered it let's\nCombine knowledge none of the senator grassroots so forth are not mentioned what we were just talking about no\nNo they're not I can't tell you why they're not mentioning\nOkay thank you you bet I'm Wondering myself um well\nI Know your questions are entirely legitimate and they're rooted in pure commonsense\nYou're sitting there thinking if the world know this it would change everything it shows that the ... the foreign side is willing\nTo commit perjury ... born in perjury pressure witnesses to change their stories which then couldn't be sad to conclude that there's not anything that ball Z Ford is saying it's reliable\nBut those two stories have not been seen by the American public at large they've not shown up at Yahoo News the Associated Press New York Times CBS NBC CNN and they want\nFor ... reason the stories are being suppressed but

in the Supreme Court nomination\n\nLisa Murkowski Republican Alaska voted today just stand with Diane Feinstein Cory Booker Kamala Harris to leave judge Brett Kavanaugh subject to claims of perjury and the impeachment which they're going to pursue by the way [noise] [noise] oh yeah or\nDoing [noise] the other interesting thing has other new develop it here but hang on to a second here's a second tweet from Kimberly Russell\n\nLisa Murkowski Republican Alaska\nToday voted to abandon due process and the presumption of innocence she voted to potentially only if the Supreme Court and a four Ford that block\nWhich puts loaning Ninth Circuit court of appeals in control of everything that matters to Alaska her state development property rights gun rights environmental rules\nLisa Murkowski has made quite the statement\n\nThese are two ... devastating tweets as they are right on the money legitimizing and signing off on the most despicable tactics ever standing with Feinstein Cory Booker Kamala Harris who is in a class by herself\nIn men dashed city and in a number of other things just just [noise] not much redeeming there\nBut more importantly Lisa Murkowski has voted to leave Kavanaugh's subject to claims of perjury and impeachment\nAnd then leaving the court if he has not confirmed accord stays up for foreign deadlock what the what the reason that matters is that in a ... ... if the court votes for four on any case then the decision prior to the court hearing is affirmed nothing changes\nAnd that means that the Ninth Circuit court of appeals wouldn't be the highest ranking courts\nThat could make decisions\nRegarding fundamental aspects of life in Alaska her own home state\nIt is it would be ...\nTo put the night if you're a Republican and by the way she does believe in property rights and development and gun rights and to put the Ninth Circuit court of appeals in a bunch of left us in charge of those issues in her state there's this shooting herself in the foot\nAll just supposedly be in unison\nWith nothing me too movement\n[noise] so I mentioned we had a couple of photos\nOf Dianne Feinstein looks like she has cornered Murkowski\nI don't know when the photos were taken presumably they are recent we can find out we just have check Feinstein's wardrobe on a particular day of hearings\nBut go ahead and Scott put it in the sweat you're for those of you I'm watching the dental ... there is a picture and stand by 'cause we have a close up there is a picture of Dianne Feinstein literally when Lisa Murkowski up against a wall in a hallway of a Senate office building\nAnd\nThey are chatting with each other and Murkowski has a hand look on her face Feinstein looks like she is\nWell the picture speaks for itself it it it it was that hand up she got a cornered she got her hand up on the wall framing Murkowski\nIt's an aggressive move it allows Feinstein leaning in to Murkowski\nNow let's switch to the close up of that photo for those will be watching on the general camp do you see\nThe pain the expression on the face of Murkowski and the expression of in hand seriousness and you better be listening to me on the face of diet for\nNow we'll have these photos up at Rush Limbaugh dot com to I'm not trying to leave it buddy out but I Want to you watching on the digital camera and be able to see the is that's that close up as the same shot\nJust to close up of the previous slave televised photo is that right\nWell done here looking here says why Feinstein sure does look like a bully and Murkowski looks very uncomfortable does she not\nI mean it's it's been really pained look on her face\nAnd it it looks like Feinstein is running this relationship it looks like Feinstein is giving her what for\n[noise] [noise] I don't know when the picture was taken and I will acknowledge that our interpretation could be wrong\nWe we have no context here other than the hearings and the way this has been going\nWell I wouldn't call that

is the marsh show Washburn story or race uh let's see [noise] Marsha Blackburn I'm Sorry Marsha Blackburn a story her opponent is Phil Bredesen\nAnd\nBreathe is and\nSaying that he is disgusting and that if he was in the Senate he wouldn't vote to confirm Kavanaugh he's a Democrat running against the incumbent Marsha Blackburn what is a Democrat and doing saying that he would vote to\nConfirm Kavanaugh this is ... this was in the middle of a campaign here\nNow I Know what to Tennessee and it's deep red that'll just wants to win and so forth but this\nHe expects this to pay off for him in his campaign this is obviously a reaction and reflection of public sentiment for Kavanaugh\nIn the state of Tennessee Phil Bredesen is by the way starting to losing ground to Marsha Blackburn in polling data this is for Corker is Steve And Corker by the white has also tweeted today that it is outrageous\nTo punish somebody you haven't done anything to anybody\nFor all of these some pose the actions other men have engaged in against women but his point is we have no evidence Kavanaugh did anything to anybody we are going to design a seat on the court because of that\nAnd then the next day we're going to die because of the judicial Temperance temperament never going to deny because they committed perjury and I'm going to deny him because he threw ice at a bar back when he was in college\nBut Corker made a plan that he doesn't think\nKevin all should be held accountable for things he has on his ... that's kind of like the affirmative action but why don't want to know where are
