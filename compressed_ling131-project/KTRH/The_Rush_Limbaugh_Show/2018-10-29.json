friday I guess it was the morning after she passed and I wasn't sure if I Would say something today or tomorrow\nBecause I'm not very good with those things and I start bowling um but I Will just say this um there is in every person something that we can take from their life um their greatest assets that I think all of us can be better from\nAnd I'm\nRuth berry who I referred to as grandma bury 'em my dad's mother had many many\nOf those traits in fact I'm much like my father\nProbably the most St like human being I've ever met in my life I Know everybody's grandmothers special to them uh I Know everybody's grandmother has something that you remember fondly\nBut actually I don't remember a grandma bury her famous dishes or or things like that what I remember most about her was a person of fierce\nIndependence and strength and dignity she was widowed um [noise] she was widowed when my grandfather died in a car wreck coming back from Louisiana and\nI think it was a lot harder back then there were fewer programs there were fewer things to lean upon so she went to work as a cafeteria workers in the west orange start school district where she probably started\nThere in her mid ... maybe even her late thirties [noise]\nHard for a woman who's not been in the workforce to enter the workforce without any degrees without any experience without a resume without any references I'm so she became a lunch lady\nCafeteria lady and she was everything that you would want in the cafeteria lady she Puerto heart and soul in that she took great pride in it [noise] um and she ended up getting a full retirement from there I'm I'm In ... that she worked\nI'll bet you she worked thirty five years as a cafeteria workers and she started later the most but somewhere along the way she never remarried somewhere along the way she picked up in the evening job as well she went to work at hallmark\nShe worked there were two hallmarks but it's still ...\nYou don't see 'em any more but she worked at the hallmark in orange and then she worked at the hallmark in a rut city and I will tell you that I don't think\nI'm certain that there was never a graduation birthday unit everybody in

it was just like clockwork inch shoot she was in her nineties by then\nIt's not easy to go get a card when you're in your nineties [noise]\nBut what I admire about her was her absolute strength here was a woman who had raised her children the youngest where I think probably finishing high school when my dad was second to the oldest um\nIt was awkward Jean the my dad Norman and then I don't know the order after that Sylvia\nSheila in standard so I'm\nIn any case she had raise these children she was a housewife that was um that was a point of great pride to her and her husband does just to go to work and never ask a person for a soul lived very simply\nSaved provided for her own healthcare when she was older and she looked to be said for that there's something to be said for the strength\nOf independence especially for a woman at a time like that when there were not a lot of economic opportunities\nBut her house was always the the gathering place for our entire family\nUm and I just\nYou know when I when you think about who you are as a person I don't know how much of who we are as\nWe're developing we choose to be and how much of who we are we are because we see things in other people that we want to replicate or is that becomes our norm that become ... you know what you expect\nA woman is supposed to be that becomes what you expect a man is supposed to be that's what you expect a father or grandmother or whatever else [noise]\nBut in any case she had a good life in a long life she lived to be Ninety eight in January\nShe would have been Ninety nine I was really really hoping she could live to be a hundred\nUm but due to a number of health issues her quality of life was not what it had been up until just a few years ago um she had a wonderful quality of life and that was no longer the case and it is it's difficult I don't get to orange as often as I should but\nI Would get frequent reports on her health updates and they were not um they were not what

I say drive by media may as well be selling it saying a Democrat part of the first thing I think they have is to try to find a way\nTo link who ever committed the bad deed to the Republican Party or\nThe phone call conservative movement\nAnd of course now it's blamed Trump everything everything at all what ever it is blame Donald Trump\nBlame me blame you blame anybody that supported Donald Trump and frankly I'm worn out with this reaction I have had it I Am fed up\nWith it's been this way for years there were showed up during the Obama administration there were mass murders and at no time did the drive by media ever try to link any of it to Obama\nAnd yet [noise] people have forgotten wasn't inflammatory\nJust say that Republicans were going to be responsible for millions of deaths if Obamacare was not passing it along with anybody remember that because I sure as hell do because I was set up on it then\nWe're trying to oppose a government takeover of one of the great industries in America better than anywhere else in the world are trying to take them to prevent a bunch of incompetence\nA bunch of government bureaucrats in the left wing politicians from taking over the American health care system meanwhile\nObama is lying to everybody about it claiming that if they like their doctor keep their plan they didn't get get get to and that their premiums are going to be reduced by twenty five hundred dollars a year or lie after lie after lie not\nCalled out not reported and then the Republicans come along and try to oppose it on subsidies grounds and the Democrats and the media start running around talking about how the Republicans are going to be responsible for the deaths of millions of people you want to tell me that's inflammatory or not\nHow many years have average ordinary Americans had to listen to this like you and I have\nWhere every time something happens that Democrats politicize literally everything and that's why none of this stuff ever gets fixed\nIt's why none of this stuff is ever going to get resolved until this politicization of everything stops in other words you have some guy who's been mentally ill for ten Fifteen Years [laughter] skills me\nThen decides to take action and all of a sudden it's ... it's the fault in political party or it's the fault of a president's and and so predictable because they hate the president will do and then they\nCan to get rid of him they spent two years trying to get rid of him they fail to get rid of him they're fit to be tied over their failure they're ratcheting up this this anger and if it were getting so far away from\nThe notion that whoever did it is the person that\nWe're getting to the point where in this country because we politicize everything nobody's responsible for what they do whatever anybody does it's because of the politics of the Republican Party or the conservative movement\nAs far as the drive by meeting is concerned it's not because somebody is mentally ill disturbed who knows what's been going on in their lives I mean he doesn't care about that except to the extent they can link the Trump\nWell I've I for one am am fed up with it I Am sick of this reaction to every freaking event even\nThough whether we can even get away from it from the women are extreme weather happens it's our fault it's the problem of the Republicans or Trump\nBecause we don't sign on to this asinine manmade global warming theory so we ended up being responsible for the deaths in print the only go [noise] and then when we stand up and defend ourselves against then all of a sudden we're attacked and we're assaulted\nFor being anti war many anti anti black anti minority what have you because they politicized literally everything [noise]\nAnd you know what if I have gotten to the point I Can't tune it out it is by your man to pay attention to it it is by your man to come here and pay attention to tell you what I think about how many people do you think are fed up with this by now\nYou would think this is going to affect the mid term lay Democrats and maybe I got I got a clue for ya\nNeither of these events that you are hyping are going to ... change significantly in the mid term elections as much as you would like them to and as much as you're trying to make them change the mid term elections you must be worried how the midterms are going to return to ratchet these two things up\nTo try to get people to somehow voted against Donald Trump you may you must not believe like Nate Silver says eighty five percent chance that you're going to take the house\nDo you have to take these too sad unfortunate events in and build them up into somehow they are Donald Trump's fault and this is why you should vote against Republicans in the midterms\nI can tell you right now I mean a ... do not know it from a ... hands on knowledge I'm just telling my gut is that there are millions of Americans once this stuff starts they tune it out they're fed up of being blamed\nThey're fed up with the people they love and support being blamed\nThey're fed up with their country being blamed\nAnd so they just they just tune it out they think about all of the mass shootings have cops back during the Obama those and those were supported\nYou had the support stalls you had the support black lives matter may want condemned but one day consequences\nFor the protesters could roll into Ferguson, Missouri and and literally tear up a town on on why they create a lie about the shooter in that in that in ... the Mike Brown good ones first name was\nWho was held up a convenience store and salt and whatever they just totally make it up turn it inside out\nAll for the express purpose of blaming\nDonald Trump now if if it gets it gets to the point that if the media wonders why they're in such ill distribute right now is because of this\n\nBelieves what'd you say\nNobody trusts what you're saying it's so obviously politically charged it's so obvious that you're you're passionate about this\nIs what you're going to do with it politically\nThe guy that shot up the synagogue in Pittsburgh scroll hill section of ... I Know this place well I Lived there not squirrel hill but I Know where it is\n[noise] [noise] the guy that shot this place up Hey David\nDonald Trump Donald Trump was too big and Jewish supporter his daughter converted to Judaism before marrying pushing their he more into the American embassy to Jerusalem this guy thinks Trump is part of the sellout\nTo worldwide and Jewish people and yet the media is blaming Trump is saying well a lot of that that is vodka and all that just that that that's just a disguise you know that that that they just did that the cover up Trump's real anti Semitism\nDonald Trump's maybe one of the best friend was Israel and Israeli Jews have had in the in the oval office and I don't know how long remember the case of\nWho was it's it's just a David Koch David Koch of the Koch brothers\nThey're re Wichita energy from and family and David Koch and his wife Julia donated funny the five\nMillion dollars to some New York hospital the nurses association and other organizations at the hospital told the hospital's not do accept the donation\nBecause David Koch is nothing more than a yellow bellied white print believes racist and the only reason for his donation wants to cover his racism and hide it so people didn't really see it\n\nThis is who the left is so they even reject acts of charity as ill motivated why does somebody seem that way well wouldn't make those nurses thinks that way I submit\nTo you that it is the drive by media I submit to you that it is very union leaders and maybe instructors teachers they had in school\nWere not even legitimate acts of charity or compassion are allowed because they're not real their relief from racist in begets who are trying\nTo mask and cover up their racism and bigotry and so the money should not be accepted and if it were accepted it should be returned\nWe got free weights\nOn cyber for ... minutes worth of delay three my lines have locked and forty five freeway Atlanta lapse in for that

aware it happened doesn't uh when it happened but it becomes real and we've got to destroy somebody's life we have to destroy somebody's career we've got and Kevin ... is supposed to sit\nBack and just take it he's just see those are the old rules in Washington people under assault take it\nThe best way to deal with it they are advised to non make waves sit there and take it and that's how responsible reasonable Republicans always acted well that's not that Donald Trump as he wasn't elected to act that way\nYou ask me the wrong people were being told tone it down\nThe left needs to tone down it's organized violence the left needs to tone down all of these political stunts\n\nThat are in many ways designed to provoke a reaction from people\nBecause they\nUtilize abuses of power and character assassination\nAnd the the character being assassinated just supposed to sit there just supposed to take it\nThat's how you get ahead in Washington if you're under the gun you take it you sit there and you take it and you realize it's just politics don't take it personally judge Kavanaugh don't take it personally it's just politics because everybody hates Trump we can't let you on the Supreme Court\nAnd you're gonna have to sit there and that's the price you're gonna have to pay for this guy be it'll like that and he's supposed to sit there and take\nHe wasn't supposed to be angry\nWhile he was mayor and while his family was threatened in his life and future we're in the process of being destroyed he wasn't supposed to say anything\nJust to sit there and take it that's the rules that's the way it works in Washington\nNot personal just this is just politics and then a couple of years afterwards everybody forgets it and everybody likes Kevin except Kevin O's life was ruined\nAnd he's never supposed to want to get even he's never supposed to fight for him so Trump ditto not supposed to stand up to this not but that's who Trump is they're not used to it they thought they would have sent Trump packing\nA year and a half ago they thought they'd be rid of Donald Trump\n\nAnd they still aren't let's go to the phones we have Steve in Pittsburgh with us You're up first a nice nice thank you for calling hello\nHey rush pleasure to speak with you thank you sir hey I can tell you that last week in front of the Pittsburgh School board they had a proposal to arm school police and it was voted down eight to one\nAbout this thing happened at a school but you know similar situation where President Trump came out and said if they had an armed guard this could've been prevented and then you have a mayor who's very anti Trump very liberal come out and say that an armed guard would not stop it's what we need is more gun control\nI mean how many more things to happen before they realized it more gun control was not the answer not putting someone with a gun that can stop it\nWell look I hate to be the one tells you are but uh there's no amount of death there's no amount of shooting whatever get your mayor to change his mind about what he believes because you say it's really not about guns he thinks it is in his supporter but it's not really about guns it's about something much larger than\nThat it's about being able to tell people what they can and can't have\nIt's about it's about telling people that they have freedom of speech except\nYou can't say this you can't say that you can't but other than that you got for freedom of speech with us leftists [noise] uh yeah and you want to have gotten you're going to have a gun except in east ... above it all for freedom as we define that\nHe mentioned this let's go to the audio soundbites I Want to start here with the Trump himself as soon as this is this is an example\nYou [laughter] well I I'm sure some people were shocked\nA on Saturday when this was Trump's reaction speaking with reporters he was a joint base Andrews\nIt used to be Andrews Air force base case you're wondering what does this joint base business well it used to be Andrews Air force base and then there was another military base close by another branch close by to unify them all the cotton joint base where multiple services are on the same place\nAnd so that's that's for air force one is parked at for Trump takes the helicopter to get on board air force one way is going to travel a reporter said\nMr President do you think you need to revisit go see\nSowing guy goes nuts in a synagogue and spoil hill and the first\nQuestion a drive by Mr President do you think you need to revisit\nGun laws [noise] by the way I Need to tell you something I've observed this is the last time the drive by some cared about the guns this guy had an arsenal and the drive buys have dropped focused on it because they think there is a bigger target\n\nAnd that is Trump being responsible for this and that in all the other things\n[noise] an anti Semitism they think oh there's a lot of racism so they're not really focused on this guy's guns as much as they would otherwise\nAnd that tells you this guy's got even loaded with guns why here's a drive by not really focusing on that when they always do because it's a political calculation that there's more fertile ground here and that would be Trump is an anti Semite or a big it or as a racist anyway\nThe reporters just Mr President do you think you need to revisit gun laws this\nSilent crime it's why people have lifelike have light flock to protect them from every kind of identity theft see when you have life luck\nYou'll do immediately when somebody is running around on you because you have an online profile at life lock tracks when there is any aberration any change at least bike they let you know and ask you what's going on if you know about it or if you don't\nAnd if you don't that's when they get into gear they've got a a response team restoration team does nothing but fix these kinds of hacks or identity theft and they don't stop till it's done it's the way you know you have been a victim of cybercrime long before you otherwise would and that's how it got shut down\nNow look nobody or no one company can prevent all identity theft but there's

hard core anti Semitic church Jeremiah Wright's church\nAnd they photographed them Obama yet with that world class Jew hater\nAlthough it's our time where we have\nWhat they say you're you're when you ask them that\nYou know [laughter] I don't what what do you think they're going to say rush what do you what do you think they're going to say that they can say damn well that's\nRight and they're never going to they're never going to they're not that Obama was there a guy Obama was who they think they are\nRight you know challenge a well spoken highly educated reasonable ACA damning intellectual um and in look in the ... world the only African Americans\nWho can do anything wrong are conservative African Americans they're not going to get on Obama are hanging around ... minds like Farrakhan agenda Robert Jackson Al Sharpton are busy promoting all those people\n\nThey feel sorry for them to get right down to brass tacks I feel sorry for them they think that because of the ancient history of America with the slavery discrimination and all that could have said that that really we we we can't\nHold them accountable we may have a skill says you know we can look the other way not exaggerating on that but the point still remains that Obama was chummy with Farrakhan and Al Sharpton and the Reverend Jackson are as well\nAnd there was fire account standing right next to him all of the Aretha Franklin funeral and none of them seem to want to not be in the photo with him and many drive by news organizations cropped Farrah Khan out of the photo when\nThey sent it down

people in America that are predominantly liberal that people scratch their heads and don't quite understand it\n'cause it's a lot because it's anti that religion is not anti Iran they still need the race in order to have racial politics\nBut it's if I had the ... air time the religion\nYeah because you can't separate the Jewish state from my religion I don't think he can and it you know any any time you're Jewish\nAnd you're in a you know you're in a liberal you're in a conversation with liver on Israel comes that no way that the display Mark I'm Jewish but I totally disagree with everything is real feeling that ... that comes up and that it's really sad\nBut isn't that more disagreeing with the politics that's associated with with Israel is a book because if their entire religion that's big I mean it it didn't Jewish religion I mean you've got the reform an orthodox and and and other branches how many\nDifferent flavor [laughter] um yeah but\nI I don't I used to I used to feel that way I feel like it but yeah with a push toward ... than many theaters they're anti Christian Tito um I don't see\nThem as necessarily being seeing it in Islam but I you know but I Do the right guy\nThat's exactly right I was just wondering Mrs all headed this is all headed toward atheism an anti God that's exactly what is a unifying the people on the left whatever they claim their religious views are\nThe trend is towards atheism and no God or at least agnostic ... because that removes any judgmental ism right it removes any limits on behavioral morality or anything else if there's no ultimate\nPower that can meet out approve or disapprove of ... than one is totally free correct\nAbsolutely\nWell I I just I'm so ... how\nThis of this event in Pittsburgh given everything else that you say that you are\nAll the liberalism to creep into Judaism and a rising anti Semitism you're right it's it's anti Semitism is rising in Germany and nobody's talking about it it's rising throughout Europe and there aren't very many people talking about it so this event in Pittsburgh than it did it\nAnd to any of the uh discomfort or on the ease you're having about things in general\nAnd I I don't I don't feel like that there's a million people out there targeting\nA Jews and the way that they would want to go she got the thing is I think that that these are isolated is an incident in this country that causes the country it's so good at that so many people I mean this guy is facing the death penalty he he went he certainly wouldn't be facing the death penalty anywhere else\nAnd I I mean I don't I don't feel unsafe\nAs a person who is Jewish walking down the street because I'm Jewish I and I and I obviously don't think I'd Trump has anything to do with it at that absolutely ridiculous and it's it's not going to make me not vote in the ... or anything silly like that\nI Am glad used because I'll tell you there's a lot of people that think and they're predominant ... thank you thank you so much Rachel I purchased racial for Thousand Oaks California [noise] um\n[noise] I don't\nThink these events are going to have anything to do with the midterms a lot of people do a lot of people think it's going to dampen a turnout what you think I'm wrong or you\nYeah I don't think it's going to have a thing to do with them in terms like ... now after Caesar say a dare I say this there I\nPut my hands together and look to the lord to do I say this\nHe's er psychotic and his pipe bombs none of exploded what do you think\nThe odds are that the drive by and the Democrats are thinking\nWell I don't have to ask as we know what we had people talking about how that whole thing last week was suppressing turnout remember and even Trump alluded\nTo the fact that that story was maybe going to dampen some people's enthusiasm remember that\nOkay while there were some people I'm sure not too unhappy about\nThat [noise] and then the second event happens on Saturday in Pittsburgh and\nIt was the to the people that politicize everything\nAnd that's the people I'm Talking about and that would be the media and the American left people look politicized and of course you've got extremists out there in in the fringes everywhere who [noise] irrationally try to explain things away\nBut the people at politicize everything who look at both events through a political mountains\n\nHad to be thinking are right now this is going to this is going to really help us in the midterms this is going to dampen turns going to dampen enthusiasm for Trump I have\nI have an\nEntirely different fits why I did the show open today but I did I don't think it's going to have that impact on people in fact\nI think the media in their natural state drives more people to Trump each and every day and I think they've been doing it since the Sunday shows yesterday with this\nThe attempt to politicize this the attempt to blame Trump for this\nThey can't help themselves they have spent the past two and a half years trying to get rid of Donald Trump they have thrown everything they know\nInto the public domain hoping to influence people to abandon Trump and it hasn't happened to these two events come along and they but I this is that this has to be what it is their thinking\nAnd they just can't help themselves they start blaming Trump for the synagogue shooting started asking the president what he's going to do about guns as you have a different view on it as though he somehow\nResponsible and what it does get portrays it gives away the fact that as far as the American the left is concerned everything centers around Washington\nThat Washington is the solution for everything and how is washing them to solution Washington is the solution because Washington is where\nThe enemies of the laughter going to be punished is where the enemies of the left are going to be dealt with that's the role of government as far as the leftist concern\nGovernment as an agent of power to enforce punitive punishing policies on the enemies of the American left that's its purpose so shooting anywhere it takes place a Web says what's the president's going to do it by the president nothing to do with it in the first place\nThe president has nothing to do with gun control laws except as a supporter or opponents Congress writes the laws but the idea\nThat Washington should be able to command anything at any time is what the left wants with the White House that's\nLooking at I tend to have freeway in Washington crowd of every\nThe
