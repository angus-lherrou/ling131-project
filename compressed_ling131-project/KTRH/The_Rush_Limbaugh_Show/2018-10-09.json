have to be very careful I don't over do this I don't want to I don't want to you know me I'm In the nation's number one natural optimist and I don't want to sound overly pessimistic but at the same time\nI I'm I'm Still searching for the best way perfect way to explain to everybody what I think the real threats that we face are so that's coming up as the program unfolds back however to the ceremony at the White House last night with the president first off\nApologizing to the nation\nApologizing to Kavanaugh on behalf of everybody in America for what was done to him for what happened to him\nAnd the cabinet episode caught a size exactly what I think we're up against and it illustrates something else that I think a lot of people are having trouble understanding we're not in a battle\nOf ideas the left is not\nInterested in our ideas we're up again we're battling people who do not want us to exist they have no desire to coexist with us they have no desire for the ongoing\nPolitical arguments offered the best way to do things for the majority of people that's not their interest their interest is the elimination of opposition\nHowever it can happen they have\nNo limit on how low they will go on how deprived and perverted they will be in seeking their reality it all I Am convinced started on America's college campuses well tracing where it started I mean to go back to the twenties and Soviet influence communist influence but\nFor the purposes of my being able to explain this\nThe most recent starting point\nBe the most compelling I think the best way to get people's attention or whether it because most people's historical perspective begins with a day they were born or and so ancient history is there\nAnd I've been taught it or they don't do it so the the closer to the present you can trace the beginnings of current problems the more effective persuasion will be it's always been my feeling on this my thoughts [laughter] but they don't ... folks we are not legitimate in their eyes\n\nIdeas are not legitimate our existence is not legitimate and not even worthy discussion or acknowledgement\n\nAnd they don't even look at the United states the way we do they don't accept the founding of the country the principles in our founding documents they accept none of that none of that is relevant ... all of that is part of the discrimination\nThat was founded as part of this country as far as their concert\nAnd it was all on display in the Capitol hearing everything that we are up against the absence a presumption of innocence cabinet was guilty because he's a conservative Kavanaugh was guilty not because they had any evidence Kavanaugh was guilty because in their minds he's got no business being a judge\nAnd he's got no business being a judge because he's not one of them it's no more complicated than that how they get rid of him that's another story\nBut his illegitimacy is born of a simple fact that he's not on their team that he's not one of them\nSo anything that can get rid of him and directly in their world is entirely non just permissible but it's required\nIf you have to deny him the presumption of innocence then that's what we'll do if you bring forward a woman who can't prove what she says but his believable saying it then that's fine that's what we'll do\n\nIf it takes the Democrats and Chuck Schumer and Dianne

to get in on all of this Trump action\n[noise] now I\nI'm I've been wondering how long it was going to be until somebody in the Democratic party cried\nThis Trump's rallies dating back to the two thousand sixteen campaign and do not doubt me on this either the Democrats in the media publicly acted on concerned on interested in and would always say a variation\nOf you can't judge voter interest on the basis or rallies you can't predict how people are going to vote simply because of the size of crowds at political rallies\nThese Trump rallies are not telling us that it doesn't mean anything he's heard just rabbit people upset with their lives and they think Trump is going to kick all the people out on free they don't like it's not that it's not anywhere near representative\nOf the population is is what they all said that every Trump rally privately\n\nDo not doubt me privately they were jealous if they can be and they were the thing\nBecause there's not a one of them on the Democratic side who could come anywhere close to ... that kind of excitement that kind of loyalty and knows sized crowds\nObama couldn't do it not in two thousand sixteen Hillary couldn't do it ever but certainly not in\nTwo thousand she couldn't she couldn't she couldn't withdraw flies there her book signing ceremonies Hillary Clinton who couldn't draw a crowd anywhere good people knew she might not be able to stand up for a full twenty five minutes without some aid coming out the proper up by the elbows\nBut seriously I guarantee you they were looking at those crowds they were looking at those Trump rallies and they would never say so publicly but they were scared to death by him they would never say so publicly they would never admit it publicly they would say just the opposite but they're human\nBeings in any kind any anytime anybody in politics has that kind of popularity and that kind of loyalty that equals jealousy envy and anger and all things that attached to jealousy and\nThat'd be they have the Trump to begin with and the fact that Trump was turning everything they believe you an upside down the fact that Trump was being able to accomplish things they couldn't\nJust in terms of average Americans being interested in the campaign interested in the Kansas City and those rallies twenty thousand Fifteen twenty five thousand as many people lined up outside who couldn't get an wanted to get in\nTrouble with his airplane perfectly placed so that Trump in giant letters and the fuselage was behind him at every stop when he made his speech except for those events that took place inside actual arenas [noise] so I I've been wondering\nHow long it's going to be before somebody on the Democrats' side tries to get in on this action and I always thought you know who I thought it would be that would make the first Abbott trying it Joe Biden\nI really thought that Joe Biden would be the first guy to try to replicate this then I thought maybe Michelle my bell Obama but then I thought no they've got too much to lose if it doesn't work\n\nMaybe Kamala Harris maybe some of these ... somebody's going to do this somebody's got to try if they've got\nTo be able to show the Democrats thinking they've got to show that there's as much excitement as much loyalty as much attention as Trump can draw up till now nobody on the Democratic side has even given
