warm welcome you don't see that report it\n[noise] [noise] um\nThey continue to try to lay the blame on Trump for this and it just wears you out I Know people are telling me it just wears you out every day you got the same thing different degrees of intensity different details in the story but it's the same thing\nAnd people say Russia's gonna win them in terms folks there isn't a soul out there who knows who's going to win the midterms\nThere isn't a single person out there who has the slightest idea\nI don't care what pulling you look at I don't care what professional you talk to I don't care what great really an analyst there is there isn't anybody who knows\nWho's going to win the midterms you have all kinds of people who want to impress you and how smart they are and how analytical they are but it's like anything else in the future nobody knows and that's because there are so many races according to the polling data can breaking her way\nThere are so many that are so close but then when you say that okay do we trust the polling day that the polling data versus two thousand sixteen not all that hot dry nobody knows a lot of blood\n\nNate Silver or given exam Nate Silver is considered a good world do you know why I think it was was it two thousand and fourteen two thousand twelve was one of those two elections were Nate Silver lucked into calling every state on the money\nAnd that feet\nWon the election I go in the past whenever it was gave him his reputation and these intolerable since that won election where he was infallible he hasn't come close\nDoesn't matter because he came closer was dead on the money when Democrats were victorious he's become a good road he's become a shrink he's become a psychiatrist or psychologist Democrats tuned in Nate Silver distaste than when the information they're hearing doesn't go the way they want it to go\nHeard pat ... silver guy nice guy but he's never run a campaign he's never taken a single poll only does this analyze them\nHe's never participated in a poll ended up of polling company he's never run a campaign and it's a ... point was you need to temper all these so called experts with some reality\nTo guy hits it on one election that happened to be exactly what the Democrats wanted to hear turned out to be\nTrue and so it becomes a girl wrote and the media continues to cite this is like Nate Silver is out there saying eighty six percent now chances Democrats when the house nobody knows\nSo you can't you can't succumb to the temptation here to go blob play\nAnd become flat line and it's hard I I look I Will admit it's hard as I say the human emotional reservoir can only hold so much\nAnd at some point it's going to get depleted and maintaining fever pitch energy becomes a challenging thing to do precisely when the news every day is Ninety eight percent slanted Ninety two percent slanted against you and what you believe in and what you want to happen\n\nThe Trump print to end the or the birthright citizenship today the Dems are still mad about it\nAll kinds of experts being trotted out it's unconstitutional no it's totally constitution no it isn't and he got Republican leaders that we don't want to go down this road is a silly we're all in favor of his many people getting in the countries that can't Democrats saying the same thing but it's out there it's a conversation starter\nNothing is going to happen anytime soon the leftist saying yeah conversation started as all of this Trump doesn't really mean it is trying to rile up the base that's where you're wrong Trump does made it\n\nIt is about time this was changed we have a crisis brewing\nWe have a crisis growing in terms of what kind of country we're going to be what kind of culture is going to dominate in this country and we are under assault by people who don't like the United states of America the way it was founded there's no complicated mysteries and this is just what it is that's who the opponents are\nHell bent\nAnd they're not going to stop until they until they went another Mahler investigate looking at all of us in the lower investigation trying to come back to life remember had told yesterday how many leftist were convinced that Mahler by now was going to have issued a report proving trumping colluded with Russia\nKnow how many people on the left believed that and how many have been thinking all this time that Mahler was timing this release for right before the election and it was going to happen and if it didn't happen to that would be a leak wanted there

Wednesday on Houston wanting [noise]\nOkay listen to and again this is Monday Night on CNN has taken a couple of days for this to reach the mainstream [noise]\nNon lending ... says it on Monday Night on CNN and its noticed today and again he's talking the freight Cuomo\nAbout all the recent shootings in mailed pipe bombs and ... says there was another have filled criminal just last week in Kentucky another white man in custody for shooting and killing two African Americans in a grocery store we barely had time to cover it\nWe have to stop demonizing people and realized the biggest terror threat in this country is white men have been radicalized to the right and we have to start doing something about them there is no travel ban on them you know they have the Muslim ban there is no white guy ban\nNow Don Lemon ah what what is your reaction to this I mean the pumps I'm telling you this is not a one off this is I mean the specifics of a white guy ban and that that may be something that he individually holes with the idea that the opposition\nAs far as the leftist concerned is white men predominantly white Christian man that's that's data on the money that's right exactly where they are aimed in the perversion view the Americans left it as white men who created this racist and bigoted\nUnfair unjust immoral country do not consider me to be exaggerating here\nThat is what we are up against and this all of this from the from the ... days all the way up through the Obama administration and a real objective has been\nTransform America away from\nThe traditions and institutions of the founding based on the fact that it's all racist and it's all bigoted and it's all unjust an unfair they continue to point to slavery\nAs the primary evidence the primary example or exhibits of their claim that America is unjust or unfair of course pay no attention to the\nSteps America took to end racism that gets no credit gets no mention whatsoever as far as they're concerned racism in slavery still exist in prisons on the caravan in immigration policy you name it\nAnd so this is what's animated and this is certainly what has energized and failed of women all over this country with rage leftist women it's being utilized\nTo ah to great effect but that's the single organizing purpose is racial or I was gonna say racist but it's racial in uh in its origins now it covers much more grounded in terms of its objective but that's their target that's what they're using and had been for a while to energize\nEverybody who is not a white man they're using victim allergy and victimhood into a tea\nThey are making people think that they have no chance in America as long as white men continue to run it and be at right men or continue to be the majority and they just continually enraged people they ratchet up the anger there has to be an outlet for it\nI think they are if you if you want to start attaching\nIf you want to start attaching media responsibility to the actions of people and notice how quickly they want to do that notice how quickly on the left ... people who commit crimes are not really responsible for them they're all ways the result of environmental things\nAnd so on the left telling us that these guys are being motivated by Trump they either love Trump or they hate Trump but whatever Trump is making them do these things\nI think it's a day if you're going to if we're going to go down that road never going to start attaching blame the people who don't really have any responsibility for making the bombs or pulling the trigger on the guns who isn't that isn't raging them like I say you cannot turn on the news today and find a single thing positive about anything\nYou can you you cannot find any reinforcement anywhere in public media for the goodness of decency of America it's quite the exact opposite\nAnd says these people are the vast majority immediate you know they exempt themselves\nFrom having any role in all of this while they are eager to try to find anybody else in the media who might be to blame for this\n\nDon Lemon sad or Monday Night also that he doesn't see Democrats killing people over politics\n\nYou mean Don like the followers of black lives matter aren't any Republicans in that group look in the number of police officers have been murdered Mr lemon by black lives matter supporters and look at how many of those cops murders have been defended\nAnd explained away by people like you\nIn the sense while they're cops and they mistreat and they are racist they deserve it\nBut don't try to tell me that Democrats are killing people yeah how about the guy that shot up the Republican baseball practice I think he was just intending to wound to people Steve squeeze almost did die it's amazing these people that way they talk and the things they conveniently forget or don't even register maybe in the first place\n\nFive cops in Dallas two thousand sixteen\n\nOr the Muslims in this country who have committed murder or they Republicans nope many of them are very loyal Democrat voting bloc Muslim Americans in fact maybe and even more reliable Democrat vote than black voters\nGreat longer here to and from day but I just wonder are your thoughts on why we haven't seen or heard of any reporting on this airline went down\nTwo days ago and I recall that last plane went down in Malaysia CNN was all over for about a month and a half a non stop the and we haven't seen anything about this this brand new plane that went that\nYeah where did it go down\nIn leaders Taiwan there but a hundred and eighty nine people died it was a brand new I Believe is going I'm not exactly sure\nWell there's no way to link at the Trump\nGood point there is no way to link it to the mid term elections there's no way to use that crash Syngenta\nAnti Republican anti Trump no I'm not joking say how I'm not I'm not joking and all they don't care about it because it has no impact it has no usage they can see in affecting the outcome they wanting to mid term elections for worry they'll get to it\nWhen the other side of the time to attack a corporation like bowling or whoever made the plane they'll get to it after they've done what they can do on the midterms\nMuch appreciate it you do you do you do new doubt me on this personally no but uh just got to remember CNN going wall to wall on that last plane went down\nWell of course because that's CNN CNN they were there were there was there was sucking hot or they were in last place out there and this was that was pre Trump and the ...\nThe belief in media is that airline airplane crashes airliner crashed as a lot of passengers is white glow eyeballs are glued to TV so they believe and then they had a mystery\nWearing a damn thing where is it Don Lemon even asked a former director of National Transportation Safety Board caught it had been swallowed by a black hole\nRemembered that you remember that\nCan't specifically remember that Americans are pro\nWell okay so ... ... ... they had a mystery on their hands and and they you're right they went wall to wall with it and it became a standing joke\nYou know that the the best way to make anything you're doing it success is to lose it and and have CNN try to find it for you\nI just haven't seen it on any media outlets whether it's Yahoo Google\nCNN NBC none of the nightly news show one picture from what you want to wait a minute how do you know about it then\nI saw it on\nLine news maybe where Monday morning morning was the headline news\nHeadline news they just announced they're getting out of the news headline news just announced they're going to go\nEighty percent uh uh uh advertising or something like what do you ever forget what you call that program but\nI just wanted to kill your that that was not one of those usually anytime the plane goes to kill him that many people especially it was a brand new plan that I don't know whether you such a brand new playing what kind of plant diseases bully will you remember the model number\nBut since it's brand new it's got to be the one of the time you know somewhat but uh and that's what made me think even more that we would see news Stewart Brand new plan going on is unusual and ah we were out of the sea sucked into it\nI'll tell you what it was a bowling seven thirty seven max which is the latest uh upgraded to seven ... seven thirty seven is a debate wide body\nAnd not as widely courses a jumbo jet wide body but it's stuffy and they have a mix of the damn thing to try to make a whole more passengers that went down but it didn't go down in America a Donald Trump had nothing to do with it going down that they could they make a case\nUh they they could not say that the pilot was angry at Trump and decided to take everybody out in his ... on it so that no way\nTo link this I'm not I'm not joking\nI Wish I was there is no way to link that crash to the mid term elections they'll get\nRush Limbaugh because we know for you the best school do on the ...\nIn our house bedtime is complicated my wife is always freezing and when she

the least about their customers and consumers and I don't know of a business out there that that has contempt for their customers and consumers like the news media does I don't know if one\nI don't know of a business who ... who who rejects half if not more of their consumers are customers like the news business does\nBut the news media has a habit that it was is assuming\nAn operating on the assumption let whatever they think and wherever they care about is what everybody thinks or everybody cares about so I'm not so sure that all that momentum got interrupted\nIf that momentum was interrupted if that energy level decline that wire Trump's rallies still so over the he's got one in Fort Myers like it's Fort Myers\nYeah Ford myself thousands of people already wind up Trump's got six rallies\nPlan between now and election day you've got all the way up to the night before the election and he's pumping\nSeries of themes and one of the themes is how great these past two years have been for the U.S economy reviving moribund industry is bringing back employment bringing back wage increases bringing back a economic confidence\nMore confidence in the economy uh\nHe's talking about how all of the things he wants to do to slow down the illegal immigration is having to deal with obstacles put on his way by both parties always messages\nAnd he remains is upbeat and optimistic as anybody ever has in circumstances like this so whatever is out there in the daily news media is not affecting Trump doesn't affect his mood doesn't affect his uh attitude or anything of\nThe sorts I think a lot of it as wishful thinking I got a lot of this idea that all of this momentum that the Republicans had has been kinda stopped because the pipe bomb and the synagogue shooting\nThis is you know I I circled back to I really don't know what's gonna happen on the lecture today and I don't believe anybody else does because we don't have fortune tellers\nAnd all we have is polling data and then yeah that's a toss up you want to believe what do you not want to believe it is it is it accurate is showing these close races really close I mean we don't know we never know until the aftermath here's Trump\nTweeting out at Paul Ryan Paul Ryan will be focusing on holding the majority rather than giving his opinions on birthright citizenship something he knows nothing about our new Republican majority will work on this closing the immigration loopholes\nThis is about this is this a classic Trump comes out and gets a conversation started on eliminating birthright citizenship and Paul Ryan is one of the first opponents to speak up\nCriticizing Trump saying why you can't do that that's unconstitutional but\nYou know it's ... I'll tell you what's frustrating to me there is all kinds of great news in this country economic news all kinds of a rebirth and there's evidence up everywhere and the Republican Party itself is not even getting that message out\nI don't know about individual candidates an individual races but the national Republican Party apparatus\nIf it weren't for Trump and his tweets\nAnd his his rallies the American people wouldn't have anywhere near the idea of the decent good things going on out there because Trump's own party is not joining the PR parade on this\nWas one of the reasons I'm never going to join this crowd and people thinks Trump should stop tweeting and Trump should stop all these uh incendiary things he says why let me ask you\nSome people it's horrible what Trump said about Paul why\nIs that why is it why is it\nA problem the Paul Ryan talked the first chance he had\nTo disagree with his own president about this and by the way all this this is a conversation starter right now\n\nIt's it's mandatory it's necessary that we have a conversation was we don't get a handle on this immigration problem you can say goodbye to America is you know it\nWhich is the design that's one of the reasons why the supporters are what they are Mollie Hemingway has a great piece today [noise] speaking of cabin on it's just right on the money and let me ask you a question during the Kavanaugh hearings\nRemember all the Democrats question and Kevin I remember all of the allegations we had balls the forward with her allegations of whatever capital I did that led to the fact that capital spiking punch with drugs to set women up for serial rapes we had all of these women that were dragging forward\nClaiming they had evidence of it none of them ever present at any but the media and the\nDemocratic Party were hell bent on convincing everybody that Kevin was such a rotten guy that his life and career deserve to be destroyed\nSo\nAfter Kavanaugh was named to the Supreme Court he is he passes it gets ... gets the confirmation vote and is in sworn in why did the media drop it\nIf Kavanaugh was such a rotten S. O. B. Y. has the media stopped its investigation\nRemember all the Democrats are yeah yeah I would've Kavanaugh's confirmed we're going to a piece you were going to throw out of there we're going to get rid of those guys are represented serial rapist where is all just it's gone is it not\n\nMollie Hemingway if the media and other Democrat leaders wanted to have any credibility of all that the post tearing release of multiple allegations was not a pure political none\nFor which they were willing to destroy a man why they continue to fight for justice everyday wouldn't they they'd still be out there trying to nail Kevin all if all of that was legit\nIf if everything capital was accused of being was actually true as they would not have stopped at him being confirmed on the Supreme Court they would still be out there right because of justice\n\nThey would be out there asking every democratic candidate whether he believes Ford and supported impeaching Kevin why aren't they doing that there's a big campaign going Kavanaugh will be rallying point Kevin always a reason to deny the Republicans continued leadership in the house\nSo why isn't the media asking every Democrat candidate running for office\nTheir opinion if Kavanaugh did you believe balls the Ford and if you did do you still support impeaching capital where are these questions\nThe reason those questions aren't being asked are the reason why the media isn't doing is just because it was all trumped up it was manufactured none of it was true it was a classic Democrat operation like every damn one of these is\nNone of what they were saying about Kevin always true it was all manufactured they didn't bring balls the Ford up until the very end as a Hail Mary if balls the Ford were actually telling the truth she

for the call I really I'm I'm Glad you got through to reminds us of an elevated Ellis I not only by the way we're checking people's health\nThey were determining whether or not people actually wanted to be Americans it was a restrictive process\nAnd we were much newer in younger country them and we had an entirely different attitudes about immigration and growth and it was required that immigrants assimilate and it was required that they be healthy we we're not going to open the borders to illness\nWe we're not going to expose the American people to things through accidents or or design but more importantly the immigrants who were allowed in\nHad to demonstrate that they wanted to be Americans they had to demonstrate that they love what America\nIt wasn't enough to be fleeing war it wasn't enough to be fleeing discomfort it wasn't enough to be fleeing poverty you had to want to be an American\nThe young people in that in that room erupted into a game a standing ovation\nAnd I

are those examples where were you know that that somebody's going to lose either at a local race or a presidential race but in mid term elections I can I can show your countless in two thousand ten\nWhen the Republicans picked up sixty three seats nobody forecast that the closest I remember to anybody for casting a massive Republican takeover was none other\nThan the prince of darkness in herself Robert Novak back in Nineteen Ninety four predicted I think to within two seats the Republican takeover of a house in those elections I think we one fifty four seats are forty something out of he predicted was off by two\nBut nobody predicted the Republicans are going to pick up sixty three seats in two thousand ten\nI mean the media didn't want to think anything was even possible because there's so much love and devotion respect for Obama and then when it happened you should've seen and if you remember the bottle\nIt fell out the women do just totally came out of their sales\nIn two thousand two everybody thought\nEverybody that Democrats were going to walk away with the house of representatives because everybody hated Bush Bush was not duly elected Bush stole the election in the Florida recount with the help of a twisted Supreme Court\nAnd Democrats did the Wellstone memorial and that was going to galvanize Democrats all over the country to show up and vote and there was no way and what happened Republicans\nGained ... seats [noise]\nThe left was done to the drive by media couldn't believe it so they're examples even when people are dams certain what's gonna happen they end up being surprised the brightest minds the greatest go rose the most heralded\nAnalysts and it's all about presenting an image of making it look like you know what you're talking about more than anybody else does\nI have here is from a ... a real clear politics by one of the written down their\nPoll analyst and data analyst there is Sean ...\n\nI'm not going to read the whole thing of printouts of four pages bought the headline here on certain days in the womb as men terms and her final stretch and I'm going to tell you what this long piece says I can do this long\nPiece in three words we know nothing on certain days alone as mid terms that her final stretch\nThe twenty eight in midterms are working their way toward a conclusion in a week we should find Leno who will control the house although at the outcomes close it could take weeks to finish counting ballots in California\nThe consensus view is that the Democrats are favored to take the house of representatives analyst disagree on just how large the majority they're going to win is\nAnd how likely that majority is if you split the real clear politics toss ups in half\nThat's much polls it results in Democrats gaining about twenty five seats\nFor a narrow two hundred and twenty to two hundred and fifty majority\nI tend to think says Mr trend day that the toss ups will break disproportionally toward Democrats and see something more on the order of a two twenty five to two hundred and ten Democrat majority\nBut this is here splitting to a certain degree okay so here he says and the second paragraph it's all over and it's a Democrat's two hundred and twenty five seats the Republicans with two hundred and ten\nNext paragraph at the same time this isn't the only way to read that data the Democrat\nPickups could be larger but they could also be smaller here are some things that shouldn't bother\nAny sober minded elections analyst enough final week of the election why we've just concluded here that the Democrats are gonna end up with two hundred and twenty five states and the Republicans two hundred and ten so why do we analyze any further because the truth is we don't know\nThose are my words and on his ... his words resume here will there be a late break as we learned in two thousand sixteen and in a less dramatic fashion and two thousand fourteen a late breaking the races can altered the landscape substantially this year\nThere are a lot of undecided voters remaining look at the most recent house polling from the New York times Sienna in some races and get to the gym membership numbers\nThis adds up to a situation where a slight break in the undecideds toward one party or the other could be the difference between a healthy Democratic majority in a slim Republican but wait here's are these are predicted to twenty five to ... I'm not harping on the street print day here\nIs we don't know he's given his best gas but now he's giving you every reason in the world is ... ... to do he can think of where it might their talent that way\nGiven the closeness of many races and the president's improving overall job approval is also unclear how about your weight all of this in the current cycle\nWell then how did you get to two twenty five to ten if it's really unclear how to evaluate all this [laughter]\nBut that's just me into being smart alec\nAh in New York's twenty second congressional district Sienna college places the president's job approval at fifty three percent so Republican representative Claudia Tenney as possibly in better shape than her polling numbers suggests\nBut what about the Nineteen representative John Faso is up by appointment the president's job approval is at a forty six forty nine split\nThat suggested very close race and there are likely a lot so\nTrump's on the ballot or he isn't\nIs it going to matter what Trump's approval number is in some of these house races or is it not\n[noise] anybody who thinks Trump's not on the ballot here leads to reexamine things\nAnd then the next burger about how many votes ... Democrats wasting one of the biggest news stories this cycle has been in the massive influx of money\nAnd the two Democrats campaigns this initially showed up and marquee races like Beto O'Rourke challenge of Ted Cruz but it has since filtered down into more marginal races like Indiana's nines or California's first or a\nOuter Mongolia of seven\nAnd all of this is relevant because Democrats right now have a roughly seven and a half point lead in the generic ballot\nWhich asks which party would you prefer to have control of Congress not normally this would be enough to flip the majority but if Democrats run up the score in districts that are unlikely to win suddenly that seven point margin translates into a closer than expected seat but then there's another consideration and that's how heart related army errors\nMeaning how 'bout liable aren't on this thing and then the next ...\nAre we're relying too much on one poster oh that's a pretty straightforward concern\nAnd then the next ... what is it early voting telling us well the pet response is nothing but that's too simple early voting returns usually tell us something but unfortunately they can only be deciphered in retrospect meaning we don't know the early voting is still it's over\nWe're not counting votes yet so all we know is party turnout but we don't know how these people that voted nobody does the only way you can determine early voting is after the election is over but yet we're still going to talk about it [noise]\nSo the final paragraph what else is lurking out there and this is probably the biggest concern and the what else is lurking what yet to happen that hasn't happened that could swing a bunch of boats [noise]\nWhich renders every poll prior to this day largely irrelevant\nWhich is why I continue to rail against polls about congressional midterm races in November the year before or in August of the summer before because the stuff that's going to determine the way people vote hadn't even happens what going to the polls but here at the end of this four page story\n\nWhat else is working out very well that's probably the biggest concern we've we've gotten good polling on the\nCandidate coal competitive districts but take argument to and then realized that in some of these districts Republicans might be caught napping we've seen some examples of this such as the open seat in Florida Fifteen or the incumbent Rob all in Georgia seventh film [noise]\nWe don't however no how big a problem this is right now or even if it is a problem I suspect we'll have a surprise or two on election night but what if there are tens of prices\nRegardless of whether that happens\nAre well set up for such as eventuality bottom line I happened to us why this idea what's going to
