funds who I Am convinced\nOne willingly take a bit of a financial hit to their wealth and businesses primarily their business is not their wealth but they would they would they would encourage some pain if it meant\nLowering economic activity on enough to hurt Trump I have no doubt that there are enough\nLooney tunes on the left who willingly do this I think they're that desperate as a previous caller said\nAnd of course it it flies in the face of the Democrats in the media tried to say well it was a new age ah yeah the economy's doing well but the president's not going to get any credit for that people don't even leaving noble even look at our polling data people\nObviously that's not true I think they're terribly worried\nThat this great economy is going to be greatly beneficial not just to ... but the Republicans\nIn the midterms and so there is a monkey and going on with the interest rates is the point it's calling you're causing the stock market the roller coaster and here is Trump ... pointed out to him yesterday was not a good day for investors\nThe Federal Reserve is getting a little bit too cute that so when I took over this economy this economy was ready to crash we were at one percent GDP now or a four point two percent\nIt was ready to crash it was the worst if you look from the great depression that was the worst recovery and the history of our country and Obama tremendous money at it [laughter] don't forget Obama was playing with zero money so he was playing with funny money he was it was very easy [noise] I'm\nPaying interest at irate because of our fed and I'd like our ... not to be so aggressive because I think that making a big mistake\nTranslation he is worried maybe accusing the Federal Reserve of raising interest rates because the economy's chugging along so well that traditional inside the beltway Washington gets very worried when the economy's going great\nMy whole life I've noticed this and my whole life I have been perplexed by this I've asked myself why\nAnd let's look at the fed here as the establishment in this story\nWhy\nIs a great performing and growing economies so threatening to official Washington and it is because every time the economy starts talking what does the fed do they\nLeak they leak that they are thinking of raising rates and what does that do that kills activity in equities markets\nIf these people think the feds are going to start raising rates people start selling rather than buying and investing what Trump is saying that he thinks this is being done purposefully to slow down the economy\nAt the time totally unnecessary for it right before an election and he's calling them out he's caught it's another thing previous Republican presidents would not do he's calling out the fed Mr Limbaugh doesn't Trump from the ... no you may appoint the Federal Reserve chairman but know day to day no way\n\nAnd the Federal Reserve chairman the odds are that the number of the board of governors going to be you know a bunch of\nTommy leftists as they are at many financial institutions and I'm going to produce strictly crazy about Trump despite how much wealth they are earning the cause of drunk\nSo Trump calling them out on it he says there's no reason to start raising rates right now right before the election soybeans down\nSo they react to it and and this rollercoaster stock market day actually ended up being only a one day roller coaster I\nThink there's positive action today I Will I Will check it's ah let's see one more thing here we have yeah\nA ... heart\nSo your wife recently had an interview she said there are people in the White House she doesn't trust people you don't trust us to watch your back is that true and if that is the case why are these people you don't trust still in the administration\nWe have great people right now are more kids\nAre there are some that I Am a not at all with yes and what we need them out slowly but surely\nServe and some other embarrassing leaks are you any closer to figuring out who these people are\nWell let me get my legs I think a lot of the lake so not links that made up by the newspapers the meat is very very dishonest beyond anything that anybody can understand\nNot even a letter written to the times that there is a chance there was a very good chance that that was written by the times I wouldn't be surprised because at times is totally corrupt and dishonest\nWhere did you first hear that right here\nWho was the first or maybe the only person just suggesting that the times itself\nWrote that piece that memo that pose a memo written by an angry staffer\nIn the Trump Administration claiming their up close and personal things the president doesn't know what he's doing but don't worry there are adults in the room and we're doing everything we can to stop this guy we're conservatives and we love business\nAnd they started a massive\nManhunt to find out who did this and they couldn't find anybody and I think on the first day on the first day would ever go back and check the transcript\nBiting it was the first day I told everybody I don't believe this I think the times made this up I

world [noise] but I see that [noise]\n\nNew York magazine and look at it as Obama had a secret plan in case Trump rejected the twenty sixteen election results is this not aware of just looking back what's what's retrace steps it was the last debate between the Trump stir\nAnd the hill the beast\nAnd Chris Wallace was the moderator and Wallace asked Trump if she writes them which swear pledge to accept the election results\nAnd Trump said no I'm not gonna sit here and tell you right now that I Will accept the results of the election I'm not going to do that until the election comes in we counted the boats\nThey want it I think what was the objective was to be able to create a soundbite Trump acknowledges he thinks he will lose elections that's what they were hoping for\nDessert Trump knowledge that you'll accept the results of the election of course I'm a great American yes that go sit at that time everybody thought that Hillary was going to win at a landslide then they the soundbite would be the headline we trumpet knowledge is likely defeat an upcoming election\nBut Trump crossed them up they said no [laughter]\nI don't know what kind of shenanigans these people going to play I'm not going to concede anything tonight Hillary Clinton gets in here\nIs the biggest threat to our democracy that we never\nDid believe in saying that this is written so then Obama we didn't know until\nRecently devised this secret plan in case Trump rejected the election results and guess what the plan was [laughter] the plan was if Trump wins to steal the election away from it\n\nIn October two thousand sixteens senior staff and the Obama White house\nDiscuss what they should do if Hillary Clinton won the election and Trump refused to accept the results\nThey had cause to be worried at that time Trump had an openly speculated that the election might be read during his final debate with Clinton on October the nineteenth you said that his opponent should never have been allowed to run and declined to answer the question of whether he would conceded\nI'll keep you in suspense Trump said it wasn't a hypothetical\nBetter roads Obama senior aide and speech writer told the intelligent just New York magazine column Trump was all ready to hang it on the campaign trail\nBen Rhodes seems to have a problem with English\nTrump was asked a hypothetical question what will you do if Hillary wins to which he gave an answer based on a hypothetical premise\nThe Obama White house plan according to interviews with Ben Rhodes and Jen Psaki\nObama's communications director called for congressional Republicans former presidents and former cabinet level officials including colon colonel Powell and Congolese are rice to try and forestall a political crisis by validating me election results so\nThis is not funny looking like they're hell bent on making sure the Trump concedes despite being dead certain Hillary was going to win and if Trump refused to concede that we're going to call Colin Powell and ... and\nRice and a bunch of ex presidents and they were\nGoing to get them to validate the election result in addition to the official count state by state in addition to the U.S Congress certifying the election that apparently it wasn't going to be enough they had to go get colon Powell income the laser rice\n\nIn the event the Trump tried to disputed Clinton victory they would have fond of resolved as well as the conclusions arranged by the U.S intelligence community that Russian interference in the election sought to favor Trump so we're now learning\nNot we're not learning anything we're having our suspicions confirmed they hatch\nThis Russia plot way before the election even took place and no matter what happen no matter what the outcome was they're\nGoing to use it if Trump last they were still going to use it to say that even though Trump last he tried to steal the selection of Hillary\nAnd it was that was going to validate her election even more that was going to make her an even bigger star an even bigger hero she overcame not just Trump She overcame ... she overcame the Olive Garden she overcame Russia and that's what their plan was\n\nAnd then it got turned upside down Hillary last and she refused to concede remember she refused to go away\nThey refused to acknowledge the Trump and one in immediately became Trump didn't win the Russians stole it\nAnd to this day there's no evidence for it but there is Obama\nThis story New York magazine they think they're doing an edible here and they think they're really

actually was bipolar\nI sleep deprivation which is called the ... ten to Twenty years from now I wouldn't even remember my son's day\nSo you do you understand that you say ... some shrink told him he was bipolar and the shrink was wrong and they looked\nInto his brain and they found out that he has a very high IQ he's up there with Tesla and he's up there with ...\nUh to see how they should test for like not nine Tesla and Freud and then they told him that he wasn't bipolar he had sleep deprivation\nAnd that was going to cause dementia [noise] so he got all that fix I I don't sleep deprivation [noise] maybe it was sleep apnea who knows what the what that was a Trump was just sitting there with his arms folded\nWell I don't know not Trump was smiling while a while this was going

taken place while spending all of this time trying to find the\nCrime that they can lay on Trump and they haven't been able to it's frustrating this is why by the way there isn't cruising frustration at the president for not deep classifying these documents that will answer the question you're asking\nDon't understand why why the president is protecting Rosen stain the guy who end up meeting suggested wearing a wire in his next meeting with Trump to try to get incriminating evidence that Trump's unfit\nNever got to gather that cabinet after Rosen's dean had\nHad a conversation with Trump which supposedly was going to show that Trump is insane and unfit and they were going to play that for the cabinet to try to invoke the twenty Fifth Amendment Rosen stance I'm just kidding I just get it was ... the people in the meeting say he was not getting none of us\nWere and I believe that I Believe these people back then were hell bent on getting rid of Trump\nI think they still are I I think I think official Washington the political media complex of washing it is still\nInside outing upside down over Trump and I think what every success and every smile on Trump space with every\nPiece of evidence that Trump is enjoying this I think they go a little further insane each and every time\nThe Trump succeeds is something that Trump is not damaged by saying every effort everything they've done to take Trump out I think they are beyond frustrated that it hasn't worked\nAnd I don't think they are giving up on it I don't think they will give up on it now the Rosenstein Rosenstein however pronounces it heard it both ways\n[noise]\nThis is really curious Trump pat him\nA on the air force one people thought that roses you know why he's got to be fired after this after\nCredibly being discovered suggesting wearing a wire to win trap the president you got to go but Trump says I got a great relationship with the guy I'm not let them go I'm not doing anything about that now and I'm not declassify those documents yet\nThat people are scratching their heads\nA as to as to why\nSome are saying it's just the election rushed Trump's not going to do any of their
