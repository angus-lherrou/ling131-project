O. E. at check a pro dot com and please your full name and your mailing address\nNow back to addicts I'm a riveting topic we talked about quite a bit Tom spit on the show a number of times and I'm Tom gets a lot of response from the show actually so it's it's a great opportunity for him to fill in those holes where he may have some holes in his schedule for his crews and he can bring deals\nUm so it works out for everybody works out for comment addict innovations in works out for my listeners\nYes and I was gonna say if you're thinking about getting this done in the next three or four weeks now's the time 'cause there's a price increase for the manufacturers starting November first so insulation ready and bury those products are going up and cost so the prices are prices probably have to go up a little bit so\nIf you get an appointment now come on come on look at it will locked the price in so we don't if you say you maybe you want to do it in the middle of November that's okay but we'll just get it scheduled and will lock that price in because prices are going up so now's the time to kind of\nDo it so you know we've been to I've been doing this you know on the radio for years and this let people know that their prices are going to go up so there's no surprise 'cause sometimes like um they'll tell me that oh we've had a price increase before and then they'll say well you know I I've been listening to you for two years can I get to your prices on like\nYou know everything's gone up in two years just you know I Can't I Can't do it so I'll just let everybody know that they're now at the time\nYou know it's gone up over the past two years according to my doctor my blood pressure but hardly unrelated but I was thinking\nThings see everything will go up and never goes down it's like taxes they only go up and never come back down and they always say oh we're going to tax the temporary yeah you're right is never temper it always when it goes up it doesn't come back down\nI'm laughing because at the same time my doctor said you're shrinking so I guess some things to go down you know I my ... my shrinking yet but but the point is if you live to be long enough you shrink I went to the doctor a couple of weeks ago and I said you've lost twenty pounds is twenty Fifteen\nI'm like oh I wasn't even trying to lose any weight but he'll eat addicts are hot as tough [laughter] ten more years I'll be Tony Hawk less\nSolar addict fans a great deal from the federal government Uncle Sam is giving you a thirty percent off what a\nDeal yeah so you get thirty percent off of the of the installed price so you get thirty percent of the product and the installation so it really helps bring the cost down\nA I go over the numbers real quick and then I'll talk about the benefits of the fan I'm so we do is already want solar addict fan it's made by the people like I said they're out of Cairo Texas I'm a thousand Ninety five dollars is a normal or normal installed price were taken two hundred dollars offer checker Pearl listeners so it brings the cost down eight Ninety five out the door installed\nLifetime warranty the whole kitten caboodle so that's a great deal but then the government's also kicking in thirty percent federal energy tax credit they get thirty percent of that back on your twenty Eighteen taxes so that's two hundred and sixty dollars and fifty cent tax credit so brings the total cost to six twenty six fifty after the tax credit\nSo just to be clear the day we do the the fan it would be eight Ninety five\nOf the editor innovations and then you get to sixty eight fifty back in the tax credit so your your true out of pocket expenses six twenty six fifty so the nice thing about that is these fans can pay for themselves in a year or sometimes even less just an energy savings because I've had customer say you know I have\nFour hundred dollar bill now my bills like two fifty in such a big difference in the summertime that that they get paid for itself to for summer it's incredible so the fans are really nice ours has um humidity sensor and the thermostat comes on eighty five degrees\nSo it doesn't pull heat out of your attic in the winter it's smart technology but it will it can kick in in the winter if you have high humidity in run for Fifteen or twenty minutes pulled the humidity down\nIn ... and you don't want a lot of humidity in the addict is because it can get in in in insulation and then the insulation starts to settle and then later on you need more inflation the whole reason was because you maybe didn't have enough to start with but if you did have enough too much humidity the insulation well basically shrank is kind of contacting so you want to keep the editing the the air and he had a dry\nSo that's what the fans do I've got one you do I put it in ... I didn't even have my crew to I came out when we were so busy we did it in the summer we were so slam as like I already know rate I knew where you live so I think I'll come from you know where I live right\nAnd I know yeah you um she made up the ladder you put your cougar paws on which are special boots that roofers use and you went up and you look you look like you don't you're doing this for sure I have done\nProbably I Would say I was gonna say thousands but I'd say I probably wouldn't at least a thousand of myself so I Am very familiar with solar fans and my cruise they've done thousands of them we put a lot of fans in\nBecause they do make such a big difference to lower the addict temperature so that's the number one reason you put a solar fan in is to lower the addict temperature the lower the temperature and the addict\nThe less the air conditioners going to run and the more comfortable house becomes so if you're addict as a hundred and forty a hundred and fifty degrees and you're trying to cool the house down to Seventy five degrees inside that's a Seventy five degree differential your ... it just can't over what we can't take that much heat out of a house so it gets overwhelmed with heat that's why they are going\nRuns around and runs so I tell people you know you drop the temperature down to say a hundred and ten a hundred and Fifteen that's going to make the biggest difference that you can't as as far as efficiency on your whole house it's all about addict temperature\nIt's huge how many of these can you give away of or I'm Sorry how many deals can you offer to my\nListeners are saying hey let's do a we can do six of these so we'll do six than deals fan deal so now some houses may need to fans so this'll be six separate appointments so if you need to find some people say well I think I Need to a federal do up to about Fifteen hundred square feet of a twenty five hundred square foot addict\nOr wouldn't recommend to fans so this kind of let people know about what the pricing would be so you know you'd normally one or two pages which need okay\nOrdinarily a thousand Ninety five correct yes two hundred dollars offer my check or pro listeners thank you very much time for offering that to my listeners today\nSo that brings it down to eight Ninety five installed yes and then the federal tax credit from the federal government Uncle Sam thirty percent off which is to sixty eight fifty nets it down to six twenty six fifty after\nThe federal tax credit yes that's out of pocket so that's the nice thing about that and this is the same thing it's a lifetime product lifetime warranty it's a great fan it has a a motor that are rated at Ninety thousand hours so it's about a thirty five year run expectancy on that motor\nI Wonder how long my motor mum on I'm pointing to my I Hope you know our life and hope you have that\nI don't know you're getting cut out their science things not just this year All right if you're a little
