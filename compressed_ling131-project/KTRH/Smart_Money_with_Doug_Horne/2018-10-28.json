{"month": "10", "state": "TX", "station": "KTRH", "content": "Your lifestyle can have a lot of freedom in it and that's that's one of the things I I I'd like you to expand on 'cause you you talk with more students than probably anybody I Know you know what are some of the life changing things your seeing\nAnd what are the some of the things people are doing to really get that freedom well\nThe first is taking a step I mean a lot of people are poor for the simple reason\nPoor stands for passing over opportunities repeatedly\nThe people tend to do better in life do so by taking action when opportunities arise they're not in their comfort zone they're not fearing all the time what they're doing is they're learning a skill that will allow them not only to help themselves maybe their kids their grandkids and again what I find with our students Ryan is they are not\nFrom a certain way or education or background\nThere simply people that are ... and they're passionate about learning something new again I mentioned this earlier the number one mistake that most people make with their money is they think they can do this on their own and then they'll go to the education later well that's the wrong thing to do one creates bad habits\nAnd number two they never do go back to the education 'cause they blown up the money they had\nSo what do good students do I talk to them all the time number one\nThey've realized in the twenty first century that they can take a laptop anywhere in this world right now it doesn't matter because as long as they have an Internet connection and their laptop\nThey can trade all over the world in fact we had a student named ... he's in San Diego and a lot of times are students feel it's too hard they can't do it well not only is beyond done this and his left his job which is exactly what everybody wants to do right we want to quit a job you don't love to do something we do love\nHe's become a excellent trader and he's also now started funding his wife's real estate business\nSo the two of them are doing something together\nSpending more time together spending more time on vacations in family but the important thing here Ryan is it they're loving what they're doing and there's so many people out there and if you're one of those people hopefully you can see how you can benefit from just learning a skill that can give me the freedom that desire\nYeah absolutely and it's it's kind of interesting as we're as we're sitting here talking about the lifestyle of a traitor I'd just literally received a text message from a dear friend of mine and it just popped up on my phone and he was actually somebody who got me started in trading he was one of the first people who said this is how you open an account these are the steps you go through\nIt very very first conversation these just become a lifelong dear friend of mine\nAnd he's a huge ski bum he lives up in Salt lake you just easy travels around it as a great time\nHe just texted me with a picture of snow ski saying hey can you use these this season or should I take him to the ... 'cause if I go to Salt Lake uses bum a pair of skis from it rather than a hall in mine around\nBut it it's just there's just so much freedom that can come with it and it and it really ends up just pulling down to a couple of basic steps a couple of\nBasic as you were saying changes or actions that need to be taking because I think it's very critical it's very important it's it's very powerful once we do understand\nThat that the poor is just the state of mind right that passing over opportunities repeatedly and it's something that can be really easily changed just by stepping out of our comfort zone right just by stepping out of our comfort zone and doing something different we talk a lot about\nKind of cliche statements on the show here but it's because they're so true and there are so useful and and it goes back to if we've always done if we always do what we've done will always get what we got in and if we are completely satisfied with where we are than than great let's continue to do what made us so happy in the first place\nBut if we want a little bit more for trying to create a little more income if we're trying to create a little more freedoms we have a specific goal\nThat we're trying to accomplish that we haven't been able to get to\nWe have to make the necessary changes and that's one of the life lessons that my grandfather share with me my whole life growing up he would hold up his five fingers and I would have to name all of them the first one is ...\nYour business the second one is be converted and that converted one as a youngster I honestly didn't understand what it meant and as I got involved with trading and I really started to go kind of soul searching down is is this something that's going to work for me am I going to be able to do this\nThat converted when I started to realize was make the necessary changes the necessary metamorphosis do what's necessary and and and in the beginning and that was the one I always kind of didn't put as much emphasis on when I was like ten eleven twelve even Eighteen Nineteen twenty you know but then as I really started into my my grown up years I started realizing\nHow be converted that pointer finger of the five to ... became the most valuable because if we don't make the necessary changes we're never going to accomplish that kind of outlier goal\nThat were after that one of the things we can do to help people get started with this as we've still got a few tickets we can give away let's change some lives right now we've got a half day class coming up in your area\nThey have to ... ... exactly what it takes to really take control of the finances really taken truly a retirement account generate more income inside of the market's really live that life the drafter and just a second you're gonna have a chance to win a set of passes one of these half day classes to get your bones writing if you are driving now is a good time to pulled over\nIncluded with your passes it's

is eight eight six one to eight seven to three that's eight eight eight six one to eight seven to three if you end up being colors nine or Twenty one sorry about that hit us up to Houston O T H ... see if you can scores and passes there\nNow Larry one of the things that I always like to say and I said it earlier on the show is doesn't matter if you have two dollars or two million dollars it's all about getting that money working for you and really getting it to generate that income so you can live the lifestyle you could reach the financial freedom goal that you're after\nBut what are some of the things are what are some of the other kind of examples I Know you have your bags and bags loads of these these examples of our students that you've talked to that we're in one place that are now in another well the first thing we always understand here is that with\nTrading it's simply a transfer money from people who don't know what they're doing to people who do know what they're doing and what's really sad as people will get themselves stuck think about this time right now\nPeople can sit in front of a television for hours versus going out there and learning a skill that can help them and every year and you were coming up to the holiday season again we're gonna start seeing all these Jim commercials again right 'cause here comes resolution time and one of the things I hear our students say over and over again is beside wishing having had more time was\nThis is the year I Want to get out of debt and I want to turn my finances around and what's amazing is how many students\nCome in through the classes that we're doing right now and simply imagine what their life would be like if they can learn a skill to help them generate more money\nAnd that's the key it's about doing something taking action and getting out there to change your current situation again if you're ... and something that you are really interested in learning how to do there is no limitations here in fact one of my students June\nShe actually came to my class and she said all she wanted to do is play golf in Costa Rica and so she started realizing that by learning how to trade gave her the time to do that\nI said it's great just sent me a postcard and she did and she said she was trading because that's a whole nother piece of it people go on vacation Ryan right and they get raid the vacation they're making money to pay for it and so I asked you or your training before after golf she goes\nBefore of course and I love that of course\nYeah we're talking with a group of students just a little while ago that did a big trip through Europe and I remember him saying\nYou know where we were trading out in Europe and we made as much money out on our trip as we actually spent on the trip and so it's kinda fun to come back from a trip with a with a with a flat balance or even being up after having a great after having a great time\nAnd that's the thing is it doesn't matter where you are you just have to have an Internet connection it doesn't matter where you are and it doesn't matter where you're from it doesn't matter what your background is it's all about just proactively identifying good opportunities and that's really what we introduce you to show you exactly what it takes how to do that inside of the half the class and we are\nPretty much at the end of
