O. E. at check a pro dot com and please your full name and your mailing address\nNow back to addicts I'm a riveting topic we talk about quite a bit times but on the show a number of times and I'm Tom gets a lot of response from the show actually so it's it's a great opportunity for him to fill in those holes where he may have some holes in his schedule for his crews and he can bring deals\nUm so it works out for everybody works out for Tom medic innovations in works out for my listeners [noise]\nYes and I was gonna say if you're thinking about getting this done in the next three or four weeks now the time 'cause there's a price increase of for the manufacturers starting November first so insulation radiant barrels products are going up and cost so the prices are prices probably have to go up a little bit so\nIf you get an appointment now come on come on look at it will locked the price in so we don't if you say you maybe you want to do it in the middle of November that's okay but we'll just get it scheduled and lock that price in because prices are going up so now's the time to kind of\nDo it so you know we've been to I've been doing this you know on the radio for years and this let people know that the prices are going to go up so there's no surprise 'cause sometimes like um they'll tell me that oh we've had a price increase before and then they'll say well you know I I've been listening for two years can I get to your prices on like\nYou know everything's gone up in two years just you know I Can't I Can't do it so I'm just letting by no that's not the time\nYou know it's gone up over the past two years according to my doctor my blood pressure but hardly unrelated but I was thinking things\nSee everything will go up and never goes down it's like taxes they only go up and never come back down and they always say oh we're going to tax the temporary yeah you're right is never temper it always when it goes up it doesn't come back down\nI'm laughing because at the same time my doctor said you're shrinking so I guess some things to go down\n[laughter] yeah I ... my ... you're not shrinking yet but but the point is if you lived to be long enough you're shrink I went to the doctor a couple of weeks ago and I said you've lost twenty pounds is twenty Fifteen I'm like oh I wasn't even trying to lose any weight but at least addicts are hot and it's tough you know ten more years I'll be twenty hindsight less [laughter] solar addict\nFans a great deal from the federal government Uncle Sam is giving you thirty percent off what a deal\nYeah so you get thirty percent off of the of the installed price so you get thirty percent of the product and the installation so it really helps bring the cost down or I go over numbers real quick and then I'll talk about the benefits of the fan\nI'm so we do is already want solar addict fan it's made by the people like I said they're out of condo Texas I'm a thousand Ninety five dollars is the normal or normal installed price were taken two hundred dollars offer checkerboard listeners celebrates it costs down eight Ninety five out the door installed\nLifetime warranty the whole kitten caboodle so that's a great deal but then the government's also kicking in thirty percent federal energy tax credit to get thirty percent of that back on your twenty Eighteen taxes so that's two hundred and sixty dollars and fifty cent tax credit so brings the total cost to six twenty six fifty after the tax credit\nSo just to be clear of the day we do the the fan it would be eight Ninety five\nOf the editor innovations and then you'll get to sixty eight fifty back in the tax credit so your your true out of pocket expenses six twenty six fifty so the nice thing about that is these fans can pay for themselves in a year or sometimes even less just an energy savings\nBecause I've had customer say you know I have four hundred dollar bill now my bills like two fifty in such a big difference in the summertime that they get paid for the for summer it's incredible so the fans are really nice ours has um humidity sensor and the farmers that comes out of eighty five degrees so it doesn't pull heat onto your attic in the winter it's it's smart technology but it will ...\nHe can and wonder if you have high humidity and run for Fifteen or twenty minutes pulled the humidity down\nIn ... and you don't want a lot of humidity in the addict is because it can get an Indian inflation and then the insulation starts to settle and then later on you to be more inflation the whole reason was because you maybe didn't have enough to start with but if you did have enough you had too much humidity the inflation will basically shrink is kind of contacting so you want to keep the editing the the air and the addict dry\nSo that's what the fans do I've got one you do I put it in ... I didn't even have my crew to it I came out when we were so busy we did in the summer we were so slam is already know right I Know where you live sauce like I'll come to a problem you know where I live right\nAnd uh no yeah you should meet up the ladder you put your cougar paws on which are special boots that roofers use and you went up and you look you look at you know what you're doing this for sure\nI've done probably I Would say I was gonna say thousands but I'd say I probably wouldn't at least a thousand of myself so I Am very familiar with solar fans and my cruise they've done thousands of them we put a lot of fans in because they do make such a big difference to lower the addict temperature so that's the number one reason you put a solar fan in is to lower the addict temperature the lower the temperature in the addict\nThe less the air conditioner is going to run and the more comfortable house becomes so if you're addict has a hundred and forty a hundred and fifty degrees and you're trying to cool the house down is Seventy five degrees inside that's a Seventy five degree differential\nYour ... it just can't over what we can't take that much heat out of a house so it just overwhelmed with heat that's why there does your does runs in runs and runs so I tell people you know you drop the temperature down to say a hundred and ten a hundred and Fifteen that's going to make the biggest difference that you can't as far as efficiency on your whole house it's all about addict temperature\nIt's huge how many of these can you give away or I'm Sorry how many deals can you offer to my\nListeners are saying hey let's do or we can do six of these so we'll do six fan deals with the also now some houses may need to fans so this'll be six separate appointments so if you need to find some people say well I think I Need to a federal do up to about Fifteen hundred square feet of a twenty five hundred square foot addict\nOr wouldn't recommend to fans so this kind of let people know about what the pricing would be so you know you'd normally one or two faces what you need okay\nOrdinarily thousand Ninety five correct yes two hundred dollars offer my check or pro listeners thank you very much time for offering that to my listeners today\nSo that brings it down to eight Ninety five installed yes and then the federal tax credit from the federal government Uncle Sam thirty percent off which is to sixty eight fifty nets it down to six twenty six fifty after the federal\nTax credit yes that's out of pocket so that's the nice thing about that and this is the same thing it's a lifetime product lifetime or the it's a great fan it has a a motor and at that rate it at Ninety thousand hours so it's about thirty five year run expectancy on that motor\nI

use safe money programs based on specialized plans that can provide first year returns of up to Thirteen percent\nWhile locking in your yearly gains and also know fees are loads taken from your deposit\nThis message is different from what you normally hear on financial planning shows largely because our concepts are different most brokers base their financial planning on something called modern portfolio theory this theory basically divides up your money and puts it into different investment categories another word for this is diversification\nThe process of diversification is supposed to minimize your losses if the market drops one thing that is rarely talked about is that it also limits your again when the market goes up\nWe have a better idea what if you could

me explain\n[noise] if you have a market exposed account of one hundred thousand dollars in the markets dropped by thirty percent your account has dropped to Seventy thousand very painful Ryan but that's just the beginning imagine the markets go back up the next year by the same thirty percent\nAre you back to your original a hundred thousand dollars no you're not\nWhy is that after dropping thirty percent the account is that Seventy thousand so the next thirty percent gain is on Seventy thousand not a hundred thousand\nThirty percent of Seventy thousand is Twenty one thousand and Twenty one thousand edited a Seventy thousand is Ninety One thousand it would take a forty three percent gain after the thirty percent loss just to get back to where you were starting\nWhich was a hundred thousand\nThat is why people rarely recover losses one of my favorite questions to ask my listeners is windows negative thirty plus forty three equals zero the answer is when you lose thirty percent
