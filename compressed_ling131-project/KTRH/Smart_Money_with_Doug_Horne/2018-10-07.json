I didn't even have my crew to it I came out when we were so busy we did it in the summer we were so slams already know right I Know where you live sauce like comes from you know where I live right\nAnd I know yeah you um she made up the ladder you put your cougar paws on which are special boots that roofers use and you went up and you look you look like you don't you're doing this for sure\nI have done probably I Would say I was gonna say thousands but I'd say I probably wouldn't at least a thousand of myself so I Am very familiar with solar fans and my cruise they've done thousands of them when we put a lot of fans in because they do make such a big difference to lower the addict temperature so that's the number one reason you put a solar fan in is to lower the addict temperature the lower the temperature and the addict\nThe less the air conditioners going to run and the more comfortable house becomes so if you're addict as a hundred and forty a hundred and fifty degrees and you're trying to cool the house down to Seventy five degrees inside that's a Seventy five degree differential\nYour ... it just can't over what we can't take that much heat out of a house so it gets overwhelmed with that\nIs what does your does runs in runs and runs so I tell people you know you drop the temperature down to say a hundred and ten a hundred and Fifteen that's going to make the biggest difference that you can't as far as efficiency on your whole house it's all about addict temperature\nIt's huge how many of these can you give away or I'm Sorry how many deals can you offer to my listeners are saying hey let's\nDo a we can do six of these so we'll do six than deals fan deal so now some houses may need to fans so this'll be six separate appointments so if you need to find some people say well I think I Need to a federal do up to about Fifteen hundred square feet you have a twenty five hundred square foot addict\nOr wouldn't recommend to fans so this kind of let people know about what the pricing would be so you know you'd normally one or two pages which need\nOkay ordinarily a thousand Ninety five correct yes two hundred dollars offer my check or pro listeners thank you very much time for offering that to my listeners today\nSo that brings it down to eight Ninety five installed yes and then the federal tax credit from the federal government Uncle Sam thirty percent off which is to sixty eight fifty nets it down to six twenty six fifty after\nThe federal tax credit yes that's out of pocket so that's the nice thing about that and this is the same thing it's a lifetime product lifetime warranty it's a great fan it has a a motor that are rated at Ninety thousand hours so it's about a thirty five year run expectancy on that motor\nI Wonder

knife\nHe was honorable brave highly skilled and all types of fighting and all types of weapons yet he's still persisted and only using his knife in battle\nUnfortunately his enemies did not participate in his ideals and even though this soldier fought valiantly he died in battle the moral of this story is that good intentions don't win battles and if you bring a knife to a gunfight you

his products where you can lose your money are called securities\nWhat is secure about than I can assure you every time the market crashes nobody feel secure\nSpeaking of security let me tell you

of letters to their investments\nFor example you might say my retirement accounts were at point hey now they're at point B so obviously there are going to eventually be at points see\nLet's explain

be your retirement account will continue to grow on the same path to point to say we see this train of thought over and over again as we look at the history of investments point a the beginning of the tech boom in Nineteen Ninety five\nPoint be the top of the tech boom and year two thousand and yet so many people bought or held on to stocks at point B expecting that stocks would continue to grow to point to say\nHere's another example point a the start of the housing price bubble around Nineteen Ninety five point be the top of the housing bubble in two thousand six people were still buying houses like mad just before the housing bubble crashed expecting that they would continue to rise to point see\nWhat crashes next the bond market precious metals national debt the stock market again who knows\nAll you can do is that just because your retirement account grew from point a to point B doesn't mean it is going to grow to point see in fact points the might be lower than point hey if you're not careful\nWouldn't you rather have planning based on guarantees instead of assumptions how about a guaranteed first year return of ten percent or how about a guarantee of your income account

because it can happen\nCould have stocks continued to rise instead of crashing after the dot com bubble yes that's possible could have housing prices continue to rise after two thousand six once again that's possible the problem is many investors take what is possible and they start to believe it is probable or worse yet a certain fact\nAdding fuel to the fire there are plenty of people that
