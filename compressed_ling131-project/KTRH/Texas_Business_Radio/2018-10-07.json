lawyers at a price\nAnd you can afford to do the same thing that the big companies are\nDoing well and more importantly than that though because of the legal profession is a it's a very big left and right limit\nRight I mean there's there's all kinds of specialization isn't there\nA but your ability to quarterback that that's right and identify\nA okay we need pat and help here we need a specialization or here because as a as a business owner I'm not going to know the different I'm not I'm not going to necessarily be able to identify that I Need specialist here there and uh and you

you got to run their businesses true what they're good at they don't need to be basically dealing with legal issues gimme someone I can trust to go quarterback that manage that and they can go grow

right we need we need lawyers right to to fix this\nGive me a flavor for some of those because I can imagine a okay you get sued or you find out your contracts aren't worth ... written on 'cause there's a hole in a more water some of the other reasons why you get those emergency phone\nCalls can be a good example at a client or a smaller company in a smaller size they were between\nTwo to four million in revenue IT company and they got threatened with three lawsuits because of the services they provide it there were an installer a computer equipment they would go buy from the oh yeah yeah and install it let's say with the hospital or a law firm or a small business\nWhile they're in the middle they buy the equipment for someone else and they do the install where they were getting threatened by the end user customers because it doesn't work\nSo if it's not work and who who's going to get their finger pointed out um it's gonna be the person in the middle and everybody in that

TB Arctic suspicious radio All right we've got the basics behind us let's get into this die because it's got to be a great program I have in the studio with me tie when who is an attorney\nI guess individual turning out I'm not sure what you call it but it's to try when law office was up to nine well that's right yes that's right so dry\nThank you so much for joining us my pleasure I happen to be here thank you for having me this is going to be fun let's start with you have some expertise let's tell people write off what that is\nRight so I Do a lot of a corporate business real estate and mergers and acquisitions work so basically I might be a lawyer and that includes you know one off transactions to serving as cheaply advisor to small and medium size businesses\nSo one of the things you like to do though was just be there for them uh for for the company any anything not just legal but the legal perspective on much on non legal things things that they need to be concerned about or be aware of that they're generally wouldn't even think about\nYeah so um I've been practicing law since two thousand one and have\nBeen involved in a lot of board meetings and worked with a lot of founder and CEO of company presidents what I Do is I take all of that experience and work with founder and CEO of companies and a lot of times it's just bringing lawyers perspective right to the situation at hand\nSo it may not necessarily be a legal issue but um you know I I've seen it from a lawyer side and and so that I bring that value to uh my ...\nOne of the things we we talked about before we started was a hot issue is just corporate formality you called it yes let's talk about some of those things so these are things that every business owner needs to be aware of right right yeah so what is what would that include\nRight so um you know what so first of all like any good lawyer I'll I'll have to do a little disclaimer that we're\nJust generally talking and we're not I'm not giving a kind of legal advice or [laughter] you don't you know they have to tell them what to do them why they got that right yes exactly so let's put that it's you know would that done a corporate formality is just a general a set of guidelines in and rules and principal at\nBusiness owners need to be aware of and and follow and even though the word is corporate you know this applies to corporations and El Al she's like I'm any business sanity right any business entity and hear what we're talking about is it's following proper procedures so that um you don't exposed the company to being\nPierced the tournaments chairs by the corporate veil\nAnd the point of having corporations and ... is that had\nOne of the reasons is provides liability protection right right\nSo you personally don't are not responsible for the company a debts liabilities and obligations are but in order to get that shield you have to follow certain formalities so\nSo the the reality is folks is if you're going to have an corporation you're gonna have to say whatever it is whatever the structure is you're doing that to protect yourself\nTo have a ... between you and your company and if you don't follow these rules someone can come along at ... mice will not have a corporation they're going to sue ... so let's let's get into some of the things that are best business practices\nRight so um the the one thing that I see a lot of is many times contracts\nSigned on behalf of the company but it's not proper that doesn't identify the company itself right so for instance you may have a contract that has\nUm you know a beast that's an ABC is the name of the company but on the contract to just as ABC it doesn't ... ... in an L. C. so it's not a formal so\nSigning contracts make let's just make sure that the company name is properly identified and even if it's a ... you can say you know which it maker db a ABC Inc or ABC yellow fever or something like that so one contracting it identified the proper corporate or entity name um\nYou mentioned co mingling I think it was a big deal the co mingling is another concept where if you are actually running a business you have a separate entity you've got to ... separate its assets and liabilities from your own personal I'm so that means that you should not be using company's funds writing\nChecks out of the company's bank account to pay your mortgage or your private car or a trip um unless it's a business trip but\nA co mingling is let's just make sure that the funds properly allocated to the business and if you need to take some of that money out for your personal than it's gonna be through a distribution of evidence or something like that got to be a formal that's\nRight and relationship now I have to do it so huge and obviously I have a personal walked those all got him started absolutely don't want to combing level right near the our actual by I mean just about anything to do just got to be careful where you do it from to make sure you don't break the shuttle\nThat's right yeah that's that's a good point many companies have many businesses have ... several different companies whether their subsidiaries or affiliates and it's important to keep those ... those operations for the entity separate separate bank accounts unless there's an in a company management agreement in place or something like that\nUm you know make sure the contracts or a specifically identifying which entities entering into it you definitely don't want to co mingled funds\nRight about that earlier well they'll they'll break to seal ... that's what I've got to be careful also meetings board meetings management Moody's what about them\nYeah so um depending on how your corporate documents are set up I'm usually there's an annual\nShareholder remember meeting and then there may be an annual or quarterly board meeting that has to take place and even if those meetings don't occur they have to be noted as an a decision not to have those meetings but when those meetings or help you know have to maintain proper minutes", "year": "2018", "show_name": "Texas Business Radio", "city": "Houston", "day": "07"}
