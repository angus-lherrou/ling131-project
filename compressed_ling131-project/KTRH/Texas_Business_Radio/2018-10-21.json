modeled\nTwo hundred and fifty thousand dollars invested for sixty five year old and he lived chill age one hundred okay\nAnd they show thirty five years of withdrawals it kicked out six hundred and four thousand dollars in income it also shows that when he passed two point seven seven nine million went to the family okay\nSo I said jeeze what were the average rate of return have to have been for those things to be true\nOkay and they modeled\nEvery thirty five year period going back to Nineteen twenty seven okay well I put that on a financial calculator and I saw for the interest rate for that have been able to be true this portfolio would've had to have returned about six point nine percent on average wow okay so it's not quite the market but\nThey were able to take a lifetime income and a rising income off is what I'm getting too with the performance isn't that far behind the market okay other thing I wanted to show us and this is Brad race to the beach [noise]\nBrad's illustration we just went through a minute ago we split the million dollars half of it went into the guaranteed lifetime income bucket he turned it on in five years six years and was proximate Lee forty thousand dollars a year and guaranteed lifetime income okay\nSo when when the ... bucket\nCatch up to the forever bucket he finally Marcia when does the money in the market anything in the market a theoretical not guaranteed past performance there's no guarantee okay well if we conservatively model the growth of the for us at ... and then he turns on income\nIt might be twenty five or twenty six thousand dollars in income at age sixty six okay\nSo when does that catch up with a guaranteed income if we're able to increase the money and the market by three percent every year as liberal analytics and University of Chicago cook well he might be eighty\nBy the time that income catches up to the guaranteed income K. twelve years a long time he might be Ninety or even dead\nBy the time the total money kicked out to him ever catches up to the guaranteed lifetime income so it begs the question jeez why would you ever put money in the market when you can get guaranteed income and sleep at night okay\nWell it's protection versus inflation and I need for rising income your hundred thousand dollars buys only Seventy five dollars and ten years just to three percent inflation rate\nAnd also you put money into the market to the extent that it fits your risk tolerance and time horizon to leave more money to your spouse into your kids\nOkay it's all in individual thing we go through that when you come into my office and we can model and the retirement GPS but I just wanted to show you this is why you need guaranteed income and you need rising income if you're over fifty

she\nThis is Cheryl fryer Sam Houston morning news getting breaking Houston on national news plus hot topics that people are talking about posted straight to your timeline liking us on Facebook actually put some useful news and your news feed it would be like random selfies and pictures of what people are eating well sorry we can help you there\nIn Houston on Facebook and go to ... dot com and\nLight button [noise]\nThe leaders\nFurniture made in America studios Steve Steve's radio seven forty Katie our age and I are is radio station\nInteresting now why\nIs it important to read I mean if somebody were not to use your product right they're they're introducing a lot of friction into that process what does the benefit of reducing the friction right beside I mean it just it it it what is the what is the benefit is visiting increase the life of their parts does it make it easier to pump what is the\nSo bottom line is like taking a drill bit in with a grinding as to how do you push to quicker it's going to ... where a whole foods steal that you're applying it to frame application with a a rotten tubing string\nWords I'm Sorry go ahead please I was going to say in other words you're going to wear a hole in the pipe and that's a disaster that's right all day and age that's the bottom line that shows you want the friction won't cause holes\nJust to give you an idea of these the failure rate of these wells that they're working over due to holes into being can range as high as three to four times a year on an average\nIt is one and a half to two and a half times a year that results in a work of a cost of a lot a significant cost of living is that's exactly right\nSo what kind of difference does it make using your products versus not right you can reduce the amount of of of work overseas they have to do\nExponentially okay interesting\nSo the ... cost savings to them is very very significant using this friction reducing our products versus not\nSo we just had a tangible as result from a customer in the Permian Basin that went from an average of to point to ... a year to point one seven using will products\nOh wow and it's a cost to work over as being extremely high that becomes a noble so so they're a fool of they do use your product in it and they have a there's friction introduced into there\nAs well right I don't know what ... say they were full but yes it does a improve the benefit and the overall return on their investment\nNow this is particularly important in a fracking because they don't take time I guess to drill straight oh and then what what makes it\nSo actually J. it's a both on the drilling a drilling side because technology has advanced so far that they're drilling so fast that they that even in the vertical sections you haven't deviated well boy\nAnd now with pad well drilling which is why they drill multiple wells within a very small footprint of the drill ... those are engineered deviated well boys if you will having asked curves and kicking off from where they enter the well into the surface\nA so they're engineer design a deviated well Boris and there's also ... at the right to the front adjust that drilling that drove it technology\nInteresting and and you know with a technology comes so far in that ah they've gotten where they're poking holes in the ground so fast\nOr like you said they they will understand what they're introducing but they can do it so fast that ends up saving more money just just put them in the ground fast and and dealing with the extra friction and stuff that that uh comes out of it\nRight that's right and what's so often what happens so often is drilling and production have uh although the same company have different goals so one is say to reduce the overall cost of drilling which is very intensive and expensive\nUh so they ... they want to drill faster I get on quicker and move on and off quicker ... quickly as you can can serve costs but that produces an adverse effect and the deviated well boys which then becomes a problem for production on outta we keep these wells running longer on artificially lifted being ...\nInteresting and it's cheaper to deal with those issues than it is to to to drill long right exactly interesting one of the things we were talking about during the break and I found this absolutely fascinating talk to me a little bit about some of the terrorist\nUh things in the market right over over the recent past with the president and the administration talking about tariffs implementing some non implementing others what has that done to your market for raw materials and stuff because it's it's flipped it upside down I find this fascinating\nRight absolutely a or just on a media exposure or expectations of the terrorists being levied has driven the costs of steel to double in price this time last year\nIt's also adversely affect supply chain so supply and demand and flipped upside down prior to the terrorists being a implement it\nI find it interesting that some of the unintended consequences of this you know is\nThe president tweeted out something about he's thinking about a terror fear will all of a sudden the market now start hoarding supplies think ... it's going to a increase in price which increases the price without anything I actually being opposed right correct\nNo that's a interesting unintended consequences of a you know the administration negotiating if\nYou will with a foreign markets while I agree with the overall a\nStrategy is their strategy of the president what remains complex is bridging the supply chain gap in the meantime and getting us manufacturers to ramp up dying or to supply the demand of the market not us than oil and gas that are all markets yeah no doubt\nThat relates to short term because the Americans have to pick up because it's so expensive now to bring it from overseas and during that short term you don't have ... ... it's crazy but hopefully the Americans and build\nAnd they could provide you cheaper in the fresh come back down according to her so the strategy go we'll see\nI I agree I I think it will be a little more costs costs late in than bringing it in through international markets are but still a it's the right thing to do I believe it's correct and I think you just need to you know bridging that the supply gap\nAnd ramping up us manufacturers takes time it's not a one year initiative you know it's a five or ten year initiative sure\nInteresting stop lightning production services L.
