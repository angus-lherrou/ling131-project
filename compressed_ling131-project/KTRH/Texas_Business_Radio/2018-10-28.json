advised or I'll assess whether there's that invention is patentable okay ah and then one of the first thing we'll look at is ownership K uh who's creating it and as the ... does the company has the documentation ordered agreements in place to show that they own it and\nThen as a I think we ... we talked into break there are you can lose an invasion or did you lose your right to obtain a at so

there's as as very new and especially the the the bad sides things\nSo we've got a little bit about engineers Matt's absolutely right engineers ... thanks and then they want to protect them but I work with a couple of CEOs that I've been around for a while or companies are pretty dogs\nBut they decided to overcome the ups and downs with your business they need to expand and they've started R and D operations and you do something like that isn't that true nukem riding on that what what what research and development or would they do it and what's going to end up being pat and I'm not patting\nYes ah the first thing is\nRecognized where that I ... it might be coming from a and also again ensure ownership so you you want to make sure if it's independent contractors that the independent contractor agreements have clauses in place that transfers the uh uh the ownership of the I ... to the company\nWhat about employees so that if you are employed them and you pay them to do this\nEmployees usually if as if they are paid to do that if that is part of their duty where some voters has dropped as well that they use they do not need to to have in their ... but it's a good idea to do that anyway yeah um\nI tell you what I probably met a hundred of these guys right the the guys that worked for a major company as an engineer they've come up with an idea right and left to be here by the way yeah I mean I mean I Am too I live in an area but the you know here's where it gets a little dicey though\nThey are employed by a major company they leave major company and they started a company with whatever invention am\nWho owns that idea I mean at what point is this engineer running into trouble if they used company time company software company resources to invent an idea that is now going to compete against the big company big companies don't necessarily appreciate that right\nThat's correct um and usually it do situations will warn litigation sure and uh\nFrom my experience the one that's more most important things or or evidence that people look for their uh is documentation right 'cause you know a lotta times engineers will come up with an invention but there is no physical evidence of it it's in their head because\nUh invention a pat noble concept is a concept is actually not\nYou know anything physical aired idea as to cut the conception of that idea that triggers the date of that invention and sometimes it's not\nYou know as well as usually not easy to trace the birth of that idea the birth of that invention and that day or the the data conception usually determines who owns it because if that\nInventor is employed as an engineer for the previous company when they can see the idea\nThen that company it's possible the company I was raised by well they often died we don't have documentation\nSure ... it's it's interesting and it's something that comes up a lot especially in Houston I might like I said I Know probably a hundred of these guys the the last thing that we're talking about is is companies that are expanding by acquisition they're getting ready to buy a company that has some kind of intellectual property associated with it\nAre you guys have every ability to come in and help them figure out the landscape of what it is they're buying correct\nAll the time yes especially when they're buying a company that is what technology is central to the value of that company and what they do\nWell and need to get somebody like you involved right then right\nYeah well I Would I Would think I mean 'cause 'cause questions that obviously pop up is how well protected there's this idea right and\nIs there anything that I'm going to rub up against right whenever I buy it and is there anything additionally I Need to do to protect it right once I buy it does that ... some of the things that they're that you're working on huh exactly\nAll right interesting stuff is Alberto or Amazon junior Amazon McCoy is the law firm or

them in later\nDoesn't really matter to me we're going to get the experts in here to get those questions answered I'm your host Matt register Jake curries normally sitting over there and the co host chair had ducked out he's going to join us here shortly but in the meantime we're going to talk a little bit about\nPersuasion and I don't care what business you're in you're in the business of persuading somebody you're sweating a customer you're persuading employees you're persuading somebody\nAnd I hate to break does to you but most of you guys are not persuasive most you guys are doing it wrong\nAnd we have an expert in here and it's going to tell us all about it we have experts coming into Texas all the time to talk to see is may have a wealth of information we like to get these guys in here in the segment we like to call the national advisor showcase and this is one of those segments\nDr Christoph Moran who is here from sales brain as you're talking to see you sales brain as the company the persuasion code is the book\nLet's go ahead and let him tell you about it a doctor more than welcome to show certain thank you met very very happy to be here with you so tell me a little bit about the persuasion code and sales brain what do you do do do you do it too well\nYou introduce persuasion perfectly you may or may not realize every single day maybe even every single hour we are on a mission to convince a client an employee and how about a family members so those of us who have Parenthood\nA stories will remember how difficult and\nOf frustrating it is to convince your own children well it turns out that persuasion doesn't need to be as painful because there is a science behind it and that's what the book is revealing in terms of ah how it works in the brain\nOkay the science behind we were talking during the break there's a lot of work and a lot of research that went into what it is you're doing I mean you're talking about measuring hundreds of times a second and brain impulses in sweat uh the tell me a little bit about how you figure out what's effective what is not effective when it comes to persuasion\nPersuasion in the field of frustration is boring alright I teach I'm a professor of media psychology and I have to go through these old obsolete models where we have assume for a long time that we are these perfect rational decision making machine\nAnd as long as we organize our arguments logically we're going to close deals in arguments\nIt doesn't work and so I became as a researcher extremely frustrated\nI was talking to people because the stories that would get is I Am a rational person I'm going to decide based on price based on features inspiring when in fact the the evidence coming from sales data\nOr what we know is the measurement of advertising at that point so different direction it doesn't uh line up with what people tell us so I decided to not talk to people anymore I decided to measure their brain activity okay and that brought in neuroscience the science of understanding\nHow the brain works into marketing and this was initially a little bit of a controversial subject when I started this two thousand to\nA lot of people thought I was on a mission to implant chips in people's brains when in fact I was just really trying to reveal what is the biochemical\nPlay inside the brain of attention what is a tension comprehension all those phenomena are explain in the brain well\nIn ... and not doing that does not give you you you get answers that people want to tell you right they say the logical person I buy based on logic when in fact\nThe the evidence points to the opposite direction so you're not getting valuable data without taking measurements of the unconscious uh their their brain activity right\nPrecisely and to make it easier on everybody's mind I Want to introduce a the brain and two\nSystems one system that we all have is considered primal it's on the bottom of the brain and it measures\nAnd controls all the activity that corresponds to life you know blood flow temperature heart rate activity your capacity to stay awake is controlled by what's called the primal brain now we don't think about that brain and that's a good thing because imagine if you have to think of your breathing\nRight no no that's right it controls your basic the lizard brain they call it right I mean that's\nLizard rain with Jillian brain we assume that it's only a fairly effective brain but it doesn't participate in cognition well that's a wrong assumption because our research has demonstrated that to be persuasive to actually be effective in convincing people you have to in fact\nSpeak and communicate to the primal brain first\nInteresting but what percentage of of marketing efforts are going out there that makes no attempt at this and gifts this wrong I mean\nI Would have to assume like more than half like a lot of it is is wasted effort\nRagweed clean Ninety five percent of messages are bypassing the primal brain and seeking to influence us through logic which out\nThe way we make decisions despite what we say\nWe do only to the extent that our primal brain has been served so let me just try to sell you a very simply a solution for extinguishing fires alright typically messages on his fingers are about the features and functions of your extinguishers how
