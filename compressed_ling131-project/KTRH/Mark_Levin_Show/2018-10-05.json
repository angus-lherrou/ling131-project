Thirty years ago has been ridiculously distorted my wife and daughters have faced vile and violent threats\nAgainst that backdrop I testified before the Judiciary Committee last Thursday to defend my family my good name in my lifetime of public service\nMy hearing testimony was forceful and passionate\nThat is because I forcefully and passionately denied the allegation against me at times my testimony both of my opening statement in response to questions reflected my overwhelming frustration of being wrongly accused without corroboration of horrible conduct completely contrary to my record in character\nMy statement an answer is also reflected my deep distress at the unfairness of how this allegation has been handled\n[noise] I was very emotional last Thursday more so than I've

something and I've been reading through your book and it is fascinating to me as a non Christian [noise]\nUm you write beautifully you're right in a way that's totally understand well these are very complicated subjects you know you can get really way down for you can get caught in the weeds and you don't do any of that uh and uh\nAnd and you can see the uh the decency in your writing the earnest this in your writing and uh and you raised a point earlier when we were talking a and the first segment\nAnd that is and just mentioned it again the founding of this nation I think people need to understand that the men who founded this nation not all of them but almost all of them were Christians\nWho met at the uh who met and I'm On July Fourth with the declaration of independence and men in Philadelphia again in the constitution and look at what they did even look at the first amendment what they did they didn't establish a religion even though they could have potentially\nAnd yet they allow freedom of religion so in other words these are Judeo Christian attitudes and principals the reformation all these things that are affected these faiths and so well people may say well I'm an atheist well I\nI you know I'm I'm this religion I'm of that and I differ and I don't agree with you\nThey can say that as you point out and they're free to do whatever they want but what they cannot say is that the founders of the country the frame or is that the constitution weren't not a religious men they were religious in their own way and to different degrees but these were men do states were they not\nYes and and that's been documented and and\nA lot of people want to do that because it has any interest of the secularists to uh say to rewrite history to revise history and say that the framers were not religious men that they were secularists and that\nUh they they say that as a result of that we should get back to our secular values and when they they want a radically transform fundamentally transform our nation\nOr back to secularism and those kind of values that but because they distort what really it really was\nBut we know for a fact what they want to transform us back to is something that's anathema to our founding principles and we watched the totalitarian tendency the left\nAs Obama tried to bring on\nRain\nCount\nAnd\n\n\n[noise]\nMan that's where we
