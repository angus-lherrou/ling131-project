parents are they going to we're going back\nTo ... they just start go on our ...\nI've never seen and I think this is your point right I've never seen anyone with such mastery of the media I don't want to use the word manipulate because that has a pejorative sense is a mastery and you know what it is\nIt is a ... you know salesmen are the easiest people to sell in the funniest thing because salesman all think they're good buyers but they're terrible buyer she watched salesman get do I've seen it myself\nSalesman get duped by others salesman it's just it's the nature they fall for the sale the romance of the cell\nThere's something about Trump and and this is a skill set that then he developed over four decades\nBut he has been shall staying with media starting in New York and then eventually expanding out but he got to practice in New Jersey\nYou got to practice in in smaller markets outside of New York\nBut the New York media is a cutthroat environment New York post to a New Yorker magazine the New York times and the number of the various regional publications and there are a lot of egos a lot of egos and the newspaper scene there\nIs closer to the British newspaper scene\nThere there's the tabloid style newspaper there the more stiff upper lip newspapers there or the newspapers it like to break a gossipy news and get into who's having sex with who and who's having an affair with ... there's the society style newspapers\nAnd he honed his skills over those years learning and and I think what he learned through all of that\nIs the members of the media are a unique\nAnd specific set of people they're quite unlike the general public first of all um they\nAre more obvious about their desires I've known a lot of people in local media who are less so this way but when they get to a higher level they almost all end up this way\nAnd that is that everything is the career everything is the big story every thing is that moment landing the big story landing the scoop and Trump learned that\nHe also learned that most of them don't make very much money and they certainly don't have as much money as the people there covering and covering\nAnd he learned you could take them on a nice dinner you could you could use the spoiled and mentor a of an extra seat on your jet\nAnd let them tag along and you would buy them I mean Scarborough and make a were bought there's there's video of them on their show talking about how lavish the accommodations he provided them he bought them\nAnd when he was done with them a toss them aside that's why they hate him hate him so much\nBut because of all that I don't think Trump takes anything the media attacks him with I don't think he takes it personally because he understands what they are he understands why they're doing what they're doing and it is that he is resolute in the face of that\nAnd that's what it it it's it's it's almost pathological it they can't touch him the kid didn't him because he doesn't care he doesn't care he understands that he knows what they're doing he's resolute despite it and he pushes on through and that's what makes them crazy as they don't\nHave the power they normally have to

United Nation a United Nation they don't want people having civil substantive serious debates\nThey want centralized power\nWith these corporations and these executives believe they can uh they control outcomes in this society\n\nThat we're going to talk more about this as the program goes on but I Want to hit this issue again a birthright\nCitizenship you are hearing\nPeople who make absolutely no sense on this issue saying that the president cannot use an executive order to address birthright citizenship again my caviar ideas that I Know the courts are going to be hostile to any effort\nTo curb birthright citizenship statutory or by executive order\nBut I hear people say a statute will be stronger first of all they're not going to get a statue because it'll be filibustered in the Senate so it's a non issue the Democrats aren't going to allow it they want birthright citizenship\nSome of the filibuster rule in the Senate there will be no statute the president is aware of that\nThe commentators on TV even some conservatives they pretend they're not aware of it but we're all aware of it or what have been done already they said the same\nPeople in Congress refused to build physical barriers on our southern border to protect this country and to enforce our immigration laws suddenly they're going to pass a statute\nOutlawing birthright citizenship but why passed a statute if in fact as the laugh says on some of these conservatives say 'cause they're no not things\nThat birthright citizenship is in the fourteenth amendment which is what Paul\nRyan said preposterous\n\nIf that's the case then how is the statue gonna fix statue won't fix it because they're saying you have to amend the constitution\nWhen's the last time we actually amended the constitution the old fashioned way or want it to the old fashioned ways but a long time why because the left changes the constitution all the time and now when we want to address something that they did\nOutside the constitution now we're told we have to pass a constitutional amendment helps there\nAs we discuss the other day\nAs I discuss this Daniel Horowitz from conservative review discussed with me\nBirthright citizenship was not\nActually implemented in this country into the sixties and seventies then Nineteen sixties and early Nineteen seventies by the bureaucracy\nBy the bureaucracy\n\nIt wasn't in the constitution no court ordered it and no statute was passed so why do we feel men in the constitution or pass a statute while the better chance in front of the Supreme Court if that's the case we have no chance in front of the Supreme Court\n\nTennis much as this battle of a cabinet was so crucial\nHe's not Clarence Thomas he's not Antonin Scalia and neither is John Roberts it's just what it is\n\nThe president happens to be right about this the president happens to be right about the constitution the president happens to be right about an executive order however it turns out and all of his critics happened to be wrong he knows more than I Do\nAs Daniel Horowitz put up there on the conservative review today leftist concocted an ingenious game of judicial supremacy isn't that great say one way rash it for their policy outcomes heads they win tails they win yet the so called conservative legal community chooses to play the game\nNo where is this more evident than in the debate over so called birthright citizenship\nWithout left cherry picks one non binding footnote of a terrible decision misrepresenting another bad decision that violates previous

West Virginia he is a conservative he is a constitutional is he doesn't have to wait for the Democrats to vote to figure out the way he should vote he will not vote for Chuck Schumer to be the Democrat leader in the United States Senate how are you Patrick Morrisey\nGreat mark Levin thanks for having me on your show I'm a big fan and I'm really excited to be on line and talking about the big issues and the U.S Senate race is going to be a lot of fun\nWell it's my pleasure go ahead and tell us the big issues where you stand and where your opponent stands\nAbsolutely well I think as many people are beginning to really follow the U.S Senate race in West Virginia they're seeing that there couldn't be a bigger contrast between the Republican and the Democratic candidates\nEh let's start at the base is I'm a conservative fighter mark you know I took on the Obama administration I sued them we had big victories in court it was West Virginia that led the way to defeat the\nObama power plants that was just this amazing power grab over the United states energy supply\nWe lead the way built the twenty seventh state coalition we stopped Rocco bomb at the U.S Supreme Court fact it was the last major decision\nOf Justice Scalia's light that was the big deal we've let on many other big issues taking on the federal government in their own lawful unless I'm strongly pro life\nEndorsed by all the pro life groups because not only check a box on the issue of why I Believe in the sanctity of life and I'm actually in part responsible for a lot of the changes which have evolved in West Virginia so we have protections for the unborn\nI'm also strongly in support of the second amendment in our gun rights and we're working tirelessly to help President Trump we say President Trump has been doing incredible things for the country and for West Virginia and I'm proud to stand with them or running a campaign partnering up with this president\nBecause he's helping turn us around now the flip side of that\nIs you're dishonest Washington liberal Joe mansion and he's just another one of these Washington politicians he went to Washington he drank the water and now he's in ... with Chuck Schumer Nancy Pelosi and all the radical liberals including Hillary Clinton on the issue of why\nHe sold out west Virginia values he actually literally had signs saying that he supports plant paranoid\nAnd also that he stood with life on the issue of life that's not a multiple choice questions you need someone who's ... who opposes taxpayer funding of abortion who wants to stop the government funding a plant paranoid on the issue is Second Amendment we need someone who's going to stand against the gun grabbers matching\nIs best known for offering a big gun control bill and on the issue of coal\nOh as to say is this he doubled down on his support for Hillary Clinton even after she said we're going to put a lot of coal miners and coal companies out of work big differences between dishonest Washington liberal Joe mansion\nAnd conservative fighter Patrick Morsi and that's why we're going to win on election day in West Virginia\nYou know Patrick Morrisey there's a reason why Donald Trump keeps coming back to West Virginia to support you just because he not only support to he doesn't trust Joe mansion and I notice throughout his career in the Senate he waits and weights and waits to see if he can throw a safe vote\nThat isn't with his party he doesn't lead on anything am I right about this\nYou are right and I think vice president Mike Pence said it very well he said quote Joe ... is always there when you don't need him and your great linemen are terrific line and and really accurate about match\n... now what are your priorities among other you you mentioned a number of them\nIs both she supported the president's tax cuts you reject this caravan you went to wall on the southern border\nRunning man well absolutely so let's START I agree with all the above the Trump's tax cuts are good for West Virginia not only doubling the standard deduction which helps a lot of hardworking\nFamilies and our state the lowering of the rates are but we also have other changes here they're really helping lift our economy up to levels we haven't seen before when you combined the Trump tax cuts more with the deregulatory approach\nI mean let's face it onto the ... Obama era they tried to put a lot of organized for profit businesses out of work and certainly they went after fossil fuels I get up and I said no to that nonsense but I've followed those lawsuits and President Trump well\nHe's just finishing the job I was basically the bridge to President Trump who's done so many great things for our economy and for energy jobs in West Virginia we need to continue that approach of lowering our taxes\nAnd then ultimately deregulating so the regulations fulfill a more basic purpose markets you know were meant to be a free people that means we should try to solve most of our problems either\nIndividually or within our communities on the local level when you have federal regulations in place there has to be a very compelling health said well for its back to it and it obviously must comply with the constitution and that's part of the problem with the ...

your own life that you get involved with a handful of people and make sure they vote and imagine if you do that and then a few others do that and so forth and so it would be a big deal it really

days\nFighting for it or we will end up with a very different looking country I'll tell you ... as far as what's happening in my district people came home Halloween you want to spend time with your kids\nEnjoy your evening together and mailboxes were filled up with an attack peace where the the mail or one half of it was just a hanger hanger like to put your coat on and one line that said Lee Zeldin plan for women's health care\nIt's discussing what we're on again one and all across the country I'm fighting for my daughter's I'm fighting for this country this nation and we got to vote [noise]\nThat is incredible absolutely incredible and you know what ... ... ah the any any notion of civility has gone out the window with the media or with your opponents or it just anything flies so they they they send out hangars\nOr trying to imply that that's your view of how women should be treated with the unwanted pregnancies\nThat is right at posted it on my my Twitter account at least ... yelled the eye and you could you could see it said\nUh it it was set by the New York state Democratic Party and my opponent's campaign and and my my son was asked about doubled down I mean like proud of this ... and ... you know right after Maxine Waters a few months back and told\nHer followers not just in that audience but all across America to be confronting opposition right after that\nWe had someone who showed up at one of my campaign offices confronted one of my volunteers said that every a supporter of of President Trump and congressman as Eldon should be killed and then tried to run him over with a vehicle you had to dive out of the way the kinds of getting arrested it's we're fighting for a future\nThat I mean I Am about\nI mean I I think things are going well in this country I see the Labor Department numbers were wage growth is now up over three percent the highest\nNumber down ten years and unemployment set of forty nine year low we still have challenges but I have an opponent and they're running all across America they want to oppose resistant peach and obstruct everything and anything I Do not want Nancy Pelosi the speaker I Do not want Maxine Waters to become chair of the house financial services committee so\nThis country that I'm willing to lay down my life for on the battlefield is one is worth fighting for in Congress it's an honor to be there\nAre but I'm not going to be intimidated I'm not going to tower I Know obviously that you never will your your audience won't uh and that's the country that we're fighting for its only six days we could do this we can keep control of the house we can even pick up a few seats in the Senate and the alternative scares the heck out of me\n... and if the nation wants to help you and the people in on Long Island in your area there you want to get involved where did they go\n[noise] developing for Congress dot com or you can visit my Web site on Facebook at le ... and I mentioned my Twitter at least ... wherever you\nLive if you have a ... a Republican who's running against one of these on hand just leftists who want to take our country in the wrong direction you're fighting on the street on your block with your neighbors with your friends no one can stay home you can't wake up on November seventh\nComplaining about the country that we have if we don't fight for these next six days you have to earn that with your vote\nSenior such a great patriot and that's all we have to do with men and women all over the world who are facing enemies their lives are endangered they've left their comfort them home and their families as you did a some years back\nAll we have to do is vote make sure five or six people who we know of like minded also boat and we will strongly a defeat the other side\nThat's right and and our national security I mean the embassy in Israel moving to Jerusalem the president not just fulfilling his own campaign promise and doing the right thing but filling promises of presidents past withdrawing from the fatally flawed Iran nuclear deal\nWithdrawing from the Paris accords were we were making these commitments on our end Waller country like China was agreeing to actually increase emissions\nMaking your understanding their enemies do not respect\nWeakness they only respect strength we can't be silent not because we want more but because you want to prevent it we have right now a president and a national security team behind them\nThat is ensuring that American exceptionalism is nothing to apologize for we are respected again and I love it\nWe have to continue going in the right direction and the president needs people in Congress who are going to support him when he has a backbone standing up to threats to our country that is how we protect ourselves the next generation that's how we protect our freedoms and liberties and I'll tell you as an army reservist\nI Know that if I was ever sent into harm's way I Would be sent to win or not sent that all where we've had conflicts in the past where we send our troops in harm's way and we set them up to fail so I feel good as", "year": "2018", "show_name": "Mark Levin Show", "city":
