and foremost whether it's Spartacus or Pocahontas or whatever\nIt matters who in what Donald Trump is represent what he's accomplished and you really have to screw up you really have to grow up in order to be an incumbent president and lose if you're running for re election I'm going to come back around to this Saudi Arabian thing here in a minute\nSo when you put this in context you think about why because for folks on the left and there's just beside themselves they can't figure out how in the world I mean on and not get ration day I had to listen to pin heads around their\nHours oh he's he's out after that I mean well first is going to be a beach but he'll he would never be reelected I mean people already seen the mistake they\nMade like you you you really just do not get it\nThe first thing is when you're putting that in context you have to take a look at\nWhat it would take for someone who voted for that President not to vote for them again\nI mean yes you can have new voters that come about over the course of four years and if all those new voters leaned heavily in one direction maybe just maybe you could move the needle and by the way I keep track of that and I'm going to give you a little piece of a story I'm actually working out for my local shows here tomorrow\nJust wrapped up the research on this little while ago checking in on the state's voter registration and for info you're interested to know how Florida has gone over the past couple of years since the twenty sixteen presidential election well yeah I was up\nBut it did break for Donald Trump beyond that at since the twenty sixteen presidential election through today there are thirty thousand fewer Democrats registered to vote\nYeah thirty thousand fewer registered Democrats in Florida over the past two years we have fifty one thousand additional Republicans registered to vote oh by the way\nProbably not going to make the news anywhere even stateside\nAnd do we do have quite a few independent set of registered to vote over a hundred thousand there\nMy point being even to the extent that we've seen people from a point of partisanship registered to vote like they're all Democrats even though you would think that every young person you hear all the time all the young people without registering to vote and then they're all Democrats well we heard from Joshua\nTwenty two years old Washington DC in biology left our\nWho's a thoughtful conservative so if that can happen in DC well it can happen in other places too and so don't be surprised that's part of the story beyond it you've got to think about what's happening here and there is a lot a lot to feel good about\nFirst ... you take a look at the economy we have the best the economy in a generation I never faulted millennials for buying into the hope and change bull crap\nThey didn't know better they went through school here in front of a bunch of people who didn't get in the education establishment they get out there and go yeah this really does suck they hear Obama and they go with I guess he's right until they actually are given an opportunity to see what the US Economy is capable of and then you've got some eyes are open\nThat's the gun at me and the generation but we have two Supreme Court justices tax reform the end up the Affordable CARE Act mandate Lewis unemployment rate in forty nine years in by the way record unemployment for all demographics except Asian and white men\nYeah remember our job at the white men white man\nIn Asia and the only ... only demos out there that are not at a record low unemployment\nRight out oh by the way but\nYou also have the biggest increase in that take home pay and thirty two years by the way I mentioned that I Believe on friday and I receive some notes from some angry folks on the left always happy to try to deal with them but I Want to lay the groundwork for that one once again because not hard to get there it is a little math\nAnd it's easier than calculating the Pocahontas math if you're the Boston Globe listening\nIt works like this you take the overall salary that the average person was making last year you take a look at what it is today by the way it's pays about two point eight percent base salary year over year okay All right\nThen you take a look at the average bonus that has been paid out so far this year when you do that it gives you a little bit over three percent\nAnd then you take a look at the average net benefit of the tax cuts which happens to be for the average fulltime employed person about Eighteen hundred bucks this year you put all that together and boom you get six point seven percent\nAnd complicated to size histories one side of the facts Israel and by the way in the event that you're the angry left as that goes yeah but I think they benefit for the tax cuts well\nThat's because you know where your employer probably David about it which by the white personally thirty million people who are in that situation where employers that might get adjustments you didn't make adjustments if you're not seeing it it'll be reconciled when you file your taxes and congratulations you'll have likely given the government and interest free one but\nIt's still there because well over Ninety percent of people do benefit from the new tax law\nBut that's all the cool stuff right I mean all of that progress that I just decided\nTo ask yourself well if you voted for Donald Trump why would you vote against that in two years answer is if anything he probably is attracted more votes ... if he didn't nothing else no other accomplishments they always status quo from here until twenty twenty it probably gets reelected\nAnd again sixty five percent of presidents who run for re election in so if he were less successful than he is he would still likely be reelected in twenty twenty but here's the the next point and this is the under stated point\nI'm going to work on something conceptually before I give you some facts will do that in a little bit\nHow often were we talking about domestic terrorism thing about that how often did we have radicalized domestic homegrown terrorism in the United states\nPrior to Donald Trump becoming president that was a fairly regular occurrence wasn't it\nYou take a look at not having that problem\nYou take a look at not having Tea Party and and white people\nSpecifically oh these are angry white men that are singled out by the Obama administration as the number one focus on the watch list and instead you have people that do fit the profile or potential Islamic terrorism that had been number one domestically under the Trump Administration gets what\nDoes it make the news if they stop it before it happens which happens a lot\nWhich happens a lot\nAnd the foreign policy success I'm not just talking about North Korea\nAnd the fact that to date we've released cat to Russia at bay or that Syria as much of a mess as it is\nHas been dealt with about as he's fully and with as little damage to the United states and our interest as we could have hoped toward the spotlight and talking about all that might even talking about the trade deals that had been worked out this far to our benefit that are often under Scott\nI'm Talking about the eradication of ISIS but also the implications for other parts of the middle east now one of the amazing turnabout and all this had been Saudi Arabia\nWe actually had Saudi Arabia under the Trump Administration say that they are with us with Israel a Middle Eastern country\nSaying there with Israel against Iran\nThat's holy cow immaterial now that's where this whole situation with hey we got this journalist who by the way you know has a interesting history of his own that goes into a consulate in Turkey we have some uh folks from uh the the Saudi regime that enter\nAnd a few hours later they leave and you know probably not putting his foot beat up by eating ... so we we have a missing journals okay\nThat's where this whole situation gets complicated because we've made some progress with Saudi Arabia but the problem is back to my sliding scale morality if you are\nNot there anymore all at the started your compass you can become pretty evil at the root of it\nAnd it's important to know who and what these people are that we're still dealing

... who has gone missing two weeks ago today\nAnd at this point it's rather obvious that we've heard the rumors that have come out of Saudi Arabia or the other day I mean like we as a crazy thing yeah there's a little interrogation and yeah you know I mean that it would just\nI just really hated when when we accidentally kill I I'm Sorry sorry we won't do it again really\nThat apparently is what we're eventually gonna get or at least that's the rumor of what we are going to get out of Saudi Arabia while also having the assertion that uh hey the king this young and and hip king who say women could draw right now I mean come on I mean it and he like yeah when they get dry\nSo he's so did that guy he doesn't know anything and and he's not supposed to do anything\n[noise] so that's where we we are in this process but the the ... the president was even talking about that today he said that for the record I have no financial interest in Saudi Arabia but he also said that he spoke with the gang and hey he denies everything denies buys everything so\nThis is difficult it's difficult for a lot of reasons\nWe don't know the exact truth obviously\nAnd you had a lot of folks to say yeah you know like shoot sanctions bring it on I mean let's just whatever with Saudi Arabia is the first thing is one be thankful that we're very close very close to energy independence of this country by the way did you know that we are now\nThe world's largest producer of oil at not Saudi Arabia\nRussia us a topic right we're actually facing the get there in January we got there a little bit earlier it's also good about now because if Saudi Arabia and the influence they had 'em in OPEC but they decided hey you know what we don't like you putting pressure on us and they go ahead\nThat didn't dramatically reduce production you could see a spike in prices obviously that could hurt the economy boom he's you know what happens there so that's one thing we got to consider in this entire process but the bigger one again as you do have this new younger hip king in Saudi Arabia\nWho is like yeah women can can drive now I mean look how progressive I Am in in equal rights and all that\nHe's on board with us against Iran and with Israel where he can get that in the middle east you take it for sure\nThat is what complicates this deal but the problem is still is mentioned three law it's evil wherever it's it's found there's nothing good about it\nWe have had\nOne thousand five hundred and eighty nine Islamic terror attacks around the world so far this year we've had Ninety four hundred and eighty three people killed in additional Ninety six hundred injured oh by the way\nIslamic terror still alive and well it's real law and are the folks that governed under it still sponsor terrorism and the least of which is ... Iran but here's the problem the dirty little secret about sharia law in Islam in governments predominantly in the middle east\nThere are still over forty of them that carry the tenants of sharia\nIncluding by the way Saudi Arabia now\nWe haven't necessarily had on track record to see how long that's going to remain part of the government but the bigger problem is\nIf you're on board with shrimp your moral compass really sucks and if you were saying that you can like ah you know kill people and will because I don't know there are a woman they were raped or you're homosexual what else are you willing to do like this journalist thing for example so that's where this becomes the tangled Web\nAnd so it's it's easy to quarterback this thing it's much different to to be pragmatic

would you put a guy like me and the president in this box for after all the press and has done this guy's gotta go Saudi Arabia the lifting there are a lot of good people you can choose but NBS his\nPainted your country and painted himself\nLike Lindsey Graham did his version of coming out isn't it\nEver since the ... thing it's been a whole new Lindsey Graham\nAnd he's he's out he loved every minute of it I mean this is enjoyable for him\nMajor sanctioned the hell out of the old does you born and Lindsey Graham anyway a in this particular case that's what makes me nervous and it's what makes me not just the the idea that states in the hell out of okay well what happens for example of Saudi Arabia says you know what I Know we had\nKind of been with you on Israel and against Iran but uh you know\nWe aren't feeling quite as as cordial as we had previously what happens to them and what happens\nIf they say you know what we're just\nGoing to go ahead and turn off this begin to do back and see what happens to oil prices and see if we can do something or to wreck the economy a little bit there for you all Presidents Day\nAnd things that that could happen any number of different applications though I think it's easy for a Lindsey Graham who's out there and eleven every\nOf it enjoying this newfound freedom maybe being the person you always wanted to be that he finally feels that ... is kinda fascinating if you think about it and I digress here you have Lindsey Graham is like oh I came out maybe said things that it would that have always meant to be sane\nAnd people did\nYou know you're talking about the Trump effect I mean it would take a look at it and the Republican Party Mitch McConnell got an incredible reception in Kentucky the other night I mean what does that ever happen\n[laughter] I mean\nIt's an interesting day these people clearly enjoying this this newfound freedom and the Trump effect that has come over them\nBut it's complicated it's complicated so I don't know but let's just go sanction the hell out of them that's the best answer and I'm not sure that we're necessarily going to find our our friend who uh\nIs mysteriously well where exactly\nJamal is talking let's go to Aaron in Kansas Erin go\nOh just a quick question if the king denies any knowledge of it or not it was a body it's obviously is not in the consulate anymore\nUs a body this poor guys in a hole somewhere still being torture\nYou know it's an interesting thought a if you were going to be really I I don't know ... if you're going to engage in in a war game I mean I I suppose you could end up putting up any number of Syria is scenarios and least of which would be well maybe when you how the Saudi officials leave\nThe consulate they left with them\nYou know if you are there any number of things that can happen I'm not sure that it would make sense for him to remain there and be tortured because well you are and how many more potential witnesses add a lot more difficult situation for even turkey to account for at that point so\nOf all the scenarios that two weeks later he's still there being tortured I think would be among the least likely but hey to your point anything could be possible appreciate the call\nNow I've been talking about the oddities the oddities politically in in some of the assumptions that often are not

it was on Sunday on CNBC how Taylor Swift political adores men could become the biggest Red Bull ever at the polls ever as the polls [laughter]\nI mean OK okay maybe just maybe not how you thought\nHere's an actor last way pop star Taylor Swift made waves by breaking her stands up political neutrality and backing democratic congressional candidates in our home state of Tennessee\nThe effect of sweat surprise endorsement which was made the on Instagram post were felt right away as thousands of people between the ages of Eighteen and twenty nine registered to vote according to vote dot org\n[noise] okay now I'm\nGonna get straight to the point about the Taylor Swift the fact that some of the media recently has a couple of days ago we're still my gosh it's happening I think it's quite a down a little bit over the past the hour or so because I think more of them are like being pointed to the polls and going\nHey you say it was up in Tennessee or\nUm Taylor's specific endorsement of the Democrats\nSo Britain sending in tendencies US Senate race you see at the time of the endorsement Marsha Blackburn the Republican challenger in this race\nSheila's averaging that three point lead and the three most recent polls in Tennessee alright Blackburn three point lead and the three most recent polls prior to the Taylor Swift effect\nWhere is she today and the three most recent polls in that particular race early this now nine points\nSo oh\nNot exactly what you're probably thought would happen here so the Taylor Swift effect in the immediate aftermath of the race that she finally weighed in on is negative six\nPercent in a week so I like to say you got two sides to stories and one side the facts but here's the deal you got a lot of folks there if you play the millionaire the concept that for every action got the equal and opposite reaction rent or science guy on earlier in the show\nHere's the thing I'm In in the south in particular you\nHave a lot of folks that will end up getting energized about the moment you got celebrities that are weighing in\nAnd specifically when she ended up outing herself pretty much immediately or her lack of understanding of pretty much everything including the person she was endorsing\nState if you're in Tennessee and you're fine politics you might have noticed that she was a bit of an obvious hypocrites for a few reasons among others now\nShe said that Marsha Blackburn doesn't represent her tendency values but you see here is that the the dirty little details Taylor isn't actually from Tennessee she's from Pennsylvania Pennsylvania and she happened only moved\nTo Tennessee to pursue her music career in high school oh by the way she's lived there are less than half for life\nYou know in the you know Taylor Swift as to Tennessee values as say a Elizabeth Warren is due to Cherokee Indians you know the the person sometimes referred to as Elizabeth Warren better known as the bad Pocahontas that one now\nShe spoke up supporting L G being he writes\nCBP rights as far as her Tennessee value is by the way [noise] I guess what the Democrats the she endorsed\nBill Bratton thin he doesn't support gay marriage and a bunch of other issues he's on the record as much [laughter] so it's clear that she's never even looked into what he believes in no go\n\nAnd then you got the optics you see for maybe you could activate some of those young folks in Nashville better\nYeah but here's the thing anybody noticed that you got Taylor Swift endorsing an old white guy who\nDoes not support\nGay marriage and host of other old G Beatty rights that Taylor says are part of her tendency values from Pennsylvania so she's endorsing in the old white guy bat evil these days and leftist politics right over a younger woman\nHa ha interesting\nI mean and there's a lot more we we can continue down that rabbit hole but it's not necessary but you see those in Tennessee they pretty much get the point to and law yule log\nIn terms of tendency values I'm from suburban Georgia lived in Knoxville for a time when I was small and I'm pretty familiar with tendency values and they take a look at these celebrity in in Hollywood endorsements and ah well\nNot often impressed so it probably is going to continue to have the opposite of the fact that they weren't dissipating I mean come on\nAll these celebrity endorsements work right Katy Perry holding up Hillary Clinton's arm\nEither way it wasn't that an awkward moment\nI mean I did the trick always does\nAnd so here's the funny thing if you're taking a look at when celebrity endorsements actually matter well she kind of Mr moment you see it she actually wanted somebody with her Pennsylvania\nTendency L. J. B. T. writes values she could actually weighed in in the primary because Columbia University actually did prove that\nSome Democrats are impressed by celebrities for example Columbia University they did show pretty empirically that in the two thousand eight democratic presidential primary\nOprah Winfrey endorsement really did encourage an additional ... million people largely black do vote for ... Obama over Hillary Clinton\nSo it's only Taylor Swift had weighed in with her Pennsylvania\nAlgae B. T. Tennessee values maybe she wouldn't have ended up with an old white guy who doesn't support gay marriage or the L G. P. T. rights that made her look like she is as clueless as she actually is that she could have had somebody that\nYou know it was going to I don't know shake it off do whatever it is that she does these days but nice try Taylor nice try and find a way by the way as for tendency values part of the reason why you have the Democrat Bill Britain's and that is not supportive of those things\nEighty one percent of tennis fans are Christians fifty two percent of the evangelical variety\nOh by the way you might want to at least investigate the state that you claim to be from that you represent the values off than\nTwo sides to stories one side effects anyway uh we're we're just getting warmed up this hour Brian mud in for the gray one [noise] hard\nNews radio seven forty Katie are age ...\nI enjoy helping my listeners like Nathaniel who owe the iris tens of thousands in back taxes he told the IRS he didn't have the money to pay but it didn't matter they put a lean on his home anyway it's an annual heard how much I respect optimal tax relief\nSo he engage them optimum got the IRS to designate Nathaniel ... case as seat and see status currently\nNot collectible that's a big win because it basically says no use pursuing our client there's nothing to be gained here optimal kept finding on Nathaniel ... until the IRS agreed to a deal\nThat saved them thousands of resolve this tax that for good optimal knows that behind every tax problem are honest hard working Americans with families homes savings in paychecks that need protection they resolve over half a billion dollars in tax that for their clients now fuel back taxes to the IRS call my friends would opt them a tax relief\nHundred for nine nine sixty three hundred eight hundred for nine nine sixty three hundred and Eighteen hundred for nine nine sixty three hundred percent\n[laughter] the largest and what\nIs going on a good thing we know what's going on\nOn this and say here use radio seven forty J.

aggressive music or that in it\nWe're coming at ya but they're the same they come from the same cloth especially Springsteen were they were anti war uh they they are just so hypocritical I'm hoping that God that people are just not taken a serious anymore\nBut I can take I tell you this much in in Tennessee in particular there are some places where the celebrities going to play if you're in California I have no doubt that plays in fact there is research that did show up from Columbia University back to two thousand uh eight\nA presidential primary to where there are Democrats or a percentage of them that are activated by celebrity but you've got to you know somebody's got to be open to the message is what I talk about when a I'll describe being politically persuasive one the most common questions I get how is it that I find somebody who I can uh you know convince of of what's right\nWell it the first thing is you got to find somebody who's open to the information if you find somebody has closed minded\nWell it doesn't matter how hard to try and they're not to the information so when the case of the celebrities when you're talking about what's going on in Tennessee oh well you've got a large swaths of that population that is not not going to be turned on\nBy a celebrity endorsement but what's worse and this is the most of the offensive thing and I say there's not really a true southerner in the sense that I'm from suburban Atlanta\nAnd to be honest with you I didn't even know what the the saying get out of the judgment until I was sixteen that kinda thing didn't come up where where I was from but I Do understand a lot of southern culture and\nYou know when you say that you have tendency now use\nAnd you're not only not from Tennessee where you're from Pennsylvania\n[laughter] same thing too many of the folks in Tennessee that those people and so it's kinda like a no offense to you and in in Jersey job but I mean in Tennessee you know Jersey not not the best reputation so anyway it's a good point\nStates all jerseys kind of cut in half you know ah almost at the center of the state\nUm for the most part I'm and I'm Down in the you know the more conservative area but I just hope and the guy that these numbers who who who rely on these celebrities are there political opinions are shrinking more and more and more that's that's my oh\nYeah I I think the only celebrity that are necessary have to worry about in terms of this cycle\nIs the president of the United states\nI mean there is an irony there are certain extent you know he's obviously successful independent of the celebrity but you know I just ah\nPointing out with somebody otherwise probably will as I don't appreciate uh Joe in Menendez I mean come on really you got some work to do in Jersey oh let's go to a liberal land in Arizona not happy with what's going on in North Dakota Avon\nOh I'm not liberal I have always been on both sides of the fence and honestly with the canvas sounding egotistical you should have somebody called me back and let you let me tell you my entire story but in order to cut it short a very quickly\nI didn't vote for Obama I ah I'm I'm totally believe in gay rights I slowly and believe in freedom of religion I fully believe that a woman's right to a woman's right to choose [noise]\nFrom east Texas a and\nA thousand miles to west\n\nOkay [noise]\nSometimes you get more talking about Obamacare [noise]\nWhat you're going to do about that\nThe fact that you favor raising taxes and Ted Cruz doesn't [noise] so let's talk about [noise]\nA squirrel\nHow 'bout that that's what you're left\n[noise] even CNN came out today and said that ... ... a lot about his mother he loves to tell on the stump that his mother is a life long Republican\nBut even she is supporting him 'cause the\nBay does built in a lab they go in and go right look\n... Chuck Schumer needs another Democrat urine Nancy Pelosi leftist Democrat when you're speaking to democratic groups you tell them how liberal you are open borders sanctuary cities illegal aliens you were a gun grabber tell the gun grabbing liberals that just don't do it in public\nUh your tax razor your tax and spend her you're a liberal and every issue\nAn ounce to uh the right groups that you think that kneeling for the national\nAnthem is quote the most American thing you'd just don't say that down at the BWI ... VW the VFW hall\nDon't say that down to be up W off your speaking before the American legion don't tell them that cake because veterans don't like don't say that to the cops course looks like almost all the cops have endorsed Ted Cruz so we'd product when it cups anyway\nSo why don't you just call the cops the new Jim Crow which he did I guess that was designed when black votes\nThey're black cops to their black people that are protected by cops and their families there are blacks were family members of victims of blacks who shot at cops her fault cops but I guess if you weren't going to win the cops anyway 'cause you don't like law enforcement 'cause they've arrested you on two different occasions\nOne for trying to flee the scene of a drunk driving accident\nAnd another for attempted burglary I guess if you really don't like the cops anyway it comes naturally to you to insult them\nI wouldn't call that courage and I wouldn't call that Texan\nBut the beauty is starting on Monday in Texas we have\nThe first day of early voting\nAnd I'm going to ask you today when you get home to take a moment look it up and see where your early voting locations are here me out on this here me out just as important\nWhenever you go in to vote\nVoting is typically in the county that you live in not where you work the county where you live now there will be some distinctions the parishes of Louisiana for instance there will be some quirks in each state look it up it's probably very easy\nIt's been just a few moments on the inner webs look it up figure it out\nAnd then for a lot of folks early voting will start next week look up when early voting starts and where you can only vote", "year": "2018", "show_name": "Mark Levin Show", "city": "Houston", "day": "17"}
