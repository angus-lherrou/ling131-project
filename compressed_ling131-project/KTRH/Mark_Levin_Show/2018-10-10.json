president Donald\nJohn Trump not ching one more victory and his first what a twenty two months in office the Trump search scored a hundred and Democrats scored zero\nThe economy is percolating like crazy the Mexico Canadian trade battle is won by Trump including South Korea next fall will be the God does he does in Beijing and communist red China that\nTakes about five hundred billion dollars a year so the last ten years they've taken out something like five trillion dollars to build their country and at the end of the day they need us a lot more than we need them\nSo when Trump gets done with the Chinese is going to be the same thing that happened with Canada Mexico and South Korea and now according harassment and it came out today that Trump's approval rating is sort of fifty one percent\nSo whether it's the economy immigration are federal judges I could not think\nOf a better president than Donald John Trump he makes Reagan almost looked like a liberal because unlike Reagan and the bushes who were pen cushions this guy fights back when Trump is hit its back harder what he did on a Monday Night last night\nWith the Supreme Court saying that I hereby find you're not guilty judge Kavanaugh your an innocent man\nAnd he went after the Democrats with the other eight members of the Supreme Court sitting there and the Republicans to me it was beautiful\nIt was wonderful this guy's got no backup and them and only half stack up it continues to teach all of us about winning in Trump's world it's about the fight and you're fighting spirit and your ability to be bare knuckle and think about this Kavanaugh\nWas a Yale middle aged judge who are educated and yell undergraduate and Moscow spend about twelve years on the second circuit court of appeals he's not the kind of guy to fight like Trump\nBut when they push Kevin off further and further and further cabin all kind of local looked over\nTrump and said that's my model that's the guy I Want to be they never imagined now there will be middle aged judge from Yale\nHeaded in them to fight back and no holds barred straight broiler fashion But Kevin all studied Trump he learned from Trump so all of his brilliance and eloquence all of his or all of his grade school girls' basketball coach in your teaching at Harvard would not helping all to win this fight\nUs people like Chris Wallace of Fox News who said after the testimony of that liar and she was a liar Christine for she lied about what happened at a maximum she was mistaken at a minimum we might go over that later\nBut Chris Wallace of Fox News said after she testified that it's over for the Republicans the Republicans had a bad day I'm a trial attorney I see it all the time a witness testifies and and you buy it hook line and sinker and then the other witness testifies and you say you know what\nI don't know what to believe now Kevin all he he in a sense hypnotic laid took on Trump's personality any thought no holds barred bare knuckles and guess what Kevin all one by Trump rules he knows that if you want something in your life bad enough you gotta fight for justice Trump proved\nAnd ah he won the Supreme Court after\nChristine forward testified about the second front door and about afraid to fly and about the cost of phobia and how it changed your life\nAnd I thought okay that's under refuted evidence Kevin I'll get up and spoke and you know what I thought I cannot believe cabinet and then I waited for the next week to transpire and it did and the next week clearly demonstrated that Christine forward was not telling the truth what was she lied or not it's a different matter\nBecause she said there were four witnesses and every one ever witnesses refuted a story or had no memory of the gathering question whatsoever the therapists notes were critical of this\nThat she released to the Washington Post but not to the U.S Senate committee she said for boys tried to rape her when she was in her late teens and the time was in the Nineteen eighties now she says it was one boy\nAnd it was a in at the age of Fifteen not or late teens and it was Nineteen eighty two not the Nineteen eighties and she flipped on that because in the Nineteen eighties Brett Kavanaugh was not even in Maryland He was in Connecticut\nSo everything she said that the therapist was probably accurate because she said at six years ago before politics entered the fracas\nSo when she said for boys tried to write for\nShe she was in her late teens what Eighteen or Nineteen years old and the Nineteen eighties what Nineteen eighty four eighty five eighty six\nThat didn't fit the scenario of Brett Kavanaugh so she flipped and change what she was saying\nIn order to try to take Kevin down and it didn't work\nAnd the second front door was put in and twenty overweight and twenty nine because she wanted her psychologist slash therapist to have an office and the direct entry into her house into a room so the second front door with support and not because she was scared of only one exit but because a person she wanted to run out some of her house\nTo a small business owner a psychologist to have a direct entry way\nOf course the other thing was she was afraid to get on planes her boyfriend of many years testify they took single propeller planes all over Hawaii that she traveled to Haiti travel do ally travel to Central America traveled to South America travel to Israel and travel to Europe\nHow is it does she swim all of these places hell no she flew everywhere including on single propeller planes which are quite claustrophobic if she was so nothing she said at any relationship to reality and over the week delay brought about by Jeff Flake\nWhose last name by adjective describes his character refuted what she said and that's why Susan Collins put up\nOn Saturday about three o'clock and gave that great speech I never thought I Would say this\nSusan Collins is a profile in courage as is Lindsey Graham Mitch McConnell Brett Kavanaugh and of course the president Donald John Trump those are the big winners and now today Brett Kavanaugh his first day on the U.S Supreme Court I'm sure he's going to do great\nBut do not think for a moment in the fight is now over it's only just begun you fool we've got four more weeks to go\nI cannot imagine and America when Nancy Pelosi in charge of the house and Chuck Schumer\nIn charge

in Washington DC I get Marines presidents here they'll cutting him in for mark lemon John please go ahead\nAnd show them following this thing for an tally from start to where it is now and\nAbsolutely I agree with your opening first off facts are stubborn things you know and and the words of our\nPresident John Adams if you're just dissect it and look strictly at ... and you go off the values of the country that you don't proven guilty it's absolutely mind boggling oh okay oh no kidding of course you know this guy he's guilty\nJohn last night I watched some of the left as media today talk about how how unfair it was\nThat the president declared a innocent a bread Kevin isn't that what are you aren't you innocent until proven guilty and then once in a case and this wasn't closes wasn't fifty one forty nine give me some small example Rachel Mitchell who I think that a lousy job is to prosecute drinks before the U.S Senate\nIt kind of walk a Christina for down to ... path when she oddly questionnaire about coaching a friend\nWho was taking a federal lie detector tests than I Am watching Rachel ... said she must know something and what she knew what was that the ex boyfriend oh Christine afford and bother why Christina forward cheated on the ex boyfriend has told his credit cards but I redress\nOr what it was the reason Rachel Mitchell said those questions about coaching a a friend protect going to lie detector test\nOr the under oath to a sworn affidavit that boy friend Christina forward to the Nineteen nineties said that she coached a friend of hers are female friend preparing to take us governor administer polygraph exam\nAnd so practically everything\nThat Christine Ford said was either a lie or a fall sewed whether it's the front door the fear of flying not taken airplanes whether it was coaching someone on a lie detector test\nShe did coach somebody on a lie detector test so Christine afford lied about little things that a lot about the big things and assuming she lied John what does that mean for Brett Kavanaugh's sanity and for his status does not mean he's innocent until proven guilty\nWithout a doubt that only conclusion one could come to feel absolutely sad for the for the family and I feel a lot of fear of getting out of a tactic is actually allow\nThat because you now hey take somebody a lesser to a lesser income in life or whatever the case may be a you know sometimes they're just coming back or something like that there could be no coming back whether whether you know\nJust the mere fact that it can be absolutely false at something like that you know gets thrown at someone and that's why as\nWhen John Waters cabin all go to get back his reputation if you're in the marine corps if some other fellow marine a woman accused you of ...\nDeep and there was no evidence that took place she didn't know where it happened I didn't know when it happened I didn't know how it happened and the four witnesses she possessed applied to be witnesses turned out to be non witnesses because they didn't they didn't they didn't see what she said they saw\n... and here still found guilty about and bounce out of the marine corps where would you go to get back to your reputation\nRight\n[laughter] that would that would be on the road and wouldn't come back you know but then again I wouldn't get their due process from such a thing\nAnd you know John I I'm a criminal defense attorney I've been in the attorney general's office when someone comes in and says I was sexually assaulted unlike many other crimes I tend to believe them if you come in to me and say you know what uh\nUh someone stole my Chevrolet I'm not going to question you to say wanted someone still for no it was a share of her life so if you go in and say my left foot turning I'm not going to say what do what you mean you're right elbow no but when it comes to sexual assault\nTen to twenty percent of the time there are false allegations\nOf sexual assault that later on proves to be absolutely alive for example the Innocence Project has listed hundreds and hundreds of men who've been exonerated years later\nWho were wrongfully convicted of sexual assault Gregory counts in Van Dyke Perry spent two black guy spent thirty seven years in jail unfolds rape charges there was a host or university case were for college man that hubs or were chores and raping an Eighteen year old fellow students\nThey came out a year later she made it all up and it was a lie there's thousands of examples how a woman or man falsely accused is somewhat of a sexual assault for all kinds of reasons and all I'm saying is\nGive Brett Kavanaugh due process the right to cross examination the right to confront its accusers the right to be in the same room and look or in the eye which the Senate denied and now that we took ... know Jeff Flake oddly enough it was a good thing it took an extra week because conservative media\nTore apart the story of Christian afford improve that she was either a ... or lie or or both\nAnd they could prove that Brett Kavanaugh was in fact innocent and not even present\nCom or call eight six six eighty eight Bible that's eight six six

latest at the top of the hour news radio seven point Katie our age [noise]\n\nWhen I was saying can I put to rest the idea that this president is not normal I hear\nAbout the norms of the presidency let's talk about norms of presidency\nBack to Bush forty one read my lips no new taxes was\nThat normal how about the eight years of a William Jefferson Clinton sexually assaulting Kathleen Willie inside the White House raping one eight abroad Rick having sexual relations with numerous interns including Monica Lewinsky then he violate the norms of the presidency moving on to Bush forty three\nIncrease taxes increased Rosa regulations greatly enlarge the role of the federal government got us involved in a war in Iraq that caused four thousand of our best cost trillions of dollars Iraq has lost now part of Iran that Bush forty three get us into the norms of the presidency is that normal then\nYou had Brock Hussein Obama who won an MTV and talked about using cocaine and other illegal drugs while president on MTV is that the norm of the presidency so please save me liberal media the idea that somehow this president forty five is violating the norms of the presidency\nThat John F. Kennedy violate the norms and the presidency when he passed off as a young in turns to\nMale cohorts in the White House to perform oral verbal services on them was that part of the norms and the president's even LBJ lied about the Vietnam War getting sixty thousand of my generation killed many murdered that Nixon violate the norms of the presidency\nWith water great in line that he violated how 'bout Jimmy Carter his mirror presidency violated the norms of the presidency so please save me the embarrassment\nOf trying to convince me that Trump is somehow\nViolating the norms of the presidency as if Obama and Bush and Clinton\nAnd Bush and LBJ and John Fitzgerald Kennedy and everyone else violated the norms and the presidency please save me\nLet's continue our way of sharing and Downingtown, Pennsylvania sharing welcome to the ... show please share and go ahead\nI I just wanted to learn a thank you for noting that list of people that were profiles in courage I totally agree with you I also wanted to add Chuck Grassley who you are wrong he really had to hold the line on some pretty\nStrong personalities you wanted to pull any direction they encourage it causes much trouble as great courage and I just wanted to ask him to the list and that was that otherwise I'm I really enjoy your show\nSharon thank you let me ask you shown as your question talking about the norms you know I'm Liz listening a liberal media today because they think Trump last night violated the norms of the President's Day by being political in front of the U.S Supreme Court\nDid Kamala Harris violate the norms of the presidency how about Cory Booker the one with the crazy eyes crazy eyes Booker\nDid he violate the norms of the Senate their behavior in front of Grassley in front of the nation Grassley cannot even make an opening statement into Kamala Harris and Cory Booker in the war hero Richard Blumenthal\nDid they violate the norms of the Senate and did that eight hundred people who showed up and about and I don't know how many two hundred arrest inside the Senate did violate the norms of the Senate do you think a little bit\nI think all violated annoyance than I think that behavior was extremely heinous and I think that you know age has now marker for maturity and I think it was terrible\n... and another point and the third debate I can recall Trump answering a question about whether he would accept the outcome the twenty sixteen election and the third debate Trump said well it depends on what happens and he didn't give a hundred percent yes answer Hillary Clinton\nAnd the liberal media viciously attack Trump for saying three weeks before the election in November I think I remember the eight twenty sixteen ... men I might not accept the election since the election\nAs Hillary Clinton and the Democratic party accepted the outcome of the twenty sixteen election and aren't having they become what they criticized\nOh absolutely and worse and worse because they are determined you can save\nThe devotion and dedication to things that Jeanette bringing his country together in any way it's terrible it's really very very bad and I know as far as\nHey it's sick about accepting the results of the election whether it's the Russian collusion delusion or whether it's all the other investigations because we have a foolish attorney general\nNamed Jeff Sessions who should resign as soon as he resigned from the Russian collusion delusion and as soon as he could not do his job as attorney general he should offered his resignation at that moment and right now the Senate seat would not be in democratic hands without Jones' character out of Alabama\nBut what happened is that that uh one Trump is criticized for not acting normally if this is abnormal\nIf this economy as a result of amoral abnormalities I say let's have more of it\nIf the southern border which has been guarded by this president is abnormal please give me more of it if we have the trade deficits we used to have with Canada and Mexico and South Korea this president has corrected the trade deficits and the only reason the communist read Chinese are doing what they're doing is they're going after the Trump voters\nThe Trump base in states like Iowa where the president's going to be the night\nAnd and at some point the Chinese need us more than we need them at some point they're going to recognize that they ripped off for five hundred billion dollars a year and that's way too much so\nFar this is abnormal Sharon I Want more abnormal because if this is a normal I cannot think of something better than what we have right now\nWell I'm with you and I also tests that they will not acknowledge anything good anything every bit as good and that they will acknowledge nothing good that Donald Trump has does Donald Trump never sit in front of everyone and said you know what I'm aren't perfect\nYou know he never did that so he tries he tried hard\nHard work and then for a million that doesn't have to do it right I alternate respect for him and they will not acknowledge anything\nAt that too is sick today Sharon we got her run thank you for calling from Pennsylvania Senator Chuck Schumer which they get out and vote\nIf you do not one Nancy Pelosi and Chuck Schumer to be controlling the legislative agenda for the last half of the president's first term get out and focus continue with more a seven seven three one two three one one still counting on the great American in for the great one mark\n\n\nHave promote the most frustrating things that

C. R. H. trafficking whether together here's Katie\nEvery name she supplied of witnesses turn out to be false every factual detail that she provided turn out to be false you know I think what happened Jeannie in reality\nIs that when you go to a therapist or to a doctor\nYou are incentivized to tell the correct story because you're seeking help\nFor your problem so if tomorrow Jeannie you go to a doctor and say my left hand is hurting\nThe doctor believes what you're saying if you go to a therapist has that Christine for dinner and twenty twelve and twenty Thirteen well before Brett Kavanaugh percolated and she told the therapist that there were four boys you tried to write me when I was in my late teens and the mid Nineteen eighties you know what I Believe that happened\nI Believe something fundamentally bad happened to her steam Ford which is why she's been seeking mental health for all these years\nAnd probably what she told the therapist incentivized to do to do so to get help was accurate that four boys tried to rape her in her late teens and the mid Nineteen eighties I Believe her\nBut somehow in her mind shared recovered memory instead of four boys it became one instead of her late teens and became the age of Fifteen instead of the Nineteen eighties and became Nineteen eighty two because Brett Kavanaugh was available and Marilyn\nIn Nineteen eighty two to be around Christine forward\nBut you see the media doesn't pursue that angle do I think something happened to that woman yes\nAnd I think what she told the therapist and twenty twelve and twenty Thirteen was accurate when she sold the therapist who rented a room in our house that cause sort of put the second front door in our house so patients could come in and out of her house she accurately told the therapy\nSix years ago that four boys tried to write me in the in my late teens\nAnd the Nineteen eighties then sell them out in her mind to get fame or to get money she decided to switch it up a little bit instead of four boys she said it was one instead of late teens that I was Fifteen set of the Nineteen eighties let's make it Nineteen eighty two\nAnd so somehow her mind is twisted in turn by left wing democratic politics in Stamford University\nAnd she could not recognize reality which is why she did not want to come forward because she wasn't clear about what happened and it took the Democrats are wrongfully leak her name which by the way it's a crime Dianne Feinstein to office it was a crime so as to incentivize and encourage them require her to come forward and won the Senate said\nWhen the Senate said will come to you in California\nWill make it private her lawyers Deborah cats and others did not tell their client that offer was made because they wanted a public humiliation a Brett Kavanaugh and that's what happened\nOther people have on the radio has said she was a con artist because her answers or so perfect for um her response is drew out\nI'm feeling sympathy they were absolutely perfect I'm can make you on her side and afraid to challenge her\nI'm sure Deborah cats who's a democratic activist in California Lawyer\nReferred by the way by Dianne Feinstein can you imagine a senator referring a witness to a particular client that's a friend of yours in which case later on you have to judge the credibility of witness\nThat you have given that witness a lawyer that's another completely different issue\nBut this woman probably had something happen in her life ... involving those four boys that tried to write a paper and that's damaged her life but it didn't damage your life so much that you didn't successfully complete high school without incident didn't damage your life so much you didn't get two master's degrees and a

confederacy\nIs and was\nThe Democratic party they're the ones who declared civil war on my country and killed about six hundred thousand total soldiers so that Democratic Party is the part of the Ku Klux Klan as the party of Jim Crow Democratic Party is the party of lynchings\nThe Democratic party is the party of the destruction of public education currently and the welfare system it's responsible for most of the criminal disasters as say like in the city of Chicago\nThe Democratic party from reconstruction the Ku Klux Klan Jim Crow lynchings collapse of public education in fact about eight percent of Detroit or Chicago public school students that are African American read at the appropriate level\nAnd so you're talking about a massive dumbing down of the population to keep them on the modern plantation which\nIs the Democratic party so sunny that preserved behavior sing from Democrats has been repeat it for the past hundred and fifty or some called them the demon rats they're not Democrats or the demon rats\nAnd what what we stand the restaurants and the and the airports in the elevators today as mild compared to what the Democrats did in the Nineteen sixties burning down about a hundred American cities so I wouldn't put a lot past them because Democrats are now shooting US Congressman other Republican\nSo wherever I look I see that disaster of the modern Democratic Party not covered by the mainstream media sunny do you agree\nOn\nSunday we gotta run thanks for your call this continuous more let's go to Jim in Brooklyn I Love Brooklyn Jimmy in Brooklyn welcome to the mark ... show Jimmy go ahead\nGreat to hear you again listen when we hear about the radical left the far left we see what's going on in the schools we see the crime you see on TV for\nThis is the result of liberalism now let me give you some quotes from the communist training manuals the communist right you know the system to destroy the system the communists right the best way to help the cause of communism is through the liberal wing\nThe Democratic party the communist right yesterday is left us today center today is left will be tomorrow center that talking about the whole American political system more to the left so they have a\nHighly organized well trained group with in the Democratic party that the strategist a tactician\nThere are a lot of our professors there are a lot of our teachers there are a lot of our congressmen and senators so when you see the Kavanaugh hearings you see the Russian pro you see the violence and Ryan ... and all this stuff that's part of the left movement which is anti American it's Marxist and it's also largely anti white\nJimmy let me explain this the also in the beginning you might recall the first few weeks the Trump Administration was traditional Jeff telephone calls with world leaders\nAnd so they organize left inside the federal government would release transcripts of the president's private telephone calls with world leaders in order to debase him diminish him\nAnd to marginalize our new hands to get his feet on the ground to do the traditional things that were presidents had done because the radical left inside the federal government worked against them from day one\nRight and that helps that helps Iran North Korea Russia and China in fact the senator from Beijing which is what Dianne Feinstein known as in New York by the Chinese here\nThe senator from Beijing this as a foreign influence in our government a foreign agent of red China like Congress when Dianne Feinstein she's the one that started this big hoopla about a a judge Kavanaugh's judge Kavanaugh allegedly raping and all that stuff\nSo they influence is more than their numbers and we're actually I think a very big trouble and out of nowhere comes Trump\nJason's yes man so that's why I put up with him\n... he's a he defines mediocre\nYeah that's why ... likes a spotlight on him\nYou know it is like Chris ... give me an update on the committee chairs\nOkay so are you were talking about what happens if\nThe Democrats win and and one thing that I've heard and I wanted to point out is we can't let them have how even how to speak because uh the committee heads have subpoena powers and they'll just continue these investigations on and on and on with these broad powers\nHow 'bout that fat slug Jerry ... taken over the house Judiciary Committee can you imagine that\nIt would be terrible\nI mean what I mean what legislation would pass what activities on our behalf whatever occur if Jerry ... learn

New York then we're done because Texas and Florida will tip this thing\nPermanently well I'll leave you with some good news or play I I I was not a Trump fan okay I was a pretty hardcore and for Ted Cruz for president and I have to admit I was dismayed by what happened and you know not that I just I wasn't a fan of Trump because I wasn't\nSure that he was going to be conservative you know and I was sure that it was so\nAnd I look at it this way I I thought when Trump got elected he would run toward the center and kind of be a New York Republican and I supported Ted Cruz in the beginning because I thought he was a real Bible believing conservative from Texas who was bright and smart and knew what he was going to do but\nDonald J Trump has done governance what Ted Cruz would have done and you had the star factory is going to be in Cincinnati on friday and I'm going to be with them a little bit on friday\nAnd I've been in his presence at these rallies Trump is a rock star it's like Elvis it's the Beatles as Michael Jackson and Ted Cruz Lindsey wherever you want to say\nDoesn't have the rock star status of forty five Trump is a rock star and there's the animal magnetism that I see president I think is an Iowa denied he hopefully will be out everyday between now and election day\nAnd when he comes to town and in Des Moines Iowa eleven thousand on the inside and ten thousand on the outside and this Friday there was like an eight thousand seat facility he's going to speak on friday north of Cincinnati in orange county it's already sold out\nAnd there's going to be twenty thousand people show up those guys the messiah a conservative politics he's done exactly what Ted Cruz wouldn't have done but crews doesn't have the magnetism doesn't have the charisma doesn't have the charm of whatever you want to call it but Trump is a rock star and\nIf you have a shot Chris getting his presence go to one of his rallies\nAnd all like the Beatles circa Nineteen sixty five or Michael Jackson circa twenty over for or Whitney Houston circuit twenty three this guy's a rock star\nAnd when he shows up in your town it's a wonderful thing to watch and when you got that magic in a bottle that you catch with Trump you got to write that baby for all it's worth and this guy makes Ronald Reagan look like a liberal\n[laughter] well you know if if it would have been up to me I still would have had cruising there but my eyes are open and here's what my eyes are open to that God is in control not me and he knows what he's doing and I think now that I've seen it happen\nThat my faith is behind Trump as a president or not because he's the most godly man but because I Believe that this is the ... because I don't think it could have pulled off\nWhat and I loved it but I don't think you get pulled off things away Donald you know and nobody I've got a plan and so we need to take comfort in that have often fake and just do what we need to do individually to help\nThis kind of get back to where it needs to be\nImaginative Hillary was in the White House who would be on the Supreme Court would you have Gorsuch would Kevin ... you'd have to Ginsburg look alikes and imagine the

Want to ask you a great legal buying a question from the school again after you've earned over they're controlling the streets in Oregon and the mayor's ordering them to the police to stand down so that people can be assaulted their property can be destroyed the mayor be charged for aiding and abetting I'm totally against\nYou know forty two usa Nineteen forty eight is a statute that deals with\nOne state authorities actor honor act on their color if state law to violate someone civil rights\nThe mayor of Portland, Oregon is part of an unspoken conspiracy they object to which is to violate someone civil rights you have the right to travel and when these individuals' confronted Ted Cruz in a restaurant in a private restaurant on private property\nAnd then when authorities did not arrest those individuals and\nThis happened in Washington DC this was under color a state law or city ordinances\nCity or state officials acted in such a way so as to deny the human rights\nOf Ted Cruz and his wife Heidi and so the answer is yes if we had a functional department of justice under Jeff Sessions these things would be prosecuted for what they are which are hate crimes under color a state law and the fact is not ... not and the other thing that drives me crazy John\nIs that the national media doesn't cover this do they as a hate crime why don't they cover it can you imagine large numbers of radical individuals taking over as intersections and a great American city like Portland, Oregon allowing only the people of color to go through and attacking white citizens'\nHow is it possible the mayor wheeler doesn't arise and say not in my city and there's tape on Fox tonight of Portland police watching it going on and doing nothing about it because the mayor wheeler doesn't want anything that happened this is despicable this is wrong it can happen in America\nIs lying his political agenda or to go forward or didn't even expect the governor to step up and say hey I'm going to bring in the national guard I'm gonna take my state back I'm gonna take my city back I'm not going to tolerate this maybe somebody above it needs to step in the federal government but we can't have America like that they have to do all this violence\nWhat what I think the mere Portland believes what he's doing is politically popular he's doing what the citizens of Portland want him to do and elected him to do it\nAnd so how is it possible that a great American city not in the south but Portland, Oregon allows in ... the takeover city streets\nBlock intersections lie in front of federal buildings making an impossible for federal agents to do their job and the mayor of Portland a clown affects was full name wheeler does absolutely nothing to stop it because politically it's

you and a market we back with you on Monday [noise]\nKnow one thing I Want you to keep uh keep the faith\n[noise] this is history repeating itself\nYou may recall the Democratic party ... sixty five sixty six sixty seven sixty eight\nEncourage violent protest cities were burned under democratic mayor so it would be there would be a hundreds killed millions of dollars or property destroyed all hell breaks loose\nAnd average Americans looked at that and said we don't want Humphrey in sixty eight or take next a new promises law and order four years later the chaos continued cities continue to burn administration buildings taken over in college campuses murder was rampant and what happened in Nineteen Seventy two Nixon\nOne forty nine out of fifty states\nBecause the average Americans live in Iowa Wisconsin Michigan Ohio Kentucky Indiana Texas Florida couldn't look at it didn't like what they were seeing on TV\nAnd you had a candidate promising law and order and are working on behalf of the moral majority and the silent majority and that current candidate is the president Donald Trump he's doing what Nixon dead and sixty eight in Seventy two\nSo and Hillary Clinton playing the part of you are at age Humphrey says the rules of civility are suspended because Republicans control the Congress and once the Democrats take over then the rules of civility we'll be imposed once again\nIt is it blatantly stupid comment\nTwenty eight per by a margin of twenty eight percentage points independent voters believe the Democrats acted like fools or the Kevin all committee hearings by a margin of twenty eight percent a great number see Hillary's doing this now she's Seventy Seventy one years old\nAnd she wants to appear hip and radical\nBut at say ... it's not true it doesn't work she used to say during the campaign I'm with you\nKnow Hillary as saying I'm with them the ... demonstrators that black lives matter protesters who demand the murder of ... what are we went dead cops one we want them now that black lives matter protesters that say pigs in a blanket prime like bacon\nFat is what is encouraged man of the Democratic party and the last couple of years of the Obama administration as black radicals and wide apologist all over the country scream for the murder of cops and it happened in Dallas in Baton Rouge and all over the country\nYou might recall that brought Hussein Obama into the White House took the founders and representatives del Rey ma cats in and others a black lives matter\nIs if they had a point to make that cops are racist murderers systemically which is not the case every now and then you have all the corn McDonald situation in Chicago where a cop should not a shot that boys sixteen times every now and then you have something bad happened the one point one one percent out of nine\nNine point nine percent when cops do want to write\nBut the argument is not that the occasional cop occasionally does something wrong the argument from the Democratic party is the cops are an occupying force there not worthy of being protected and loved you not worthy of our support not worthy of law and order and so when a candidate like Trump promises law and order\nThe silent majority will arise and stop at the Democratic party once again to overplay its hand with Kevin all\nAnd I don't know if the fire can be maintained another twenty eight days twenty eight days from tonight\nWe're going to have the results of most of the most of the elections by by midnight tonight we're going to know twenty eight days from now and I'm willing to strongly predict that the United States Senate will stay within the grasp of the Republican Party because of the behavior of Democrats\nPlay overplay their hand and it's way too much so continuous morals go to Craig and little falls Minnesota Craig in Minnesota Welcome to the market live in show bill accounting em hair incorrect please go ahead\nYeah good to hear you on night other than Sunday thing I'm I'm a concern that if there is a red wave which I think there's gonna be I'm concerned that these antifa types are going to just go absolutely bonkers everywhere\nMaybe start shooting more Republicans well see that's the problem when somebody comes up to my car with a mask\nOn tries to drag me out of it I've got a glock forty three that I'm licensed to carry in about forty four states and I think somebody with a mask is going to meet up with that and and and they're actually putting me in jeopardy and they're putting a lot of other people in jeopardy I don't know how to I don't know how\nHow we deal with that but especially these places where there's Democrats in charge and they're going to encourage it just like they're doing in Portland\nWhat Craig I Would imagine Portland, Oregon I also have a concealed carry permit I Would imagine Oregon doesn't have reciprocity was hardly anybody and you can imagine if you're in Minnesota in Ohio and Kentucky and Alabama and Texas and Florida\nThere aren't too many mobs pulling people out to pick up trucks because that ain't gonna work maybe in Portland it works and what is so despicable the video tonight on Fox there's a Portland police officer in uniform on a motorcycle watching these individuals' shut down intersections in\nDowntown Portland and doing nothing about it\nCrazy that's crazy but I don't know how the cops feel about it I suppose there a beat up and they want to keep their jobs so they do with the boss tells him or or maybe they're complicit with it I don't know\nAt one point for a couple of segment I ask people to call in and give the full name of your grandmother or grandfather about whom you have fond memories\nAnd then what you called that person when you were a child [noise] and then a song that reminds you of them and it might have been a famous song\nBy a famous artist or it might have been a song that's kind of an old nursery rhyme and some people sign them and so the call would go Bob you're on line one Bob would say\nI didn't leave Jones I called her ... and her song was moon river by the Glen Miller bad whatever it was\nAnd uh we had references digital bugs and the mashed potato\nAnd nursery rhymes beans and basically we had a good time [noise] [noise]\nOh the guy called in in our city called in and saying me in the courtroom ... that was fantastic [noise] so [noise] go back and listen to the\nBroadcast this morning if you would lie I got more email or complements on that show than I have in a long time because I think a lot of folks have been worn out\nBy what's happened with this Kevin know nomination and they just needed a break from it all we also this morning had what is not a break from all that we had a little more a\nMore taxing discussion of how sex by young people sexual relations\nHow much more complicated it is how fraught with downright danger it is today for young people between photos that are sent back and forth on\nLine pose things people say and share and\nAll the way down to consensual sexual relations that then some a woman withdraws two weeks later her consent after the fact\nAnd then whether that's a criminal act and we went through a case that reason magazine profiled at a university UC Davis where this happened\nAnd how ... you know I've had people come up me and say my clinic that complicated I just told my son you just don't have sex\nWell if only it were that easy because the sexual urge is the urge to reproduce and it is a powerful urge I got news for you take it out of the context of human beings and just watch what deer will do ask\nAny hunter when is the easiest time to shoot the male\nOf most any species and you will learn a lot about the urge to reproduce and how that is inversely related to the reasoning power that any species has we're no different I'll tell you that we are no different I've seen some grown men\nDo some really dumb things\nIn pursuit of a sexual act I have seen some grown men and I'm sure you have to I have seen some grown men put a lifetime\nOf commitment investment relations memories on the line boom\nA well we've all seen um [noise] I'm not unique in that way anyway so that that was all up this morning on the podcast will encourage you\nOr if you don't get our morning show go back and listen to it on the podcast is from ... eleven AM central so you can listen
