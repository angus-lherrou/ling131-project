the twenty first congressional district in the center taxes and appreciate you saying that it on my website we were spending every dollar the Democrats are under assault here I got to tell you I was out there early voting out that a rally with Governor Abbott twice what an didn't want to ban it\nHe's obviously now gone down to Houston but the president and with Senator Cruz\nIt's been a great day uh we've been all over the district people are fired up but I'll tell you early voting numbers are really high really really high they've smashed all records on I think in areas that indicate that on both sides of the of the aisle if you will so we've got to do our part to get the vote turned out because if we turn out we wet\nYeah early voting in Texas has started as with other states and ladies and gentlemen if you hear me right now I really don't put this off get out there and voter and you know what the early voting was set up by the left the trying a in a change the system you can take advantage of it to go ahead and vote early\nAnd the more uh people who do that the better now tell us\nHow your race looks in your district\nWell uh you know it mirrors in many ways Sen Cruz is raise a and it is a a\nYou know tight and and and and hard fought but very winnable race or with the support of your listeners a lot of good Texas we build good but we feel that it's necessary for everybody to show up\nIn order for us to when my opponent as I think you know is a a a very liberal Democrat very liberal who served in the United States Army and I thank him for a service but he uses that to try to claim centrism to claim independent that he's running in his dad\nBut there is nothing centrists and nothing independent about somebody who has already said he would vote to impeach Donald Trump who's already said that he would undo the tax cuts\nIt was already said that he would put in place a carbon tax is already said that he wants to regulate guns he wants to single payer government run health care called Medicare for all and he wants to take away resources from the border patrol and give him the other country\nAnd I can go down a long list but he is trying to run as a centrist and he's not but I think the people of Texas are seeing through it just like they are seeing through Mr O'Rourke a efforts to a claim centrism and if that set for them that were in San Francisco and not the center of Texas\n[noise] and a lot of these leftists in Texas and Florida and these other states are really trying to disguise in camouflage their true hardcore left wing agenda aren't they [noise]\nOh I mean I Can't even begin to describe to you how much ah we're seeing that both with congressman O'Rourke as well as my opponent and others are the Democrats very purposely went out and recruited leftists\nWho could run because they may have worn the uniform or otherwise good a wrong with the veil of centrism or moderation because they know liberalism doesn't sell in Texas and I'll tell you something market I think you'll you'll appreciate as well your listeners you know and I mentioned this to my opponent he never has a response\nWhy would my opponent or why we better or not want to run in Texas for governor or state rep or sending her to do all of these social as things were at least it's constitutionally\nAre just sort of subtly persuade people do when you're in a certain direction\nAnd I had an epiphany moment at that point and what I thought was\nYou know that's why they hate Trump so much his his rallies aren't as much as you know this is my policy it's their stand up comedy act the that are all the time to effectively made fun of his political aren't I think that's why I laughed at the media really hate so much\n[noise] yes I agree um he also\nHe also gives vent he not gives me he gives his audience an opportunity\nTo\nVent their leans over things that upset them and anger them in a way that I think Republicans for better for worse you can have your own opinion as to whether this is a good idea or not but\n[noise]\nPeople are angry about Hillary Clinton because they feel like she got away with committing crimes and other people wouldn't I mean even Anthony wiener went to prison\nAnd and you see people who who go to prison for\nRelatively minor infractions compared to what the ... the Clinton's did and people say it's not fair it's not right it is unjust\nThere is in in in the character of Americans there is\nThis sense of righteous justice that a lot of the world does not have\nThe there is a sense that Rome's must be right it you know my wife has commented to me many times\nThat Americans are unique people in that when we quote unquote conquer a country rather than taking over their government\nWe share with them are skills that we share with them our treasure we we lend to them we teach them our systems I mean it's an act of extraordinary kindness\nBut it's who we are\nAfter vanquish in the Japanese\nDid the United states do ... rebuild\nAfter World War two what did the United states do but rebuild\nThere were lending facilities there were there were there were outright investments there were a there was teaching and sharing of knowledge and expertise\nAnd look how the world is better because of it that's what our country is that's who we are and Hillary Clinton violated that which is core to our
