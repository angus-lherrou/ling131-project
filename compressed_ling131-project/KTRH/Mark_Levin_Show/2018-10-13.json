Republican types as well remember when you had the Republican establishment type that said oh you can't compete\nFor black people or well if you don't compete for black people maybe that's a self fulfilling prophecy which again you might think George W. Bush was a racist no [laughter] I did I go\nDuring the country in a relief effort when we did have the ... George Bush doesn't like black people yes was mesmerized by Michael Meyers in what his reaction was as that everything was taking place yes\nIn fact actually I went back in and watched a little while uh the the little series there are earlier today and it's amazing it's as entertaining today as it was the moment it happened\nAnd maybe more so because that just came out of left field so you didn't necessarily understand what was happening until it happened because the George Bush doesn't like black people that was the culmination of everything that had been building up for about two minutes and Michael Meyers the entire time\nHe's looking he'll look at gun you look at the teleprompter electric gun yet and then at one point during Tanya is kind of ran\nHe said Red Cross and Michael Meyers nuts [laughter]\nYeah\nAnd then it's bad you know we got George Bush doesn't like black people and Michael Meyers picks up it starts reading the teleprompter\nAnd all the time moment anyway no I don't think George Bush was is a racist but what I Do think that he and many establishment Republicans engaged in is the belief that you know what we can't win there\nAnd if you don't try hard if you don't try to Institute policies that make that big of a difference if you aren't willing to have the politically incorrect conversations well guess what\nMaybe you're not going to have to success you Nate and I'm not talking about politically because again if you want to have political success was somebody what do you have to do\nYou have to prove to them they can make a difference and as we're talking about record low minority unemployment rates especially with the black community at the Donald Trump story\nSo you can sit there and you can say Donald Trump is is a racist Donald Trump is or whatever but you know what Donald Trump is responsible for an economy that has more black adults at work than ever before\nThat has hundreds of thousands of your families on welfare providing a path in an American dream for people who didn't think it was possible and told you how to sit here and collect government assistance that's what Donald Trump is doing [noise]\nNever forget I've lived many lives even though I'm not all that old I a pack a lot into a given day [laughter]\nIt's an understatement given that I Do to morning shows and you know keep going be [noise] I I um I had a smooth the company\nHad a manager there one time and uh end up getting a call\nAnd call came from government office doing a an employment verification jak verify the employment and then they wanted to talk to the employee\nLike OK so hand the phone over to the employee and conversation takes place and I can tell after a couple of minutes that it was ... she was getting upset she was getting really upset\nI was like OK gets off the bone and she tells me you know what to do just happened Senate making too much money single mother she's a single mother\nAnd she was being told that she was going to end up losing some of her government assistance unless she worked less because she was making too much money\nThey were actually telling her to earn less and she was telling them that she wanted to make something out of her life now we're going back nearly Twenty years ago now what do you think takes place in today's environment\nThat's why it took a sea change that's why it took ... catalysts that are again James like Donald Trump in so many different respects to break through how many good economies have we had we had a great economy in the eighties into the nineties\nWhy didn't we have record low black unemployment back then\nThe economy was good and the early part of the two thousands why didn't we have a record low black unemployment then\nBronco bomb I mean come on now well of course open change when it was much bull crap\nBut I mean he he cares about black people right I mean come on look at him\nWell yeah he he cares about having their vote which means you need to keep 'em on government assistance keeping the economy that's mediocre keep an economy that will not allow people to have upward mobility boom you're gone right where you need them okay so now we have Donald Trump

okay you're drawing oh\nTiny a\n... billion dollar I Do\nIt's been an interesting couple of days but an interesting week and a well the more things change the more they stay the same which is the hostility\nAnd the most pervasive form a bias in the media which happens to be old mission now they're talking about the ... effect throughout the course of dispersed that we're all with a sliding scale morality here's something else that you probably don't hear about too often\nNow we have had according to the media Research Center ... news busters\nNow Ninety two percent of the coverage Ninety two percent of the coverage of the Trump Administration by news media be negative Ninety two percent you you compare it to Iraq Obama this same point about forty six percent of it\nAnd you know where we were in the economy you know where we were in this country a couple of years into the Obama administration\nHere's something that you also don't here again the omission\nYou'll have the media\nMedia is always happy to say oh here is a poll that shows Donald Trump bad whatever approval\nRating but there's been a true wisdom pretty much the entire Trump presidency the more informed and engage a person is the more likely they are to approve a President Trump\nAnd that remains the gate says we're a little more than three weeks away from the general election if you take a look at an average of various different pulling out there you'll see that among adult only samples President Trump's approval rating about forty three percent\nAmong registered voters at pretty much around the same\nBut among likely voters we've continued to see it rise you'll see some bowling rats most at one point as we got to fifty one percent and an average of all likely voters the president's been averaging around forty six forty seven percent now that might not sound great but let me put things in perspective for for a moment\nDonald Trump's approval rating at this point in his presidency compared to ...\nBombers among likely voters his approval rating happens to be right now three points higher than brought above us three points higher now imagine this for about a president with dying the two percent negative coverage compared to a president with forty six percent negative coverage\nAnd yet\nThe one with Ninety two percent negative coverage among people who are likely to vote does that are most informed those that are most engaged\n... it's a rather incredible story that's often emitted and here's the bigger point I've always said that you can lie to people about what they don't know\nBut you can't lie to them about what is or isn't in their wallet this was true of Obamacare\nAll of the lives that were thrown out there where perpetuated wild that whole deal was going down\nIt was guaranteed not to work it was guaranteed to fail but hey we've got a bunch of people don't want it to believe they bought into the hope and change okay so Obamacare is going to be great okay and here we are in eight years later or the same insurance coverage you have\nNinety two percent higher premiums Ninety two percent more expensive eight years after Obamacare you can't lie to people about that we know about the you know if you like your doctor and keep your doctor and all the rest of that\nSo people understood as soon as they had to pay for it we're in a similar place in this economy a lot of folks get upset about media coverage lot folks get upset about the way things are portrayed but remember that if the media media generally had the type of influence\nThat we think they have\nIf they had the type of impact in elections\nAnd that and many will still assume they have there's no way that Donald Trump is your president and again\nThey you know mental they want the people know that they're making more money people know that they have a job people know that their life is getting better bees are all things that are facts and it's why the most informed and engaged are more likely to approve of President Trump\nIt's why we might actually be one of those inflection point in American political history the kind that might actually lead and Republicans not\nLosing and this presidential election cycle [noise]\nThese are all the things that are on the table something else that you can't lie to people about [noise] you can't lie to people about

talking point it's a fact\nIf you go back a few years ago Medicare was projected to begin to hit insolvency in the twenties thirties kind of like Social Security but what you've seen over recent years is increasingly we're going to reach insolvency sooner now you don't have to be a financial genius to pick up on a couple of points\nReal quickly and here's the first one if\nAlready are pacing insolvency with Medicare as we know it was going to happen if we put everybody on it\nAnd here's the deal according to the federal trust the Medicare we hit insolvency in twenty twenty six as it is twenty twenty six eight years from now now what happens in your one nine percent of Medicare benefits to ...\nGone first year nine percent Medicare see\nAnd it gets worse every year from there currently you got Fifteen Percent of Americans that are on Medicare Fifteen Percent that's it\nYou got a hundred percent of the workforce contributing to it but you do the math on this one real quick\nFifteen Percent on Medicare insolvency in eight years what happens when we put the other eighty five percent of the population on it\nIt is financial fraud that's is bigger than Bernie made off you at a political party that's perpetuating it\nIn Florida we've got the Democratic ... a gubernatorial candidate that is running on it financial fraud running on a platform of financial fraud\nAnd by the way\nIf you're not paying attention to borders gubernatorial race and you're not in Florida that's okay\nThat's okay but guess what if Andrew Gillum if the socialist when's\nWhere we've gotten much bigger problems because it's coming to a state near you one of the most important elections in the entire country this year is what's happening right here in my home state of Florida where we have run this and this was the Trump candidate who is running as the Republicans replace Rick Scott\nWho was term limited in running for the Senate\nAndrew Gillum is the Bernie Sanders candidate\nI Want you to think about this for a moment because you're used to for being the purple state the swing state we tend to have you know fairly moderate politicians no no\nYou won't have the most liberal and leftist governor and the entire country if Andrew Gillum wins and he got well that sucks to be you in Florida now it's six to beat you everywhere because here is what will happen\nWe've already seen it start start to take place Andrew Gillum was not backed by the Democrats and our state\nHe was one of five candidates running the establishment on the left ended up backing Gwen Graham within the daughter of former governor of Bob Graham in our state\nShe finished second to Andrew Gillum Andrew Gillum rode that wave of the Bernie Sanders support he ended up winning the Democratic nomination which is thirty four percent of the vote that was enough to get through\nWhat's happened is\nThey now consolidated around him of course the Democrats the party Soros came in here with his money Michael Bloomberg\nJust came out to South Florida held an event for Andrew Gillum cut him a check so noisy here Michael Bloomberg felt like he is the the the populist the sensible guy he's backing somebody who is a democratic socialist for governor and the state of Florida\nBut what's happening now that they're getting behind him and that he's running at this point a race to where he is a slight favorite to win\nThere watching closely and they're saying hey he's getting the young people young people typically don't vote in mid term elections\nAnd so what happens in Florida rarely stays in Florida but this ... is critical and again there is one platform piece in particular\nThat is really important to watch and it is the Medicare for all which by the way is all that much more ironic when you're talking about the governor's race because won't Medicare federal program it doesn't really matter\nAndrew Gillum has also run an impeach him President Trump a kid you not\nThat's part of what's going on here\nNow this is why it's important to educate\nIt's why it's important to inform simple concepts like this\nIf Medicare is already set to fail in just eight years and benefits will be cut and you've only got Fifteen Percent on it\nIt is impossible it is a financial fraud is out and out this honest is that you could put everybody on it and it's going to get better there is no way without massive tax increases massive benefit cuts to be able to achieve what they're talking about\nBut if it wins politically than what\nWe've got much bigger problems on their hands here's something that is one of the biggest challenges we've got today financial illiteracy\nOne of the things that drives me crazy the average adult average adult financially illiterate if you really want to be afraid of the education establishment be afraid of this the average teacher by the way it also happens to be financially illiterate\nI'm not getting a not exaggerating I'm not making it up it's according to federal the finger up as a basic financial literacy tests\nAnd right now more than sixty percent of adults fail it a basic financial literacy tests and that's part of the problem we have with conversations and concepts like this\nDoesn't matter how educated one is\nGenerally if they are financially illiterate then these concepts might be bought insult kind of like hope and change and Obamacare\nSo having these conversations making sure that your financial informed to making sure your kids are financially informed pretty important not only for their everyday life but when it

scheme of the media got losing his mind everybody had to point out what a tiny have iPhone password is which job zeroes [laughter] so anyway that was a that was an interesting moment ... but again you know when you got\nThe the dragging the energy and you've got your mega Superman ad on things happen you know it's really hard to get to channel all of that and and you gotta you know every now and then you're going to have a a hydrogen I I play and that the president or the president [laughter]\nTalking earlier you one of my one of my all time favorite reactions Michael Meyers watching\nKanye do the Katrina really like where is the exit button on this stage right now how can I get off of here now please\nAnd ah you know one of those moments but President Trump is like okay what do I do hear you talk about role reversal because he's usually the people ... and making people dumped trouble but uh you gotta gotta feeling that for once you got a dose of his own a kind of thing there\nAnyway are talking about some of the financial fraud that's been perpetuated Medicare for all is a financial fraud again if you miss what I had to say about a half hour ago it's a complicated and and this is the way the shutdown drop the Mike argument you have\nA Fifteen Percent of Americans on Medicare right now it's pacing insolvency an eight years\nFifteen Percent ... percent of folks do work or on our contributing to Medicare insolvency in eight years what happens\nWhen you but the other eighty five percent on back to you okay so that is the greatest financial fraud that would ever be perpetuated on this country and it is a disingenuous dishonest argument that is\nPerpetuated on people by virtue of the average adult being financially illiterate and again now my opinion\nProven by federal sixty percent of adults are financially illiterate it's all part of the problem that we've got to overcome informational year but here's something else that is a fraud that is perpetuated on people I talked about the benefit of the tax cuts and how the average person net take home pay this year\nUp six point seven percent which by the way when you run into somebody well I haven't seen any benefit from it well that's just because you probably haven't done anything about it most recently we've seen in a report that came out showing that about thirty million Americans never made any\nThat's much either their employers didn't they didn't the tax cuts so it's all going to be reconciled when they file their taxes or they wouldn't be saying that money right now if they had actually made the adjustments with their employer so that's what's going on with almost everybody has a I haven't seen it well it's because you haven't done anything\nNow the next poured that fraud comes in with companies you hear how awful the tax cuts are because\nEvil corporations you know the the ones we worked for the\nEvil corporations they're using it to buy back all their stock and you know do one rich corporate fat cats do to screw the little guy\nYou know that that stuff except that that's a fraud as well as dishonest to its ally the or CNBC you know the the vast right wing media CNBC [noise] they had the CFO council and they get research from them constantly\nOn what's going on with any number of different issues and so on the tax cuts\nCNBC what their CFO council\nHave found a a few things that are interesting for example what is the the most common way to what's been the biggest beneficiary of the corporate corporate not ... percent of the corporate tax cuts\nThis year buybacks right this horrible shareholders of what you probably are one\nActually the employees get this according to the CFO council CNBC is now thirty five percent thirty five percent\nOf all tax cuts savings has gone to a combination of bonuses and employee raises thirty five percent twenty percent has gone to a debt reduction which makes sense we've seen interest rates rise companies that have dead they should paid off that helps the company become more stable lessons their debt burden with rights rising\nFifteen Percent Fifteen Percent on share buybacks ten percent upgrading software five percent upgrading ... uh upgrading equipment and five percent have increased evidence so all in the combination of share about buybacks in David in payouts twenty percent that's it\nAnd even then you probably benefit because once again something that is not perpetuated information only by our friends and media generally\nFifty two percent of Americans own stocks and\nBy the way despite the volatility in the past few days way with the greatest wealth creation machine the history of the world is your United States stock market so I don't apologize for that anyway but the

Nelson has not faced a tough competition pretty much at any point he's won his election in Florida by five twenty two\nAnd Eighteen point and Rick Scott right now is in a statistical tie a it's kind of unfortunate ... even ... been a easily a top three governor during his seven plus years\nAnd he has been rock solid remarkable dealing with disasters like well we've been dealing with with hurricane Michael here which which by the way\nAh I'm Brian mud in for more clip and by the way and I'm In south eastern Florida quite fortunate to be virtually missed entirely by the storm we got a little bit of weather but uh nothing of of significance here but for the folks in the panhandle\nWhat you what you see is is very real for one specific community Mexico beach and to a certain extent the surrounding areas but give you an idea in a comparison real what a lot of folks\nAre familiar with Hurricane Andrew even if you're not anywhere near South Florida course Hurricane Andrew the devastation you might even have some of those images in your head and one of the things that\nI ended up noticing\nWhen we're taking a look at some of the imagery come back from Mexico beach ground zero for hurricane Michael\nA lot of pictures but looked an awful lot like what we saw with Hurricane Andrew you heard a Rick Scott say there's like a tornado or this you know and hurricanes a lot of people but the focus on the category and the tops of state when\nVery rarely is the wind the issue and hurricanes and I know that sounds weird if you're not used to have having to deal with them wow good hurricane be about almost anything but the wind just as you saw with boards and the Carolinas just as you saw with hardy\nIn Houston last year it's the flooding storm surge and flooding is responsible for the overwhelming majority of damage and death and hurricanes rarely is it about the when now Hurricane Andrew\nIt's about the wind when you get to a certain level you're not just talking about a tornado you're talking about a hurricane that around its core is a tornado to give me an idea you got that scale you know you've got the F. one through the F five tornadoes go right\nTops Hussein wins in a hundred and fifty five miles an hour\nHurricane Michael was three miles per hour away from being an F three tornado I'm very fortunate my ... my my family has been trying to ah\nTo give me a heart attack I was saying\nI Am I got my parents and my sister and my brother in law veteran Naples last year or ma I hit them directly they ended up being alright ironically and I'm On the other coast some southeastern Florida um I was without power for five days we had a little tornado came through tore up some of the power lines near us\nThey were without power for like going to do actually fared better where a Hurricane Irma truck directly than than we did go figure\nBut I got a brother and Panama City beach you sold all reporters through Michael that were on PC beach give me an idea and he has a\n... about ten miles from ground zero and really about four to six miles outside never lost power and bill without cell service pretty much for the past couple of days boat in the marina\nBasically fine\nRight they are back close just a matter of miles and that's because we are talking about a hurricane that went through as Governor Scott said like a
