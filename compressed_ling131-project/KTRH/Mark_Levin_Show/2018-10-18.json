S. that MPs is somehow consulting with Trump to decide what to do at a time which is a bunch of crap nobody's in favor of this we have a western mine a Judeo Christian ethic we believe in due process at least Republicans do so\nWe believe in fairness and and so whatever happened to a Saudi Arabian by the Saudi Arabian government\nIn a Saudi Arabian consulate in Turkey is interesting but hell we got ten thousand murders in this country every year not being investigated by CNN or obsessing by the New York times the Washington Post where he worked as a contributor kicked him we let it go a little bit and see what happened and when it comes out\nThat the M. B. S. directly or indirectly heck a show gave murdered in a horrible way because he was a dissident and Tyler Perry and offer regime and Saudi Arabia that's what's going to come out I guess Trump's responsible for that to it never stops it never ends I Can't take it anymore it's awful\nAnd so can we move on from that the answer of course is no this is the ah\nThe event there's your the event this week and next week they keep coming up whether it's Kavanaugh or Julie sweating ache or Deborah Ramirez or a bunch of other incidents that have arisen in the past several months to Trump Trump Trump Trump Trump Trump how can we use this event\nHow can we take Christina for how can we use this event that didn't involve Trump at all and somehow wash this upon him and stain or smear him with some news event\nThat Trump is nothing to do with doing nothing zero zilch nada didn't happen is that possible but it goes on and on I I tried to watch for hours\nWolf Blitzer and others on CNN it's impossible to watch it as if MPs is on speed dial with ... and Trump taking orders assuming he did it what does that mean what might be behind it is is\nThere are many in this country and in the media who\nThinks the Iranian deal was wonderful for our country\nAnd that brought Hussein Obama delivered one point eight billion dollars in cash on governmental pilots to use for terrorism by Iran man that was a great idea we ought to do more of that and so because Saudi Arabia is they pitched enemy of Iran\nMaybe those in the media wants to get back to the Iranian deal and\nWeaken Saudi Arabia in the middle east\nSo that Iran takes over larger chunks of the middle east Iraq and Syria not paying enough maybe that's what's behind it plus as you may know if you've been paying attention Israel and Saudi Arabia have become brothers they become sisters they become friendly with each other because their enemy is Iran\nThe ... the enemy of my enemy is my friend so because Israel and Iran are enemies and because Saudi Arabia and Iran are enemies now Israel and Saudi Arabia are working together in lots of areas so there may be parts of America that wants to get rid of that uh that budding\nFriendship between Israel and Saudi Arabia\nBy weakening the Saudis\nBut whatever it is we don't have a dog in this fight you may want to strengthen Iran and the media does or weaken Israel which the media does\nBut by doing that were hurting our country after nine eleven which I think Fifteen of the Nineteen hijackers came from Saudi Arabia we got a little sideways with Saudi Arabia for a while but now we're back together and they're spending\nI think the president said the other day something in the range of a hundred and ten billion with a total cost of five hundred billion dollars\nA of taking our military hardware to upgrade their military to fight Iran who's our enemy they'd been our enemy since ... since we helped get rid of the shah of Iran look what happened there\nAnd so whatever happened happened it\nOccurred let the Saudi Arabians deal with it if the government ordered the killing of someone which by the way America itself has done on a regular basis countries do these kinds of things if Saudi Arabian government decided to murder Jamal ... show gig and stupidly they decided to pick\nA consulate in Turkey to do the Daschle deed and if that's a violation of some criminal law somewhere to the Turks are the odds you know what I say have at it\nBut according to diplomatic law the consulate Israeli Saudi Arabian territory and so what happened there stays in Saudi Arabia so whatever happens happens it is what it is can we move on absolutely not you see\nThe mid term so now only about what twenty days away twenty days from now the ... and so things were heading toward\nThe Republican way in many states especially in Arizona Nevada and a Montana the president is going to make a greater parents there in North Dakota Heitkamp that allows the thing with the disclosing the names of sexual assault victims\nSo the red wave appears to be building and the Senate and that was the big news story so the last several days the news media said wait a minute this thing is heading toward the Republicans to help Trump we can have that so they started this other thing about ... who was killed\nIn Turkey and he's a Saudi now as we speak the last several days there have been hundreds of Americans who have been killed a few dozen by illegal aliens there was a horde of some two or three thousand Central Americans making their way up to America paying their passage the MS Thirteen\nWith are girls being raped and men being killed it's happening right now and so there's other news stories going on in the world and because it was kind of going toward Trump's direction\nAnd as Rasmussen approval rating was up to fifty one percent the media might have said you know what\nThis is going the wrong direction\nIf we can go after some out the sides and you and in their place put Jared Kushner and Trump somehow responsible for the murder of cars shaggy maybe that'll be a good thing maybe we can stop the building red wave in the Senate what's

of case and Chris and Josh and many others to lines are\nOpen to the ... ... if you'd desire to join his eight seven seven three one two three one one last night before I go to you I keep babbling but that's a good look at it this way Tony days from now\nAnd uh I met with the president or two or three days ago we are going to share with you some of his thoughts later on that uh it appears to me\nThat the number one issue right now is the court system as I just told you Seventy percent of the judges are appointed by Democrats great majority of the cases Ninety nine point nine percent never get U.S Supreme court\nAnd so if and twenty days the Senate flips to the Democratic party Chuck Schumer will hold back and not come from any\nAny of the White House's judicial nominees through twenty twenty which really is January twenty Twenty one\nAnd then at that point and Trump has reelected which most of us believe he will understand that state's democratic is not going to be twenty Twenty one it'll be twenty twenty three he will not stop\nThey will not nominate you get nominate but they went out for one judge so what's on the ballot and twenty days is the court system and whether the destruction of our constitutional several more rights and traditional values will continue\nOn or else we can make the turn some out back to the mental secondly all the investigations if the house becomes democratic which is appears to be very likely\nThe investigations of every aspect of Trump's life his wife's life Jared Kushner's life everyone's like for the White House will be laid bare and the next two years to not be about legislation but rather investigation so if you want the mob rule that you've seen the past several months where Republicans are shot\nRun off the street cars blown up and beaten than incentivize the mob by giving them up power by putting their house back in charge of Nancy Pelosi and watch what happens\nIt's going to be unbridled is going to be unbelievable and other aspect of course his foreign policy right now\nDespite the efforts of CNN and others to destroy our relationship with the sides things are pretty good\nNorth Korea's not shooting missiles anywhere right now Iran and Iraq are somewhat quiet right now in Syria is heading toward a conclusion I've got a horrible war incentivized by the Russians by the Iranians and vibrant Hussein Obama who allowed the Russians and the Iranians to come into Syria\nForeign policy wise things are pretty good that's on the ballot the economy\nAccording to some national international experts the American economy right now is the greatest it's ever been in American history\nHow what their stock market react and Nancy Pelosi begins investigations of every aspect of the executive branch of government it won't be good plus she got the impeachment issue is there any doubt in your mind that the Democrats who want to eliminate Trump from office so if you want the next two years not to be about judges\nNot to be about er and only about investigations and impeachment and hurt the economy then that's what's on the ballot so when Trump\nAnd one of these states and he came to Cincinnati a few days ago I spent some time with them to play you some of his thoughts later on\nIf that happens do they're just don't talk which is all we do go they're physically in confront and say yes I Am here as as testimony to what this country can be and should be do I like all the tweets do I like the horse ed comment about the strip or no\nBut the policies the procedures what's happening with the court system what's happening with the economy what's happening with Foreign Relations you know is damn good it's really good and so think about what's on the ballot and\nTwenty days because the Democrats are is incentivized as they've ever been and it's going to get more ridiculous they're going to more incentivize and if you incentivize the mob by buying them off or paying them off is going to be nothing but difficulties so let's go to your calls now\nWe have a case in Los Angeles than Chris in Atlanta one becomes available you know the routine let's continue with more Keith in Los Angeles welcome to the mark Levin show hosted by the great American bill Cunningham please go ahead\n[laughter] hey bill thank you for taking my call you asked a question if the U.S as complicit with the democracy show um murder I Would say two hundred percent yes and reason why I'm saying that because I've been looking at al Jazeera English and they've been reporting from day one that us and tell us I don't know if the deep state\nBut the league that they had conversations with authority ... and his entourage arranged a kitten that this guy\nDo and if you look and recently um John Brennan the last past two days and then NBC confirmed that through his CIA operative so I think [noise] um yeah we are complex and even though we didn't have involvement in the murder and we did not warn him and that's what a big issue in the final point\nOut on the on that point do you believe al Jazeera any more than you believe CBS why why why\nDo you rely on al Jazeera which is an arm of the extreme Muslim Palestinian Authority why do you believe outages era how\nTo cut her why do you believe them I wouldn't blame one word they said\nOkay I hear what you're saying but when they're right there at the end of the thing for twenty four seven out of your family the factual information are doing is recording the factual information where both on the ground though I don't\nGenerally controlled by the Republican Party because the ... the Republican Party was a home of African Americans from the Eighteen sixties through the Nineteen thirties and be on it was functional and so\nWhat if CNN spend its time saying okay we're going to go to an area that's been completely controlled by the Democratic party\nFor or at least a half a half a century and see how those theories are working out to see if it's occurring to see if crime is non existent to see of job creation is happening everywhere to see if education early the children are exceeding Adam above their their grade level\nTo see families are being formed to see families wanting to move in you want to move into those communities and we want to see if there is moving trucks bringing new families in the south side of Chicago and then the burials of Memphis and Tampa and San Francisco\nAnd Los Angeles and ... Texas we want to go to the poorest areas where the Democrats had been in charge the longest to see how successful there are theories have\nBeen I'm waiting for CNN to do that why haven't they done that\nEverything's Trump Trump Trump Trump Trump Trump what about the lives of average Americans coating the according to the department of education\nAbout half the black kids the poor kids who go to an inner city school don't graduate they give it up along the route and they have to do graduate the best academically agreed on average at the eighth grade level with all the money being spent in Washington DC\nGood chunk don't graduate twenty to thirty percent don't even go to school any particular day the vacancy rates are through the roof and the reason is not race because most poor people in America mathematically or white [noise]\nThe reason it happens is the lack of family formation whack a job opportunities rampant crime because of drugs and the Democrats had been\nWhen was the last time there was a Republican in charge of Washington DC and the city council of the ... what was the last time there was a Republican who was the mayor of Chicago what was the last time any of this stuff went on\nThe answer is decades up to a half a century it doesn't happen so if these theories of Chuck Schumer and Nancy Pelosi or operational and they actually work\nWe would see a completely different result wouldn't we must continue now let's go to a Josh in Alexandria Josh and Alexander a welcome to the Mark LeVine show and Josh please go ahead\n[laughter] well thanks for taking my call um I I wanted to ask since when did the ... start to want us to vote on other countries' businesses I mean this guy a horrible what happened but you know Saudi Arabian citizen it happened and Saudi Arabia or at the sea and turkey\nLast last time I checked they spent a decade saying oh why are we involved in Iraq why it out with all of with all the war crimes with with Iraq and and uh Saddam Hussein\nAnd now they want us to start meddling it just because they think they can tide Trump to it I mean it's just crazy to me\nWhat what can we what should be the reaction I guess October the second or ... was killed in a horrible way\nBut in America there are cops killed\nThere's American citizens murder by legal aliens there's horrible domestic violence happening that those crimes happening tonight somewhere terrible not solved why does CNN want to use that crime eight thousand miles away as a cudgel against Trump what's the reason\n[noise] I mean personally I think it's because it's a horrible story and be\nA Trump is looming on all fronts right now and they are desperate to find a way to to bring him down and that's just one little thing they're going to try to throw them but I personally don't think it's going to work um but it's a they're just desperate for anything to try to try to bring him down and tie him up at the fish because now\nBut this thing what is there about this thing will show gay I guess I wrote some columns the Washington Post he had a green card but he's a Saudi Arabian citizen killed in Turkey I guess in Saudi Arabia and territory\nAnd yet and yet what ah it's it's what I mean it's interesting\nWhen a when re most in lieu were murdered in New York City in cold blood by a black nationalist who came from Baltimore to specifically kill in uniform in their car\nPolice officers in New York City\nThat was like a one day story nationally and then it evaporated died because it didn't fit the agenda of the liberal national media can you imagine if some Trump wearing M. A. G. A. had had hunted down somebody to kill somewhere how big without being story how long without going on\nOh would have been the store for a week and I think you brought up a good point\nWho do you think the left is wanting the fat and quick or a journalist or one of their own or a police officer and I say that all the people who are mad about that don't like police officers but that can mean much quicker to rush to the case of of one of their own and it works at the Washington Post rather than uh some of our of our um\nPolice officers isn't that a parent\nI mean ... why do we spend I mean I haven't seen it tonight I refuse to watch it\nI imagine it right now it's the biggest story on CNN and MSNBC all it is about ... ... what did Jared Kushner knew who knew NBS better or is it ... or was it\n... or was that Trump did sod spend money and wanted Trump properties at some point they keep making these connections you know what I care about is the murder of re most in lieu and what that said\nAbout Brock Hussein Obama meeting in the White House with representatives of black lives matter whoever cater to murder of police officers and one B. L. M. got what they want and what are we went dead cops when even when I'm now in rainbows St Louis were tortured and killed\nThat was a one day story and the media quickly dropped it because of who did it one officer Jason Ellis was murdered in a bar it's down Kentucky ambush killing we don't know who did it\nAnd at this point\nWhat is in the media spent time instead of the show geek in Turkey\nTake up the calling of a police officer who was tortured and murdered in uniform and spent time as those who killed him and why was murdered\nRe most so Lewis killed according to this black nationalist he said that he wanted to come and killed police officers because what cops had done to Michael Brown and Eric Garner\nAnd so the media covered those stories as if cops killed wrongfully Michael Brown in Ferguson which they did not do Michael Brown tried to kill a police officer Darren Wilson and it was proven beyond a shadow of a doubt\nBy Obama's Justice Department then Michael Brown should have been killed because of his behavior and Eric Gardner killed was killed he died because he was resisting arrest\nAnd so but when the media cover these events there was a sick mine in Baltimore who thought police officers ... fold because of the way CNN covered the killing\nOf Michael Brown who was an armed robber who tried to kill police officer Darren Wilson and grabbed his gun inside the police car and that was proven that was proven\nBut the media cover these events in such a way that causes black murder nationalist the hunt down ... New York city and murder them\nWhy didn't CNN covered that aspect to the story and the fact that Obama in the White House repeatedly met with representatives of black lives matter that advocate at the murder of cops who were killed in Dallas in Baton Rouge why didn't CNN cover it that way\n[noise] because it doesn't fit their narrative 'em and they think about that it doesn't ...\nIt doesn't in other words they can't use that as a weapon against a either John Banner or George Bush or Ronald Reagan or now it's now it's Donald Trump see the media ought to call balls and strikes\nBut instead of doing that they take sides in a dispute and ignore all this other evidence that doesn't fit their agenda and then they go after the obscure fact\nI'm some saw being killed in Turkey which they can use as a club against Jared Kushner because Assad's have invested in real estate ventures of Trump years ago and they spend money at the hotel next to the White House so they keep looking for reasons that tight Trump to the murder and ... seconds me Josh thank\nYou for your call let's continue with more we have a chemist joined a JD and Tom a couple of days ago I met with the president and ah he gave

calling now seven seven three Avon ... counting on the\nGreat American let's continue is always an honor to do the Marshall events show as you know mark is a\nAttending to a family members that some medical difficulties Marco be back with you and I on Monday of next week but until then it's always a kick always a pleasure to have on the president of United States Donald J drop I've interviewed him many times over the years normally when it was selling a book or doing a business deal\nAnd we've established that better friendship I'm happy to defend that great man and ABC News George Stephanopoulos or on CNN I have a lot of feelings for the president to forty five Donald J dropping\nA Mr President before we get too deep into the Sonoma Loni is playing a little bit difficulty and is doing quite well so instead of dealing with that let's talk about ... trip to Africa how things go\nWell she's a terrific first lady and a great human being and she wanted to go and see for herself Africa because we've heard so much about it some very good step but some very tough stuff in the sense of the way people live\nAnd she made forceps and she also went to the pyramids and Egypt and that was quite something special [noise] but uh\nAnd the poverty is incredible you know the level of poverty\nIt was very sad a beautiful in one way and very sad and I know the kids were beautiful they loved her\nAnd she came back and she said I Hope you're going to continue to give a lot of money because they need it it's not a question of it's not a question of defense is not a question of it it's just it's on the human race as they need it and she had a big impact on me I Will tell you a\nBill she really had a big impact\nOn me and the other thing the mid west I looked at Canada Mexico and South Korea [noise]\nMillions of jobs have been credit and you were told a year or two ago by Gary Cohn and others that you know the candidate deal is probably not going to happen Mexico's too tough NAFTA is ingrained what did you do that cause Canada may not be real happy right now in Mexico may not be real happy and then South Korea\nTo kind of play because we're the big dog in the kennel but they don't treat it that way what did you do with the\nDeal and we're also the piggy banks that everybody wants to come in and Rob\nAnd uh Mexico we made a deal and we told him look otherwise we're going to have to just to actually car industry which would have been bad for them and\nFrankly I wouldn't have wanted to do it but we were going to do it and we made a deal with Mexico we could not make a deal with Canada they just wouldn't make a deal that was fair for us because NAFTA was a total and complete disaster you know that better than you saw what happened over here with you still have building's empty with just everybody moved out\nI don't know what they would say so that's why I refused to call it NAFTA I said the deal with making I refused so we call it the U.S MCA and its works good but we made a great deal with a with everybody what happened then is Kennedy came along in the end\nWe weren't able to make it I said we're going to tax you cars coming in and then what happened and they made a deal they made a deal they made a deal and it's a deal that we're very happy with I Hope they are very happy with the help everybody is but it's a fair deal for us and\nWe have now we just had to deal with South Korea which is fabulous much a much improved approved deals you know improved I Will say that Hillary Clinton to remember she made that deal and she said it's two hundred and fifty\nThose are jobs and she was right for South Korea so they got two hundred and fifty we didn't get two hundred and fifty it was a terrible deal so essentially we terminated that deal and we made a new deal with South Korea so\nHow many jobs and talking about you're talking about Canada Mexico are we talking about a million\nWas you're talking about millions of jobs potential don't forget we've opened up countries that were just totally close to right if you look at Canada we couldn't sell our dairy products out there and if we did it was a three hundred percent of people don't talk about that you know if I put on a ten percent or twenty percent Arab they make a big deal of if they have three hundred\nActually three hundred percent two hundred and Seventy five percent two hundred and eighty five percent these are the terrorists they charge so essentially that's a wall because if you have to pay a tariff like that you can't sell the product is so expensive so we've opened up Canada\nWe have a very good relationship now I think they respect us more than they did before\nBut now at least it's fair in our farmers are in love with it you see what's going on it's beautiful now we're working on China and we're working on the European Union which have absolutely taken advantage of our country is the European Union has been brutal and the way they took advantage of the United states for many years\nI mean they were formed to take advantage of the United states that was a reason they were formed how can we\nHow can we take from the United states\nSo the European Union they formed and they have their very unfair to us they have barriers where we can't sell into their into into their countries they have a tremendous tariffs that make it impossible\nAnd yet they still Mercedes Benz and BMWs by the millions they come in there and Indians and we charge him essentially no tax it's two and a half percent but for the most part they don't even I liked it\nSo we charge them virtually nothing and they send millions and millions of cars if we want to send a a piece of grain okay we want to send a piece of grain we can't do it and to the European Union so it's unfair uh we met with them I told them I'm going to start\nTaxing because because Obama they wouldn't even talk to them right they said we're very happy the way we are and that's that was that Obama just went away and then ah with us I said look\nWe want to talk I didn't hear from them I said we want to talk I didn't hear third time I said listen we're not call me back but I'm going to give you one more chance and he said that's okay I'm going to tax the cars at twenty five percent coming in which is frankly more money right it's devastating to them but it's more money\n\nI've had my

Sochi guy um I don't think\nAnything's going to work with these people anymore they've gone down so far the left they've gone down to the gutter but what they doing\nThat even though the president is not running there are a lot of people that are coming our way now and I don't think anything's going to work for them that disgusting and then file and everybody needs to get out there and\nIt's amazing if if I didn't Trump probably got twenty eight percent of the vote in New York City but I ... I bet among ranger fans who got Seventy percent\n\nDo we got her on Scott thanks for your call one more quick call then we'll take a break let's go to Kim and now the annoying Kim in Illinois Welcome to the market ... show hosted by the great American Kim go ahead L.\nI. bill you are a great American thank you and I love your show here in Cincinnati and heroin on on that you want to say something about this\nMall could've show guide [noise] okay I Know he's a ... than a shift in usa resident but my thing is people need to ... to the media they need to check into this guy's history\nHe joined the Muslim Brotherhood back in the Nineteen seventies he had the ... had the same ideology that that they have today about um you know bringing out here to the country\nAnd he worked for the Saudi royal family for years as an editor on one of their papers so he has a history with the family and I think that a turkey doesn't like\nPresident Trump anyway so\nThat I was like I like to see that a bad start they found that they have and I really don't know if I Would even trust the information and it happened at the Saudi conflict in Turkey so it should be their investigation\nRight in the ... and early the consulate in Saudi Arabia and territory really are\nAnd so but I talk about Christopher Stevens was US ambassador to Libya murdered Sean Smith\nTyrone Woods and Glen Dougherty we're all American citizens they weren't didn't ever green card and the media largely ignored that in twenty twelve because it was so injurious to Obama's reelection if they would have focused on that for the last eight weeks Mitt Romney would have won but the media couldn't do that because they wanted to make sure their guy one\nExactly and I think America is because they need to stop watching what's going on and frankly I don't want to think anybody murdered I don't care or from Saudi Arabia turkey wherever or that in the u._s._a.\nOr that I really think that they need to let this play out let the investigation happened what Saudi present at Stanford nation on whatever it is on it so I don't want to stay at ready to get out the vote because we have a great president and I back in the thousand percent and we have to keep the house and Senate\nAnd we have to help our president 'cause he's he's banner fire for three years ago\nKim thank you very much for your call we continue and ... just to put a sharper point on this thing that that it's almost impossible today to receive objective information from the mainstream media that they should call balls and strikes their daily business in America\nThat the first amendment protects the constitution protects one business in America that is the the freedom of the press and so when the press is protected by the by the U.S constitution with rights go responsibilities there's\nGreat responsibilities to use objectivity and reporting to the American people the information upon which they cast balance that's why it's there so that the press in a free press can objectively informed electorate as the facts ... over which they have no control or know or understand\nTogether that information to objectively present it\nSo that we can change government we'd go some other direction we can say you know what that's not right but I Can't trust ABC NBC CBS the\nWashington Post the New York times Hollywood I Can't trust universities colleges late night TV shows\nTo give me objective information upon which I can cast and informed ballot\nI Love listening to mark Levin order rush order Sean order Laura Fox News is getting a bit liberal I Love C.
