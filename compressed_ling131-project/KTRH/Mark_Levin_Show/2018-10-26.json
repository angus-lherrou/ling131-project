I'm not trying to make anything of this\nI'm just saying\nThe coverage was different the coverage of what happened is Susan Collins was different wasn't in Mr producer there was no panic mode\n\nThey didn't blame Donald Trump Fort incidentally 'cause how could they because the Trump family was receiving some of these things\nThe president was sent to the president and he gets death threats all the time\nThere's something odd about how the reporting takes place on so much of this now that said I told you yesterday that I could see in together we could see\nHow the media we're moving to attacking\nTrump for what's taking place and now it's\nFully open it's fully open\nAt Trump's words and Trump's rallies and Trump's\nTweets are encouraging this sort of thing\nAnd I took a stand yesterday at least for the first out of the program and I explained well actually the media say many more hatred vile disgusting things in the president\nDoes than any politician does\nNational Public radio NPR contacted Westwood One and asked them if I Would submit to a twenty minute interview\nI said why would I submit to a twenty minute maybe I just spent an hour talking about it\nYou can download it so you can do your little cherry picking in your set up job and I don't know why there is a National Public radio it's unnecessary we have thousands of radio stations scores of radio

really do not remember CNN getting all worked up about white powder being sent to the president's family does anybody else\n\nNow why does all this matter it matters because the media are out there trying to determine who politically\nShould benefit and who politically should be punished it's the damage thing it's the most grotesque good\n\nAnd of course it's Trump Trump's to blame about Trump's not to blame for any of it he didn't do anything now\nI Want to um play a montage for you on this pathetic program on MSL us the the morning show and Mr ... you're going to hear make but you're also

heart that President Trump there's a lot of responsibility for rhetoric fascinated almost inevitable that top Democrats in the navy I Would think targeted this is an unusual for the ...\nGo ahead\nOf the reasons that it is fair to blame him home from the president's rhetoric ... stock market\nSo it's fair in some sense what sense ...\n\nThe president's rhetoric Jay pot\nFor like Jay moron in some sense it's okay you know let me ask you Jay pod of you guys over commentary read much about the repeated references to the president and Hitler I Would think that would offend you does that offend you\nOn cable news channels let's go to Steve Rattner you go ahead\n... causes I think when you have a rhetoric of a kind of rhetoric we've had\nGuy over and over again [laughter] it has a price on that his call the media the enemy has cable and right now\nSo the president calls the media the enemy of the people and their ten bombs I don't know if they're fake bombs real bombs whatever they are but they are obviously a terrorism threats as far as I'm concerned\nAnd that you see is what triggers everything I remember when Gabby Giffords was shot in the federal judge who was murdered I remember that it was a ... that assassination attempt on her\nAnd it turns out the guy was a psycho and I remember how they tried to blame Sarah Palin quite frankly they tried to blame me in a few others nothing to do with any of this\n\nWe have these mass horrific killings have kids in elementary schools and there's the media\nAnd then you will cost the enemy of the people of course we're not you know what I mean the people what what the hell are you really I what are you what are you doing tonight what did you do this morning what did you do yesterday\nIt's appalling go ahead\nOr whatever

the DC circuit had nothing to do with the president know ideas that Trump's personal attorney Jay Sekulow when shown the docket for the case\nAttorneys for Roger Stone said they didn't know of anyone challenging a mile a subpoena beyond Miller Miller's lawyers agreed with Mueller's prosecutors to make many aspects of the dispute public\nNo such agreement appears to have been struck in the other fight although Mueller's team and the mystery witness did file a joint motion earlier this month the asking the appeals court to expedite resolution of the dispute\nSeveral other lawyers who represent witnesses another investigation also said there were unaware of who's crossing legal swords with the special counsel's team and the largely secret case a few barebones details about the dispute are available in the public record while all records about the litigation and the district court or steel\nDC circuit stock it shows that the case was brought the D.C court on August sixteen and how ruled on uh September at Nineteen initial appeal was filed five days later\n\nStay with me on this because we'll try to make sense of this it's actually very very fascinating\nThe bottom line is most likely scenario someone found a motion to quash or otherwise resist any grand jury subpoena\nAnd the judge issued an order denying that and saying the witness needs to testify said Ted Boudreau so I Know a Gibson Dunn and crush or attorney who is handled grand jury related litigation for journalists and media organizations\nIt's unclear whether the case the appeals court has agreed to hear and December involves an assertion of attorney client privilege or some other privilege is framed as a broader attack on mother's a party or perhaps advances both sets of arguments very hard to tell from the stock and well I'll tell you\nIt's not hard to tell at all [noise]\nMr Miller ... challenged we know from a few months back the constitutionality the appointment of Mahler under the appointments clause of the constitution the same argument I've been making\nAnd professor calibrate she has made\nI don't know exactly what kind of argument there making obviously I'm not privy to this sort of thing\nBut it's the same person Miller and I assume it's the same lawyers who are making this argument probably challenging the subpoenas\nChallenging the constitutionality of Mahler and his operation\nIn the first instance\nI suspect I Believe strongly that that's what's taking place again I because I have first hand knowledge but because remember what took place a few months ago\nThe grand jury cases pose a threat to Mueller's investigation because they can serve as vehicles to get questions of as a party of legal legitimacy before ... judges relatively quickly and I believe that's what's taking place here such questions have also been raised by defendants and some of his criminal cases but all the human defendants who\nSet foot in a courtroom ultimately decided to plead guilty and drop any challenges to the special counsel the party or tactics\n\nMystery cases moving through the courts and Robin grand jury matters and independent counsel matters are are not uncommon in Nineteen Ninety seven conflict of interest investigation into America or chief Eli seagulls fundraising activities was conducted under steal from its star\nIn the final report remains at a public view involving another Clinton era pro labor secretary Alexis Herman and influence peddling accusations\n\nThis ... this can get a step or two weirder than it already is set an attorney representing a senior Trump staffer in the Russian inquiry Tiller recalled a case from a previous investigation where you couldn't even get to see a judge's opinion because there was under steal\nAll right\n[noise] I'm\nFairly confident that this is the case that was originally brought involving Miller I counsel as I said the question the appointment of Mahler or the appointments clause and the DC circuit has been packed\nA wood left is an Obama appointee so who knows what'll happen there perhaps they're building the foundation also to take it to the United States Supreme court\nAnd despite what you've heard by senior judicial analyst than others this is not the Martian versus Olson case of Thirty years ago and bobbing the independent counsel\nThe elements in that court decision appear to have been violated in my opinion and professor calories his opinion respecting Mahler and this is why these two questions are important stay with me 'cause you're smart\nAnd you'll know you'll be able to follow all this we've talked about it before is Mr Mahler a principal officer of the federal government\nOr is he an inferior office for purposes of a challenge to the appointments clause of the constitution\nI have no doubt that he insists that he's in fear officer who reports to deputy attorney general rose and ...\nThat he did not have to be nominated by the president and confirmed by the Senate\nHe's nothing more\nThan an inferior office official like some assistant United States attorney\nOr jeopardy to an assistant attorney general now you know that's not true he's got more power than a U.S attorney and the reason among other reasons that he has more power than a U.S attorneys because his initial\nAppointment\nWas enormously brought it didn't provide any criminal basis for his investigation we've talked about that so this isn't like Mars and versus ... now the court may conclude that it is but on the facts that is not\nIt's a legitimate challenge of is it's hard I don't know where it will go but I'm Glad it's being done\nAnd eyes more than ... suspect I Believe strongly that that's the ping pong that's going on between the trial court the district court and the appellate court back and forth and that's why the appellate court is a it was going to hear the case and again as I said that court\nIs heavily loaded with a a leftist activist so the the final case will have to be made to

have strongly endorsed Ron dissent is um\nTallahassee is a very corrupt government under this mayor there's been a a long going FBI investigation as I understand it and even the mayor himself that is the man who wishes to be governor Andrew Gillum he got caught up in this what exactly happened\nOh yeah no absolutely so he has a very close relationship with several lobbyists who are lobbying the city government ah to get basically sending money to to build the project they want it to a million dollars and so what the lobbyists did is they arrange a number of excursions one of which was the New York city\nI'm In a long for the ride on that was a undercover FBI agent who are trying to infiltrate at\nA he was posing as a contractor trying to do business with the city of but this guy got Andrew during that trip one thousand dollar ticket to\nGo see the play handle that I mean people hear about the gamble to pick a day to go to the movie the tickets for at least uh\nOpen dollars at that time um and so he gave it to Andrew Andrew knew that injures lied about that but now there's been evidence that shows that\nBut then those same lobbyist also arranged a luxury for night stay in this Costa Rica villa which ended up costing about a thousand dollars a friend drew and his wife are in addition to some other folks and getting injured and pay for that and then what happens after all this mark\nLow involved mayor Andrew Gillum turns around and he gives those lobbyists that two million dollar deal that they were looking for and so\nAndrew is getting things that that he shouldn't have had that did violate Florida ethics laws and then the lobbyists got a exactly what they were paying for and so that's really the way the government runs its corrupt it's wrong I'm Andrew has you know he lied to the country on Sunday night when I confronted him about this\nBut then documents came out almost immediately refuted\nIs denial showed he was lying um and he's basically tried to blame everyone he can cause he just refuses to take responsibility but the bottom line is still to this day tries to say he's not under investigation but mark you're very smart in the law you
