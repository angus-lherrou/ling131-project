ready to do\nTo keep the mob from taking power\nBecause make no mistake this is all about political power\nWe heard from Hillary Clinton yesterday in her interview with Chris you and I'm a poor where she said we can only regain stability if the Democrats win the house and the Senate\nBasically saying no justice no peace no victory in November no peace nice little town you got there be a shame if anything happened to it you better vote for the Democrats or we're going to burn this thing down\nSo what are you willing to do\nTo stop the mob from taking power eight seven seven three one three I wasn't one because we have an incredibly important election coming up in twenty seven days for weeks from today for weeks from right now this moment when you tuned in to hear the great one mark living on the market within show he will be discussing\nWhether we are about to embark upon two years of a Democrat controlled house of representatives which will inevitably mean a investigations impeachment of not just President Trump\nProbably justice Kevin ... or is a mark living might be talking about the remarkable his door Rick victory of the Republican Party in maintaining majorities in the house and the Senate\nWhich story what we hear for weeks from tonight\nIt really depends on you and it depends on what you were willing to do because right now I have seen Republican voters\nIn my town of Washington D. C. and yes there are Republicans in Washington and then the greater Washington area but all across this country I assume Republicans motivated an energized and ready to walk across broken glass to get to the ballot box and that's important but it's not everything\nThe only way that Hillary Clinton lost the election and twenty sixteen\nIs because people not just voted but they told their friends to vote they told their family members to vote they made sure that they became part of the message and they said we can't let her when\nWe can't let her pick Supreme Court justices we can't let her be the commander in chief look at who she is look at what she thinks of us look at her history\nThat's what happened two years ago next month\nThat's how you win elections when you're up against the mainstream media when you're up against Hollywood when you're up against television and music and the universities and the news media that's how you when you have to tell your friends and your family we can't let this happen so are you ready now\nAre you ready because they just showed you over the weekend over the past two weeks how they're going to govern\nThe Democrats want all of those people who were screaming in the streets and screaming disrupting the operations of the United States Senate\nThey want to take them from the streets they want to take them from the gallery screaming at vice president Pence trying to conduct a vote in the United States Senate and they want to put them down on the floor of the Senate down on the floor of the house they want to hand the gavel to them and let them be in charge for the next two years\nWhat are you willing to do to stop it eight seven seven three one\nThree eight one one it started yesterday on CNN well actually forgive me it started\nEarly in the morning yesterday in the Washington Post these things happened and they're all coordinated have you noticed that\nThe Washington Post writes an op ed talking about how Trump is using coded language when he refers to Democrats as the mob\nTalking about how this is a dog whistle how the mob isn't really a mob and then Matt Lewis a writer at the Daily Beast he's never Trump ... republic\nI was about ... Republican but he actually I think is no longer identify as Republican but he has to be a Republican he used to read at the Daily Caller now he switched to the Daily Beast I think that's what happens when you go from being a Republican to a non Republican you switch Daily Caller the Daily Beast\nAnd ... he's a good guy and I've known that for a while he's on with Brooke Baldwin Mary Catherine ... friend of mine also in never Trump Republican she has not renounced the Republican name she writes the federalist she's also um they're both paid CNN contributors\nAnd they're talking about the instability that we're seeing in this country and we're talking about the violent protests that we saw in the streets after the Kavanaugh hearing but frankly the violence we've seen for the last two years since the middle of the twenty sixteen election\nThe things that we saw against Trump voters at Trump rallies there were instigated by the left\nThe things that we saw remember the antifa people following the Trump motorcade into a hotel and hopping over the freeway barricades to get into the hotel where he was having a fundraiser\nDo you remember the mobs on the campuses of UC Berkeley and other places across this country when Ben Shapiro of all people shows up to give a speech in a little mild mannered Ben Shapiro is causing a bonfire\nAnd the bonfire bunch of parents ever been around involve marshmallows in smaller ers\n...\nIn the moral words of Billy Joel we didn't start this fire\nThe left has been doing this for the last two years and now they're disrupting us when we go to dinner we've got Maxine Waters telling people to get in our faces and disrupt us wherever we go so Brooke Baldwin host these two never Trump hers to talk about what's going on and listen to how it went\nWhen you see people like Ted Cruz getting chased out or restaurants by a mob or you're not going to use the library all they're totally a mop it is without a doubt that there's no other word it's\nPut a stop on non ... well we saw in Charlottesville, Virginia to August they go\nOh isn't that the life when she was so ready for that by the way did you hear how she jumped right on it you know when you go on television you often delivery you're talking points ahead of time you say yeah you know I go on a Fox a lot I'm Tucker Carlson and ... and bring him a lot a steward Barney and they always say you know what your point of view give us a couple of lines as the host knows what's gonna happen\nAnd she was ready for the mob word right she jumped right on it and then she had her ... joined her she got her one rejoined her well we saw a mob in Charlottesville I mean honestly if if Matt had been a little less politically correct he could have easily immediately said well now which is that are you talking about the white nationalist racist mom which was a mob or the antifa mob\nWhich was also a mob I remember two mobs in Charlottesville\n[noise] uh but he did not do that the way the media reports on these things though you know they all whenever there's a protest from the left\nOr my friend Chris plants who was also a radio host national radio host\nHe uh he pointed out that uh they always report these has mostly peaceful in the mostly peaceful protests it's always a a left wing protest is described as mostly peaceful in the mostly peaceful protests of ... and the mostly peaceful protests on the campus of UC Berkeley in the mostly peaceful protests following the inauguration of Donald Trump in the ...\nIf they're mostly peaceful that means there are a little bit violent right\nRight\nI mean that just by definition if you're mostly peaceful means you're not entirely peaceful and that means you're actually a little bit non peaceful or violent so I mean maybe Matt Louis would have said well yeah we did have\nThat poor woman lose her life down in Charlottesville but you know the protests were mostly peaceful that was mostly peaceful mob in Charlottesville but I don't think ripped bald one would have taken up the right way because listen to how the conversation continue\nLaw is not what we saw chasing right\nWhat about the people who were at the Supreme Court banging on the wall what do you call that civil protest or that I'm not I think it's ... yeah and if there weren't any party or as we call it um out for ... ... plus they serious\nThat so that's Mary under and ham jumping in there and and by the way at this point it's a visual Brooke balls and actually puts her head down because she can't respond because she didn't say she didn't think she was going to get pushed back she didn't have another rejoice under the only one she had prepared was the Charlottesville side of what a and then she goes on to say if you can play that are real fast Richard\nFleming Lennie Lennie Lennie little past the N. word because I feel like that as part of the the weaponization of of what's happening now ah the\nN. word and the weaponization of it that's right the N. word is mob and he ... she knows as and she's not the only one says that Republicans people on the right Trump is weaponized saying that word\nAgainst Democrats against the law you know by calling a mob mob that's weaponized saying the word mob well she's partly right actually in a moment I'm going to actually play some audio from President Trump at a rally\nWhere he first raised this issue and uh and and she's apparently right in the sense\nThe word is being weaponized in so far that it is properly describing exactly what's happening in American politics today [noise]\nAnd it's being weaponized in such a way that it is ... devastatingly effective against the Democrats that's why CNN doesn't want the word used that's why the Washington Post doesn't want the word used that's why the next thing we know Facebook\nWill start a silencing you if you take your own social media and start calling\nA mob mob\nThis is the use radios seven forty Katie R.

exactly what they become and he knows 'cause he's seen on ... and this angry left wing mob mob since the middle of his campaign\nUh they really the leadership of the Democratic party actually do believe that you are the most dangerous people in this country because you're calling them out on their agenda you're actually keeping them from power and now they think that they can intimidate you\nThey actually think that they can bully their way into office by letting you know\nThat if they don't when you were going to see more violence in the streets you'll see more protests in the

we opposed his a confirmation process\nWe as a party did not endorse or in any way support the activities that we're seeing right now the disruption that we're seeing right now in our society the Senate cannot function this way our government can't function this way our country can't function the way they could have done that\nBut they didn't they actually encourage it they this is their base they've decided that there was more power aligning themselves with the mob right now than in condemning the mob\nThat's how all those protesters that were in the gallery of the Senate screaming during the vote or jumping up and creating their demonstrations during the comedians they got there because members of the Senate gave them tickets thinking that\nThey knew what was going to happen\nThey are accessories to the crime that we're seeing going on right now and and to make it even worse instead of condemning\nThe mob there condemning you for calling it a mob\nThat you're using coded language the your weapon I think the word against them well hell yes we are you're lucky that's the only weapon than that it's being used we will weaponize that word we will paint your party as the mob in the

if you're a public official then it's okay to follow people around and hound them and keep them from having any peace couldn't be further from the truth\nUh and you draw an analogy to the Tea Party which was nothing ever but perfectly peaceful they would leave a place cleaner than when they found it because he's a journalist covering\nAn authorized organized rally\nThat that's not the same as people invading a restaurant and and screaming at them until they leave or for that matter a spontaneous march in the middle of the street where they stopped traffic and disrupt people's lives it's

allowed it to come to the floor for a vote\nThey say that every single one of the nominees the Trump is put through remember Richard Grinnell the ambassador\nTo Germany right now who people are saying should be the investors you and I would love that by the way wreck when I was a great guy\nHe was the ambassador of Germany he languish without a vote for over a year we had no one bastard or Germany and then once he got there\nBoy he is is whipped that continent into shape not just Germany he has been the the tip of the spear for the Trump Administration in on doing the uh the the free for all that happened with regard to Iran\nAnd Germany and all these other businesses and banks and industry suddenly doing business with the terrorists mullahs Iran because they were functioning without Trump's man in Berlin\nThey finally get Rick right now as the ambassador after languishing for a year without a floor vote he gets there and within two months all these businesses are divested from around oh we had no idea that that's what America wanted we had no idea that is what Trump one way that it's because they didn't have as a master there\nThat's just one example [noise]\nSo Democrats vow cloture this is a Senate rule that can be changed and should be changed I don't know why McConnell's allowing you to go on as far as he had he should have just said okay we're done with us\nWhenever a senator files cloture it means that automatically a requires thirty hours of debate and I think about this there's something like I think two hundred a ... roughly two hundred nominations right now there languishing\nFor each one of them they would require thirty hours of debate they won't get anything else done they won't do anything\n\nAnd so so McConnell wanting to get stuff done has sort of just said okay we're not going to put those nominations through the floor votes because we can't just hold progress\nBecause of the thirty hours a foot and by the way the thirty hours of debate that is triggered with every single cloture that the Democrat forces\nThey might not even have a rational opposition they might not even have a reason why they oppose the person they just want to mock up the works they just want a slow everything to a grinding halt\n\nThe going back to the editorial here at the wall Street Journal which is brilliant they figure if they can't defeat nominees they can delay and consume valuable time Democrats have forced one hundred and Seventeen cloture votes\nVersus twelve in Iraq Obama's first two years and four in George W Bush's\nSo here we are in the first two years of the Trump presidency and Democrats have forced one hundred and Seventeen cloture votes on his nominations what are the Republicans do during Obama's first two years twelve\n\nYou don't hear about this and the media you don't hear about this on Jimmy Kimmel\nThe question this month is whether Senate Democrats will accept a deal to confirmed more judges and nominees which allow vulnerable members to return home to campaign see see now McConnell starting to instead of just saying screw it we're done with this rule which he could do\nIs that he is now saying hey it's a nice midterm election coming up in twenty seven days be a shame if you couldn't go back to your state to campaign\nHey Joe mansion I Know it's it's not a long drive to West Virginia from DC but it'd be a real shame if I force you to sit here for all these cloture votes in the next four weeks they caught him McCaskill hey you're not looking good in the polls there in Missouri I bet you like to go there and press the flesh and\nHand out some walking around money to the voters in St Louis not going to be able to do it if you're forced here to vote on all these nominees so McConnell's playing hardball now and he said you guys want to go back we got to make a deal on these things\n[noise]\nUh let's hope Republicans extract the high price for that privilege some one day I hear it is here it is I I was looking for the number earlier I was right outside it was close to two hundred one hundred and Ninety eight nominations are backed up right now awaiting confirmation\nThere's no wonder can you imagine this is the defense department we're talking about this is the Pentagon there are positions and the Pentagon right now\nThat have been left unfilled nearly two years into this president's administration key positions at the Pentagon that involve national security that involve the functioning of our military\nAnd the Democrats don't care\nOne hundred and Ninety eight nominations backup awaiting confirmation according to the partnership for public service tracking the nominations range from State Department under secretaries the Labor Department spots Charles Stimson was nominated in June twenty Seventeen to be general counsel of the navy\n... pausing for a moment I Know ... and he's a great guy I haven't really talked to him about this we trade attacks now and again I just say how you doing how you're doing you're still don't have a vote right now is another vote don't have a vote I don't know what's going on June is twenty Seventeen college Simpson was nominated to be the uh counsel for the department of the navy\nGeneral counsel that means the top lawyer for the for the navy [noise]\nThis is a guy who is eminently qualified he has not only cleared committee once he's cleared committee twice he had to go back to committee a second time\nFor summer I Can't remember I think they changed the makeup of the committee he still they won't give this man the dignity of a vote on the floor he's that got did sitting there treading water right now am I going to be working at the Pentagon among not going to be working at the Pentagon\nAnd and the navy at Wall Street journal points out they are an urgent need for legal direction they've got to deal with the fallout from recent ship accidents as well as lawsuits against bases in Guam and Maine nothing but there's no one there to guide the ship if I may use upon there for the department of the navy\nThis is news radio seven forty Katie R.

the study miss one though\nI find to be fascinating and I think that makes sense\nBut what I'd like you to tell me is why\nWhy do you think this is true American men actually favor female politicians\nMayo politicians midterm elections are just around the corner\nAnd so it could be a potential turned the tide in American politics when it comes to gender says this skewed article from study five star or a record number of women are running for Congress and there may never be a better time for such a breakthrough a new study finds that both men and women prefer\nFemale politicians over males a survey of fourteen hundred American men and women over Eighteen connected by researchers and the Steven's Institute of technology that won't be bogged down in a lot of the various analyses that they do here but I I Will point out this because I find those to be a sort of the most ...\nPart of when it breaks it down between a Republicans and\nDemocrats or this is fascinating ah Democrats Democrat men specifically tend to favor a female politician mailed Democrats\nWill favor a female politician but when it comes to Republicans Republicans can go either way Republican men and\nWomen are fifty fifty they don't have a preference one way or the other you know now me if I'm looking at\nTwo Republican candidates and they're pretty much on paper the exact same and and in terms of their their a resume their track record it it is it I'd have to flip a coin between two Republican candidates and one's a man and one's a woman\nI'd probably go for the check I'd I'd probably put the baby up there I don't know why I got I think\nIt makes us look better when we have more women up there and frankly speaking generally speaking for the most part in in the modern era of the Republican Party some of the most to nations fighters\nFor the conservative cause have been women I'm just more impressed by them\nAnd I think they're used to take in the ... a little bit more and they can give it back a little bit better\nI think men are are are are are too easily cowed by the media they oh they don't want to be called names they don't want to be a a old don't call me sexist don't call me racist oh no no I'm I'm going to do whatever I can to make sure that the media is my friend for the most part I'm speaking in general terms that's what we do and talk radio\nBut women see for a woman to be a pro life true red blooded conservative woman in American politics they hurt at all and they don't give a damn really the life I had\nFight my way in the professional world being married for decades raising kids raising grad and you think I'm going to be concerned about about a Don Lemon calling me a name about Lawrence O'Donnell not approving of me please I've given birth\nI don't I don't need to worry about you I've been through it all but I I tend to want to put the baby in there and I like the checks generally speaking generally speaking\nUp but I Do find it fascinating that when it comes to Republicans conservatives it doesn't they don't show a preference\nWhich truly shows that it's the conservatives who don't judge people by their genitalia that don't judge people by the chromosome or make up we actually judge people based on who they are the character that they bring forth\nWhere a Democrat men they're like oh well if it's a woman you betcha because I Want to show how woke I Am\nI'm I'm I'm more feminist and Alan Alda just wait ... you bet ya I think that this is the way you tell me I'm interested in your take on this eight seven seven three one three at one one but I think that that generally speaking Democrat dudes are they they want to show women\nHow incredibly wonderful they are looking hardly ... I mean you couldn't have found a better Democrat then Harvey Weinstein he exemplified personified the very model\nOf a male Democrat in the United states of America he gave the all the right causes he raised money for all the right candidates\nHe was pro choice he he's never met an abortion he hasn't liked\nHe made sure that he was in the forefront of every liberal cause in America because that was his suit of armor that was his protection\n[noise]\nHe was able to be as as abominable and sexist and horrible and despicable as a man can be but as long as he gets to where the mantle of feminist liberal Democrat\nWho checks all the boxes on the list of the causes the support and the candidates that you throw money at and raise money for a while then you'd get a free pass up to a certain point\nIt makes sense to me this is this is a Democrat do ... ah get the ...\nSay they they they can walk into what a coffee shop and order the right kind of ... and and where they are pro choice buttons and have a conversation with a barista about how they're going to the uh save the spotted whale rallied\nTomorrow and uh that's they're opening line that's how they get their checks most of them married not the checks the ...

Believe that this was a multi jurisdiction of effort\nAh I Know a couple of people who work in a\nA various parts of our domestic defense here in this country I Can't get too specific uh gave me a bit of a heads up on this from the AP federal authorities have charged in New York man with building a two hundred pound bomb a Ninety kilos bomb\nAnd his plans were to detonate it on election day at the national mall in Washington\nDo you think they're playing around here\nYou you think that when that Elizabeth Warren goes out there with a megaphone stirring up the protesters when you when Hillary Clinton says sitting there in Oxford\nWith Chris John on them pour on CNN when she says that we can return to civility until the Democrats win back the house in the Senate you think when Maxine Waters screams no justice no peace\nAnd then tells people to get in the face of Republicans\nAnd not them let them have a day of peace as long as they're standing in the way of them retaining power you think they're messing around\nHere you think this is just a coincidence\nMan in New York was building a two hundred pound bomb that he planned to detonate at the national mall in Washington on election day

when he gave his speech and he was mocking Brock Obama\nYou know in any it I remember he listed off all of the accomplishments of John McCain and all the things that John McCain had accomplished in his military life into civilian life in his political life in his public life and then he said and who did the Democrat\nSays they have a community organizer remember this number and and and Rudy laugh to juggle that he wants for what is that what is that\nNow you know what that is\nNow you know this is community organizing this is what comes from eight years of a community organizer in the

will be no civility unless we were in the house in the Senate\nCommunity organizing is standing in front of somebody's house with a bullhorn screaming at them because you're upset with the job they have\n'cause they the guys they worked for a bank or they work for an oil company or there are a lobbyist\nI think I have one regret in that is that Dr Sharon I never get a book together um I never
