Horowitz has a great piece on this a conservative review today\nFolks this is not a bad thing\nNow all of a sudden the Democrats that they have lost their bid to take over the majority on the Supreme Court they thought they'd have a six three majority with the president Hillary Clinton right now as rain in quite work out that way\nNow than it is a five for conservative majority and the swing vote is now John Roberts rather than Anthony Kennedy who is a I Believe more reliable conservative vote I Hope in the future\n[noise] the liberals are now attacking the courts now less than attacking an institution in the United states because you lost is not a good thing but heart which makes a really good point here folks liberals for years have had a really hard\nTime doing one thing they can't seem to get a national mandate for any of their hard left proposals to pass through\nThink about it no I'm not saying they haven't had big wins they had they had the stimulus Obamacare let's not put her head in the sand to pretend that didn't happen but the big ticket items that liberals on abortion on\nDemand Bob yeah a basic income Medicare for all these are big ticket big\nMonstrous platinum and gold winning items for the liberals they have no national mandate for\nThey wanted a national mandate for gay marriage wherever you stand on it they couldn't get it states were knocking it down they were putting it on referendum they were losing\nLiberals as a backstop have always relied on the courts and legislators in black robes who pretend\nTo be judges to pass those items why it's very simple when you think about it it is a very simple mathematical equation do you want to have to convince a hundred million Americans in\nAnd the vote for your candidate along with your house of representative members and your Senate members or do you want to convince one or two judges and a black robe consider themselves swing voters to do\nIt for you the answer is obvious they have always relied on the courts because the the the you're just get a bunch\nOf liberals pretending to be judges on the court to choose to legislate from the bench and you don't have to do the hard work\nOf knocking on doors getting elected in telling people why you think government controlling their health care when they can't even run the damn deal V E a a DMV excuse me ... or whatever the deal for

they're starting\nTo now I Want you to screen shot all of their tweets when you're out there on Twitter them saying the Supreme Court it's\nNot legitimate screen shot all of this because there may unfortunately become a time\nWhen they take back a majority on the Supreme Court and I want you to fire all those screen shots back at them on Twitter hey look at this remember when you said judicial supremacy in the Supreme Court didn't matter\nNow it's not going to matter you're not going to change your mind these people don't stand for anything there's actual principles their principles power they worship the golden calf of government that is what they do their national pastime is Jen you flexing before the author of big government or whatever means they have to use the get there doesn't matter\nBut another lesson learned from this is this the Democrats are going to attack judicial supremacy we use Republicans should say is only to make this personal the courts do have a

Mike making an appearance on the show Mike what are you got for us [noise] hey how you doing I'm doing good how are you\nDoing pretty good lesson [noise]\nI just want to let you know I never on the radio shows and now when you were on the ballot and Marilyn I didn't really know your name and then I started seeing the on Fox News and I was like this guy is a bomb [noise] then I get my card and I hear the voice that sound familiar\nAnd I'm like oh my God this and then it turns out that you had to get on the air with you because I just wanted to tell you how awesome I think you are\nCalled straighter look at this guy he got\nLet me tell you something might that is that's a clever take my Mr Cosby is one of the fight is on the planet\nThat is very nice I accept your compliment\nBut you're supposed to be arguing with me here as a liberal can just play oh give me a favor Mike let's play a little game here for a second I Love you that thanks for the compliment Mr call screener forgives you I promise I Know you're a big part of an ... to just play a liberal for a second what you were going to say right here's what it says on the cost me so I Want you to just act like I Know it's hard you are rational\nGuy but I Want you to act like an irrational maniac from it so you weren't going to say\nIt's ridiculous that we are bred cabin on the bed too many allegations we don't need any doubts behind this guy this is terrible this was in a criminal court trial this was a job interview right Mike is not what you were going to say wink and a nod\nThat's that's how I got on there [laughter]\nWell let me I'm not obviously not arguing with you I Know you're making that up but let's just say we were it isn't a job interview which you well know my\nBest to process applies everywhere this was not a job interview in the traditional sense one job interview I Can't believe I'm arguing with a guy is a conservative pretended to be a little bit but\nWhat job interview anywhere in the world are you allowed to present twelve years of work related experience like Kavanaugh did sitting on the D.C ... circuit course all of these opinions right\nAnd then someone at the last minute says you you're a gang rape is produced is no evidence that that's actually true tells it to a creepy porn lawyer and all of a sudden the job goes out the window the answer is nowhere\nSo it's a complete total nonsense\nBut Mike thank you for the call thank you for the compliment\nThank you for playing fake liberal for a minute I really ... he missed the call screener many gotcha by and never happens you are like you are the do you like the human polygraph tests the correct [laughter] [noise] well you know it\nIt is tough though sometimes to this is mark show is one of the most popular radio programs in the country and sometimes it is hard All right let me take another call its takeover we got up there who do you think is good\nAt the end\nOf it has to go to Matthew in California Love California by the way I'm headed out there soon a political and if any of you are going out there so stop by and say hello Matthew what are you got for us\nHey what's going on man I Want to play angry blue collar worker who goes to work every day and watches the Iliad get away with criminal all crap\nThat's a that listen man go head knocked out one out because I Love the every I Love people who work for a living and so you got me what are you got\nWhen is it going to happen when a leader and the Republicans come together in an actual investigation into the Clinton Foundation\nUranium one to see them selling off twenty percent of hardworking Americans uranium across the country falling out a way forever or a hundred and fifty million dollars to the foundation when an investigation going to start when is she going to be put under the microscope\nAnd what are people going to actually fight back against the Democrats or the biggest Democrats that I've seen in the last Twenty years and I'm only thirty one years old\nBut if you know I don't know all of us that especially the blue collar workers I work with every day over the refinery we work are blocked off\nOur taxes to get taken away out for everybody else who doesn't work for a living\nWell let me angry about it Matthew a first can I call you Matt ... would you go by yeah well let me just said a few things there first I Want to\nThe guy's a like Michael Bennett making a false claim against the Las Vegas police and then the video coming out showing it's not the case the column capital nicks who taken me during the national anthem or Eric read those are not great representatives of the NFL\nBut Drew Brees with his nuclear families children there and then talking about uh his life experiences his inspiration his mother grandmother and grandfather\nLife so that people most of the hospital\nBut more so\n\nTo read all the officer you play the same\nAnd it's true you know the little league baseball the a little league football pee wee football\nSports seems so far from that baseball seems more connected to it slowly groups but you see professional football and it doesn't feel like\nThe end the journey of what started at the local high school or middle school or elementary school\nWhere kids we started playing tackle football we were wearing pads in second grade they don't do that any more my oldest started playing tackle football this year in seventh grade and my youngest is in fifth grade\nBut for him to give credit to the people when he was a little bitty kid toting him to practice because guess what those parents out there who were at the game and at home watching that's what they do with their kids\n[noise] that's where the professional football league community went wrong is the kind of people that are being talked to after the game\nOr not living the kind of lives of the people buying the tickets now you've got the Swedes that are being purchased by corporations but there are a lot of families that work hard maybe pick up some overtime shifts\nCan't afford season tickets but dad take son or daughter\nMaybe one of their friends to a football game that's an expensive undertaking that league seems so distant so disconnected from that fan and\nTo me that's a metaphor for what's happened to music it's a metaphor for what's happened to film the movies it's a metaphor for what's happened to the university\nJust a university looked like a place that middle America wants to go to anymore do these professors looked like the kinds of people you'd want to send your your child to be educated by\nJordan Peterson posted today that forty percent of top tier liberal arts colleges have zero Republicans as faculty members\nIs that's what's happened have the universities that are funded by taxpayer dollars become so disconnected is there a university faculty member that has a family member who's a cop", "show_name": "Mark Levin Show",
