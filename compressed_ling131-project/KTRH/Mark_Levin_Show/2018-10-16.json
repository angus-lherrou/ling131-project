Clinton's husband so they could still do business in this country\nEven though our diplomatic approach was to put them in the corner in time out for now gosh where have we seen Democrat couples\nWhere money is given by an entity to one of the spouses and the Democrats couple to gain the influence or to gain influence\nWith the other spouse in the family to you could not legally give money directly oh that's\nRight we started our show talking about Bruce or was at the department of justice and Nellie or his wife who was brought into fusion GPS and given a lot of money to do who knows what\nFusion GPS gives Bruce or his wife a bunch of money which ends up in his bank account to fusion GPS gives Bruce or his wife a bunch of money and then it has a meeting with Bruce or\nWere they given misinformation and say hey investigate Trump stop investigating Hillary\nAnd lo and behold he now says that meeting happened and the guy who wrote the check to his wife and ask for the meeting says it didn't and he won't come before Congress he's taken the ...\nIt's almost as if there is a pattern\nIn these Democrat power couples were the man or the wife ends up in a position of of influence in authority and their spouse figures out a way to get paid by the people over who they were exercising regulatory authority\nIt's quite the scheme if you think about it\nIt'd be like oh I don't know a criminal enterprise\nPaying the wife of a cop when lets the cops regular beat and somehow that cop never bothers that business as long as his wife is getting paid oh I don't know consulting contract and if she never find time to come and consult that's okay\nBecause we want to give to her and help the community\nWe see these cases time and time and time again Terry McAuliffe was the bag man for the Clintons gave him the money to buy their house because they just spent their money settling the lawsuit with Paula Jones\nBecause he didn't back story goes have a ... distinctive though it was that's an expensive ... all the costs you eight hundred and fifty thousand dollar subtle but then again when a woman can identify Frankel and your winter and you say you didn't pull it out on her [noise]\nOh yeah it looks like you got a practical or above [laughter] that's going to cost ya 'cause that's not going to look good in court [noise]\nPlus you want to drop trial in front of everybody\nInterestingly he did drop trial he got to be president Brett Kavanaugh didn't and was accused of [noise] all the irony interesting times we live\nIn France [noise]\n\nA big opening weekend for guys know the trial of America's biggest serial killer I Know people tell me they're worried about going to see a movie about abortion\nThe way the movie is done this is a movie about how politics kept the system from working it's not going to be something awful people are taking their teenage children to learn about the system it's not going to be something you're going to fill a you you wish you hadn't gone to God's know movie dot com it's open now\nTheir motto is kill rain control their name is MSN Thirteen they're one of the deadliest gangs in the world I mean heaven is Thirteen and other violent gangs read their brand of people when they're all across America including right here in Texas Moore\nMen identified as Anna Thirteen gang members are in jail according to what records they took turns happy for them to death with a machete\nGovernor Greg Abbott ... these monsters and all violent gang members because he knows that gang violence affects every corner of Texas Governor Greg Abbott\nLaunched anti gang task force is all across thousands of seminal already been a risk\nAs your governor there's nothing more and more to the keeping you and your

plays ball\nAnd conduct sorts Mike\nSeven\nSeventy five\n[noise]\nThis report is paid for by age peel you pack ... be as bad PR used in\nHe is a bad deal that's why Republicans Democrats mayor Turner the greater Houston partnership and other top business groups are all against property we can do better vote against propping paint political at age ...\n\n[noise] Jimmy ... and we want you to win a thousand dollars explanation why keyboard when nobody why in the two hundred two hundred\nBut instead of a Republican just answering like that oh yeah oh they hadn't been a hawk and they're terrified and they'd backtrack and they let people like Leslie stall run the table\nBy framing\nFraming the question to advance a narrative they are not looking for an answer they're looking to put you in a corner\nWhat Trump did in that interview was just beautiful and it is a PHD course in owning the lips completely it is a PHD course in how to handle the liberal media\nHe does not accept the premise of the question and turns to question it to an answer he wants to answer not an answer that's already a you know that they they think\nThey're going to get out of abide by a pre existing narrative and trying to advance he re frames it in his way\nPerfect example was the question about the Washington DC with Trump starts talking about how bad the media is this is a a it's the trumps narrative it's a narrative that is true by the way that the media is biased against the American people were weapon to be conservative or even moderate Republicans\nThis is a that's a that's a almost total logical truck knows that Trump is comfortable\nWith that territory talking about the media and they're biased towards working class Americans and others right\nSo what does he do we re frames it led really saw who smart\nShe's listened she's not them she's very bright she's just the liberal too liberal you know pretending to be a journalist right\nShe automatically census Trump's getting into this media war she knows that works for him and she tries to stop him she cuts them off by the way she interviewed him I I saw something on Twitter the sixty four times and when they interviewed Obama they interrupted and four times but we figured that because that's what they do right\n[noise] she get the rub some to stop 'em because she knows she's now playing on on on the ... basketball court here\nShe knows she's playing and his territory she tries to stop him and he doesn't have it\nHe doesn't have it he keeps going and going because Trump knows that authenticity cells and he's going to be authentic even if it comes with battle scars at all that's Trump's MO he is not going to talk and focus group tested talking points he's going to talk like Donald Trump talks period and the story right\nSo the take away fear\nFor anybody thinking about or ... or interested at all in running for office becoming a conservative activists take away number one is you re framed the question to reframe the arguments went answer you want to get not to the pre existing narrative they want to advance\nTrump does it all the time watch you know\nFolks they sell this guy short constantly constantly the liberal media paid for this guy as some kind of a buffoon yet he is constantly having them back on their heels\nSo it makes no sense\nNow he did something else that's important not just that he turned around and reframe this thing\n\nHe got the last word and this is critical he would not let Leslie stall that sixty minutes and if you get the last words he gets a last words he did it constantly and he did it one time and what happened what's the benefit of getting the last word and they come on this is simple this is really easy\nThe benefit of getting the last word in if you talk last and that's what everybody remembers\n\nStall tries to stop 'em on when he goes on this uh when he goes on attack with the media right and he keeps going and then he says at the end and you know Leslie and then that's why I'm president and you are not and boom that's what everybody remembers at the end\n\nFolks that's what I think this is the tough time the media is having with this guy they don't understand that it's the sense of\nAgain a battle scars and all and authentic natural way of conversations sometimes it's sometimes it's heated sometimes it's not there are hills and valleys there are the natural vicissitudes of the ... the conversation he goes up he goes down but when he hit the hits hard\nAnd people are attracted to that authenticity\n\nSo he understands he has to reframe it number one and secondly\nHe understands fully that he needs to get that last word in and he did and that's what everybody remembered\nBecause I'm president and you are not\nNow\nThe reason I bring this up is not to just you know law does performance at the point out what he did but to show you how that performance contrast what's what's going on in the Democrat Party right now which is a ... of just a litany of frauds in and out of the people who are completely inauthentic who they're\nThey based their entire campaigns around identity politics in class warfare and it's collapsing everywhere exhibit number one Elizabeth Warren today\nI mean who\nWhat other president other than Donald Trump what other forget about president what other Republican anywhere\nAnywhere in the in the entire movement\nCould have gotten a ... a major party presidential candidate twenty and twenty twenty which everybody knows Elizabeth Warren's going to be to actually released a press release indicating that she's possibly one\nOne thousand and twenty fours Native American who else could have gotten so much to do something so stupid folks whoever is running the PR shop in Elizabeth Warren staff\nShould resign for a felony level political malpractice immediately I have no idea what you think you were getting out of a press release indicating that your great\nGreat great is it for grade so I'm not even sure for three great grandmothers back may have possibly been Native American I don't know what you think you were getting at is but it was quite possibly the dumbest press release in political history\nWho else could have done that\nTrump has a unique ability I'm telling you to constantly owned the lips by driving them when Saturday\n\nThis is entirely inauthentic\nElizabeth Warren will not let this go fight in cold blood eases embarrassing do you understand how this plays\nTo the average working class Americans sitting there toiling for a living at a whatever kind of a job you're working hanging sheet rock driving trucks\nPlumbing electric work you're an architect you got to sit here and listen to a woman who put down on her form to gain some kind of advantage that she had Native American Native American heritage wrote an entry in a a cookbook about powwow chow\n\nThat's real by the way it is and and as\nPossibly one one thousand and twenty fourth America this is about give it a Democratic Party of I I just say you constantly wonder gosh how did Trump beat us how did Trump beat us because he's just a normal guy\nBattle scars at all your people are fakes you got this guy in Texas all Beto better always skateboard\nYou so cool who cares who cares you got Bernie Sanders the rich they're the worst part he says he's like oh this is my third house now\nBernie

suggesting you know anybody here is without sin I'm simply suggesting that one of the messages that resonates with the American people\nIs he's a plane speaking authentic guy who says what's on his mind and after fifty plus years of PC politics and focus group tested nonsense this cells\nNow I bring that up in relationship to the sixty minutes interview where I I thought he just dismantled Leslie stall I Know it\nBecause I've got friends of mine who were union workers up in New York am I going to say who because honest to God I'm afraid they'll be targeted but who texted me during the interview like I Can't believe how great to be with\nContrast that with the frauds and the Democrats side Elizabeth Warren\nPutting out a press conference press release today that she won five trillion the Native American or whatever it was one one thousand and twenty fourth or whatever it's so ridiculous the guy running against cruise in Texas who whose whose entire campaign seems to be that he ... he can skateboard and play the guitar\nAs if this is that's great that's wonderful what the hell does that have to do with tax policy anything at all pleased your your who cares\nThen you've got these Bernie Sanders you know foreign left radical left this time she got this guy Andrew Gillum running down here for governor in Florida\nHe's got their socialist they don't want your

talking about the actual percentages the rich and the very rich of our income tax they actually pay these numbers are going to blow your mind\nHere's the first\nIf I have heard you say there's something numbers so much it's the comparison\nYou'll see what I mean in a minute\nThe top one percent of earners that's right earners people earn money top one percent of earners pay an astonishing thirty seven point three percent of the income tax load in this country I think about that one out of a hundred people\nPay thirty seven cents of every dollar in taxes\nIn this country chew on that one for a minute you may say okay well you know that one out of a hundred people at the top one percent they're very rich\nFolks the bottom Ninety percent meaning Ninety out of a hundred taxpayers the bottom Ninety percent few liberals who have a tough time with this kind of stuff [noise] pays only thirty point five percent of the ... to pick up about this for a second\nThis is why I I this is what I Love about Trump it's not just that he doesn't accept it out of the liberal ... you're not that rich you don't pay your fair share of you know the ... thing right you don't pay your fair share you don't pay your fair share it's not that Trump just doesn't except that he turns around and just throws it right out of the guard right out in the garbage that narrative and he starts\nOver with that yeah you know what they pay a lot they actually pay I think they pay to watch let's cut their taxes [noise] gone job the top\nOne percent of earners pay seven percentage points more of the income tax load than the\nBottom Ninety what the hell's a fair share if that's not if you hear what I'm ... there's more by this isn't just that\nThere's more of these comparisons in this this isn't a Bloomberg peace again not some right wing website here\nI mean your son and a negative way but I'm sure the liberals listening will be like nah you got that from uh some right wing slanted website there there was just trying to manipulate the fact is is from ... okay the top\nOne percent pay thirty seven cents of every thirty seven percent income tax load the bottom line the only pay thirty\nWhy is this so sensitive to make us liberals are frauds they keep talking about this fair share some as John Kerry doctors vote in Rhode Island to avoid paying taxes what if we had Al Sharpton is tax debacle we have

media rhetoric when they go out there and they spout off untruth in straight up\nLife they cannot they simply can't contain the rage he's got them talking about booth failing in Senate hearings he's got a\nCory Booker declaring he's ...\nJust from the or at least just silverstone clueless movie he's got Elizabeth Warren releasing a press release I'm One one thousand Native American jobs by the way a Fox on in the background the Cherokee\nNation just responded and and in a brutal brutal response to this basically full laying her statement Elizabeth Warren who what was she thinking the answer is they worried this is the era of Trump the gas lighting is not working anymore\nThat guy's got what forty million followers or something on Twitter he goes out and give speeches all over the country the media is forced to cover his soundbites he re frames questions from the media turns it back on them\nHe ends he gets the last word and just about every interchange even with the sixty minutes thing over the interview making sure that's the soundbite everybody remembers any talks like normal Americans this is constantly\nHas the liberal media and the liberal focus group folks and their swap rat Democrats back on their heels 'cause they don't know how to respond anymore the standard arguments are no longer working there are collapsing they are falling on deaf ears\n\nYou know I said with his fair share stuff that I was talking about before the break that this argument that Trump is done apologizing\nFor taking money out of the pockets of the government and putting it into the hands of the earners in this country even if the owners happen to be successful and wealthy everybody used to apologize in the past oh no no we're not given tax cuts to the rich why why are we not doing that\nWhy well because it'll look bad well is it good for the economy yeah it's good for the economy so who cares that make the case something it's such a was\nMake the case Trump does say\nI told you the numbers before the break this one I Can't get this number out of my head\nThat the fourteen hundred wealthiest taxpayers in the country pay the same percentage of income tax three percent as the bottom fifty percent of income tax payers this whole country\nDo you understand the gravity of what I just told you for teen hundred taxpayers who are successful and wealthy pay the same percentage of the income tax load as the bottom fifty percent of income tax orders in this country\nCan't liberal delusional liberals who are one percenters themselves Bernie Sanders Elizabeth Warren\n\nJohn Kerry John Kerry used as a as a one percent of one percent are\nWell still insists you don't pay your fair share they have no idea what that even means it requires you to be a sucker to do no further analysis of that\n[noise] folks turning your money over to the government you might as well turn or you might as well burn it you're flushing it down a toilet\n\nMilton Friedman I haven't brought this up in a while either [noise]\nSo it's worth bringing up again the great Milton Friedman the late great Milton Friedman he had this thing about the ways to spend money but she used to tell people what you hear it you can never on here and there's no turning back\nThis way to spend money summarizes completely why the government and giving the government money is a total complete epic disaster [noise]\n\nWhat are the most efficient what's the most efficient ways to spend on my way to spend money right\nNew spending your money on yourself or your family you on yourself why\nBecause the cost of the product you're purchasing matters if your money\nBut the quality of what you're purchasing matters too because what you're buying you're buying for yourself or your family you want a good car

mark of and show them watch you know with mark is calling from seven three one three and more money\nWhat a tweet me at the bottom Gino comments criticisms whatever I take\n'em all take them all\nSo I said I get to this Spygate stuff that's important I Do what I did write a book on it literally at a was one of the great projects of my life I really enjoyed it [noise]\nBut there's been a break in that case a real break in the case over the weekend I should say break a revelation to break in the case happened a long time ago actually but the revelation over the weekend by Congressman John Ratcliffe who's been doing a tremendous job um exposing along with Devin Nunes ask Mark Meadows Jim Jordan and various others\nHave been doing a great job of exposing the a disgusting\nGovernment corruption in our intelligence community or department of justice and at the upper level management of the FBI in this scandal to get Donald Trump now folks ah here's what happened this week and let me put it in context for you for a moment for those who\nI don't know seemingly missed this story somehow I don't know if you've been out in bars or whatever for the past maybe your space travel and it's like that Bruce Willis movie you say with Ben Affleck where they're drilling into the asteroid you've been gone [noise]\nThe Donald Trump he was spied on by the United states government there were Pfizer warrants issued to spy on the Trump TV may miss some of that but that is what happened in the FBI is given conflicting accounts repeatedly of how exactly this investigation started that sit in a nutshell it's a very wonky case\nMy book as extensive footnotes audit even by I use liberal footnotes that way to liberals camera phew what they said in the past on it but\nThe case is very simple in its essence ... opposition political parties from Donald Trump Brock Obama's White House weaponized the intelligence community and in some cases the law enforcement community in case and the FBI the upper levels of their management chain\nTo go after the Trump team that's it now why am I bring that now that they give you like oh what's great what else is there are lots to talk about them bringing this up so that break this weekend makes sense [noise] Ratcliffe\nThey just a torrent of information to Maria barn Romo show on Fox News Sunday at Arizona on the weekends\nAnd he said that there is some potentially exculpatory material hanging out there about George Papadopoulos why does this matter folks and what the heck is going not remember the FBI's reasons for starting this investigation the most critical counterintelligence investigation possibly in modern us history\nAgainst a suit to be president Donald Trump at the time a presidential candidate\nThe explanation as to why they did it has changed so many times that they cannot seem to wrap their arms around why they did it themselves\nIt started as a whole is all about Carter Page that it was all about George Papadopoulos that as I explained in a ...\nSo it's it was all about alpha bank that's in my book lays it out alpha bank oh you haven't even heard that story and I'm sure you I promise you folks the reason\nThe story keeps changing is because they were constantly looking for new reasons to spy on the Trump team because the ovaries kept falling apart [laughter] this is what's going on\nThey tried to ... for bank law that didn't work let's try Carter Page oh there's no evidence he's a spy either let's try George Papadopoulos man up is working out their shocks what do we do now\nThat's the reason the story keeps changing now here's the problem here's the problem they're having the last story they settled on that was advanced by the New York times back in December of last year\nAnd that they've stuck to since you hear the liberals parrot this to yourself\nGeorge Papadopoulos that George Papadopoulos is low level Trump advisor met with Alexander down or this Australian diplomat in the United kingdom talked about this Russian dirt and that's what did it he passed on the information that there you go bingo we got\nAll these gentlemen what's the problem with is\nThe problem is when you go into a fight as a court there is a ... process for the information is supposed to present\nExculpatory information to at some point if it indicates that the the target let me give you an easier example this ... sometimes a little complicated may have been a federal agent [noise]\nIf I Walk into court and swear in front of a judge for a search warrant then I Believe there's probable cause at a prime a crime has been committed that there's evidence and this location and I fail to put out there evidence that indicates that the person I'm targeting in the house we're looking to get a warrant on\nIs in fact not the place and I I felt um include evidence that that person may not be guilty of the crime\nLadies and gentlemen the chances of losing your job if not being put up on criminal charges yourself depending on the severity of the allegation\nAre significant\nIt's becoming clear as day now that the FBI according to multiple members of Congress you've seen this information had information that George Papadopoulos was completely innocent of\nThis that this Russian collusion thing was a fairy tale was made up but the information they presented to the Pfizer court was not that folks was not that it was only this stuff alleged basically in the ...\nAnd here say based items that can never be verified now why is this important that there may be exculpatory evidence\nSupporting folks because\nDo you like to work ...
