protect their business I mean there's just no different than\nPutting a lock on your door having a fence around your house having a a worm system if you know that people are coming for you what do you do your gear up\nIf I Know that someone's coming to break into my house I Am going to get ready and I'm going to warn them that if they break into my house I Will shoot them I'm going to I'm going to gear up to protect my property which is exactly what the president's doing he's protecting the United states of America our property as citizens\nNow all of this I said to go\nIt's a core point here I don't hate people that come to this country illegally I've said this filling in for mark before or many of you know me I I played tennis in college I was ... almost every one of my roommates in college was someone from a foreign country\n\nMy best friend is from another nation one of my other best friend just from a another nation they both came to this country is a student with a student

respect our laws and make sure that all their visas and everything are in order they did it the right way I have no problem with anybody from any part of the world coming into America as long as you do it the appropriate and the right way\nAnd you wait in line and you do it the way it's supposed to be done I have a big problem with people that just say I'm going to break into your house 'cause I Want your TV\nI'm not going to go buy my own\nThe president's tweet today was what a strong advocate\nFor a civilized nation says\nYou know you look at what the media has done the last twenty four hours Donald Trump is standing with an evil nation in Saudi Arabia\nAgain he hasn't stood with them he said we're investigating we're taking the time he said the day before he got on to that helicopter go into a campaign rally ... it seems that he was killed and if that's what the facts they're out there will be a very strong response\nFrom this country to Saudi Arabia more than words remember don't trust somebody actions not words when it comes to stuff\nAnd of course they say where's the outrage from Donald Trump it's one of the most scared tending things about all of this story with with with Saudi Arabia and I'm using as a compare and contrast to what we're talking about with the with how the media is treating him with this caravan of of ... of illegal immigrants coming to America\nYou have a president that they say must be outrage and there's an outrage enough on this one story but then they say this president being outraged over the immigrants coming here legally shows that he's ... he's a terrible person they should come down and should be loving\nWhich one is it to the media which one is do you want a president that defends his country and fight for the country's interests will like he's doing with these illegal immigrants care of anything to the United states and then when he does that you criticize them for doing its thing he's on hands these crazy and he's mean an evil and have so many of these poor little people meanwhile he says about Saudi Arabia which again\nI hate that this journalist was murdered\nI also hate that the media acts like journalists are somehow more important than average people\nI'm In the media I don't think my life has any more important than anybody else listening I don't think my life has any more unique than any other person's listening I don't think that my job is it makes me any more significant in society\nOr should make me any more significant in society compared to someone else is just doing a normal hard day's work in something else that maybe doesn't get you quote famer or notoriety or whatever you want to call it the media is so self righteous that if one of their own gets tack they all come into ... and they all freak out and they all go into overdrive over it\nAnd and the fake outrage is have you not been paying attention to the human rights abuses with Saudi Arabia do you not realize that they have killed women because the women were raped\nThey they give lashing to women who were raped because they were sexually and pure but they just allow women to drive and the only reason why they limited drive in Saudi Arabia is because they were taking so much heat for human rights abuses against women they're like All right screw let's give them a license that will shut up the world\n\nEvery president in my entire lifetime has had a relationship with Saudi Arabia\nI didn't ... and Saudi Arabia has been brutal you still in Saudi Arabia they ... they were literally take off a limb\nThey will cut off fingers they will cut off risk they will cut off arms they will cut off legs they will cut off ... feet as part of punishment\nThey will give lashing to old people and young people in the hundreds and hundreds of lashing they will throw people in prison who are dissidents or do criticize the government they been doing that for as long as I've been on this earth\nAnd I didn't see any of this fake outrage from the media when Bill Clinton was having relations with Saudi Arabia and I'm not talking about sexually I Know we have to clarify with Bill Clinton\n\nNo one was freaking out when Obama had relations with Saudi Arabia\nThey weren't riding these articles they weren't they weren't demanding more out of ... Brock Obama with human rights my point is the only reason why this one has gotten headlines and has taken a life of its own because it was a member of the media and it's horrific what happened to him but his but but but the media who's acting like this is something we must\n... where I mean the media saying we we demand sanctions basically because\nOf what Saudi Arabia did to this guy that's been happening to other people in Saudi Arabia for as long as they've been alive who are writing these articles it's fake outrage\nI don't like how Saudi Arabia does things I don't know why we are an ally with them because they're extremely tough on terrorism and that part of the world and they do things that we don't do\nWe also need a place that we can land we also need a place that we can fire we also have it for oil interests whether you like it or not Democrats or Republicans have agreed that a relationship with Saudi Arabia is incredibly important\n\nThey've agreed that it's important they've all said it's important Obama agrees with Trump and Trump agrees Obama and Obama agrees with Bush Bush grades with Clinton and Clinton agrees with the other Bush and the other boats agrees that Reagan Reagan agrees with\nJimmy Carter we've always had these relations with them\nAnd so now because they do something they've been doing my entire life and it was ... towards a member of the media now we're supposed to put in sanctions and change American foreign policy when we've known that this is the only been dealing with all along\n\nSo I gave you that compare and contrast so now how Donald trumps the villain because he threatened to send US military to protect America's border and they said this is too strong this there's two main meanwhile they're saying we want you to be mean and we want to be strong with Saudi Arabia 'cause we demand at because one of our own was ... was murdered which one is it\n\nHow is it the same demeanor from the same guy can be one eighty from one another all based on your perspective although I'm a journalist and I'm going to be\nBigger and better than you are and most journalists believe that they are better that their life is more important than your whole life\nMost journalists are self important I Can't use the word I Want to use\nA I Would argue that most journalists in this country especially those that you know they they throw the word journalism around like they are better for example than even talk shows are commentators well I'm a I'm not as commentator I'm a journalist I mean get over yourself\nI hated this happened I hate to this journalist was killed but make no mistake about it if you're writing articles freaking out over this demanding sanctions you as a journalist have not been doing your job as a journalist paying attention to what has been going on in Saudi Arabia your entire life\nSo spare me the fake outrage\nAnd I think the president nine states America threatening to send the military to block the the migrant caravan are legal immigrants heading nights it's America is what the president should do\nRegardless of party you don't welcome all breakers you don't you know I mean what what what is the media wants Donald Trump to do what does it and I know what the left one Sunday but I'm saying this directly the media\nDo they want Donald Trump to go down to the border and and and make a ... a great fence with big doors open those doors in hand these people blankets in waters and say please come into America and break our laws and be a drag on our society and don't go through the proper steps and\nHave no respect for this country and let me give you a big warm Donald Trump hug\nWon eight seven seven three one thirty eight eleven one eight seven seven\nThree eight one thirty eight eleven I'll get your reaction you can tweet at me all during the show in Ferguson show on Twitter Facebooking semi masters been Ferguson or on Facebook\nBreaking news twenty four seven from the gallery are made in America studios\nThis is news radio seven forty Katie our age used as news weather traffic command I R D radio station is win or go home for the Astros I'm Corey Olson at seven thirty a new radio seven forty Casey arrange trafficking whether together here's Katie\nLondon [noise] see that as he can be found this out with a left leaning would\nRead Jennifer reminder that there are still doing construction he sounded Alameda until about ten o'clock so that flow from ... and an Eighteen wheeler that was sold out of the ... that it's clear and and things were selling money from Curt Flood getting elected in the Gulf Coast windows dot com twenty four hour traffic sent our [noise]\nOur Weather Channel forecast tonight cloudy skies maybe a stray shower lose mid sixties tomorrow overcast\nScattered showers and thunderstorms possible in war with a high around eighty Seventy ... guys at the gate T.

families that are making less than a hundred thousand dollars a year should be eligible for a monthly tax credit a five hundred dollars that six thousand a year\nUnder new legislation they announce today by the Democratic party the Democratic US Senator Kamala Harris of California she then went on to say that individuals making less than fifty thousand dollars a year\nShould be eligible for up to two hundred and fifty dollars a month that would be ...\nIt sounds than a year\nNow she said quote Americans are working harder than ever but stagnant wages mean they can't keep up with the cost of living increases\nThat is a lie\nAmericans are working harder than ever before right now because the jobs are good and the and the economy's good and many people went from part time employment to full time employment and wages are increasing\nEverything she just sit in that sense is is is nothing but a ... a lie and for all the people that I ever are obsessed with the fact checking every Republican and everything that Donald Trump says why aren't you fact checking her on that because that statement in our own words is it why\nI'm not going to focus on that for ... that's that's almost like a technicality like compared to what I'm about to tell you\nHarris's office as she rolled out this plan today cited aid to thousands Seventeen survey\nFrom the website bank great dot com\nThat found that more than half of Americans cannot afford a five hundred dollar unexpected expense such as that rent increase a medical bill or childcare\nNow bank rate survey came out and it said their headline of this phone survey went and found the article says just four and ten Americans have savings savings they rely on in an emergency\nSo what you have is you have come out of Harris is saying OK Obama phones aren't enough anymore to get somebody to vote for me because people can actually pay for their own darn phone bill now\nFood stamps or not enough because people are walking away from food stamps where we are seeing record numbers will fall off of food stamps because they're actually getting good jobs where they're being employed in a great economy and they're providing for themselves government aid to keep people in poverty is not enough so now I got to do something new I got to tell you that you still need more help from the government\nAnd I'm going to do it because of a website called bank rate dot com that found that more than half of Americans cannot afford a five hundred dollar unexpected expense\nLet me just explain to you how worked this logic is this idea is\nI'll go back to her first part of her proposal she said American families making Ninety nine thousand nine hundred nine dollars a year\nCould be eligible for a monthly tax credit of up to five hundred dollars or six thousand dollars a year\nAnd the reason why she wants to give you that money every month is because she says it you don't have you haven't saved a five hundred dollars for an unexpected bill that could come in with the rent increase of medical bill or childcare so she wants to give you a government subsidized money\nSo that you making nine hundred nine thousand dollars a year have an extra five hundred dollars so that she can pay for your unexpected expense now my my quick question for you is this what\nMakes you think that if you give somebody who's making\nNine hundred or Ninety nine thousand let me just say this number correctly because I said it wrong a moment ago so people on the left will freak out and said I said it wrong so I'll correct it right now calm down\nYou're making Ninety nine thousand nine hundred dollars a year\nAnd you can't save for a five hundred dollar unexpected expense you're an idiot\n\nWhat makes you think that idiot who's making that much money is going to take your government money and then go Oh thank you you just said me for my unexpected next expense of five hundred dollars I'm going to say that money because that same dumb a hasn't saved five\nHundred dollars of his Ninety nine thousand dollar a year job\n\nRemember when we had the tax credit that came out Bush tax credit member that what happened everybody took their tax money and they were they do with it they went out and bought a ton of crap and boost the economy and George Bush and those economists rent 'em or right people to save that money they got extra money they went out and spin\nIt right away don't walk in the stats\nComing on airs she knows that they're not going to say this money for five hundred dollar unexpected expense they're going to take this money immediately just spend every dime of every single month\nOn average\nThe idea that someone making fifty thousand dollars a year if you give them an extra two hundred and fifty dollars a month of the government's money which is our taxpayers' dollars subsidizing people to make under a hundred thousand dollars a year that they're now going to say that money every\nMonth for an unexpected medical bill or child care you're an idiot\n\nTwo hundred and fifty dollars a month is not going to save someone's life it means that they don't know how to budget this there's nothing more than buying votes this is not about\n... and the fact that you're doing this under the under a survey from bank great dot com is the reason why we need legislation in this country which she announced today\nThat is going to save America's middle class by giving them extra money among subsides from the government that now they're going to save that money and not spend it on whatever the craft or spend their money on now that they're going to become more responsible with that money compared to the other a hundred thousand or making year she is just liberal incompetent see at its\nBiggest form you can make\nBring this to a ... a family level if I'm making Ninety nine thousand dollars a year and I called my dad and said dad I man I had a flat tire this morning\nCan you can you let me borrow two hundred bucks I don't have it my dad would tell me to drive on the darn fair and get my house in order in my life in order and stop being a screw up\n\nHe would not loaned me the money because if I'm making Ninety nine thousand dollars a year he would say you're an idiot for not saving any of that I Am thousand dollars a year if I was making fifty thousand dollars a year to use her other example that I had a\nTire and I call my dad or my mom and I said hey mom look I'm only making fifty grand I just had a\nFlat tire I have no extra savings I Can't deal with this unexpected tire expense can you please send over five hundred dollars or two hundred and fifty dollars to use their math\n... I I Would hope my mom would hang up the phone on me in fact I Hope she would say I'm embarrassed by you\nYou're an embarrassment to the family get your life together you moron and then hang up on me\nThis is nothing more than buying votes\nThis is nothing more than welfare on a higher level than the welfare that we're currently in that they've been offering instead of food stamps you're offering people cash because they're not getting the food stamps anymore so you still got to keep them addicted to you\n\nYou still got to get them addicted to you that's what you got to do just get them addicted to you won eight seven seven three one\nThirty eight eleven one eight seven seven three eight one thirty eight eleven\nThan Ferguson filling in for Marco then we'll be right back\nNews radio seven forty Katie are age ...\nHere data is everywhere data breaches Facebook breaches big companies mining and sharing your information these are legitimate companies but they're putting you at risk and now you add in all the crux since ... cameras and the risk of ID theft it's insane look the best thing you can do is protect yourself and your family it's why I switched to my\nId care for identity protection they're the best in the business would plant starting from less than ten dollars a month and only my\nYou're feeding on that [noise] they're still not broken fetch than up until ten o'clock on the south of loopy Saddam meet I Walk in the right lane and it's causing the most out of time in a backup proposed out on the east north down after Manchester at the ... bridge made an accident just clear and getting London in the Gulf that's windows dot com at twenty four hour traffic center [noise]\nOr Weather Channel forecasts tonight cloudy skies maybe astray shall we are losing the mid sixties tomorrow other overcast day scattered showers and storms possible will be a little warmer and more muggy with a high around eighty eight Seventy now under cloudy skies at the gate to your age west side north side Lexus twenty four hour\nWeather center K.

A. hopefully Mexico will stop this onslaught at their northern border all Democrats fault for week laws\nThat was a present spot on for doing this I Would say absolutely\nOne eight seven seven three eight one thirty eight eleven and I want to go back to Barbara Barbara go ahead with your point\nThen that might pass for Twenty years and I've written on it and I ran for office on it and multiple things that I studied it for three years down here\nI live and he said I bet a victim of a ... that go there are thousands of cases that are coming in that county that make it to the book where I had one come in my house for life in hand and almost killed me that aren't even making it to the court system I beg\nPresident Trump to listen to all of taxes that they are they are pouring over the borders I or ten years that he calls the southern border because we are getting inadequate very they aren't even making that kind of ...\nAnd I wanted to tell you sip our fast or south side of it\nIt gets to the truck rally Monday Night they looked at venue for an energy to Toyota Center you cannot imagine how palm Texans are\nWhere oh they're they're they're so thrilled about this um and and look I I think I I talk I talk to Trump in and he's prompt and he's he's he's a big fan of Ted Cruz they bury the ...\nThe presidential primary got nasty there on the same team they're working together um you also have a a great working relationship between the two on Capitol Hill or are they have a very good relationship the vice president and Ted Cruz and and even Donald Trump junior\nHas come down and help and helped out Ted Cruz as well and I think what you're going to see on Monday Night is getting the people in Texas fired up to beat a this candidate that wants to open borders and says vote for me you know impeached Donald Trump which is not how this country's laws work\nWell and he wants to want to take our guns you don't take our guns in fact this nine out of ten people carry yes only carry you don't come\nHere and say you're going to take our guns I predict ban that it is going to be a landslide victory across\nI Hope you're right but I'm I I Am cautious about it because I think that we were in trouble or just from not paying attention\nOr people ill secure your ... and I I Try to explain this the other day on TV I said the reason why Democrats are doing well is because there is mad as we were when Obama was in office at the end right and so they're furious there the fever pitch\nA lot of people if you've got if you feel like things are under control and Donald trumps the president and you feel good about it and you feel like he's doing a good job and doing the right thing and wives getting good and you can enjoy life you're not as focused because you're not married you're not frustrated\n... I Believe that Ted Cruz was in serious trouble from just lack of a of enthusiasm because people feel secure it they were comfortable in how things are going in Texas how things were going in Washington with Donald Trump being the president and now\nUh because of the character assassination of Brett Kavanaugh because Democrats have already said they're campaigning on you give us the control the house for the Senate we will impeach uh Brett Kavanaugh and Donald Trump\nIs re engage the base and fire them up and that's why you're going to see the thing be sold out on Monday Night you're going to see standing room only you're going to see thousands it won't get in in Houston on Monday Night and and and and and that is we under reported by the media guaranteed\nThat they're winning down here than that women are the areas with what happened to cap it off because that's what happened everybody husbands in science and children are winning down here are so energize because they overplay their hand and and it's an ethical state with a loving\nIt really helped me because I mean the real fear or how they're trying to just trample over everything that was that it on it gets to a point where it's just you have to let you do and I will tell you [noise]\nThe inability to mark\nThe things that go on in this country is the greatest weakness we have\nAnd the greatest asset the left past is that most comedians are naturally liberal and if a comedian is funny they know how to take things and make you laugh at them and in the midst of that laughing\nShaping your views are problem is a lot of people who are middle America conservatives have no sense of humor\nAnd they have the mistaken belief\nThat if there is a serious topic you don't laugh at it because of laughing at it means you're not serious and they need to be serious so we're real good ... pound the table serious all the time mad very serious no laughter\nKnow funny okay the left will take that or anything else we do and make a joke about it and make no mistake it's no laughing matter\nThey are shaping minds when they do that they are changing minds if you can get someone to laugh\nYou can insert in the middle of a comedic routine you can insert of very powerful political opinion that might be outside where they were already\nAnd get them to experiment with it and potentially make it their own\nBut we don't do that we pound a table just keep repeating the same thing over and over again no laugh no funny no funding no laugh we don't laugh laugh and is not good because if we laugh we are not serious and we have to be serious because these are serious times of serious issues\nBut you fatigue people over a period of time and that's\nWhy we we fail to get a lot a lot of times we failed to get independent voters or less docked trying all voters because they go man I I Can't be that mantle time\nI Can't be that serious all the time and we have to understand that their vote is just as important as our vote we have to understand that the somewhat informed voter still gets the same value placed on his vote as the incredibly informed voter\n... we don't have a a super delegate system where some people's influence or vote is worth more than in others it's a pure numbers game\nAnd we're selling big Macs not caviar we have to appeal to a mass of people to get to fifty one percent and sometimes that means presenting packaging our positions\nIn ways that don't ... or in ways that are not how we would typically do that\nSome people don't want to be serious", "year": "2018", "show_name": "Mark Levin Show", "city": "Houston", "day": "19"}
