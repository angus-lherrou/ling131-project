I'm not saying she is and possibly a sexual assault victims let me ask you\nIf you have someone who is a legitimate victim of sexual assault and they go out in the murders somebody down the line\nAre they not accountable for that murder because they were a victim of sexual assault somewhere in their life absolutely are held accountable for murder right what was she tried to do to break out and I am one hundred percent certain\nIt was Brett Kavanaugh machine not trying to effectively\nRuin that man's life his family's life how evil do you have to be to do that so I don't care if she was a sexual assault victims somewhere along the way does not give her the right to do what she did\nAnd it's important once again and we don't just wide off because break out I was going to make it through this thing\nAnd ignore people who are perpetrators like Christine bored\nBecause there will be others we ended up a thorn in the biggest issue we could have had in this country which is due process just going the way of uh I don't know oh Chuck Schumer's credibility\nThe Chicago Cubs season I'm not trying to rub it in by the way I'm just pointing out that if I were a leftist in Chicago I wouldn't show up to vote because I mean just why you know not and things aren't going you're way right now and ...\nWhat's the point\nBut that's where we are that's where we are more on ... razor thin edge and if you are someone who believes and right and wrong if you are someone who believes in the constitution if you are someone who believes in the premise\nThen we all need to acknowledge what happened here\nAnd who the perpetrator was and recognized in our own lives should those people come about the bay as well will be called out he made accountable for who and what they are\nNow a couple of things as we were just getting warmed up Happy Friday by the way it really has been that kind of a wake asset that kind of couple of weeks to cut up three months\nI mean shoot pretty much only Clarence Thomas them and understand well Kavanaugh has been through an emotionally then it was kind of feel like we were through another election here this whole cabinet thing is a pretty emotional deal because there was so much on the line\nBy the way I mentioned on ... ah yourself for the friend\nI don't want to show a my home station W.

H.\nUnder\nThe age of fifty one the nose are forty nine the motion is agreed to\nAnd there it is and I have ... happy\nFriday I Hope you have had a a wonderful day and are getting set for an amazing weekend it certainly has been an emotional time and no doubt or we're gonna have must see a TV going on about five o'clock eastern time tomorrow as the final vote or should take place approximately around that period of time but at this point\nGiven that Susan Collins made her speech made it clear that she is going to be voting\nTo conform Brett Kavanaugh and then shortly after that Joe Manchin Democrat West Virginia who is a Republican and waiting at this point I'm humid\nOr at all it seems like it's inevitable at at this point the mansion is going to go and make the move maybe ... after the election of but he is a he said that he is also an board so ah the it it absolutely appears that there are the boats and in fact\nSomething interesting that developed out of Alaska\nLisa Murkowski voted no Republican Lisa Murkowski voted no she did not want to end debate and again if debate did not end today basically given I Would have been dead they would have been it right there at the procedural vote today absolutely critical so with her voting no\nUh you know she has come under heat\nFrom her constituents on the right\nAnd what's interesting I when you take a look at that in context is the way they've been going about it not screaming not protesting not people they're chasing her down in elevators but there have been a lot of folks\nThat had been to lighten up for office uh was phone calls them know how can certainly are there have been a pretty good pieces put out including one by the wall Street Journal that was amazing pointing out that hey you know if Lisa Murkowski or to have a ... year the ninth\nCircuit court of appeals\nWould be kind of the final say if you end up having basically this split court and you had significant decisions don't impact Alaskans the Ninth Circuit ruling ultimately if there weren't a decisive decision at the Supreme Court that would stand for all Alaskans seems like Lisa might now actually be reconsidering\nRight taken a look at the most likely outcome here or it looked like it might be in that fifty to vote range and I we might end up there even though we were fifty one forty nine today now something that I have tried to lean on from a point of optimism throughout this process\nIs the positive that can be gained from all this\nHow many people knew how many folks were on the Senate Judiciary committee until the past couple of weeks\nI haven't known many I I mean even you and the student listener somebody who cares and is engaged in you know but they were Twenty one members well I mean okay so twenty in Spartacus but didn't you know how many members of the Senate Judiciary committee there were\nWe learned that right I mean one small detail but for many folks because we don't teach civics in school this has been an opportunity and cabinet jak your\nOr a ... that man what he has been through and having a backbone of steel so see this thing through holy cow incredible person definitely a role model a role model that we could all point to\nThat's ultimately what a thing Brett Kavanaugh's role it's twofold one\nI think he taught history by what he went through during this process and having a whole new generation of people engaged in pain detention\nSecond thing is I think we have a new role model that we can point to one of the big concerns of course has been well you know Trump Trump Donald Trump has been an incredibly effective president the United states not necessarily the best role model right\nBut if you want to introduce your kids to somebody\nThat seems to have all the ripe for priorities in the right places it is the right way doesn't back down when he's faced with adversity you absolutely can point to Brett Kavanaugh now\nHow many folks necessarily knew how many Supreme Court justices their war before all this I'm sure you did but a lot of folks have learned that\nA lot of folks have learned about how this and it actually works and that's important from a point of civic says well how deliberative the process is by design all these procedural votes and everything that's happening now including the thirty our window that we're in\nAs we wait until approximately five o'clock tomorrow afternoon for the final vote\nKnow there are a lot of things about our government we complained about a lot of things we don't like a lot of things that we should be frustrated by\nBut they're always opportunities and we're in one of those moments one of those historical moment [noise] and we can look back on and this could be an opportunity for generations to learn what they never would have learned and have an opportunity in a time of adversity with leadership to point to somebody who does the right way does have backed down [noise]\nI'm Brian must be

Bush\nIn the wake of nine eleven so we took the great depression nine eleven and\nThe botched impeachment of Clinton to bring about the president's party gaining seats\nThe average outcome in the mid term cycle is that the president's party will lose four seats in the Senate thirty seats in the house it's just the average outcome happened this year Democrats regain control of everything now\nThere's no chance whatsoever that Democrats will gained four seats there is a better chance at this point the Republicans gained four seats the Democrats\nAnd Republicans are almost certainly at this point going to retain control the Senate maps favorable for them Heidi Heitkamp has pretty much done herself in in North Dakota she voted no today and what we've seen ever since she indicated that she was like would it be a no vote\nAbout ten points about ten point to what the what the difference in her race in North Dakota and she was already endanger their Claire McCaskill\nOf Missouri voted no\nShe already was trailing slightly in the polls likely to end up being a big time issue for her and then Joe Donnelly in Indiana same deal voted no these are all big Trump states than you did have Joe Manchin of West Virginia devoted gas Joe Manchin by the way is almost certainly going to be re elected on backup this\nAgain when I've been taking a look at for ... how much this boat meant and those particular states\nAn average of about ten points ... or nay because those are pro Trump\nBroke Kavanaugh states so\nThe Senate almost certainly going to stay but still the house you take a walk in if you check any of the polls he checked decide to take a look at everything right now does not look good for Republicans looks like Republicans are facing somewhere in the neighborhood of about thirty losses which would be enough for Democrats to take control the house\nBut I continually have people say that they just don't see that happening they don't see it happening they don't see it happening\nMy question is and this is what I'm working out because again I base everything off of information are we at inflection point in American history is this number four is Donald Trump as a catalyst just him being the disruptor as president of the United states\nThen this Kavanaugh situation is that now I guess to what we went through and any of those other examples\nNot the great depression\nNot after nine eleven but if you're looking for a ... year absolutely could point to Nineteen Ninety eight right there are so many similarities right now booming economy what's going on right now in fact our unemployment rate is much lower than it was a Nineteen Ninety eight\nAnd you have the president well he's not as popular as Bill Clinton\nBut then again he actually isn't specifically the issue here except that they made him the issue right we've had the ... investigation we've had to get Trump effort since before he even took office\nThat would certainly do it hasn't risen to the level of impeachment yet because Democrats are not in control the house that could be analogous your throat Kevin on the mix maybe that is too\nSo this is all something that I'm working on right now is there a chance that Republicans really might gain in Congress this year\nIs that is that moment of done then inflection point American history where things are different historically Ninety two percent chance that Democrats win more seats than not this year but\nThere is an eight percent chance that they don't for a reason are we in that window will continue the conversation coming up next I'm Brian mud and for the great one month\nNews radio seven forty Katie our age [noise]\nI Can't stress enough that you must protect yourself from thugs who steal personal information email address is Social Security numbers medical card passwords and retailers are being compromised every day you can't stay vulnerable it's why I switched to my\nId care the best in the business my id care coverage you for the nine types of identity theft providing best in class service and you can sign up at my id cared dot com slash\nMark my id care is taking care of fortune five hundred companies for years but just recently made their protection available to consumers Tom Kelly the c._e._o. is a genius at personal id protection plan start for less than ten bucks a month and only by\nId care often say money back recovery guarantee my listeners also get Fifteen Percent off at my id cared dot com slash marks learn more and then let my\nId care take care of you my id care slash marks enter promo code mark that's my\nId care dot com slash mark ...\nWhen the ultimate trip to the string Vegas forty and I'm Ari promotion leave George Strait live mobile arena friday December ... and wrangler in a bar on Saturday to separate they can travel mound you're at a combination of the MGM grand design up go to the R.

Committee eighty eight there spinach\nOkay exactly what they need their hair I don't think they pay no attention to that but hey carcass stand in the heat of battle he didn't wait to see which way the wind was blowing that kind of way I look at it and I think and I'm going to say that um [noise]\nWe never Trump earthquake how and why why we used to like ... was one and Jeff Flake was one I think that they had the attendance at Trump's rally they then they had four or five I've lost count he Energizer Bunny I think they and and he has\nThem and those rallies when President Trump was mentioned cabin I now I Am sure you heard that too\nUm and so I just I I was calling for her speech today but I really wanted to say how much I admire Lindsey Graham for really having a\nParty in there to\nReally say what needed to be said to those memories of that and Judiciary Committee they were acting\nUh well they are they all have their Spartacus moment I think [laughter]\nBut but actually something you can be proud of but you know I Would agree with you as a probably Lindsey Graham's find this moment as well are you talking about the the five o'clock hour five o'clock eastern time tomorrow we're going to have this vote\nAnd uh it was ... eastern time that Lindsey Graham a week ago yesterday ended up by having that particular moment where he sped up now\nRespectfully disagree with you just in terms of him influencing in this particular case Susan Collins she was so principled and detailed as she laid out I don't think there was anything that she was going to be swayed by by virtue of simply be\nPragmatic yet emotional plenty of Lindsey Graham ah but ah but ultimately I'm not going to take anything away from him it really was a pretty incredible moment but speaking of Lisa Murkowski I'm interested to get your take a given that you are in Alaska\nSo she voted no today the the heat is being put on her ultimately what are the implications in Alaska does she have a chance to uh to win her next election if she ended up going down this path\n[noise] well I I Wish I knew the answer to that Brian judging from the very popular radio show in the afternoon for and treated fix up here I have not every day and believe me that people I Can't remember very many call for a new one hand for foreign Lisa\nAll the other calls have been um\nUm we how she votes for a ... a cabinet [noise]\nOkay it's going to be interesting to see what happens there I actually think there's an outside chance that she ends up becoming a boat in the affirmative tomorrow or I Know that the earlier today a in addition to her voting no to end debate she also indicated that he wasn't the right person at the right time for this country\nBut then she walked back through his comments later in the afternoon after she started getting some of the response in so\nUh she'll be an interesting one to watch tomorrow although what should the likely be a formality which gives recovered by the way because you can go ahead and you're Lisa Murkowski in and vote in the affirmative because it's like an alter the outcome almost certainly tomorrow All right let's go to Dan Dan is in Clearwater, Florida Dan welcome to the show\nAnd thank you sir [noise] hey I'm\nI was watching and listening to a sinner calling speech today and at first I was I was on I was amazed I was impressed

really\nThank you thank [laughter]\nPraised Kevin on one of his rulings and one of his books blah blah blah anyway here's the deal I Do credit the Palm Beach post by the way for at least being somewhat honest by saying that he is known to follow the liberal side of things getting an idea the media sucks in this country All right and uh I don't have to tell you that but\nIt is really easy to information early and empirically tell you who in what John Paul Stevens is because anytime you could find a Republican in this case a lifelong Republican\nWouldn't give you an idea about John Paul Stevens former Supreme Court justice he is to the Republican Party\nWhat Steven briar is so we're to the Republican Party go see the briar\nHow liberal or San Francisco on the ... yeah bingo Steven

percent conservative\nAnd again to give you an idea Steven prior exact same split in fact when one step further\nTo know how liberal John Paul Stevens who does not believe the Brett Kavanaugh should be out of the Supreme Court how conservative this guy really is if you compare voting records and the United States Senate right now on partisan splits\nThere are for a U.S senator Saturday

major endorsements today was the glowing endorsement of Debbie Wasserman Schultz so on the grand scheme of of of sucking they are all the way they're okay they're the people that hold the Baghdad that make the case for Debbie Wasserman Schultz\nSo it is the consider the source thing but I I Want to illustrate some points here this is an excerpt from an article yesterday police union endorses Republican Ron disadvantage for governor for years after endorsing Democrat rhyme\nLikes or from the story a major union for police officers to Florida police benevolent association is endorsing Republican Ron disadvantage for governor for ... years ago the Florida PBA endorsed the Democratic nominee for governor Charlie Crist\nAnyway there's a lot of people's Charlie Crist Charlie Crist are literally has been everything politically in in our state if you're not familiar he currently has a Democrat that is a serving now the saint\nPete area but uh anyway what's the last time he actually was a Republican governor in in Florida Rubio ran him\nOut of the party what happened anyway I'm continuing\nAnd Wednesdays endorsement at the same answers the PBA president said this Santas would be the kind of governor who would stand up for what he asserted are unfair efforts to malign bullies\nQuote the men and women of law enforcement want to tell Floridians that Iran does that this has our backs that's why I'm proud to announce that we have his back said the Florida PBA president\nAnd his endorsement of this and this is ... that police had been treated unfairly in recent years said the quote\nFrom the president of the border police benevolent association as we've seen in the past few years police have been scrutinized for doing their job and kicked to the curb by special interest groups media\nAnd politicians whichever resulted in the rise of law enforcement officers being killed or assaulted and the line of duty he said and the my blood boil boils here but the the whatever you want to refer to\nThis poster\nThat pretends to be an objective journalist I wrote this garbage for the sun ... he ended the article what this he didn't offer examples of how scrutiny of police has resulted in police being killed or assaulted\nI'd call myself down\nBy morning show yesterday I think at one point I was actually yelling I had a mother to their children in the car you know what this is that big of a deal because if we don't have good cops what happens in this country it's game over its came over\nAnd part of what made me so upset I noticed what was going on\nNot long after the whole Kaepernick thing broke both economic and and I was tracking violence\nTowards police officers remember before the whole Kaepernick thing even if you had the Dallas Cowboys and they wanted to honor you know the the cops that were murdered the NFL wouldn't let them at all that and I started being more aware of what was happening to police officers in this country and I notice that there had been escalating violence I actually started a weekly series that I Do here in South\nFlorida that tracks the violence against police officers and here you have someone posing as the ...\nThe list who has the audacity to say he did not for example ... scrutiny of police as a result of the police being killed or assaulted\n[noise] well I got it for you you might suck at what you do might not do any homework might not want to because it would just prove the nonsense narrative you advance\nBut here's what's real in this story\nRemember this is the for the police benevolent association and about politics is it they endorsed the Democrat four years ago for governor endorsing Ron does say on is the Republican this year\nSo obviously it's because it matters more now right now they fill in the blanks here since twenty Fifteen\nFive hundred and Seventy three police officers died in the line of duty five hundred and Seventy three\nTo say last made a political endorsement of those five hundred and Seventy three officers three hundred and forty were killed three forty\nKilled and until this week\nWe had and and this is the audacity of this person writing this article and Florida about the ... police benevolent association with more officers dine line of duty in Florida than any other state in the country\nBut this is how bad it is and yes it is a specific to Florida but this is what's going on across the country\nAnd he has the audacity that he didn't offer examples of how scrutiny and police as a result in a place being killed or assaulted\nNow\nIronically it is exactly exactly what the president of the Florida police benevolent association was saying when he made the endorsement with being kicked to the curb by special interest groups by media\nBy politicians and it's exactly why I started this theory that I did a couple of years ago\nAnd in the grand scheme of choosing sides we've now been put in that position yeah every now and then you're going to have a bad cop\nGet ... get hundreds of thousands of people from any background in any profession together and tell me you're not going to find a bad apple\nBut almost every one of all\nGood people put their

that's going on and media if we don't have good folks don't want to be police officers that put on the badge that leave their families and by the way just this year we had Seventy widows Seventy widows Seventy people that have lost their spouse\nAnd the line of duty we've got more than a hundred children that have lost a parent in the line of duty stories are never told but if we\nDon't have
