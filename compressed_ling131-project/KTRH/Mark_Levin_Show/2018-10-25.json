we want to know who did this as soon as possible and I believe the FBI we'll figure this out because nothing exploded\nSo they have these are these packages and these devices are in their original form\n\nWhich will make it much easier for them to track it down ... they'll get the guy or gal that guys or gals\nAt least I Hope so I think so based on my past experience of the department of justice they have a ton of evidence now they're going to be able to use different methods of tracking this down\nAnd they begin to pull strings and then the strings begin to pull the fabric the fabric begins to unravel and then they they're able to track people down but they need to find this person or these people because they may do it again they may do more of\nIt that's all we know we don't know their motives we don't know their motives\nWell we know the motive uh obviously it's a threatened if not harm if not kill the people they targeted\n\nBut there's a lot of speculation out there now why why can't people just white particularly in the media\n\nNow you can see that question though building that somehow this is Donald Trump's fault because the way he goes and speaks at rallies and the language he uses about this that or the other I Am so sick of this you have no idea the president of the United states without question faces death threats all the time\nIs it because what the Democrats say about him is it because what Joe Scarborough says about him or Don Lemon says about hammer scapegoat bears says about him\n\nThe other day the president said her rallies in a rally I

one\n[noise] the president is signing a series of opioid bills today all of which fell to recognize this premise as the main cause of the Seventy two thousand annual debts\nThat next data point that should concern us as the trajectory of the increase which is unfathomable\nWhile the overall numbers aren't higher than they were during Obama that is because the numbers dropped way once in a generation load during the first few months of Trump's presidency just based on the perception that heat enforce our sovereignty since a legal saw that nothing changed\nThe numbers surge beyond belief and the president has been trying over and over again he's been telling us he wants to make changes but the Democrats in Congress are blocking it\nAnd so are some Republicans by the way\nA total of sixteen thousand six hundred and fifty eight family units these or nuclear families were caught between the point of entry in September a new record and he's sharp spike from the previous months in total one hundred sixty one thousand and I love and one hundred and Thirteen family units were\nApprehended this year remember only one point four percent of the family units apprehended last year were deported so almost all of them remain in our communities along with the nearly half a million others who are never apprehended and this is growing every year so now we've gotten to almost seven hundred thousand\nAnd it goes on\nIs an incredibly serious matter of course national sovereignty the rule of law and the nature of our immigration system it's being openly and brazen we violated in ...\nJust by aliens by people in our own country by people in our own country\nNow we spend a lot of time last night it's been picked up by a lot of news outlets a conservative news outlets since today as we have in the past on this issue pointing out the hypocrisy of the Democrats Hillary Clinton\nBill Clinton Brock Obama Bernie Sanders Chuck Schumer and many others Harry Reid\nThe positions that they took ten years ago Fifteen Years ago twenty five years ago the positions that they took on a legal immigration first of all they called them illegal immigrants\nAs recently as two thousand nine twenty ten Chuck Schumer called them illegal immigrants as a matter of fact he admonished his audience in two thousand nine he said look\nIf you don't use the word illegal\nThen you lose essentially the moral high ground what is this on documented stuff\nHe said now of course these reverse course because they're all about power in politics not about country\nSo what's the point the point is the Democratic party is not even the Democrat Party of ten years ago it's certainly not the Democratic party Twenty years ago\nIts position on immigration like its position on economics like its position in the military like its position on healthcare embraces increasingly radical policies and attitude\nAnd it's not going to get any better it's going to get worse\nIf the media really want to understand the division in this country they need only look at themselves and look at the course of the Democratic party has taken you've a party where John Kennedy couldn't be nominated for the presidency today you have a party where Bill Clinton couldn't be nominated for the presidency today\nYou have a party that wouldn't nominate Harry Truman for the presidency today and I could go down the list\n\nAnd so now you individuals who won out radical\nEach other tell me who is a centrist than the Democrat leadership boy\nSo called ... can you name one just name one\nWell I Can't name any I
