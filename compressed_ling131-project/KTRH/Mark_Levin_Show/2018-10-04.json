up and handed over it's only been said four billion times that that's what a background check is\n\nSo what is it that the FBI needs to find out now if they really did interview\nDr Ford then they should take with them prosecutor\nRachel metros memo and as well as several the points I've been raising and then have Dr Ford square the circle\nThat would be a real criminal investigation\nAnd they

objective was to protect segregation\nA war fought over slavery\nRiots in war is if you will domestically fought over segregation\n\nThen they claim the mantle of civil rights\nWhen it's the Republican Party\nThat oppose slavery that oppose segregation those were not Republican governor standing in the door house and then the Democrats trying to rewrite history well you know the old Democrats or the new Republicans no they're not\nThey're not in the least\nThe Democrats are gone\nThey didn't turn into young Republicans\nBut this mindset of nullification you can see was sanctuary cities secession you can see it in California where the radical left\n\nThe mindset about destroying individual human beings the mindset about old white men and phrases like that it's the Democrat Party\n\nJust change their approach it's all about power the Democrat Party cannot survive if the nation is United\nWhat is the Democrat Party the Democratic party is an entity\nPolitical entity\nThat is made up of disparate parts\nBased on race\nBased on religion or no religion\nBased on income\nBased on age\nAnd so forth and so and it is the party a balkanization as the party of tribalism\n\nAnd so when you and I when we try to discuss the constitution the declaration these are very quaint ideas to the Democrats but they really have nothing to do with anything\nThere objective is always how to get power and how to keep it had to advance the cause whether they win elections or lose elections why do you think we have this massive administrative state the early progressive to tell you why because elections come and go Franklin Roosevelt tells you why\nThat we will only have\nTemporary control over the instruments how these of government but we need to make permanent our policies\nAnd so they have bastard eyes the federal judiciary they've created a fourth branch of government and this massive administrator state\nSo even when they lose elections from their perspective they're supposed to win when they win elections they tell you they have a mandate so they never lose what\nObama said when they lost the when he lost the mid term during his presidency\nThat all those people didn't vote he represents them and the ones who voted Democrat so in his mind he had a perverse idea that he represented the vast majority the American people including those who didn't vote and the Democrats who did vote\nLook yesterday and now today the New York times a massive story Fifteen thousand words that's like three chapters in a typical book\nOn Fred Trump's taxes and tax returns going back to the early to thousands\nWhat did they get that information\nWhere did they get that information is is a civil liberties union we're forced to file federal income taxes we're forced to file death taxes we have no choice we have to give it to the IRS and state authorities\n\nThe New York times said it had a one hundred thousand pages they went through to be more accurate went through one hundred thousand pages that boxes and boxes of material if it were you know hard\nCopy as opposed to a a chronically provided well they got it from the government obviously\nThe question is which part of the government the U.S attorney's office eternity general's office in New York\nBob Mueller's office\nThe Internal Revenue what did they get this information from does anybody care notice anybody even raise it\nNow and half of the article\nIs an attack on Trump effectively as a failed businessman that but for his father he could never have achieved great wealth you've never seen the peace like that written about the Kennedys ever and you never will\nOr any of these multi billionaire families\nWith a father and grandfather created the initial wealth\n\nMost of your familiar with New York city aren't you\nAll those buildings with the president's name on he created this\nEven in areas where it used to be warehouses and so forth along the Hudson River he rebuilt that entire area\nThey want you to believe that Donald Trump\nIs a lousy businessman as a lousy developer and but for his father he couldn't succeed\nThere's some concern about that and they go on about how he he's a tax cheat first of all as I understood these were his father's tax returns but\nWhy is he attacks cheat has he been adjudicated attacks cheap now has he been adjudicated attack street administratively or judicial like no\nNo he has\nNow what is the president's supposed to do now you know full well when you have these kinds of holdings you can't actually follow your own tax returns you hire professionals and you sign the tax return and you submit it\n\nMatter of course the goal is to pay lower taxes as possible\n\nI asked Bill Clinton that I seem to recall one year he deducted as used underwear member that Mr producing\n[noise] but there's never\nBeen a New York times investigation into the Clintons' like this\n\nThe wheeling and dealing they haven't built a damn thing is there a single building in New York or any other part of the country with the Clintons name on it now what do they do to make a hundred and fifty million dollars\nDid they pay their taxes\nHow about all these foreign speeches that they influenced the Clintons particularly when she was secretary of state or a senator\n\nThe New York times doesn't care anymore than the New York times doesn't care that
