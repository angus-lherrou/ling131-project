birthright citizenship then we'll get an all the rest of it [noise] Paul Ryan said something today that I thought it was quite interesting being the constitutional scholars ideas and here's what he said about birthright\nCitizenship and the president by the way the president didn't bring it up I heard one of the miscreants on on cable say the president brings this stuff up to divide than they first of all he was asked about it he didn't bring it up secondly it's not about dividing the nation it's about upholding the constitution okay\nNobody really knows how birthright citizenship was instituted we've investigated this\nIt started in the sixties bureaucratic like the old ins\nStarted doing ... put it that way as the bureaucracy does this all the time there's been no law passed that conveys birthright citizenship on to illegal aliens\nThere's been no Supreme Court decision that definitively confirmed birthright citizenship onto illegal alien children\nNobody's a hundred percent certain how this came to be\n\nBut everybody seems to be a hundred percent certain that the president can't fix it\nSo the executive branch unilaterally somehow somewhere in the bureaucracy decided to interpret this as it's being interpreted today nobody knows exactly who exactly what office but there it is\nAnd so the president is asked about it and says how did you find out about this yet we're working on executive no you can't change the constitution by executive order well does the constitution confer birthright citizenship on the children of illegal aliens\nOf course it doesn't which all explaining a minute that here's\nThe current speaker of the house Paul Ryan who is silent for months but now he feels compelled to speak out go ahead\nWell you obviously cannot do that um you cannot and birthright citizenship with an executive order we didn't\nLike it when Obama tried changing immigration laws the executive action and obviously as conservatives um you know we believe in and and the constitution [noise] you know the conservative I'm a believer in following the plain text of the constitution and I think in this case the fourteenth amendment ... pretty clear [laughter] um and that would involve a very very laying the constitutional process\nThe ignorance on this subject like so many others is unbelievable the speaker of the house who cares not one ... about the history of the fourteenth amendment not one where\nYou have so called experts constitutional experts professors former trial judges in New Jersey who say the same exact thing ignorant beyond belief illiterate when they come to the fourteenth amendment\nSo I decided let's play a little piece that I did in twenty Fifteen\nOver three years ago we can go back further but that's long enough to provide a basic foundation of understanding of what those who wrote the fourteenth amendment and ratified the fourteenth amendment actually meant that's got to cut Eighteen go\nAnd yet nobody did a better job of explaining this then professor Edward earlier who I've talked about over the years\nAnd he's a professor at California State University who was also at the er Claremont Institute senior fellow there for more than a happens to me right\nAnd he testified before a subcommittee a Congress many years ago almost Twenty years ago\nAnd he set forth the case now he's not the only one professor Thomas west has a ... a professor at the University of Texas law school maybe more than them the framers of the constitution\n\nOr set forth that is a primary the fourteenth amendment got\nHave after the civil war three amendments to the constitution the Thirteen fourteen Fifteen called the civil war amendments and we know pretty much what occurred\nProfessor earlier was testifying you said it's my considered opinion Congress has the authority under section five of the Fourth Amendment\nTo define the jurisdiction of the United states of the fourteenth amendment of course and did it as my contention that Congress has exercise that power on many occasions and most recently of immigration reform of control lack of Nineteen eighty six and I would say they also exercised it\nWith the

I get to talk to so many of you people say mark your show is different because you really get into the substance now we have fun don't get me wrong we do our thing too\nBut we do really get into the substance it's one thing to say yeah yeah yeah obviously the constitution doesn't provide that's not enough\n\nThat's not enough so when you were in the debate format or political format or a classroom format or this format you need to back it up and that's what we do here we back it up\nSenator Jacob Howard the author of the citizenship clause in the fourteenth amendment he spoke he told us what he meant\nHe defined who would fall within the quote jurisdiction of the United states unquote\nReady quote\nEvery person born within the limits of the United states and subject to their jurisdiction meaning the states there just is\nIs by virtue of natural law national law a citizen of the United states this will not of course include all persons born in the United states who are foreigners aliens who belong to the families have been ... foreign ministers credited or the government of the United states\nBut will include every other class a person's it settles to a great question of citizenship and removes all doubt as to what persons are or are not citizens of the United states this has long been a great issue in the jury stick at George prudence and legislation of this country\nWhich the call screener Mr producer you understand that right\nIs it not plain English\nIs he not as clear as can be that it does not include alliums that does not include foreigners that does not include families are within bachelors or foreign ministers\nSo the author of citizenship clause intended to count foreigners alien to those born to a bachelor's foreign ministers as outside the jurisdiction of the United states that senator Jacob Howard he knew as his reference to natural law indicates\nThat the Republican base has little are Republican basis for citizenship\nIs

seventies somehow somewhere the bureaucracy began\nNot even interpreting the constitution just conveying citizenship on the children of illegal aliens there's absolutely no historical basis for this there's no constitutional basis for this there's no statutory basis for this\n[noise] my buddy Andy McCarthy wrote a brilliant piece of National Review is he didn't want to do and he said well the fourteenth amendment has been codified I was in Nineteen fifty two I think he said well that doesn't really in my humble opinion address the issue\nCodified in the constitution as a way of describing an aspect of a statute is really\nPretty a pretty frequent practice it doesn't really lend anything to the interpretation but we know what the authors of the fourteenth amendment meant because they told us we have no real Supreme Court decision\nAre conveying a citizenship on the children of illegal aliens and then we\nHave Paul Ryan let's play cuts six again Mr boosts and Paul Ryan saying that you can't change the constitution with an executive order who is changing the constitution it's the executive branch the president of the United states who is the executive branch taking back the in Saudi do interpret and enforce the fourteenth amendment go ahead\nWell you obviously cannot do that you cannot in birthright citizenship with an executive order we didn't like it when Obama tried changing immigration laws the executive action and obviously\n... who is changing immigration laws you know I\nBrought as a guest here Daniel Harlow which is an expert in this area as he is in many incredibly intelligent you write so very conservative reviewer and a Daniel Horwitz what is Speaker Ryan even talking about\nOh great to be with you mark and first of all condolences on the last year patriot dead he's a he's in a better place thank you\nUm you know this is constitutional constitutionally illiterate I cannot relate to what these people are saying let's put this in plain English here basically they're saying mark I could break into your home kicked down the door drop a kid there\nAnd hit the right to live there for the remainder of his life and there's not a darn thing you can do about it even henceforth that's what they're basically saying it's nothing to do with the president there arguing we can't even do this through Congress\nOr the reality is that even if we agree to the notion of birthright citizenship that there is a legal mandate a floor requiring\nA Congress and the executive branch to issue a citizenship to any child of any legal immigrant under any circumstance as the court didn't among can are a very active it's decision but let's agree to that\nThere is no way you could extrapolate that\nDo people who came here without consent the key words are consent and sovereignty nothing ever supersede that nobody could unilaterally assert jurisdiction\nAnd uh make it that there is nothing we can do to stop this and I think mark more broadly speaking what the disturbing trend we're seeing is that throughout the last number of decades past administrations have actually use the executive power to subvert sovereignty\nIt looks like Trump is doing a lot of things executive Lee but the details matter and what he's doing is actually pursuing the law and as you mentioned there is nothing in statute requiring\nThis and it all actually happened by accident through laziness and lack of enforcement\nExplain that because people are under the impression including the current speaker of the house who's taken an oath to uphold the constitution and some of these fools on TV who pretend they're experts\nThey seem to think that the fourteenth amendment says what they say it says now were originally this and that includes the actual lists and you look at the language as intended as written at the time and they tell us exactly\nWhat they meant and nowhere do they mean affirmatively giving citizenship to children of illegal aliens\nI think this is where some of our colleagues go awry ... doesn't mean Amelia Delia style liberalism right on even if it didn't say and subject to the jurisdiction thereof if it's just that anyone born in the U.S is a citizen I got news for them\nFor a hundred and Thirty years there's an uninterrupted stream of case law including cases written by the one Kim arc justice Horace Gray saying that if you come here without consent\nAnd you do not have legal status it is in the most literal and physical sense as if you were standing outside of our boundaries in terms of access\nTo the courts in terms of rights in terms of everything so literally you are not on our soil and and that is settled law so when Congress nearly cut and paste the text of the fourteenth amendment in Nineteen fifty two they could've never fathom such an egregious argument\nThat the one who is in Nineteen fifty to the constitution was not interpreted as giving citizenship to the children of illegal aliens\nExactly it's like saying proved to me that the fourteenth amendment didn't mean to mandate gay marriage will I mean no one would have thought that and and and that's the thing here what are
