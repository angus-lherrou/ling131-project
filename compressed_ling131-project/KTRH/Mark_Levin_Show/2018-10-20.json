C. W. A. L. ... the the uh ... station for your nation's capital so I Know these think tanks right Kato was a think tank that focuses on free market principles and ideas\nAnd a libertarian\nOr concepts and principles are and they're all brilliant\nThey're all really smart people over Kato and uh I'm really looking forward to this a very special edition of life liberty and lived in the Sunday make sure you tune in because I miss mark I miss my just as much as you do\nA great to be here I'm I'm lifting my ah outrageous a gender discrimination it won't be ladies only from this point forward but I Do appreciate it I just did an event with mark living here in the greater Washington area we had a theater full of five hundred people\nA year for the station and it was great marked at this great thing at the end of it you know we did like an hour and a half presentation on stage and before we were done he said you know I Want to say one more thing can cut all the ladies stand up\nTo the women in the room stand up and it was more than half of the room\nAnd it was so great that he did that and and and I love having there's still a bunch of women on the line wanting to get in\nBecause there's this there's this fake phony despicable myth bits perpetuated\nAbout talk radio about what we do here when we when we discuss\n... big important ideas and conservative principles and values and we have this free\nFlow of information and exchange of perspectives and they will lie to you wouldn't say it's just angry white men angry white men angry white men it's always angry white man I'm not angry are you angry I mean I mean there are some things in this country that if you're not angry ... years something wrong with you\nBut I approached this from an angry perspective I Know that you don't\nAnd and you don't care what color I Am I don't know what color you are white and always angry white men they thing um and and so when you when you specifically say I'd like to hear from women boy I can tell you I've been doing a talk radio for years now with the didn't big markets and across the country and when you say women I like to hear from you\nBoom those phone lines just explode because oh let me tell you something there's no way\nYou can grow and expand the kind of of communication product that has been growing and expanding for talk radio over these last decades by just being\nJust targeting angry white man it's a myth it's a lie that they love to say about what we do here because they're ... they don't want a new generation of listeners the last thing they want\nIs for a men and women in their twenties that's when people start listening to talk radio when they're done with the idiots who play music and and\nBlow the the ... a bicycle foreign and ring the cowbell and make jokes about a body parts and they they start to get real jobs and have to wear long pants and have bills and are making money and they see how much is getting taken out of their paycheck\nAnd they're trying to settle down and actually be a grown up that's when they start exploring other parts of the radio dial and that's when they hear talk radio because they want to know what's going on out there\nThan it usually happens in your late twenties early thirties that certainly when it started with me in a serious way and it terrifies but the mainstream media it terrifies the gate keepers in the media who used to be in charge of all of these outlets\nRadio television newspapers they're still in charge of newspapers but they're not in charge of the Internet [noise]\nClemens the last time you actually bought a newspaper I mean unless you ride the subway in New York when was the last time right\nAnd so they're terrified and so they want they they put the lie out there they put the lives out there that this is hate radio that it's nothing but a bunch of angry old white men shouting hand so when we have the opportunity to say hey ladies love to hear from you [noise]\nExplodes uh

cases\nBut Republicans did not follow through for him they just didn't\nAnd they'll tell you is because the Democrats stood on the way because of the filibuster and they'll tell you that it was because of a threat of government shutdown they'll tell ya lots of reasons\nIt doesn't matter they've had the majority and if they wanted to\nThey really really wanted to they could have pushed for that wall they could have pushed\nFor jumping on board the president's agenda with regard to immigration the fact is too many of them don't want to either because they're getting their beds feathered by the U.S chamber of commerce and other ... deep pocketed interest groups who do not want our immigration laws enforced as they're written\nOr it's because they're terrified that they're going to lose reelection\nBut here's the thing they didn't get elected so that they could get reelected I don't know anybody who votes\nThinking yeah I'm going to put this person in the house of representatives so the two years from now they can win reelection\nI I'm going to vote for the senator so six years from now I can vote for them to get their job is not to keep their job their job is to do with the voters expect them to do\nAnd they didn't they dropped the ball\nOn enforcing our immigration laws and protecting our border\nAnd and if if they lose in many respects it's going to be because of that\n\nOr let's go to Daryl in Portland, Oregon your next step on Larry O'Connor infer mark live in hey Darryl\nHow're you doing guys though I've watched I've watched\nThe border over the years grew up in a Chandler, Arizona and you know they actually had a ... year they had a fear of consequences that if they snuck across the border for a job and they you know if you know food or whatever they did\nThat if they ever got caught they were going to get you know tossed out of the country they've got to basically everything that they're welcome more than the citizens and then you have people standing in line trying to do with the right way there's no incentive to do it and if you think walls don't work so back to the Israelis\n[laughter] yeah exactly you know Daryl it's so funny when you say you know I remember when I was younger people didn't cross the border because if you remember a that movie from Cheech Marin from Cheech and Chong was born in east LA\nYou remember that and it was a parody song they did a parody of born in the usa called born in east LA and it was in the entire movie was about him being well actually the irony is his character was not actually illegal but it was but it was about him\nOn the run from border patrol and from immigration officials who were trying to deport him right\nHey if oh if only that really were the case if ... what what has changed for God's sake that was in a movie in the eighties\nYou know ... in the beginning it was a ... can't think of who who was in Arizona at the time I mean they have been there forever I mean obviously is not no longer with us but uh\nIt's just that it's slowly that came in more and more and more and then they became lighter and lighter on the consequences you know when you get here and then now they're actually given the benefits like hey we'll take care of you know you want to have you know four or five kids go ahead\nOh we're not doing enough for him Darryl Darryl thank you for the call and we're not doing enough for these people who are in this country illegally it's it's funny I I I always hear from people but you know for those who have been here for many years and they become part of our society the ones who are law abiding tax paying\nA uh people in this country or that even though they're illegal we should have a path to citizenship for them and it sounds great doesn't it they've been here they've been law abiding they've been paying their taxes they shouldn't be deported we should give them a path to citizenship\nWhenever anyone says that you could you just follow up for a minute and say I did get a hold on I hear this a lot\n... they're here in the country illegally they've been here for years they're law abiding\nAnd they pay their taxes and they've got jobs\nCan you explain how that's possible because if they're in this country illegally for years and years and years and they've got a job\nAnd they're paying taxes on the money they make from that job then by definition they are not law abiding number one they've broken our law by staying in this country or entering this country illegally but number two\nIf they got a job that means they buy their lied\nAbout their documentation or they're using fraudulent documentation quite possibly they're guilty as an accessory to identity theft\nSays so your argument is that complete and total nonsense [noise] if someone has been in this country illegally for years and they have a job and they're paying taxes\nThey are by definition not law abiding they are continuously had bit surely and on a regular basis breaking the law\nAnd the fact is one party in this country apparently still cares about keeping our laws enforced\nOr speaking of east LA let's go to Ken in Los Angeles well my my adopted my my first adopted home now Washington this is my second adopted home you're like sitting on the great age seven to the answer care really are I Can't what do you make of this\nAll right [noise] well I wanted to talk to people about getting out and vote in a case that false pole and ah [noise]\nAre convinced self showing and Flanders also discourage people from voting yeah\nAnd the overall media onslaught this the scourge many conservatives those on the right from voting mhm they're only about seven percent of the u._s. citizens Eighteen years old in older it's rooted for President Trump has a primary\nAbout twenty five percent of the general for you see there are a lot of people that aren't voting I think actually\nMost of them would vote conservative is they're going to have voted for\nYeah it can do you think though at this point after what we saw in twenty sixteen and and with the new trends with regard to polling and how you know people don't even answer the phone on their cell phone if they don't recognize the number did you think people still do believe these polls do you think that I think that people just inherently\nUh believe that these polls are phoney and fraudulent or they they are I mean one of the last time they were accurate\nYell I think often that's probably the case but it's similar to the fore Anders that people don't actually believe the frontrunners for what they believe is that other people will believe him and they won't get out the vote show they think that\nThat lives in ... that is definitely the danger and and and Ken thank you for the call out there in LA\nUh I I don't disagree with you that is a danger I think though that this president the fact that he's rallying and going out and doing these rallies or several times a week between now and election or the fact that the the cabin on\nHearing I still believe resonates and I do want to believe that that was a motivating factor for people I think and and and and back to our topic of the hour that caravan\nI think when people turn on their television and see thousands and thousands of people waving the flags of their country demanding entry into our\nNation I maybe I'm naive maybe I don't get it\nBut to me that is the greatest free advertising for Trump in the Republican Party that we will ever see who wants to be on the side of the party who opens up our borders and says you betcha come on and take whatever you want because that's what one party's position is\nAnd it's certainly in the Republicans I'm Larry O'Connor and you're listening
