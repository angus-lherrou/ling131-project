Ferguson\nSelling a night hello and thank you so much and I get an excellent job thrown in for mark thank you I appreciate that\nThank you um I had two comments one I Want to let you know first of all that I suffer from depression and I have a suicide attempt number of years ago I Am doing somewhat better but I'm a couple of years ago I realized that I was probably living a little bit ahead of my time and that society was going in this direction as a whole\nUm even though I had depression I didn't have any kind of psychosis or thoughts disturbances but when I started winning and mental health housing and I spoke out\nAbout somebody of use it that we're going on\nAnd some of the you know quake nut rolls and what have you all the sudden I seem to have like thoughts disturbances although no one could that explain to me what it was prior to that no one ever thought ahead anything but you know mental illness from depression\nAnd uh then they made up story that I was violent and I got kicked out of two places even though some of the age of forty four years old I never had any kind of history of anything on any homeless twice I've lived in my car but\nIt's also suicide prevention months and\nI think by making it sound as well ... what kind of mental illness whether he got dark and it's not even an issue\nBecause as you said they had nothing to say that about him to be four of them spoke out about Bush [noise] it makes it very difficult I think the young men in particular\nWasn't it wasn't out her day was it yesterday if I'm not mistaken mental health awareness day\nIt's a whole month you know how it is unfortunately a lot of there's a month to everything now they must be honest you know but it's supposed to be\nTechnically we're just and just that people know that we were when we make it clear what did it yesterday was world mental health day two thousand Eighteen\nWorld Health a world mental health day uh it's it's on October the tent that's the reason I say this is where's the compassion and and I say this first of all thank you for\nYour sharing your story and I'm I'm so thankful that you were unsuccessful in your attempt to take your life uh I ... my best friend in college um took his own life and it is something that sticks with me and and all of our close friend group ever since and I have great compassion for\nThose that suffer with mental health and it's something that we shouldn't make fun of but to to score political points with Kanye West as the left is doing saying you know we're clearly and again they say that the president's taking advantage of a man who clearly has mental health issues\nAs a token a black man uh and and there and he's taking advantage abusing him by putting them out there today\nNo one said any of that\nWhen Kanye West came out and said George Bush doesn't like black people\nBecause it was a narrative they wanted to be out there it was the narrative that they want it they they they were OK with that narrative Dan you are on the mark of an show Ben Fergus and we didn't go ahead\nStole my thunder but the uh uh President Bush hates black people man I was like I was all part of the hit that um they check this out so now Herschel Walker is going to be the next soaking negro because he said that Don Lemon ...\nUm I think it was horrible at these lessons are doing but that's a whole other thing is
