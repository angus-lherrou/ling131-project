Hillsdale dot com that's living for Hillsdale dot com L. E. V. I. and free Hillsdale dot com [noise]\nNot ladies and gentlemen I I have a solution for this or they called a caravan this invasion that's taking place [noise] I have a solution I posted up on Facebook and is this\nThe a prime minister of ah Canada\nTrudeau young Trudeau chip off the old man's block Trudeau has set in the past say we we uh welcome aliens illegal aliens I guess he calls them undocumented migrants\nFrom all parts of the world we in Canada we're loving people we're compassionate people\nWe welcome all people hear some thinking to myself I have a solution to all this stuff\nA solution for the illegal aliens who are trying to come into the country illegally a solution for the Trump Administration and the solution for the Trudeau administration here's what we do\n[noise] president United States picks up the phone and he calls Trudeau and he says hey we got\nSeven to fourteen thousand people coming here legally I Know you support illegal immigration I Know your borders are wide open you've said it over and over again and you've said you're very compassionate about these things so here's what we're going to do when I get a whole bunch of greyhound buses\nAnd we're going to have as many of these caravan marchers as possible get on the buses and we're going to drive them you know the way Mexico\nDoes it lets these people go through their country and our country we can learn something from Mexico oh we can and what we'll do is we'll put them on greyhound buses and will drive them tour northern ...\nOrder and we'll let them out because Canada wants them these people want to leave they ... they come from my lab to say that I mean if you're marching a thousand miles or two thousand miles I assume they're how ... even though they're carrying their flags and in the United states this\nPresident believes in law and order and enforcing the immigration laws so there you haven't you satisfy all three the illegal aliens wind up in Canada leaving their hell halls Canada receives them because their arms are wide open for them and in the United states we enforce our border and our immigration laws I think that's a brilliant idea ...\nAnd on top of that look at greyhound greyhound makes a profit to they could probably use so that's\nMy solution ladies and gentlemen for the caravan ha a parade of illegal immigrants who are coming into our country\nSupported by left wing groups south of the border left wing groups within the United states funding organizations within our borders funding organizations outside our borders like in Venezuela and so forth but here we can accommodate everybody\nOK well use Hooper too I don't care if we can use ... you can use taxis greyhound\nWhatever I'm not particular about these things\n\n[noise] while Mr producer my call screeners down why don't you give me a hand and tell me the number one if we ever live and number two if not if we have a regular American\n\nMike in Maryland the great WMA out go\nHey mark great talking to you a first time caller\nAnything else on the war rhetoric that going on um one thing I noticed that some things to push the buttons to push this guy but was that\nUm you know it's the first time where supporters of a particular candidate have been directly or ... or attacked and attacked regularly for a long term and you know and that's a thought things that people when they when they fix the side and then there are backed by the ...\nAnd ... that's my point is you know they formed back and forth that it's a it's the rhetoric between what Donald Trump that and and what the media and the Democrats say it it showed directed to I don't ever remember Donald Trump I'm doing something that his supporters of the Democrats the way that the\nArmed burglaries and so forth and we actually to believe\n\nThat the political rhetoric causes these things I mean seriously ladies and gentleman this guy has a a long crime record including threatening to use a bomb in two thousand to multiple felonies\n\nAnd we get played all the time by the media really by the left more more more generally played all the time well if the president we keep down his rent has nothing to do with the president then as I pointed out in exquisite detail for the last forty eight hours\nIt's the president who's called Hitler it's the president who's called a Nazi it's just supporters us\nWho are called neo Nazis and racist which the president who's called a racist and he's called a racist and Nazi on MSNBC\nOr CNN by the late night host which is really truly appalling absolutely appalling\n\nAnd then they tell you know we got to tone down here toned down immediately out of the ... sucker who's responsible for CNN\nPuts out a statement without knowing anything blaming Trump\nJake Tapper such a fool he goes on the air like John Harris I think that was me and they go in there and say what Trump says stop blaming him he was blaming him what do you do is blaming him all of you idiots are blaming him your network I miss LSD\nSome idiot writing a column in a\nIn the Washington Post Dana Milbank\nTalk about a low life\nLook at this Joe Scarborough Mika Brzezinski this is a clown that this is Barnum Bailey there the center ring they should be bouncing balls on their nose specially him with that Bob us knows it as\nThey should be doing a clown car stuff\n\nOh but Trump UC inspired this guy this guy was committing felonies before Trump even thought about running for anything\nGrotesque [noise]\nYou know your data is everywhere

Margaret Mr producer\nWho do you recommend that I should speak to\nEight Seventy am Ken in California go\nYeah smart ... uh some employers and it scares me but I think I should but I Need you to clarify the numbers\nForms well out here to help sir\nI heard that there are either fifty thousand or five hundred thousand cases to be adjudicated as to whether they can stay in the country\nNo that's wrong there's one million\nIt's one million okay that's we're armpit\nInherited a backlog of one million people understand how this works when somebody stepped foot in the country and uses magic words that the lawyers tell him they use lawyers south of the border lore is north of the border they have the system they know what the law as\nIt triggers a mechanism bureaucratic legal mechanism where they have a right to be a period before administrative law judges and because there's so many of them\nThey're given a date to return and often that they could be two or three years away and guess what the vast majority of them never show up\nRight now I realize that so my my solution will partial solution would be to try to in\nIn California for example if there are shortages of attorneys you can appointed commissioner is that possible to appoint a number of us are\nThey disappear in the shadows you can opponent commissioner you're going to ... for the day you know they're not listen to me I Know you're you're you're enthralled with your idea they're not coming to court they're not coming back\nBut at least we'll be able there like it more as they come you\nKnow you don't understand they have a right to come back they don't have to be a ... in other words nobody adjudicate something right there you get through to assemble your evidence and make your arguments and so forth and so on so they're not going to adjudicate them right there\nI ... that that's the process\nAnd the president has been begging Congress trying to change the system to prevent this and of course the Democrats refused\nSo it would be able to to eliminate that you know in backlog you're talking about\nYou know the million backlog is one day going to become a two million back lot and this backlog that I talk about again these people are gone there somewhere in our country we don't know where they live\nSome cases they gave false names that have false IDs it becomes impossible it becomes about women anarchy right now absolute anarchy in the immigration world [noise] and uh you can thank the Democrats and the federal judges absolute anarchy thank you for your call my friend I
