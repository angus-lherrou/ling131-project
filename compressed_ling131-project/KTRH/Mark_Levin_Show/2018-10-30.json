states from Israel with us unfortunately under these circumstances run drummer first I'd like your general take on what has taken place here and secondly I Know you've been in Pittsburgh who did you meet with um what did you see there's certain\nWhile it to you know a horrific act or send us a medic attack and us history they climbed eleven lives I I was in Pittsburgh yesterday\nGot to meet with the members of the community you got to meet with the mayor with the county executive I'm with Senator Casey was there we had a a congressman Republicans and Democrats and talked to a lot of people have to tell you mark it's a very very strong community\nAnd I think a special community and squirrel hill\nA Pittsburgh they're they're very very tight it it's not just taking it among the Jewish community but also the Dodgers community supporting them and I went to an event last night\nUh that really brought out the entire community faith leaders Christians a Jewish faith leaders most from leader who actually spoke there as well and spoke very well and uh I think the humidity is just trying to support 'em the Jewish community there and everyone told me the same thing we never thought it was going to happen here\nI think they were just shocked and stuff on a and what I wanted to do is Israel's ambassador to the United states is just tell them that Israel stance with that that they're not alone\nAnd they and Israel yesterday morning our government may taught Sunday because some days like Monday Israel the first day of the week and the government meets every Sunday at there was a moment of silence where the entire government\nOf Israel ... because we are the one and only Jewish state and so we feel a special sense of solidarity with Jewish communities around the world and that's why I was for me to be in Pittsburgh uh yesterday\nNow you were born in Miami and just when people do this you're born in Miami your father was the mayor of Miami your brother was the mayor Miami\nMiami Beach Miami Beach was about that yeah we're the ones with the speech that that's true [noise] um\nSo you know the United states very very well obviously you are an Israeli citizen and you are you're very close to the prime minister of Israel so when you look at this we see growing anti Semitism throughout Europe\nOr the FBI put out a report to the latest report you see growing anti Semitism or hate crimes as I called in the United states what do you make of this\nKind of it is it's going to say a growing problem uh many people want to say that it began in fails sixteen with President Trump's election that's simply not true and you look at the FBI statistics that you mention\nA thousand fourteen and two thousand Fifteen a hate crimes against Jews accounted for over half of hate crimes against religious groups and the United states it was only two percent of the population market there\nAccounting for over half and by the way there were periods over the last Fifteen Years was about Seventy five percent of the number of uh\nUh attack the crimes against Jews were actually much bigger than I was in two thousand fourteen of two thousand Fifteen [noise] I really think what you have mark is is the rise of anti Semitism over the last couple of decades which you had was about a half century after the Holocaust where it was politically incorrect to attack choose\nAnd I think what you've seen happen over the last two decades is\nThat it's once again become fashionable or to attack juice and it's no longer politically incorrect to go after Jews now most of the attacks actually hide themselves\nBehind the mask of hatred towards Israel to one and only Jewish state but at the singling out of Israel is very much like they used to single out the Jews for special treatment so I think you've seen this on the rise it's not just in America\nIt's all around the world you see in attacks against Jews in Paris attacks against choosing to lose attack against Jews in Copenhagen attacks against Jews in Brussels and in London and even in the United states uh this is not the first attack\nThere was an attack in two thousand six to the G federation in Seattle there was an attack in two thousand fourteen at a Jewish community center a added outside of Kansas Kansas City with I think claim three lives and this is just the worst attack but this is a growing problem and I think one of the issues is social media\nBecause you know you can have a very very small fraction of the population that are these are you know these crazy I don't know if I'd call them crazy but evil people um you\nCould have a a one one hundredth of one percent could be thirty thousand Americans\nUm and there's a stream is can be people like David Duke it could be neo Nazis it could be white nationalist all sorts of people but online they can actually build communities of hate in a way that they couldn't do before so I think as you get more and more people going into social media is you have this rise of abuse online hate groups\nI think it's extremely dangerous Senate dangerous and it it has given\nThem a sense of community of haters and I think it's important to take action against that I Will tell you marketed in Israel\nWe monitor the Internet now we're a different country and you have constitutional protections here I Know that you're\nYou're a great defender of them we don't have a First Amendment Second Amendment Fourth Amendment but hopefully your law enforcement authorities can figure out a way within your laws constitutional rights that Americans have to figure out a way to monitor this so they can see when sort of this kind of hate pops up\nAnd then be able to take action before the crime takes place that's what we have in Israel um and it's been very effective at preventing a lot of these types of attacks I mean I Would love to believe that this was going to be the last attack but I think given that these all these haters are communicating with each other I think it's important for your forties to see what they can do to\nAs I say it's Americanism versus socialism it really is for those of us really know what's Americanism versus progressive as ... to ... now the media in this country they don't like to be called the enemy the people there are certainly not the friend of the people who've gone long ago\nA is the day when CNN

drowned its reports about the fate of Jews and the flood of or time news it's neglect was far from unique in its reach was not then fully national but as the pipe as the premier American source of war time news it surely influenced the judgment of other news providers\nWhile a few publications newspapers like the post ... or ... pm and New York in magazines like the nation and the New Republic showed more conspicuous concern\nThe New York times has coverage generally took the view that the atrocities inflicted upon Europe's Jews while horrific were not significantly different from those visited upon other war victims nor and more noteworthy\nOnly six times and nearly six years did the times front page mentioned Jews as Hitler's unique target for total annihilation only once was their fate the subject of elite editorial once only twice to their rescue inspired passionate cry prize in the Sunday magazine\nAnd it goes on\nThis is the history of the New York times which is completely

logic that out loud by law that Martin living in a show called now\nAt age seven seven three one ... one one\nOne of the key Senate races in this country is in the show me state Missouri [noise]\nAnd uh he got an excellent Republican candidate Josh Hawley versus Claire McCaskill Josh Hawley how are you sir\nI'm doing great thanks so much for having me\nWell it's my pleasure every election cycle Claire McCaskill tries to remake herself into some kind of a moderate I just solar interviewed on Fox where she says hey look I with Trump half the time and I love post Kavanaugh because of his views on foreign money in campaigns and\nNow are the people in Missouri going to buy this trick one more time\nNo they're not you know Senator McCaskill is trailing in the polls that she's a she's a little desperate to be honest with you\nMark and as you should be because ... she is out of step with the voters of the state it's just that simple I mean they told her that they wanted her to get with the program they voted for two thousand sixteen by twenty points by the way President Trump won the state by twenty\nEt cetera McCaskill turned her out to vote no on Neil Gorsuch to the Supreme Court no one justice Kevin ... know on the tax cuts no on border security no on rebuilding the military I mean it's just as she could not be more out of step\nWith his she running in New York and Missouri\nYeah exactly well most of her money comes from New York and California that she'd be a great senator for one of those places but for this they hardly and a ... that's her big problem and that's why she's down in the poll or she is just out of touch with the people of our good state\nI mean she really is a left us to be perfectly honest with you her votes really are not much different from a Bernie Sanders or ... and of course she will vote to make Chuck Schumer the leader of her up of the uh the Democrats in the Senate and she does that every time right\nAbsolutely she votes with him about Ninety percent of the time she has accepted twenty six million dollars and expenditures\nFrom Chuck Schumer he has spent more money in Missouri than anywhere else in the country trying to prop up but Senator McCaskill ended up by her seat and you know that's the kind of thing that Missouri's just don't take too well I mean they\nThey don't want anybody coming in and tell them how to vote and they have Chuck Schumer come into our state and try to buy the seat it just isn't flying\n[noise] they the top three issues in Missouri or as far as you see them what are they in what are your positions on\nI Would start with pro constitution judges and what happened to justice Cavanaugh\nIs a big big issue in this race it really exposed I think the left thirst for power the radical nature of their agenda and the fact that they have not accepted and are not willing to accept the results of the two thousand sixteen election and the rule of we the people you know they want to do everything\nCan to try to get their hands on power to undo what we the people have said\nAnd that is a huge issue in this race immigration is a huge issue in this race border security especially with this caravan as it continues to master the move towards the border Claire McCaskill is sponsoring and open borders bill in Congress the most radical open borders bill\nEver introduced and that that is a huge huge issue and then I think ah ah economic growth wage growth Senator McCaskill voted against\nThe middle class tax cuts she's voted over two hundred times to raise taxes in Congress and that people want somebody is going to go be a fighter for the middle class and workers and not just another big government liberal\n[noise] but you know these big government liberals think they found an issue you know that's a pre existing conditions on health care and they keep running around the country and every state by the way including your state was McCaskill saying you will oppose or ... or ... methods of protecting people with pre existing conditions is that your position or see just trying to make that your position\nOh she's just trying to make that my ... that's a total and ridiculous faucet and she knows it and I've called her out on many times in our debates I support of forcing insurance companies to cover folks with preexisting conditions on the same terms everybody else here's the difference mark I don't think we need Obamacare\nDo it and I think that we should stop holding hostage\nPatients who have pre existing conditions and everybody else too by the way holding them all hostage to Obamacare in my state income health care prices have increased a hundred and forty five percent on those health care exchanges\nThat is the national average things a hundred and two percent which is terrible but in Missouri it's a hundred and forty five percent families just can't afford their insurance\nThat's because of Obamacare it's because of Claire McCaskill she won't support any plan but is it Obamacare because she's a she's a big government liberal\n[noise] now is she going on about Medicare for all or is she duct that one\nWell she she tries to duck because he says he's open to it you know she's open to it of course we all know that that's where this is headed and we all know that that this she'll never vote against her party I mean she never does on any major issue an issue consequences and\nYou know my worry is look they cut seven hundred and sixteen billion dollars out of Medicare in order to pay for Obamacare imagined what they'll do\nTo pay for their government run health care scheme so you know it it is just a ... it will devastate a folks who are or who have paid into the system that will devastate families who are just barely making it now and and trying to get\nA hold of private insurance and that this is part of the radical Democrat agenda Claire McCaskill's on board with\nBut you make a good point Medicare for all is Medicare for nobody because they have to abolish Medicare they have to abolish every employer based private plan that the polished all private insurance and basically turn us into one ...
