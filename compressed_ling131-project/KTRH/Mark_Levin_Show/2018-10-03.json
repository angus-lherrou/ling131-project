make America happy because the alternative when a couple of years ago\nMy wife started to realize wait a minute why do I even ask you what you want for your birthday meal because I Know it's you want me to make your mom's pot roast you know the one with the Lipton onion soup and the cream of mushroom soup you cook it all day and\nShe makes a a a German chocolate cake and when I Walk in the house mark after she's been cooking at all day it just brings a smile to my face because it immediately transports me back to\nYou know fifty years in reverse suddenly I'm eight years old again I'm I'm In that little house on Margaret street in Russell, Kansas and\nIt's a happy place and everybody it seems that whom I've talked to has a happy food I I asked Dr oz I said you know I figured this was a\nKale something but now as it turns out it's it's a German chocolate cake or Sean Hannity or I asked him what he liked and he said all the foods corn beef and cabbage\nAnd the ... you know here's a guy he could have steak every meal\nUm but I happen to know that's not true well they eat the steak every damn meal that I happen to know as a matter of fact but anyway go ahead [laughter] really does but here's the\nThing he loves a corn beef and cabbage because that's what he used to make when he was like twelve years old or Thirteen Years old when he worked out at that normally would end where he was a short order cook\nA for years making like a two Seventy five an hour you got to make that and lobster and steak city he learned how to cook and when he wants\nA Happy Meal he will go and he will boil up a corn beef and cabbage and so anyway we we put together a bunch of the stories of of ah people and they're happy foods and they're sweet stories a lot of them are really funny and uh we put it together came out today it's doing great\nA happy cookbook let me ask you then to make America small it's a great\nThe happy cookbook and we have it up on ... face but mark I live in show Twitter you get it on Amazon any major bookstore but it is it's a nice you know diversion from all the stuff that's going up but I didn't know you know Greg Norman\nGreg Norman a actually just between you and me yes my\nWife and I spend a lot of time down or in the Jupiter, Florida\nArea now and don't give away your address for God's sakes no no Jupiter, Florida is large yes I'm\n... and so I we have met a Greg Norman through Fox and friends and ah you know we'll go down there every once\nIn a while and he's got a little golf course it will play out and have a very nice guy and one of his recipes isn't the cookbook and he loves this thing called crispy crackling pork loin which is you take a pork loin and you've got to get a special cut because uh\nSomething when these are people who have proven again and again that they are not to be trusted and they are not to have their word taken for anything [noise] yeah she\nShe had all those over once she's interviewed again\nBy the FBI yeah we're good we're good we're going to go ahead and cast a vote because at this point this has become ridiculous we've reached that point where it's time to call the room to order\nCast a vote and move on and that's nonsense we've have you ever been to a public meeting I served on city council for six years and I'm going to tell you there are\nTimes when you get these groups it'll come forward it's usually some activist group and they come forward and you know they're nuts when they first walk in the door\nThere was one group that used to come in and had this old black lady they were\nKind of a they were kind of a nation of Islam come black lives matter come are\nAngry at the world come ... group and they had this oh woman and she'd come she ... she'd come in\nAnd uh she where like this ... and it had buttons on it and the buttons were\nJust crazy nutty like every Salo Lenski group every now mind you this was before the Soros influence things have things have really taken a turn for the worse in the ten years since I left public life since I left been elected official\nBut she would come every time and she would carry a file folders\nAnd I I don't know what was in her father folders but it was a bunch of documents that were kind of bent\nAnd I don't know ... maybe it was the Warren Commission report on the Kennedy assassination and maybe some notes from Charlotte mean and you know a couple of ah edicts I'm from the council of elders may be the ... you know as a tack\nCold at the top a British she would come forward\nAnd they would come to city council meetings every time they were ready for you know a a vote on reparations or something\nAnd they would come rolling in in a group\nAnd their whole you remember pig pen on a peanut member pick being carried with him at ... ... there was like a dust storm that would come with him [noise] that's what this was there was a there was a smell of ... and body odor and stink and oils\nAnd I'm I'm\nA what do you call the ... that that people lights um incense and so that there was this combination kind of hit the smell of which was not pleasing to my nose it's what I imagine Woodstock smelled like\nUm and and so and and maybe you know eight year old clothes cigarettes just bundled in\nThat and they would come rolling in to the chambers and we'd be in the middle of our meeting and they would begin to disrupt\n[noise] and we did not have the disposition to simply have them removed and continue with our meeting so what would happen is they would come in and they weren't sure how much they could get away with so when they'd come in they were real loud boisterous", "year": "2018", "show_name": "Mark Levin Show", "city": "Houston", "day": "03"}
