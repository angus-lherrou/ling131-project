cyclists they took for granted access than than it was a small study but very positive showing that cyclists improved their trial time by two minutes and twenty kilometer bike race\nI mean that's a

deal but our listeners might be saying well okay maybe I don't play tennis or what about me what does it mean for me right\nRight so so think about this uh Ninety three percent increase in a person

this is some very important information we're going to cover today\nYou know this is an exciting topic taught to me about this important message today what molecule are we talking about and how it's impacting the lives of people who follow the science\nRight right right well we're talking about her new supplement it's cold every strong and it features and exciting molecule called creative team now had a lot of our listeners may have heard of ... and I know you've used Korea Team right but for those that don't know about Korea Tina it's mainly use\nIn the Olympic circles professional athletes body builders college high school athletes because it does something extraordinary and what I'm about to tell you is proven by hundreds and hundreds of\nHuman studies so here's where Korea Team does for us it helps us to get stronger\nMore powerful helps put muscle mass on the body and it helped protect us from losing muscle tissue as we get older we know that's a big part of aging not only that pat great for the brain great from memory and it helps promote bone strength as well so an amazing molecule that everybody needs to know about\nAn amazing story can you share some of the science and tell us why you're calling Korea teen one of the best kept secrets to healthy aging\nOffshore pat what we need to understand with Korea Team is that it's a natural molecule to the body it's in every single cell tissue Oregon in your system\nAnd its job in the body is to generate and maintain\nStrength and power that's a reason for being to maintain strength and power\nIt's an every single so on the body Ninety five percent of it however is in your muscle tissue because that's where we tend to use it the most it powers up the muscles it's good for strong muscle contraction\nAnd it's important to help maintain strength and muscle contractions when you're using them over and over again for instance if you're working at the gym if you're playing sports golf tennis anything like that it keeps your muscles\nPowered up in their higher energy state\nSo they're strong and ready for action packed\nHere's the key is is so important for those of us say in our fifties sixties\nSeventies you see we had lots and lots of Korea Team when we were young we had all this stuff it was coming out of areas we had lots of creating our bodies made a lot of it but as we get older like everything else we don't do that is well we have less Korea teen in our muscles you know the good news is that\nHundreds and hundreds of human studies show that when you supplement with Korea Team\nAid goes to work or go straight to your muscles it's absorbed easily it pumps up at the Korea Team in your muscle tissue and you get stronger\nYou get more powerful not only that it helps support memory and brain health and it helps support the strength of your bones\nYou know we were talking before the show and you were talking about how it limbic athletes have been using Korea Team for years to enhance their strength and performance tell me more\nWell this ... is the premier sports nutrition supplement there's no question about that how you've used at body builders know about it athletes know about\nKorea Team is the premier sports nutrient so you know back twenty twenty five years ago the Olympic athletes and their coach is of course he knew about it they knew what made you bigger and stronger and faster they knew was natural to the body it was supposed to be there\nBut there were a little bit afraid to supplement with it because they were afraid it might be considered cheating that it might be considered too much of an edge\nBut back in Nineteen eighty eight the international Olympic Committee they came out the officially confirmed and I'm quoting here Korea Team can be used by athletes to enhance their performance and now ... it's not just for athletes anymore because the studies are clearly showing\nThat for adults for people in their fifties sixties seventies this stuff it was amazing and purity has this incredible new formulation\nWe call it ever strong because that's exactly what it does it helps you get stronger in states stronger with hundreds of human studies to help you and it's the purest form of ... money can buy the stuff from Europe this stuff is fantastic\nAnd we should point out that naturally occurring in red meat problem is in order to get the amounts that are going to benefit you you'd have to eat large amounts of red meat in like four pounds of red meat a day most people are going to do that right and what about vegetarian they can be creating deficient\nExactly when I have a vegetarian that comes in here and their energy efficient they don't feel the way we don't want to feel\nAnd I put 'em on every strong they noticed the benefits almost right away because they've been so low on a younger person out there that staying away from red meat if you're staying away from meat in general or you have more of a vegan style or if this is for you you definitely want to add that ...\nHigh so obviously this works with athletes but you say Korea teen is going mainstream there's a lot of studies are showing the folks in their fifties sixties seventies and beyond that Korea teen can be a cornerstone compound to help people stay strong stay healthy stay sharp stay vital right\nOh exactly I mean this is the ideal muscle enhancing strengthening muscle protecting nutrient for folks as we get older fifty plus or like you and me patent but let's go to a couple of studies on seniors just to show this we'll do one on the guys and one on the gals when I\nFirst on the guys love the title of this one Korea teen supplementation improves muscular performance in older men study done it several American universities\nOr group of men get this at age fifty nine to Seventy two hey you know we can do that is not when people are known for getting stronger right right so this was just a one week study people need to understand that that's how effective and rapidly this stuff works or just a one week study get this the guys on Korea Team\nThey put on four pounds of lean mass that's muscle tissue for those that don't know that it shows they built the muscles and they hydrated the muscles nicely they increase the strength of their bench press that's a chest\nPressed for people that don't know by seven percent they increased the strength of the leg exercises they were doing by Fifteen Percent pat they could get in and out of a chair more times faster without using it\nArms on top of that it could generate more power on a stationery bike pack this happened in one week when I think about that yeah it's really quite incredible\nAlright but what about the women out there did they get those kinds of benefits to as well will it actually help women in their fifties sixties and seventies gets stronger to\nOh yeah and what blows me away about that story 'cause you told me before\nIs that her medical doctor recommended routine for and that just goes to show\nHow much more mainstream this is it's called every strong\nAnd it supports the muscles that supports your power your strengths your speed if you're an athlete you're certainly going to love it but even if you're not an athlete you notice the difference let's go to another study one more review study this out of the journal current aging science December two thousand thirty and I thought this was very cool\nCause the researchers looked at the body of research out there on creating and seniors without exercise they want to see what happens when seniors take Korea teen and they don't\nExercise so I'm quoting here ... supplementation without associated resistance training seems to enhance muscular string power and insurance increase lean body mass\nFor those that don't know what that is they're talking about muscle and improve the functional capacity of the elderly they go on to talk about how it supports bone health as well and then they finish with this creating supplementation without training in the elderly\nCould potentially delay atrophy of muscle and unproven difference and strength so here again we see bottom line ... chain is very very effective it's gonna help you to feel stronger whether you exercise or not it supports your strength and power your brain health\nAnd on top of that it supports your bone health I mean pat when you think about it this almost sounds too good to be true right right yeah you're a person that never heard about this and you're listening to us\nYou would think this sounds too good to be true but it is true hundreds and hundreds of human studies back up what we're talking about you're going to love the benefits you get with this ever strong formula\nThat's incredible

on the ever strong powder they tested golfers and purity found out that not only with these golfers getting stronger and more explosive but they were driving the golf ball get this\nFourteen yards further that's amazing\nI have such a big smile on my faith right now I'm remembering when the researchers came back and gave us information I mean we were bouncing off the walls this is so exciting

control study thirty golfers took the restaurant powder for one month no exercise nothing different just took our ever strong power for one month in one month they were banging the golf ball\nFor teen yards further pat not only that six percent more power on the bench press more explosive they could lift the weights faster\nThey hold our guys spend hundreds of dollars on new clubs to drive the

a good though on the pulse of what's going on with pets in the area so do you notice any particular issues related to animal care\nBut I think one of the major things is focused on heart worm prevention I'm you know where we live mosquitoes are everywhere and I really feel like there's not a maybe enough education about um heartland prevention I mean I remember when I added adopted Franklin you know the vet said here's your heart where medicine but I didn't really understand the ramifications of\nHow important it was to give them a monthly heart worm preventative so I think that's\nOne of the big things that need an education and then one or the other things is that a lot of rescues aren't able to\nTreat heartland positive dogs the way that the American Heart Association recommends because of funding and so that's been one of our big focus is is it that if they're wanting to treat dogs the correct way and they're unable to because of funding we really want to help them do that\nYou know speaking of funding you got some very good news recently didn't you\nWe did so we actually just\nUm expanded um the scope of our mission just a little bit Florida Hospital recently added on a team of canine officers um they have six canine a security officers and we were able to get a grant to provide vote bullet proof vest to those dogs will be protected as they are\nWell that is terrific now obviously those have to be specially ordered you know any part of that where those are obtained\nThere's a company actually ... Dana's safety that actually provided or that actually made the best\nOn Florida Hospital though on their security team did all that research as to exactly the specifics of the vast because as they're more protective they're also heavier and harder to wear and make the dog hotter they had to carefully balance the how\nHow bullet proof they are versus how uncomfortable they were for the dogs and that is not our act area of expertise we wanted them to have the best that we are going to be best for their dogs that we let them do we ... them do the research and we just put it to bill\nPull this tremendous such tremendous so in fact let's let people know how they can help out than buying attending the Halloween event\nSo by the Halloween event is a secret like parking hassled area on October twenty seven that'll run from nine AM to noon\nThe website to register as Franklin's friend dot ... dot com on the very easy online registration process you can register as an individual you can create a team and walk with a team of Walker's there's a doggy costume contest you don't have to have a dog in costume you don't even have to have a dog at all\nTo walk in the event and just enjoy the festivities\nAnd by the way my new shot I didn't hit that well enough so let's point out to everyone that's how we'll win as\nIs a play on words in fact I have now and noticed that I cannot actually spell the word Halloween without accidentally accidentally\nRight now [laughter] oh tremendous and it must be a lot of fun with the costumes what kinds of costs to do\nIt so much fun I mean I think that they're bringing ... is it ... on some people put so much work into homemade costumes other people of course just pick something off the rack at pets Mart and it's just as cute um the costume contests though that a competition can be intense we often have groups of being the dog that dress up as\nPeople characters from the wizard of Oz and we can have Dorothy into so in the wicked witch and the scarecrow which is kind of fun to see 'em groups getting together and doing that but it is it is just adorable to see all the dogs in costume and I'm just amazed at how many of the dogs actually keep their costs games on mine would have nothing of it\n[laughter] you have more than one dog right\nWe have three right now we asked we have three rescued hound dogs um they're they're pretty big there about they range without fifty to eighty pounds um but they're the love of our lives\nWoman he said it's a pleasure speaking to you good luck with the event is there anything else you would like to let everyone know\nNo just that if anybody would like to volunteer with us we're always looking for volunteers um our website for the organization is Franklin's friends die in though there's lots of good information there and um we're always looking for for people who want to be involved\n... is the cofounder of Franklin's friends I'm Beth peril have\nWith me on the phone Richard village or he's the Orange County bar association president and coming up really soon as an opportunity to get some great information because the Orange County bar association is co hosting to ask a lawyer events of the first one is coming up on Monday October fifteenth\nThe second event will be on October sixteen so we'll go ahead and repeat that just a moment but welcome to you Richard thank you for joining me today thank you for having me I think a good place to start is just simply to explain what the Orange County bar association is and and while you're offering these kinds of events sure I'm happy to severe\nHey bar association is a thirty five hundred member\nVoluntary ... we were founded in Nineteen thirty three and it is a place where our our attorney's local attorneys and people associated with the legal profession meat and exchange information and knowledge about the legal profession and about practice in central Florida\nI'm as part of our mission we promote honor to dignity and professionalism and the legal community we enhance the delivery of legal services in central Florida\nAnd we enhance access to legal services and that's something I'll talk about it in a minute we also um have as part of our mission to educate the public about the legal system um we are um a diverse and inclusive bar\nUm and we're in a place where\nA members can can exchange information that can discuss the legal system and they provide camaraderie among the legal profession so our lawyers may\nBe adverse to one another in the courtroom but we as a bar tried to bring them together and provide camaraderie to them um so that are legal services are enhanced so with that being said you know we had\nTwo parts of our mission that are important here and this is this these two community events\nAre central to our mission number one we used to bar are committed to enhancing access to legal services and number two we're committed to\nEducating the public about the legal system so at the bar um this year we have tried to bring our lawyers into the community there are many people in the community whose only access to lawyers as what they see on the TV\nOn and on the billboards and what we've tried to do is bring our lawyer members out\nTo the community so that they can meet the public and help them with their legal issues\nTell tell us about these two events not the first one is on October Fifteen and what will be the focus of this\nWill on October Fifteen at the James are Smith neighborhood center we are going to have an ask a lawyer event it's co hosted with the Orange County clerk of court it will run from five thirty six thirty PM it's alive event\nAny member of the public can attempt anyone that has the legal issue can attend these meetings and our planet these meetings is discuss criminal law issues in family law issues those are very common legal issues that the public faces and we're going to have volunteer lawyers\nWho uh donate their time to serve the public\nAnd at that meeting they are going that that\nEvent they're going to answer questions from the public now that event is not all not only also live but we will be broadcasting it on Facebook Live so if I'm if the public is can't make it there\nAnd they can watch the event and they can listen to the questions that are asked and see if that may apply to them and see if that may help them with their legal issues\nThey're kind of theme that you're starting with in terms of the types of questions and if so what is that or what kinds of questions are you hoping come out\nYou know it at this events uh we expect that the questions will focus around the criminal issues you know we we have um\n[noise] I Wish I could tell you what the questions are going to be but we don't know you know our lawyers are there and they hear what the what the public gas and the answer him as best they can um we're also going to handle family law issues there sometimes people have just a question about child support\nSometimes they may have a question about getting a divorce sometimes they may have a question about\nDomestic violence in their home we want to help them\nIf there is an issue that people ... are facing we want to help them resolve it\nAll right so pretty open to anything then yes ma'am [noise] so that's that's the the first event will be focused on criminal law in

they can get in a kind of a load of posture kind of the men can't get into that\nThey certainly have all of those advantages and it's because the estrogen sends a signal\nTo make more ha now women have more ha to lose than men do and you see the skin traveling up the joints and so on as women age but there's a way to get it back and of course purity products for years now has been talking about ha and they have a new formula just for the joints\nH A joint formula and it's so important today because\nI think everyone's confused an article in the New York times says consumers are confused what to do to support their joints took people are looking for alternatives we need cushioning in between the joints the bones in our joint when a doctor looks at an X ray\nAll he's doing is measuring the space between the two bones there in the knees so it's about a quarter of an in space without that cushioning you've got bone rubbing on bone that's what age a is it the jello or the cushioning agent in between our bones\nWe lose it either due to wear and tear or age and so we start getting problems the more that we find pain relief the more pain relievers we use the more we're going to use these joints and then we're going to wear out more bone and they've noticed is people who chronically use pain relievers\nAre going to have more bone where so what you need is the actual cushioning back there to lubricate the joint and that's what ha does that what ha is that doctors call it ... fluids\nThey actually inject this into joints orthopedist do dermatologist injected into the skin I doctors use it as a lubricant during eye surgery so it's nothing foreign to modern medicine but it may be new to you as a listener there and you have never heard about ha before well\nYou need to learn about it it's a wonderful molecule it's all natural and you can get it as a dietary supplement\nPurity products was the first to introduce it now\nIt's a great big long molecule path that six million Dalton's and molecular weight think of six million paper clips put together its big you can absorb it and\nPurity found a way to knock it down so that it's only about Fifteen hundred to three thousand that means that you can absorb this orally we actually proved that in studies conducted at the laboratory right there in Florida and we're going to tell you more about that but\nWe proved that it's orally absorbed most doctors are told that oral ha cannot be absorbed that's true if it's the regular ha it's got to be knocked down in molecular weight and more important it needs some other antioxidants to be added where that we're going to talk about one here in just a moment but\nPurity products is introducing this all new joint formula for people that are searching for alternative for their joint health and of course this isn't a drug it's a dietary supplement meant to of course support healthy joint health as as we think of it\nYou're just tuning in we're talking with Bill Saudi about ... acid or Eighteen bill you said recently that the H a revolution is under way more and more people are using it tell us why a genius such a breakthrough and what exactly can you do for people\nI think the brick and mortar analogy is probably the best for everybody to understand it there are bricks in our body the cells there's mortar in between and the mortar is the college and now within the college and not the college in itself vitamin C make college\nBut within that college and there's a moisture rising agent that looks like Jell O and everyone knows you put some jello in the refrigerator and the water separates out after a time\nAnd that's what's happening in our body we're losing the water holding molecule ha the body is Seventy two percent water and as we lose this\nThe connective tissue that connects all of our cells that connects all of everything that we have begins to lose its water it separates out and then we begin to lose\nThat the substance the scaffolding that the support structure that holds our body together\nAnd of course we've been getting a wrinkle we shrivel up we lose an inch in our height\nBut they're not dealing with the origin of the problem the origin of the problem is the loss of cushioning and the joy and if we can just replaced it if we can find a way to get that cushioning back\nThat's what we call youthful this that's what we had when we were young here's David right into me from New York twenty five years looking for something that would help support his lower back and of course he said I Can't believe it now he says that cat thank you enough for this product people have tried all the alternatives they've searched everywhere else pat\nAnd they haven't heard of ...\nAnd now the reorder rates on AJ sort of tell me the things are phenomenal the product works the study shows how but one of the customers saying what are they telling you candidly what are they saying the bill sorority\nIf the horses come back to
