forever stamps\nAnd a bulge in the envelope and that's when they ended up calling me and YPG the bomb squad arrived in by six thirty this morning\nThey had started to drive the device inside to a disposal unit in in the Bronx Joe this is a believed to be a device pipe bomb like similar to those sent to other prominent democratic political figures and recovered yesterday\nIt was going to be so many questions that are that are being asked you know what is the pattern amongst the people who are receiving there's clearly a ... they're all a Democrats prominent at that uh and it's also curious that that none of the bombs have detonated\nWell ... thank God yeah they haven't got yes they were built a investigators believe to go off or they they believe the intent of the sender or Sanders was to maim or kill the devices were all fashion from a ... a section of PVC pipe\nThey contain pyrotechnics powder there was a time or a wire a small battery and ... so they were all\nAdditionally Joe enhanced we've learned to use the the ... in artful phrase of the bomb squad with with shards of glass so that is not a device that investigators believe was designed to merely scare\nAnd Aaron these these devices have been geographically located around the United states from as far out west as California as far south as South Florida as far north as a as upstate New York ... this seems like one person could not make those rounds all that way to make those deliveries well\nAs some of them seem to have arrived through the mail some seem to have arrived via a courier service the authorities are still trying to get to the bottom of how each of the devices ended up at the intended recipient location now to to be clear and and and again thankfully with male security screening procedures\nNone of the intended recipient ever seem to get near the device or the package that was intended for them up but the the delivery roots could be important clues for investigators but so could the devices themselves which are the authorities could could exploit for fingerprints for DNA\nOr in some cases they may even be able to trace the origin of the components to themselves\nRight lastly as you just kinda you alluded to right there is as none of these devices have exploded they would seem that there would be a ample opportunity for investigators to coal some sort of evidence from those unexploded devices\nBut they the hope is that they will be able to an end whether that's a ... and they can do it from fragments remember during the Boston Marathon bombing investigation they were able\nFrom all the fragment scattered across Boylston Street they were able to piece together the make up the pressure cooker find stores in the Boston area that sold it and recover surveillance video of the ... buying it uh it it it's painstaking work\nBut they have intact devices in this case and so they're hopeful there'll be able to use them to to help them find whoever did\nThis and I'm sure I Know is that it was my last question but this one's personal ... do you live there I mean what does it end New York's been through a lot we know that but what is that like the you know living in New York now knowing that that there's a bomb there and someone's targeting your city\nWell it but I don't think it's it's it's a it's a it's a city things you know I Know that authorities talked about it in terms of of a terrorist threat yesterday but\nThe way investigators have a read on this now Joe is that these are targets all have you know a common thread in in in that the writer prominent Democrats or prominent a democratic supporters\nUh many of whom had been singled out you know on the campaign trail by the president and so while they haven't made a definitive conclusion\nThey believe this but the motivation is is politics and and there are concerned about um the tone of the nation's political discourse no matter who's doing the honoring and and they they they say that has

a drop I guess in school suspensions while that sounds like a good thing perhaps\nIt isn't well a lot of people\nDo think it's a good thing we want to make that clear they're definitely two sides to this story\nAnd we were contacted by teachers who can't really speak on the record you to fear of losing their job they work in orange county school district and they had said that a shift in the wake discipline it's handled jets within the last few years here it making their classrooms are really difficult environment that students who\nMay have been removed from the classroom in the past are now just being allowed back in without any discipline really at all\nAnd so they're not getting that sort of reinforcement that they're looking for as far as those behaviors that you wouldn't want to see in class\nAnd you know when you you talk about what's fair for the student who is being suspended versus what's fair for the entire rest of the classroom is that what it comes down to\n[noise] yeah but there again there are two sides to this coin because a few years ago Orange County had some of the highest numbers in the state\nOf minority students being disciplined with out of school suspensions it was disproportionate so we're breaking down those numbers to tonight to see if it changes that at that district has made a really making an impact on those numbers as well I think

WWF\nYou're listening to our special edition of Orlando is morning news here are eight o'clock expanded news feed the the search for a bomb maker this morning ABC's Brad Garrett joined us he is there news crime and terrorism Alice former FBI agent and Brad but before we get into the nuts and bolts so to speak\nOr does it does it drive you and other agents crazy when you see like the Internet Internet and and all the amateurs trying to solve crimes like these\nYeah but it happens every day I mean some of the cold cases I work on that don't have a high profile I still get messages from people that it's this and it's that you know it'd be you know the they're willing you know what will intended but it's not helpful\nAnd certainly there's ample volumes of evidence that the American public that the the Internet just doesn't get to see well of course\nYou know it's kind of like the senior decision of of the outcome of a baseball game only after the second inning and that that it happens every day I mean we we tend to now jump to conclusions as a culture before we have the facts\nBut it's not hard for an amateur to look at that ... these the distribution of these pipe bombs and say ha there seem to be targeting the Democrat Party officials or certainly people that are influential and the Democratic party\nWell of course but I'm not sure where they get you as far as identifying him it that will be very helpful\nOnce you figure him out but you know he's left sort of a vast trail of potential evidence both the bombs you know maybe eight or nine that could give you DNA fingerprints or other identifying pieces of of of evidence\nUh it'll also give you the sophistication or not these bombs are they really operational or not um and it also you're going to have to look at how he got these packages to the locations like\nA you know I'm not sure we use the mail service has got stamps on these but the you know they're reporting that they're they've not been cancelled as we you know as we get letters and packages\nSo I don't know some of them I guess war delivered either by career or by individuals you know all that lends itself to CCTV or insulated\nInterview closed circuit CD for those that don't know right in New York City particularly with the latest bomb found there this morning I mean there's cameras everywhere in New York City\n... absolutely so you know for example if the package today at ah at Robert de narrows location a which I think appears to be dropped\nYou know how well is it covered by cameras I mean there's just a ... a real potential here they come up with either is the guy or at least an associate of his\nAnd and what does it say about the bomb maker that none of these bombs have been detonated a because even though the bad bomb maker ah can make a device that is incredibly fragile dial that if even touched could detonate\nOr correct so it will let me go to that he had no intention of detonating bombs this is all about scaring people\nScaring people and in drawing attention to\nDemocrats so you know this was a guy that's obviously very very angry and he doesn't like I assume the way the Democrats do business uh and he wants to rest of us to know it and that ... that he's going to threaten them in any any has\nSo it it's still as I said is it we just don't really know is it are these real or is this just a big scare tactic\nGravy I Am naive where I Am just horribly ignorant but I cannot imagine getting to the end of this day this day without having identified a suspect\nI Know but you know that's all driven by you know do they come up with the forensics\nAre they getting tips about people a duty as people are already known people that have made threats in
