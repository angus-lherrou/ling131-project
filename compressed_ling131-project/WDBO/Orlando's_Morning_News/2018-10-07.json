P. A. N. D. ha circulatory concerns all of these things are associated with low omega three blood levels most of us don't eat enough fish\nFish is really the only great stores of these two compounds\nFish oil supplementation has now become the biggest category in the vitamin business because of all the benefits all the clinically proven benefits of EPA and the ha charities really taken a leading role\nBecause we feel we have the best product and now the best product combination with other ingredients we've combined with fish oil\nDeliver even better benefits for people\nWe're talking with Jesus in camp president a product development of purity products about I'm exciting new products available exclusively through purity products called the omega three super ... we've\nGot a special offered free bottle offer stay tuned we're gonna be given up that phone number ... Jesus let's get to ingredient number two because there's so many got three super pill does something that no other fish oil product can do it actually lowers cholesterol talk about these plants generals explain how this works and why it's so important\nRight well I don't know anyone who is in concerned about their cholesterol if you have high cholesterol obviously you want to lower it if you have normal or healthy cholesterol obviously you want to maintain it sure well in the world of dietary supplements there is one\nCompound one ingredient that stand head and shoulders above anything else they're called plants they're all they have over a hundred and forty human clinical studies shown to lower significantly lower\nLDL cholesterol and again LDL as the bad cholesterol\nHDL the good cholesterol right though obviously you don't want to lower HDL plants they're all only target LDL and the studies are pretty dramatic they show that in his little as a few weeks four weeks you can see anywhere from five to Fifteen Percent reduction in your LDL level\nSafely and naturally absolutely no side effects very effective they've known about plants they're all since the Nineteen fifties and they work to be a very different mechanism than Staten drugs so I wouldn't tell people to stop taking stat and drugs we're not trying to position this as an alternative to Staten\nStaten work by preventing the production of cholesterol in the liver plants that rolls work differently\nA block the absorption of cholesterol in the intestines plants their roles are similar structurally to the cholesterol molecules and they basically can the with little cells in your intestine called my feels into thinking that the plants they're all are actually the cholesterol particles so that my field\nPick up the plan sterile instead of\nThe cholesterol particles and the cholesterol particles in that sort of just get passed through urine test and then you ultimately excrete them instead of absorbing them the point is if you're on that and\nYou can take plants they're off as an addendum therapy to help control your cholesterol studies actually had been done to show that they can amplify the benefits and of course\nThis particular product you get obviously first off the full clinically tested amount of the plants they're all to deliver the benefits as shown in studies that\nSomething that's very important because a lot of products out there that you'll see that have plants that laws on the label may only deliver a tiny fraction of what any study has ever shown any benefit for purity delivers the full amount that you need to get these benefits\nNow Jason let's talk about the third ingredient in the formula co Q. ten which is also becoming one of the more popular nutritional ingredients all over the world's tell us about co Q. ten and why it's valuable for our health what does what does it do\nWell co Q. ten is found that every single cell and your body if they're from the moment you're conceived until the moment you leave the earth\nUnfortunately as you age you lose co enzyme Q. ten so by the time you're in your senior years you've only got about half as much co Q. ten as you did when you were about twenty now when you think co enzyme Q. ten one word should come to mind pat\nEnergy you cannot make energy\nWithout co enzyme Q. ten ... is the\nCritical pivotal energy component of every cell in your body Ninety five percent of all your energy is related to the amount of co enzyme Q. ten in your body without an adequate supply you become energy efficient you technically would have energy the fish and sell so\nCo enzyme Q. ten delivers a whole ton Napoli of different benefits were putting in fifty milligrams a perfect dose for you to get every single day it's going to support healthy blood pressure it's great for your\nGums if you're a person who has tender gums maybe when you floss or brush your teeth you noticed a little ... maybe a little bleeding could be a sign that you've got to co Q. deficiency\nCoincide Q. ten supports immune function\nIt supports brain health and cognitive function it's a very powerful anti accident in fact one of the most powerful anti accident ever discovered\nThey're actually taking a look now at Cohen's on Q. ten and its role in exercise and muscle performance one other interesting note coins on Q. ten really has become popular in the United states as a topical beauty products you're seeing a pop up and beauty products where\nOne study recently showed up to a forty percent reduction in wrinkled depth and as little as ten weeks or so\nWhen used topical is a very potent ingredient very safe and greedy and\nSo the three and one product we're talking about these three amazing ... extremely safe for a long term use for short term youth in any dosage and I don't know if you saw that report the other day\nBut basically half of Americans are taking one or more pharmaceutical drugs so I Know a lot of people out there listening already taking something they're thinking is this they should I take it to my doctor\nThere may be no three safer ingredients than the three we're talking about today\nNow Jason as

advantage here's the deal folks as part of their twenties at the University of celebration all you have to do is just be one of the first\nSo basically the kinds of things that in the first month or so the VP K program teachers are looking to see if if children are able\nTo parents going into these meetings they will be addressing those particular sort of points of knowledge and skill but what advice do you have for parents and teachers perhaps and making that a meaningful meeting\nWell first off if you haven't been asked at this point I'm to come for a parent teacher conference you should ask for one um it's a great opportunity to get to know your child's teacher it's a great opportunity for parents to begin practicing how to be their child's best advocate\nOn so that teacher comfort teacher conferences very important um I think just even asking some open ended questions about\nAbout when you see my child playing with other children how ... what do you see on asking those kinds of questions as a parent you know we've noticed that he's come home and he's talking about um a a a really good friend of his house he interacting with his friend\nUm he's coming home and he's asking us to count with him tell me about what you're doing in terms of teaching him how to count\nThose are kind of open ended things that parents can ask of teachers because those are the things that if you're looking around the room you're probably seeing not around the room to help teachers feel comfortable that you that you want to know what you want to know\nIf you were going into one of these meetings what would be the first question you would ask what's the way to get the ball rolling\nI think the first question I Would ask is a question about all of the kids in the class how many children are you working with\nAnd I'm just a little bit about what the day is like and what can I Do as a mom to make sure that my child is prepared to come in for the day\nAnd I think that helps to kind of set the stage for I'm interested in all the kids in your classroom I'm interested in how your your day is and I and I want you to know that I'm interested in helping my child be as successful as possible\nReally nice and then of course parents are afraid you know like am I doing everything I Need to at home and of course this meeting with the teacher can't go on forever so boy how do you be efficient and get the information you need as a parent to know what to do with the home to support what's going on in the classroom well\nGenerally the teachers should be giving you something that's giving you some sense of where your child is and I would focus on on a kind of a mix of the things that your child is strong in and what can you do to reinforce that\nAs well as a couple of areas that you might as a parent be able to help your child with um\nI think there's things that you could ask in terms of what kinds of games have you noticed that my child likes to play well he's here\nA pre K. I'm as you're walking around the room looking at different things take note of what is what's in the room ask your child themselves what kinds of things they like to do during the day and that begins to give you some sense of some things that you might be able to do with your child at home to continue to build those skills\nLet's take a moment to explain how VP K came about what was the goal because interestingly enough the first class a VP Kay is about to graduate high school\nAbsolutely it's amazing to think that ah when we started in two thousand five with the VP K program\nThat we would be here in May of two thousand Nineteen with our first graduating class it's very exciting I'm V. decay is a constitutional amendment here in the state of Florida it was passed in two thousand two\nUm by a significant um majority of Floridians who really felt that it it was important for every child in our state to have access to a high quality pre K program at no cost to our parents so that any parent who wanted their child to participate was able to do\nThat without fear of having the resources to do that in two thousand five was when the program was launched\nIn orange county here in two thousand five we had almost three hundred\nDifferent childcare programs public schools private schools who stepped up and said yes we would like to offer this to students today we have over four hundred and twenty sites that parents can select from the program has grown significantly\nWe started with about ten thousand children\nWhich was about I Want to say sixty five percent or so of the four year olds in orange county were up to about eighty percent a four year olds participate in the u._k. program the year before they're eligible for kindergarten\nGiven the fact that this particular class is going to graduate in two thousand in Nineteen you're obviously looking back at the program and trying to decide did that class make a difference to going to be became make a difference so what's known about that\nWell what we do know from the kindergarten assessment that isn't on every year in um ... the first thirty days of kindergarten um they're looking for common things that say that a child is ready for kindergarten some of the very things that I was talking about\nAnd what they do is to look at where that child attended the PKK and to calculate the number of children who are already and that's how the TK providers are awarded um or recognized for the services that they have been providing to kids [noise]\nSo what the what we do is we look to see whether or not the children who have attended a substantial period of time which is defined as a minimum of Seventy percent of the PKK time at those children how did those children compare in their readiness for school\nTo other children who participate in the deep UK program but didn't attend I'm Seventy percent of the time as well as children who did not participate in the ... program at all\nWhat we have found is that BP K does make a significant difference for kids who participate they at least Seventy percent of the time\nIt makes a difference for children who are on free and reduced lunch it makes a difference for children who have disabilities that makes a difference for children who are English language learners and it does tend to make a difference for little boys so I'm very pleased to see that there is\nSome evidence that he has made a difference what what does that difference look like the difference is more reading us in terms of being able to participate in it as a student in a classroom that's one of the big challenges that um that kindergarten teachers will tell you\nIs how to take a group of of twenty kids Eighteen kids and get them all moving in the same direction the same time\nBeing able to stand in line takes simple direction and share with others et cetera that's extremely important but then it's the the the forever marched to the third grade reading which is absolutely critical for the next juncture of\nEighth grade math and graduation ultimately for kids so they're really looking at how prepared are children to take on more rigorous um recognition of words build their vocabulary work on math and science sorts of skills\nSo what ... is done is to really give a a a higher floor with kids coming in so that teachers are able to get off the block if you will a little faster\nThat was part of that what we would call emotional intelligence and allowing the child to know how to utilize their emotions\nI'm thinking about you know you get frustrated and one thing and ... I remember is lessons on how to you know sit in a corner and take a breath and get control of yourself\nThat is all part of what's referred to his executive function for for children it's learning how to control your emotions on behavior is the language of children and until children learn the words to be able to express how they feel then they're going to act out\nSo a large portion of what what any kind of birth to five program is trying to do with children is to help them develop the words so that they can express what they see going on around them\nHow comfortable they are with what's going on around them when they're happy when they're sad because it it it moves it moves us all as human beings to a point where we're able to interact with other people in a positive supportive way as opposed to it across that way\nAnd it strikes me that if you're doing that you are going to be more open and to the things like the alphabet and how to add and subtract\nAbsolutely it's hard to it's hard to focus on the academic side of of school if you do not feel safe and secure and wanted in the environment that you're in\nNow and all of the groups that you said ... you saw a difference or there's a difference I didn't hear girl specifically mentioned\nBecause a lot of the research shows that pre K program to make a bigger difference for boys in terms of their readiness because in a you know not to be not to show any bias on this but you know boys tend to come in to a group environment\nI'm In a little more individualized way than girls do so what pre K programs help um boys do is to learn to work more in a in a group\nJust kind of like ... like boys tend to gravitate towards sports and and a lot of the worked at the coaches are trying to do is to get them to work as a team not to work as individual that's really what's happening and protect programs\nOkay here we are not only at the significant moment of that first grade graduating class but we're also in the political climate coming up on elections and certainly what happens in Tallahassee effects what you're doing so what are your insights there\nWell I think that um I think one of the biggest challenges that we have with the PKK program at this time is a strong opportunity to really look back over the years at water the inputs that have really made a fundamental difference for children in our community\nOf groceries and things and like Safeway foundation and an a to B and other groceries donate products um for us to be able to do the box lunches but I'm right now for the fifteenth anniversary we have about fifty five pallets of products stored for that event and every single piece of it was donated\nAnd how do you ship it\nWell once we package those items we apologize\nAnd ship it so from the fifteenth anniversary celebration that we're having here in San Antonio for the Fifteen thousand we're packing we already have a list of the VA medical centers across the country that are doing homeless distributions I'm Stan downs in the\nCabinet mourning and remembering board young is to follow the show down on the Senate floor yesterday with protesters shouting from the gallery as vice president Mike Pence led the final voting process\nArgued arm\nThe gallery divide over Kavanaugh's sprinted across the aisle and nation and California Lisa Remmer is the Republican candidate running against democratic congresswoman Nancy Pelosi in November\nWill be good he's had all those years in the DC circuit with lots of lots of opinions and lots of experience\nMonterey resident David Jones doesn't agree with a new\nRecord I Believe [noise]\nIrreparably damaged\nIn Haiti magnitude five point nine earthquake has shaken the northwest part of the island officials say at least eleven people are confirmed dead meanwhile disaster\nWorkers in Indonesia and say the death toll from last week's earthquake and tsunami has jumped to more than Seventeen hundred with concerns that five thousand people are still missing on the shelf ...

[laughter]\n\nI guess it like it it's just it's just so little three dollar part take charge five dollars for a a [noise] he's replacing\nVery ... very well could be because\nIt only difference is a lot of those sensors are built into the mother board of the machine it's a small printed circuit board and there are but yeah yeah um so what do you what would you like what type of information from us would you like 'cause we got like seven answers on this one\n[noise] the one that fixes it\nOh okay mhm okay do\nThis have you found the sensor that's bad do you know which one it is can be seen

themselves if you can get in there and find them\nThere's normally a little sensor strapped in several places and that's probably what what's bad and you're right most of those are a standard generalized sense or ... or ... been there's different ones I mean there's there's probably a hundred of them out there and you'll find a number on that censor\nBut if you take a picture that censor
