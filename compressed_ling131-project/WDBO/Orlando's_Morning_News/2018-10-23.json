ticket for making millions you can buy a three dollar ticket with the multiplier\nBut all that does is multiplied the lesser prizes it it doesn't multiply the grand prize the top prize\nUh but uh you know if I buy tickets and I just bought the two dollar tickets and you can literally just hand your money to a clerk and say I want you know two dollars worth of lottery tickets or I went twenty dollars worth of lottery tickets most if not all of the clerks know exactly how to help you and exactly what to get you a or as yes\nAnd also make sure we get the goalie you makes you against\n...

F. T. V. I opened with her and all\nOf my question here for us Chris hey this is Mike\nIn Chile out I can you tell me where I can find a site that would give me some unbiased explanations of all the amendments that are on the ballot this year they have such a key on by unbiased\nIs always in the eye of the beholder the person reading and I mean you have to determine for yourself I Would say go through several sources uh the Tampa Bay times out of the land oh send no both a published really good right ups of all these the league of women voters has as well read a couple that are out there um that have given write ups of these\nAnd you can kind of gauge for yourself I wouldn't go to a single source on any of them I Would go to all of them and look at it I mean the state of the state of Florida does have the actual ballot language out there you can look at it on your own but if you're looking for like analysis of what it means who's supporting it\nThere's some really good sites out there from um newspapers and from ah the league of women voters that does that I'd say there's going to go two or three sources read three or four of them on your own draw your own conclusion\nI Will say that I often will go to a group that is as ideologically opposite as I Am and look for their recommendation to think about it and then I vote against all of their recommending\nWell the thing about his there's there's twelve of these and they hit different areas like for the tax watches a really good organization out of Tallahassee but they really only have a position on three out of the twelve because only three of them really deal with taxes and so they're kind of hands off on the others so you know different organizations are going to have kind of claims on different ones 'cause there are so many\nSome of them were bundled and they're going to deal with about two or three things under one heading it's so yeah I Would say go find a couple of different sources out their read them\nAnd kind of come to your own conclusions I Would not just go to one place I Try and go at least two or three\nI forgot to tell you I got my flu shot yesterday but for you about that you're gonna get yours already had my fiancee alright were protected all your other people who aren't protected from the flu or so there was once a thing called a November surprise yes in elections and and we're coming up on November the elections as are going to be in November November's sex\nAnd ex for anybody who maybe is new to the political realm or doesn't understand what is it what does it November surprise\nThe November surprise I think the best indication at least in recent memory would be if you go back to two thousand they dumped the fact that George W. Bush had gone to DWI that was the exact one I was thinking uh and they don't do the right at the last minute and it's and it's basically something that you put out on your opponent at at as late as possible to affect the outcome of the election\nNot giving them enough time to respond to it will not get\nEnough time to adequately respond to it and it and it obviously has a lot more have to it if it is true in in the case of George W. Bush it was true he had had gotten this and Connecticut\nBack in his earlier years I'm subsequently he quit drinking after that but um no so you you put that out there and the idea is due to the max amount of damage you give your opponent almost no time to respond the two problems you have this these days with it as one there's so much information out there now on candidates that it's really hard to have that surprise\nObviously the Internet will docks things much faster than in opposition held\nSo fast that if you dump it two weeks out it Mary play out by the time the election comes and goes or the other side of it is is um people start voting early I mean we were a million votes into this election as we're talking right now and will be even more so as we move forward because early voting in person has already start across most of the state\nMail ballots are being return so if I have that really juicy piece of information on Joe Kelly I hold it till next week\nWe may be ... million three million votes already in the bank yeah and you can ab outcome change the outcome of that election but the fact of the matter is you're you've wasted votes they're they're already in their bank\nYeah and you can't get them back after you cast your vote you can't say oh I have a new information I Want I Want to vote a do over there aren't a do over\n... and some places you can you can go in and you can request to a new ballot it gets tricky there they put it in as a provisional I remember um after\nAnd twenty sixteen if you remember when the call me letter came out the Trump campaign made a big deal of\nHey voters in Wisconsin for example you can go request to vote again most people aren't going to do that and I think about is if you're voting early enough in an election cycle usually you're somebody who has bought in on that candidate no matter what it almost does not matter what comes out in the last minute it's going to sway you\nUsually these things then would be than geared towards that last late breaking voter\nIn which case you know you may still be sway a boy at the last moment\nSky news is reporting that parts of Jamal 'cause she'll give body had been found and they were discovered in the garden of the Saudi council generals home in Turkey\nYou know this whole thing is starting to really look bad on so many different levels I mean how\nDo they think how do they think they could just bury a body and and no one's going to look for it but the thing that jumps out to me when this thing first broke was ... you have the Saudi Government saying well we just wanted to talk to him or they brought a boom saw yeah you don't bring a bone sought to an interrogation unless you've got\nTo say died from some some wrestling I mean come on ... nobody believes anything the Saudis are saying on\nThe snow but it's been a tricky relationship with the Saudi Government going back Thirty years as to how we deal with them and how\nThey deal with us and listen this is this is a very complex situation top to bottom it does not look good for anyone and I mean there's so many people in the situation that you would describe as questionable actors whether you're talking about the Turkish government who were getting a lot of information from or the Saudi Government who are also getting information from\nI mean this is this is one of those situations you sit there and you just as starts to unravel across the board you say\nMan there's a lot of bad stuff happening here\nIn either as Chris race tonight I witnessed is get buddy I think sixteen candles
