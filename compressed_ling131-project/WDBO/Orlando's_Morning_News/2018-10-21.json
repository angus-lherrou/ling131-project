millions of people all over the world are now taking resveratrol pretty much every day\nWell this is amazing but let me to sit back for a moment I Know you've been working with purity products for several years of their coach too\nAnd it was but now they feature co enzyme Q. ten would you say is just as important as reservists role especially for your heart health and you'll says in some ways it's got even more evidence behind so let me ask you this who needs co Q. ten and what exactly is it good for\nWell first of all let's take a quick peak or what a co enzyme is\nA co enzyme has any substance in the body that speeds up the rate at which a chemical reaction takes place it's like a vitamin in many respects well co Q. ten is the nutrient that is responsible for the energy that's the key word the energy that supplies your brain your heart\nYour liver your kidneys in fact we need co Q. ten to literally convert all the food we eat into energy\nWow that's amazing yeah well that's what it's all about not only that but it's a very powerful anti oxygen and I remember Marc let's go back to Nineteen sixty three that's awhile ago while I was teaching for the first time since the\nSecurity\nReal close your home and shut down neatly west down between obesity and high ... has been a news Ninety six point five red alert traffic advisory where they were looking\nFor what makes the heart beat they were literally looking at heart and saying what is making this darn thing beat well they found out that was co Q. ten and that co enzyme Q. ten supplies that energy in fact by Nineteen Seventy eight a British biochemist named Peter Mitchell\nWins himself a Nobel Prize for describing what he called the bio energetic energy created by co Q. ten\nSo we could say it's so darn important because your energy is related to the amount of co Q. ten and your body and without an adequate supply of co Q. ten you're living in what we call an energy deficient stay your heart and he's co Q. ten\nIn fact the highest concentration of co Q. ten in your body is right at your heart muscle\nYour brain needs co Q. ten at all times co Q. ten supplies energy not only to your heart and brain but to your immune system\nIt supplies energy to your lungs to your liver so needless to say we all of this energy that case is that as we age and this is unfortunate levels of co Q. ten fall we lose this vital organic energy now in fact the research shows by the time you're eighty\nYou've got less than fifty percent of the co Q. ten and your body as you did when you were age twenty wow yeah it's really quite dramatic so I Would summarize co Q. ten by saying it's what I call it daily essential\nI mean you could eat sardines and mackerel and peanuts where co Q. ten comes from but it's not going to be enough just from your diet\nWell Dr person I just didn't you told purity that'd be quite a bit of research that it was time to combine these two agrees co Q. ten and the reserve troll no why he's proud of this cutting edge combination purity calls it their co Q. super boost formula look at it actually do people\nWell now that the president you said that took you ten holds an elite status in the nutritional supplements industry because it's been so well documented so well researched you call this evidence based nutrition maybe give us a brief overview of the research and explain why co Q. ten research is so widely respected\nWell let's go back Nineteen fifty seven University of Wisconsin\nThe Nobel Prize for Peter Mitchell in Nineteen Seventy eight\nThe University of Texas Medical school Purdue University in Indiana Stockholm University in Sweden that great study recently at the University of and Connie and Italy on mitochondrial energy and co Q. ten\nUniversity of Grenada in Spain talking about co Q. ten being a powerful anti ... articles publish constantly throughout the world\nThe archives of biochemistry and bio synthesis the proceedings of the national Academy of sciences major studies major university right here with the United states and abroad the bottom line and these studies\nEnergetic mitochondria without co Q. ten you don't have energy combine that with resveratrol I'm telling you pretty darn amazing\nNow that you present purity products occasionally does these free bottled give away with this one sounds really special wasted is so important\nWell I mean you really get an opportunity you get a chance to see for yourself what I'm Talking about I mean you can hear me speak about energy and physical performance and there's nothing quite like experiencing it for yourself\nI mean you hear me say some pretty amazing things and you say well that's pretty interesting but until you know until you try this for yourself by taking too soft gels a day of his co Q. super boosts formula\nYou're not going to really appreciate what I'm Talking about and the best way to do that is to call the number you gave out get your free supply try it for yourself and you'll see the difference\nMore with our guest Dr Allen precedent in the middle but right now purity products recognize leader in the field of evidence base nutritional solutions president credible free bottle offered today for the first thousand color so don't miss this chance up the phone call now operators are standing by the call is free\nOne eight hundred seven three six

directly through purity products you just pay for the shipping limited one per household the toll free number again one eight hundred seven three six three three three one eight hundred seven three six three three three\nOnce again we're talking with Dr Allen precedent now that the press and we talked about the co Q. ten we talked about the ... but you've added vitamin D to this and I knew there was a meeting with Dr canal from the vitamin D council\nAnd it's made me a believer would you added vitamin D and you've added vitamin B. twelve yeah now many people go through life not knowing that they've got to co Q. ten deficiency with vitamin D vitamin B. twelve those are also important to why did you had these factors\nRight now I think at this point in time there's more research being done on vitamin D that pretty much any other vitamin or nutrient and the reason is listen to this one\nBillion people worldwide do not get enough of vitamin D and their diet according to the New England Journal of medicine well I mean that's a lot of people and we found out some pretty amazing things with all of this research now listen to this\nWhen most people think of vitamin date of bone on bone health you might think of sunlight as well or vitamin D also plays a very powerful role as a supporter of the immune system\nIt supports immune system health and immune system activity quite dramatically in fact it also helps support brain function memory cognition it helps calcium build bone of course\nBut also it's very important for heart health for your blood pressure and the great new study out of Harvard Medical school and the University of Iowa talking about the importance of vitamin D and lung function it supports a healthy colon on top of all of that and a great new study out of the universe\nOr why talking about vitamin D and colon health I mean who thinks that those things right yeah that's amazing\nSo I think it's a welcome addition to this amazing formulated a co Q. super boosts formula in addition to that I said the channel look we should put some B. twelve and here as well that coal cabal him then and I say that because the twelve convert the carbohydrates and proteins in fact that you're eating convert them right into energy\nAnd this is all about energy and wellbeing when you're sitting down to eat your breakfast or your lunch or dinner if you don't have enough to be twelve that great meal that you just said is not going to be converted into energy get your body\nNow I Know you're ... until you try this unique combination of the one hundred milligrams of co Q. ten the advanced ... the way you find them impurities co Q. super boost formula that you won't know what you're missing but explain what you mean by that\nWell I Want you to

to create what I call the environment of energy in your body\nNot only physical energy mark mental energy in your instance stamina I mean who wouldn't I mean raise your hand if you don't want to energy endures stamina everybody wants\nIt absolutely I mean come on and this is a great way to do that and I said ... you know let's tell them about it and let's let them experience it for themselves\nWell absolutely must have been fascinating but Dr presents for people who were tuning in late how about a quick recap here what exactly is ... is very ... super formula who needs it and why is this in your opinion the next generation of coke you supplementation and how does purity free bottle offer work\nWell look I think there's a distinct advantage to having energy endurance and stamina and if we were going to isolate the nutrients and create what we would call a daily essential and somebody gave me the assignment list the top five or six nutrients that we need to literally give us energy to build endurance to bill stamina\nI Would lift the following nutrients\nCo Q. ten resveratrol B. twelve and vitamin D day this is the advantage you were speaking about\nAnd rather than going out and buying all four or five of these different nutrients you get them all in one with the co Q. daily super gross and the idea behind it is you take two a day\nYou see how it works for a month and you'll find that you're going to be on the phone call to order more because you're going to have a lot more energy just make sure you're in that first thousand of the day today and get a

Ninety six point by heavy duty the window turns first for breaking news\nThat amendment three is voter control of gambling in Florida and some may say well why would I Want to put a cap on this but if you read into it it says this amendment would require a citizen referendum for all casino gambling expansions requires approval of any new casino gambling through a citizen initiative\nConstitutional amendment effectively barring the legislature for making those gambling decisions by passing laws correct soaps vote yes would mean\nBut yes it means that now the petition would have to go through the process but they have to get so many signatures that language you have to be approved by the Supreme Court and an additional language requirements and signature requirements before it actually goes before citizens right now today different interest groups that those who are seeking to expand um gambling in Florida has to lobby the legislature\nUm and so this will now take that out of the hands of the legislature and put it in the hands of voters if you miss voters will decide to expand gambling in Florida\nAnd vote no on amendments three continues to allow the casino\nOf gambling either through new laws passed by the legislature as the court just said or through various types of constitutional amendments do you want gambling or not correct and I think that's\nThe question when you so there's there's you're going to see different there's a lot of commercials on this one right you have the groups that say they're they say you're hurting children and you're hurting education and there's a whole nother debate about whether the funding from gambling actually goes into our schools\nThat's probably be a whole nother show by itself yes um but then there's the group who believes that Florida has been branded as a place of family\nAnd do does gambling ... you know signify families and what we've created ourselves to the market here we talk about our land to alone it's about the place to bring your families and do we want to be in Vegas and so that's the question that the citizens of Florida we have to decide\nUm as far as but this isn't to say no to gambling it just controls the process mhm and how we allow gambling to be expanded in Florida\nAnd it is interesting because we would have to bring in a whole different panel of folks who if we want to talk about the lottery yeah if we want to talk about gambling\nIs generally speak just doesn't even address what if I say we added another hotel so much like a Biloxi, Mississippi that's just beat to wear that funding is going to go where they actually goes into our schools mhm though I just say I hope voters kind of get beyond the commercials and really dive into an ask those hard questions mhm 'cause this this doesn't save if\nThis were her school who just controls the process\nAnd how gambling is expanded in Florida\nOkay All right the one that you're hearing people like Desmond me talk about\nOften is the voting restoration amendment which is amendment for now this amendment would automatically restore the rights of any Phelan who completes all terms of his sentence including parole or probation now this does not include individuals who committed murder or any other type of of a felony sexual assault yes\nYes so that's the one thing that I wanted us to clarify Desmond will come on at another point to really talk about letting my people vote when you hear us talk about this now a vote no on this amendment would what\nIt basically will not automatically restore their\nSecurity\nWrote closure all laying shutdown mainland westbound between obedient Hiawatha see this has been a news Ninety six point five red alert traffic advisory\nLabels on the current climate the process is unconstitutional that has not been resolved ... but so far no vote if it fails we would stop the fall that process to see what comes out of that process but a yes vote automatically restore as those who qualify their right to be voting citizens to Florida\nAnd we know that there are like one point four million people here in the state of Florida and it wasn't no well you know Florida is a funny kind of a state because we've gone back and forth with\nThis and because when I'm done the Governor Crist again he had automatic restoration ... um but that's as I think the process here or that that was a government executive governors executive\nOrder which can be changed with new leadership rice is what we know solidifies it and put them in the constitution and this is what you want this is ... and that's the thing that you want you want things to be stock right hosed into that constitution and voting yes on amendments full will do exactly that and\nThis is what this is actually I think it's probably you know\nWe should have just as long ago in Florida we're like one of the former many states that don't have automatic restoration what does that speak about Florida when you think the most of the states in this nation have already moved towards that mhm and you know the interesting thing if we stick on this one more moment is that\nI can think of almost three friends of mine who have left the state of Florida and they could have been putting grain a effort into our community into our economic system but they couldn't get ahead here so they went to other states you know\nSo he lost that great resource and we we have\nSold number five the super majority vote required to impose authorize or a state taxes or these this is event amendments five and it would impose a two thirds vote requirement for tax and fee increases\nAnd require that they be contained on a stand alone bill with no other subject I don't understand five\nAt all okay so five basically if putting\nStricter standards on our legislature to pass tax increases and fees\nMhm two thirds vote is very hard to achieve the state of Florida extremely hard um and so that's what a yes on that would say that it's going to require two thirds of both chambers which is hard\nUm to approve any increase in fees are taxes\nThe downside to that or the unintended consequences of that there's this um provide parameters when there's an emergency when there's a recession okay we have a storm so I think you know I think some somebody from a nationally here just to say yes we want you want to be very hard to pass increase in taxes\nBut there are times where that body must convene to address emergencies in the state of Florida and this does not address\nOr define what is considered emergency okay and so I think we just need to be aware of what impact a yes vote will have\nA making it so hard it's very rarely has a two thirds vote been needed in the state of Florida where it hasn't been up you know met al ...\nAnd so a vote no one this will allow its current is adding\nYeah OK amendments fix this is another one that is tricky and what we're saying to you this morning again we have the clerk at the core Tiffany Morris along with us this morning and we're talking about\nThe what is it Thirteen amendment federal on this ballad come November said than what you want to do is listen very carefully we are not trying to give you a yes or no we just want you to explain it\nI Am Betty basic I don't understand just like you don't understand that's why I get really super smart people to come on with me\nThis one trick for me to ... amendments six the rights of crime victims and judges this amendment combines several subjects relating to the judiciary now the ... would one established constitutional rights for the victims of crime called Maher sees law\nTo it would remove judicial deference to executive branch interpretations of that two of us statutes sometimes called Chevron\nDeference is now this is a lot of information that you and I'm Betty basic and you could be Larry love or whatever we wouldn't understand the backside of this the third thing that it would do is we were would raise the mandatory\nRetirement age for judges to Seventy five that's what throws me mhm that's not fair to throw that in the [laughter]\nHas nothing to do with it so I'll vote yes on amendments six would do what clerk\nAmendments six as you mentioned is one of the one of those amendments have bundled issues in them and so it's kind of like if you like one and don't like the other you've got to make a tough decision to submit one does you're going to see more commercials about amendments fixed as far as Marcy on it but you keep hearing but there's not much other stuff include an amendment six\nSo the yes vote would ask specific rights of crime victims of the Florida Constitution\nAnd there are some that argue that this already there that victims already have certain rights they're supposed to be notified and so I put it in the constitution um constitution should not have this much level of detail in it\nAnd therefore it should be better addressed and statue in Florida rules of criminal procedure in other ways of addressing prosecution of cases of how the victim should be treated that's leading opposite of whether they support 'em amendments six\nUm and that the judicial Pete did you did show piece was interesting because you know many would say our society is growing are are living longer and I'm going to work um in back to limit a judge at the age of Seventeen were losing some very good judges who are very experience because they are aging out\nUm and that for that amendment piece came from is that if it was the increase to Seventy five we will have some ... some very good qualified judges presiding longer on the bench\nUm and so it's unfortunate they're mixed together because they're so polar offices um and so unfortunately for voters a no vote means no to all of you know yeah\nIt it's a no or yes if you if you go for it [noise]\nYou know so that's the one where you take your hand and you kind of Rebecca [laughter] stand up there and you say well the clerk said but we're not really telling you ... let me just go to one more thing on on on this one we're still on number six is a vote\nIf you would like to tell us about your a

we didn't stop there for the fifty pleasures we between vitamin D we doubled the the Oxford empowering Steve we actually increase the microwave sixty seven percent so this now becomes the finest omega

well Kroenig or fifty plus remember this is the combination of ... with the high omega three highly concentrated they should also which is much higher and omega threes than most cruel oil formulas would be so when we're dealing with the higher omega three fish oil we're talking about support\nFor the HDL cholesterol healthy you pull flexible arteries that's so great for the circulation heart muscle strength platelet activity red blood cells that stay nice and soft and flexible so they're going to work their way through those little ... oh what about triglycerides that becomes so important

hand it to the crew guys because in terms of antioxidant power crew oil is extraordinary and it's because there is a molecule and crew oil that's naturally occurring cold after his hand and after that than Steve this is one of the most powerful\nAntioxidants we've ever discovered Steve by one measure of antioxidant activity at six thousand times stronger\nThan vitamin C ... amazing they had\nThe opposite in power in the cruel and now as we're getting older fifty clusters like myself I'm fifty two and\nWe don't make as many antioxidants naturally are antioxidants systems are kind of slowing

I'm\nI'm hesitant to get in and Ron thanks so much for calling in and thanks so much for being a listener we really appreciate it I'm I'm hesitant to give you know direct advice on how to approach this because even myself as a plumber\nOr when we kind of approach situations like this when we have to break open the block you know which is what we have to do to make a sort of repair we don't know what we're going to find the issue with adrift for it\nA leaking into an area that we don't want it could be immediately behind that exterior host the next year faucet\n... it could be further down the pipe and we have to be extremely careful when we're breaking these block walls open to not make any more damage than there already is so that the repair needs to be very delicate the the the breaking open or cutting into that block wall is is done in a very a surgical careful means\nA so that we can expose the effect that pipe in and and just repair what's there and not make the situation worse which is the challenge with\nThat I Do think it's just a big you would think you know ... maybe behind a connection to what you're going to be sure\nThe the the home built in that year uh you know the the supply pipes are going to be in this lab so the they're going horizontal outward on a slab once they reach the point of where the husband is it goes from the slap and then it goes vertically up\nSo that drip if you're getting it into the kitchen or you're getting it at the foundation of level of the stucco it might not be right behind where you turn that host them on and off it can be further down that pipe and that's when it gets a little bit more tricky or repair and probably not something I Would suggest that\nThis is the time they should do mentioned is Ron but this is the time or consider ... ... ... ... these when these cop in in ... is almost to the point we need to have bonded totally dissection rolling his how's your clothes the rest of the house because everything is on the wrong correct\nYeah in in with runs in with Ron I'm concerned about water infiltration into other areas of the stucco too that's that's something we can come out and do an evaluation on and and let them know the full scope of of what's involved in in this sort of project shortening\nSong lead lead doctor I saw it on and I so I was going ... come out\nWith us and and take a look because you never really know behind the stuck when it runs out in other places I I had when George found in my house it leaked in one spot in the wall\nBut the block is connected to the slab right but it cracks ... somewhere along the edge folks just so you know it's normal to do so Fifteen feet down the way to actually ran out of the wall\nRight now at twenty twenty eyeglass super store get two pairs of glasses that range and those incredible do polycarbonate lenses better stronger and lighter than regular Lindsay's to prepare for only a hundred and forty nine dollars and you could share that free pair it with a family member a friend or just someone in the\nWill even play for one eye exam if you already have your prescription bring it in for a credit torture purchase these special polycarbonate lenses are twenty five percent thinner and lighter and ten times\nStronger than regular plastic lenses the rabbi heavy prescription you'll love the difference that twenty twenty eyeglass super store we like to say there's a frame for every face and a price for anybody\nWhere it's Seventy five more with him wrote in Melbourne in orange city just off by for actually want to let him be right next to ruby Tuesdays ended Fifteen fifty five state road for thirty six in winter park northwest corner of for thirty six and how branch road\nOpen Sunday for your shopping convenience get\nDirections coupons even make your eye appointment on line and twenty twenty I last dot com\nOrlando's largest two day festival effect\nThe forty eight there and you will fall fiesta in the park presented by your local for dealers come out to a beautiful lake ... park on November\nThirty four four regional art and crash a huge kids play area and live entertainment all weekend the event is open ten AM to five pm Saturday and Sunday fall fiesta and the FARC has brought to you by her sing university lake rich winery and vineyards in central Florida expressway authority for more details visit fiesta in the park dot com\nDon't just lose weight central\nWas the original burn fat or Leno dot com and\nStuff out of my closet that I thought wow I'm gonna wear nice now they weren't too bad how I got to go shopping which was really nice things\nWith our cutting edge that burning technology you can lose thirty to forty pounds faster and easier than ever before and just forty days would burn fat or Leno dot com call now at eight five five eighty nine eight ball\nFor six I remember when I hear the\nNews twenty four hour news weather and traffic is news Ninety six point five\nLess than ...

on Jack o' lanterns okay I call them pumpkins jumped in carving or something and I'm from the south or something in the Jack o' lanterns\nAnd I got to tell you a quick story so one day this is a few years back when my daughter was younger and and we want to do Jacqueline carving and I've got no art talent at all she's got some she she can drop pretty good actually really good I\nI don't know where she got it from 'cause I draw stick people Peggy draws ... actually pays real talent to but you know so I'm going to help her car just pumpkins swag lobster the garage and I get my cordless drilling ramble\nA series of their own interests and it was really started the hill and\nAnd I had come in on the ceiling a pumpkin\nOn the cabinet and that was just from twenty seconds of turning it on I think a lot faster than [laughter] the stuff is flying\nEverywhere so I'm looking at his article and they're saying oh yeah just put some vice scripts on the whole song and just turn it by hand with the vice groups in kind of cut the Jacqueline don't put and drove over\nYou know we don't need thirty two hundred rpm that [laughter] so you know I learned some just endlessly a coating setting you know uh yeah\nYeah it's it's only when they hide your lender when all the cop\nExcept for that [laughter] and I have all experience that I've had two hundred dollars or\nSo I was over my my daughter's aspects because my daughter again or the other day in in her and her husband in in one or two of their daughters and not sure who was all involve\nCarved pumpkins but instead of going all the way through on two of them they scooped out of design ... oh yeah there was really beautiful it's like real art and then one of them they cut through\nBut then they finished with finish I don't
