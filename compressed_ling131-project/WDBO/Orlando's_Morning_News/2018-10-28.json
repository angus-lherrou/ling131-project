the list goes on and on the prostate skin bone density even potentially weight management here's the phone number one eight hundred\nThe materials that are going to you're recycling bin or go to one of a orange county's facilities and we actually loaded onto another truck and it'll get hauled to a materials recycling facility or Murph and those facilities are set up to handle hundreds of tons of of recyclables\nOr a day and what they do is they sorted out each of those five materials each material gets sorted out and once those materials are sorted then they are compressed into what we typically called bales and those bales within our loaded onto onto um trucks are ships and sent to facilities where they are material is\nTurned back into a new commodity you know once this plastic uh bows out it can be a melted down turned into new plastic turned into new jars turned into um uh\nSuch things as as carpet and other recycle commodities or things like the metal ... you know a aluminum is highly recyclable and it's always been said if you take that old aluminum can and you put it in your recycling bin\n... Thanksgiving there's every chance by Christmas it could be a new um aluminum can coming back to use those things can get turned back into new products\nIsn't any type of canned soup can\nThe recycle all that absolutely if it's a metal canister or a soup can or or\nA a a drink can anything that's made out of steel or aluminum the typical cans that we would buy at the store\nI Know a lot of people do have pieces of metal and put them in their cycle is that okay\nUnfortunately it's not that the metal and the sorting material\nOr I should say the sorting equipment\nThat separates those metal cans out is kind of specific to the shape and size of the can so if you have a nice round can it it'll get processed appropriately in the equipment but if you put in say a an engine block something like that which is very much recyclable\nJust not recycling your cart that problem being is that it's heavy can damage the equipment and the same things even for like say pots and pans which may be made out of stainless steel which is just not a type of metal\nThat the system is set up the handle\nI Want you to back up to plastic chair I always kind of debate justice plastic go in or not how do we know what plastics go in and let\nThe plastics typically those plastics that are numbered one through\nFive um our recyclable if it has a little chasing arrows on the bottom but many things have that a number on the bottom and this is where it kind of gets a little confusing when it comes to plastic a\nRecycling so if you've got a plastic bottle that has a knack that is very much recyclable if you've got a tub like yogurt container bad is recyclable unfortunately those things that are made out of like the clam shells or you may take a you're a leftovers home from a\nRestaurant that's a a a different type of plastic and it is not recyclable so anything that um typically as a as a bottle\nOr is always recyclable and some of the other things may not be so I Would say\nWhen in doubt keep it out that would be the rule of thumb to follow when it comes to recycling thanks so again if you know you've got a a soda bottle or milk jog highly recyclable the other things if you're not certain about it don't put it in the recycle but\nYeah the things that I tend to wonder about other things we bring home you know fruits and vegetables and\n... unfortunately not very recyclable um sometimes they have numbers on the bottom sometimes they don't put those clam shells what we call those containers that kind of fold over on themselves those uh those containers are typically not recyclable so\nAgain if you focus on the bottles and you focus on the yogurt uh and type tubs you'll be okay anything else is not recyclable\nAnd many of our listeners of course they're outside of Orange County and they're listening right now I'm Wondering what about our county so what do you advise do you have for those listeners in terms of keeping track of what they can recycling not\nGenerally stick to those basic five items they are recyclable in most areas you want to make sure that we we focus on what's kind of a minimum um [noise] uh information or they minimum containers but I Would say outside of the area you can always find get information on your county's website or\nYour your local municipalities website as far\nAs those things that might be recyclable but again typically sticking to um those five things would be the most recyclable outside of Orange County although each county may have some subtle differences or I Would suggest that they are a residence outside of Orange County check with their local um local county website\nWell back to Orange County down as an example Flora for all of this can you give us some numbers I mean you know number one just starting with it the solid waste that you deal with and how much it can be recycled air dance\nI think Orange County where typically about this past year the the [noise] the state of Florida tracks how each county does on recycling one of the challenges we face is not all material moves through Orange County facilities so if material\nMoves to a private facility um we don't track those numbers but the state of Florida attracts the recycling rate for every county in Florida and our rate is a little bit over thirty five percent I'm of the material of the waste that's generated Orange County gets recycled\nAt someplace either by Orange County or by a private entity\nComparatively it's not good\nIt is very close to the national average national averages right around thirty four percent so\nWe're about as good as um you know most of the of the other locales in in the country but one of the challenges we face is every body is facing some headwinds when it comes to recycling in that uh some of the markets in particular China\nHas stopped we are accepting certain materials for cycling so what we're seeing is the processors are demanding that we have good clean materials\nIn our recycling bin and so the one thing we can do is if we can encourage our residents to only put those recycled recyclable\nMaterials in the recycle bans them we can be sure that it will get recycled so again the challenges we're trying to work across all of our um [noise] all of our residents to make sure that they put the right things in the recycle in\nOrange County ... efforts to recycle is that part of a bigger plan in terms of being environmentally sound as accounting\nOh yeah I mean I think the county has a very broad sustainability\nGoals and the county tries very hard to be responsible\nWhen it comes to matters related to the um to the environment so of course for cycling is just one piece of that puzzle but you know\nIt's not always just the environment there's also issues related to the economy when it comes to recycling because the idea of those aluminum cans of those plastic bottles bacon continued to\nTo move through the economy continue to generate new products which have to um have jobs to support them so you know we're looking at issues related to not only the environment but also the economy and then again the long term impact on society of not putting all of this material into and if you will a landfill\nWhere it it stays in the landfill for the rest of the\nRest of time but if we can keep it moving through the economy than it it has\nYou know this this quote waste material actually becomes a product that moves through the economy creates jobs and helps um\nAgain helps us reduce our reliance on on raw materials or that you know either petroleum or ... mind metal out of the things that we extract from the earth\nI think the metal being that we would be able to use it again and again maybe I'm wrong about that and I always wonder about plastic how many times can that be repurposed\nEven though it can be repurposed a number of times but to your question I don't really know exactly how many times it can cycle through but uh my understanding is you know\nMost products can continually be recycled as long as we put them into the um [noise] and put them put to good clean material into the recycling card they'll continue to be turned into some kind of product um so it's a life cycle\nThey return to what this item sorry can I wanted to ask you about electronics and certainly you don't want anyone to put those either in the recycle bin or in the regular trash but uh what what can we do with them\nWe uh Orange County has a program to accept a end of life electronics from our residents and that material can be delivered to the Orange County landfill or\nI'm right now to our uh our LB McLeod transportation on a schedule and I know most other counties also have a program to accept end of life electronics and the advantages materials\nThat are delivered to an end of life electronic collection location will be recycled there are very you know ... valuable metals and these phones um that can be you know turn back into new phones are back into new computers were into new t._v. so uh again that's where I Would encourage folks to look\nAt their at the website for Orange County defined times in locations where that material can be dropped off here in our county and for other listeners you know look at their local county website\nOkay so more recycling okay and he and I guess we should ask you about some stuff you mentioned earlier don't put you know the pesticides are they the other kinds of things in different cycle ban but is it possible to in some way and you know turn this over to you\nManner that keeps them out of the landfill keeps them out of the groundwater\nAbsolutely um Orange County operates a household hazardous waste collection center or sometimes we called\nThis is the most horrific crime scene I've seen

C. R. formula there's more it's got the green tea Kirk human the spiritual to be talked about\nClass grape seed extract behind bars bio ... vitamin C can you talk to me about this a re a really super anti accidents poli sci fi knows that you put in the form you\nWell yeah I won't say that we kind of went over killed but I Will say that we really really developed in the fish and comprehensive program here grape seed extract and pine bark extract\nBoth contain a group of highly specialized antioxidant compounds that not only do much of what I've already described but also enhance the physical integrity of tissue in the blood vessels and the skin\nSo we put those in there for\nExtra boost in antioxidant activity but also for a specific type of activity that isn't as much addressed by the green tea the curriculum and then there is there a troll the by of flab annoyed and hence\nThe overall activity of vitamin C. and vitamin C itself is one of the most important nutrients that we can possibly take in so I Would say that we were very very thorough you know when we went through what could be in this product we said you know what would happen\nIf we put in grape seed extract pine bark extract ... noise and vitamin C. we realize that we would have an orderly superior formula and just to reiterate pat\nI Want people to experience dynamic health I Want people to feel great this formula the Greenpeace ER will make you feel great and that's the purpose of it\nI ... I Love this green T. C.

D printers is where the ... toilet something like that and it went down again I'm like oh my God I got another leak job now I was not expecting that\nWell is it led and you'll come\nYes we haven't we haven't pinpointed delete as of now we're going back in on Monday right but the point is cast iron you know the ... most people in the deal is backing up\nOr something that's happening you know they keep having these problems yeah you know the ... gonna stake in it\nYou got the great could you went out and you took the camera and there's going to take a camera just by something like ... or I Do is usually when it's real bad though if you go see what the camera right you know the first time out right because you get up to a brief stuffed them falling into it and that type of thing you know we can test it over to our goal is to be able to test to\nSee where this leak and enough\nBut ah we were talking earlier time and I was thinking about this because we were in another state you know doing this they're they have clay\nWhere here we have saying oh yeah and if I don't know how is it that the houses are backing up more and more dollars 'cause what I'm finding is I think this happened a lot more than you think you know I'm looking at the advertising like a ... that's not a problem the cast on really not a problem\nThis has happened to more than you'd think\nBut because it by saying you know here it is time weak the water line can take I mean there are say it could take a gallon admitted he off a couple of guys you can't make it now that you know you're talking about thirty you know or eighty thousand gallons of has to be in\nA leak mhm so if you know what I'm saying if you got that much water going underground in the sand would take it a drain leak from a cast a bidding they run every now and then you may never know you have a problem\nCould take years for the problem that actually surface the editor only gonna happen\nIt's where I've been going with it if you know the ... enough I mean there's got to be pretty bad when is doing it because it's falling into whether those crack the cracks or in in is called the backup Mm is when you go to find other than if is running out it'll run out all day and you wouldn't know\nBut that problem because that's what's happening now uh we've located again you expect it on the kitchen\nI'm surprised that it's a it's on my a toilet area or the bigger pipes well you\nKnow cast aren't a bummer all the way round in so many ways but you didn't I didn't think so well like if you have a restaurant yes and you use chemicals clean the floor with I mean you're dumping down to sink those type you're gone\nYou know they're not even bigger than any ... any caustic as you know a dollar a day it's a very young\nBut that's back too but what we got going on Georgia's everybody's got all kinds of sewage running under the house in the dirt and under the slab in Wyoming up everybody's way right that's pretty ugly\nIt is but again we talk about the chemicals and caustic and things that happen but usually that's in the washing machine you know and the and the kitchen sink right or an ops after that everything else my argument has been everything else has good\nNot all that much [laughter] tries to do that is I mean that's a big surprise but that's what they're saying and I'm at\nHome with maybe substitute blood ... through ... years ago yeah that'll come you know it's out of pounded into joint and then let it over so\nThat's a ... foot hey I hear that music that means we got to go to break ... around the house Roger by the train company it's hard to stop the train the doctor and protect air conditioning and plumbing where we never closed for me right back as we say in the old days don't touch that dial today people say what's the dial yeah just don't go anywhere I'm willing\nThis is news Matty six point by having your baby to Orlando turns first for breaking news\nI'm Michelle ... Saturdays massacre at a Pittsburgh synagogue\nBelieve now to be the worst attack on a Jewish community in us history\nSix Flags inside the nine six five goes with news Ninety six one side yeah how about that I never know when things are almost out on her [laughter] what's your what you're talking about sewer pipes and all this test and equipment you've got here and the and do\nWell yeah well we've been looking at it you know 'cause we you know we built a business own pipe the orderly but that was water supply and you know it's not what now your unit on you know the advertisement about your sewer system most be an old or these leaks into decay and in these lawsuits and all that\nSo we're being asked to file leaks and that\nAnd sewer line diagnostics can be a little trickier the old ally lot to do it can be ...\nYeah it's a lot to that but again the surprise I um\nExperience is that I was expected in the cast and with the chemical war in the kitchen and\nWashing machine I was not expecting it for them to and this is back to what they're saying\nThat the whole system maybe ... and it's not those systems is bad you know what we're doing our practice what we're trying to do is how to isolate each league and that could be multiple leaks will find that's what we learned out at the training but I didn't think it would be the case here uh tried again\nBecause it by saying you know we'll an alleged you've got a major backup from it\nYou know it because the saying can take the water drains really well it drains were entered ... you know I mean if he can take a gallon or two gallons a minute you know you talk in eighty thousand gallons a mutt right and they can surely take you know you run toilets or you flush the toilet or\nFrom time to time you got all as adults down in the ground now on they're out on the ... that's true and what you're saying yeah and that's that's not a healthy situation and imagine a note to healthy I don't want that under my house no um I don't think anyone\nBut you know we work on a lot of homes to the sewer lines were the home is off the ground you know is it your Space Center nearby and you know\nYes you know right away and you're right\nAnd the plumbers your gun oh man oh man but you didn't what was called but you didn't know that I mean we didn't know until they wanted to know a backup or some of K yeah occasionally home or not doing that as a ... or something and they see it\nAs true but uh yeah but we go out there and the guys are trying to fix the problem and it's like oh my own my own mind and it doesn't doesn't smell it get under the house no no no no\nBut yeah so that's what's coming up for us do end up but you know I Want to say 'cause we started you are just you came in he was saying how last week he was getting all these calls and you know it's pretty quiet today and I'm going to want to think it's because\nIt's a little chilly outside and people staying in bed snugly or a little bit but the other part that I was told and it seemed like it happened we started talking about leaks you know yeah and I was still ... sex you know so well\nI don't I think there are ... or ... I Love where this hype\nWas under a tree in the corner of the building move because the treaty move the building and the ... got a twist you brought one day or a couple of times are brought in somewhere to root is wrapped or well yeah see like a corkscrew through the pipe and\nCool that is to me that's what I think also yeah that's what it is not a water heater you know a well known what aged maple was say if they don't have a ... water here they're not happy well let's talk to the bucket mountain Dora buck yes it has a tool just like I don't even know what it is but go ahead exactly\nI Would have a buck and [noise] what do you think more and more are already thinking I think it's many lave\nAll wow that was a very many laser incredible unfortunately I've got a big lanes because I didn't know any better when I bought it and not what I Do better I wanted to big stuff\nTurned out I Love doing pins and on pans you can often use a mini late that way your expenses lot lower and it actually probably runs a little smoother sometimes but no but that's not what it is good but if you make ... it is a good guess George records this all up and make it\nIf you make pans I I use this tool to help you make my pin so like buck has one of these that is is does it for a buck thanks for the call we sure appreciate that\nAnd folks if you play along with us here this morning we'll give you clues to the two of the week you guessing we get the gift card for twenty five dollars to a\nWell Christ said he had some from Perkins you had something in there maybe from Hobby Lobby in a few other things that will will take care of that\nIt's a function phone number here's warnings eight for for two two zero zero nine six okay now you all her stump the jump right you all her this you know gay okay you already Chris you paying attention in there I don't get jumped [laughter] how much weight\nBecause I see I have thought about going to be had again that my Christmas decorations on and there were no to hear something from last year oh it's not too early Justin by different [laughter] that's how early I Am trying to find a punk and so when the kids go recruit trick or treat to know at least I got some pumpkins to like knock on it or get some candy right yes there and had a great\nRight area if LA how much weight can you add a cold I mean how much stuff you can you put up there\nI think that's probably something a lot of our listeners have not thought about I didn't know there was a kid I was a limit there's probably a lot of ads [laughter]\nThat's right oh but when you be most a lot of people addict seemed like there is no limit so is there a specific number though yeah\nThere are for all all universal for all addicts there's like a there's a there's\nA generally speaking yes yes there is one and you know what it is a factor was here I I I'll pronounce it for Hector that do nothing oh ... it's only made to support to rough\nI mean if you go to Chris was in that but not Thanksgiving you do you have to research and I don't want to go in there and talk to her yeah really I suppose\nAnything you're addicts whoa yeah but you know most addicts are insulated over the garage right now I insulated mind to make my garage ... inflation's find little or eleven up there are Nineteen I don't know if you want or thirty necessarily but unless they're specifically designed to hold\nMore stuff yeah yeah and um now what about all that space an addict Tom would likely exactly secret compartments like you know they aren't there for ... yeah yeah well you know that's the real answer that's the engineering answer but most people like me I I decked my addict a little bit short here\nAnd I put some Christmas decorations up there and I\nYou know put some uh Thanksgiving or you know and stuff up there but I have definitely tried to to use it last\nYear and a half before because it's not you're not supposed to be done stuff up there but here's a question for me you know that I have is\nIs you put it up there and you don't go in the attic very often and you ... and every time I go up to ... oh I Need to get rid of that you know you see that the insurance up there that you put up to eight years ago and you wonder you thought it was gone\nAnd it was [laughter] like like some facts may maybe they are not plans yeah you go look\nIn the end it's it's just so serious about it but the rose a good number of yet but most nights will lead to a you know put a little bit of stuff up there but the other thing is is don't ever leave it on the drywall goes to the drywall ceiling will separate from from the ... ...\nDesigned to support zero than the drywall ...\nDesign just oh yeah you know when the euro yeah exactly I mean when it gets to be put water cross stitch you doing this or that becomes that's you say zero but boy that's a lot of area [laughter]\n[noise] and no and we get to move those things around an ethics when we do our re pipes and\nOh you got that you would have a a lot of snow right a lot of stuff in ... a lot of that stuff from\nVery ... very carefully at very carefully [laughter]\nSo what one of my favorite magazines or family handy man has told me here says five pounds per square foot but folks I'm not telling you I'm telling you nothing yes I'm telling you nothing nothing okay but they said five pounds
