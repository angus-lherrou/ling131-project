you follow any journalist on Twitter you can see\nThe bias in the way that they phrase things and a lot of times it looks like there is a left wing biased there\nDo you say it's a Twitter is a minefield for journalists and it says because it unintentionally reveals that so many of them or left wing I've known some that it's not unintentional\nOh right I mean it's not just national yeah so
