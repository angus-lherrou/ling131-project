moment ago but ah I Am in Panama City that is true\nYou have to take my word on the other part there Steve\n[laughter] I'm a yeah I I Am in Panama City right now and we've got\nKind of a steady rain now a it is raining pretty hard at this point but the winds aren't too bad here yet it uh in fact you know outside of the hotel this morning there were still kids sort of running around in the rain it's almost like they know that they're going to be cooped up\nFor some time so they're trying to get it out of their system I think but there were you know when there was some folks have been asking us as we're getting ready to go out into the downtown area to to watch the sun come up\nAnd sort of be up ... you know in the storm as much as we can throughout the day there were people actually asking us if\nThey could still make it out to the very edge of the coast to get things out of their apartments and things like that so you know still some people that just aren't quite ready for this storm to come I think a lot of people were caught off guard Joe because it just sort of you know a couple of days ago we weren't even talking about this storm now it\nIs has turned into this you know possibly a monster and it really really good to have a heavy impact right here looks like it's going to smack white into Panama City or job\nYou know Steve there are so few times in in our world in which we can predict that people will die and yet as as sad as it makes me to make that proclamation\nIt's a foregone conclusion that people will die there in the panhandle perhaps in Georgia and maybe even up into the Carolinas\nOr whether they are first responders or people who decided to ride out the storm or it's people who didn't have the ability to evacuate and but it's it's heart wrenching to think that some people will won't\nIt till the end of the day to day\nYeah and and it's all about preparation I as we drove in on a highway Ninety eight runs white along the Gulf of Mexico here in their houses that sit right there along the Gulf of Mexico we stopped did it\nDid alive shot there at six o'clock last night and I was talking to three different neighbors that lived ... right next to each other they said there is still washing the forecasts they're still trying to decide at six o'clock last night whether or not they were going to leave or not I certainly hope they got out because now that this is a category for now that it's our ... at it\nIt's going to be dangerous and the interesting thing on the storm\nIs that it this is a lot of times these come ashore overnight and you really can't see what's happening because it's so dark dark this is going to be a sunrise sunset event where the whole thing is going to unfold and it's going to happen right in a major area you know Panama City is taking the brunt of this and it's just going to come ashore\nFor all of us to see we've got our weather chaser on channel nine so I'll be live over on channel nine

developing but it also doing this Twenty one time I learned the places that I can go to be safe I always know just where a police station is a fire station is\nUsually my favorite place to write out a hurricane is in a parking garage parking garages had a great stairwells where all you know\nHeck breaks loose you get in the stairwell it also has a place to protect the equipment that's one of the most important thing protect your equipment because really the story is not always just the storm is what happens after the storm and they want to make sure that you're you're ready to cover what

danger and hurricanes we like to send a are danger hurricane reporter\nChannel nine eye witness news reporter Steve Barrett is joining us live and you appear to be pretty much right where the eye of the storm is going to make landfall\nAnd sometimes it's just a matter of luck or your position yourself beforehand and how much the storm's going to move around we had a good sense that it was going to come in you know the Mexico beach area Joe maybe Panama City so we got ourselves a room and Panama City and and uh I'll be darned thing hasn't intensified quite a bit\nAnd now it really looks like Panama city's getting it get hit Barry Barry art will be down town all day today covering and now that the the light is up I can see the clouds swirling around and that pattern that you see as tropical storms and hurricanes come ashore and uh the clouds are really starting to get sick\nOr not a lot of wind yet but it certainly has been raining for quite some time now Joe\n... it is not impossible to think that this could become a category five before it makes landfall as the hurricane hunters are reporting that there are wind speeds of a hundred and fifty miles an hour inside the storm\nA you know the pressure keeps it keeps dropping dropping and it it's just amazing how this has intensified you know we saw it as we drove out of town a yesterday that you know maybe it would be a strong to baby it would be a three\nAnd now we're talking for now we're talking possibly five this really could have a devastating impact and like we talked about an hour ago it's all going to happen during the day and it's all going to happen quickly it's not going to be like Lawrence [noise] more you watch it move over the course of days\nThis is going to happen in a twelve hour period you here and gone in that period of time\nAnd it'll probably be sunny in the morning\nRight with Florence that's such a good observation there Steve because with Florence had stuck around and rain and rain and was just a huge drain maker of this one to the major threat appears to be the storm surge and the roof shredding wind or that is going to be blowing in there in in just a short order\nYou know that's why the preparations for a hurricane or always so important because you can have what happened with Florence where it takes days and businesses were closed days in advance it's slowed down\nAnd then it weakened and then it dumped all that rain over the course of time and the flooding became a problem afterwards as opposed to this where we weren't even talking about Michael\nYou know at the beginning or at the beginning of the weekend last weekend\nAnd now all of a sudden we're faced with a\n... something that's just increasing exponentially here as it comes ashore with very little notice so I Hope I Hope people have heeded the warnings and he'd gotten out or on the coastline and even even you know a mile or two inland evacuated if they were told to do so I Know is talking to some people yesterday Joe\nThat said oh we're going to wait we're just you know keep watching the tracks for a little while we're there isn't a bad storm you don't have a little while to watch this one\nYeah and this storm now is nearly five hundred miles wide or this is just a massive storm that came out of nowhere and moved very quickly\nAnd people are not going to have a whole lot of time to get out a way and I saw a warning from Governor Scott that if you haven't evacuated already don't ah it's too late for some of those people to to evacuate now it's too close\nNow you should at this point just hunker down and try to find a safe place which by the way Steve I Know that you do I know that this is your twenty first hurricane to cover\nAnd uh you have survived all of them because a safety is the first order of business to make sure you and the crew are safe that's channel nine eye witness news reporter Steve beret where the eye of the storm is very likely to pass or
