know the the again the greatest leaders understand that they're they're this and\nThis idea that you know\nLeader as hero leader as\nThe smartest person or you know riding in on the white Orson saving the day there are some situations they're required that type of leadership but but in terms of running and organization none of us can be the smartest person in the room\nEspecially especially in this day and age things are moving too quickly so really great leaders stripper CEOs it's true for managers is true for supervisors is true for leaders in in our you know places of worship in the community every leader understands that they're real job\nIs to get great talent around them that the answers are going to come to the people around them and then my job is to kind of be the\nYou know I'll be rowing boat as it were but I've got the best possible people on the boat that are helping to determine what direction we're going in and what we're going to do when we get there and all that so it's about getting the smartest people around me and then it's about my efforts\nTo make sure that the people around me are constantly getting smarter and more capable and more experienced\nSteve who were the leaders from history\nIt's currently in any field\nOr that you really admire\nYeah I I'm a ... it's funny because I I get asked that question a lot in and I'm Glad you you changed the cab yet from history to people that I admire because when I look at historically leaders\nAh it's a little cliched almost them you know and and even even popular\nUm well known leaders today like for example the warm up at some of the gates that we were just talking about a minute ago\n[noise] if I don't know them personally I I Can't say that I admire them other than from what I've seen through soundbites a news coverage so so I'll tell you I'm One of the leaders right now that I I really I've known him for a while\nUm he's not a famous leader I mean he's not he's not completely under the radar but it was a guy named ... oldfield who is the the or the c._e._o. of a company called train it to try to it as a publicly traded company for something billion dollar\nCompany and their clients are are a small to mid sized companies so it tried it does your age are the services and count them benefits and all that sort of thanks for companies that can't hire their own HR\nThey're too small to hire ... nature so they've got thousands and thousands of people in their network and Bert ... whenever I talk to ... what emanates from him is how much he loves his clients\nShow would reminded me of him in this context pet is is just recently they open up a new office in a I Believe there's in Nevada somewhere so he was working the c._e._o. of a four point whatever billion dollar company\nRunning around the country visiting all of his offices he goes to this new office in the vodka and joins them for a barbecue in the office right\nAnd and one of the employees looked at him and said you're the c._e._o. this company what are you doing here at our barbecue\nAnd he said he said look\nWhen I took this company over we're a hundred million dollars now were you know over four billion dollars you guys are working day and night\nWhy wouldn't I hear\nThere's a very simple reason that I'm here I Love you guys that's what he said I Love you guys who may ... guys\nAnd then at the end of the evening somebody said well you know Bergen thank you for you know thank you for for ... and he said no thank you for making this company what it is that to me he is a heroic act I can't tell you how many CEOs\nThat I met over the years\nThat are terrified to do that kind of the\nThings they don't want to leave their office they're afraid actually literally afraid to sit down and talk with their employees because they're afraid of what they're going to hear they're going to hear the wrong thing or said wrong things make them uncomfortable it's so ironic to me it's really a simple act of love should it be a greater than yourself kind of a leader\nRequires a personal engagement with people requires it requires a desire to see other people they excel and succeed so my heroes my leaders that I've met over the years are people that you know they're not famous or not the people that you read about except maybe if you read about him and one of my books Steve\n... or what does it take for a ... be leader to becoming a leader or Tennessee leader becoming a leader at some point\nYeah such great question you get it begs the question your leaders born or are they made right\nUm and the answer courses yes never yet metal leader that's not borne so that\nThat was part of it um but listen there are people that are naturally inclined to leadership there are ... there was such a thing as a natural born a leader as you as you call it ... that doesn't mean that for the rest of us there's no hope so any of us can progress I don't know that all of us\nHave the capability to be you know Gandhi Martin Luther king Nelson Mandela et cetera\nBut we all have the capability\nTo be better tomorrow than we are today to be more effective leader tomorrow than we are today\nSo the simple answer is yes she can move to be can move to a\nUh in you know in their context but it's it depends on a couple of things first of all we have to understand the leadership is not about your position or titles so let's not confused getting the assignment of leadership with actually being a leader right\nSo if I if I Am promoted\nTo manager that doesn't automatically make me all these\nPeople are going to start calling me a leader\nThey're going to start including me I'm a leadership meetings and conferences but it doesn't automatically make Neal leader so I have to understand first of all the leadership is about what I Do\nHow they approach my work the relationships that I create my ability to influence people around me to change things for the better so that's got nothing to do with my title so going from it seems to be lead attorney leader\nNot the same as getting promoted from one of the other it's all about our own development so the first\nThing is they have the desire to be a better leader to understand that it's something I have to work on\nA and then there are lots of steps taken that process not the least of which is constantly getting feedback constantly getting feedback from the people I'm leading\nA as to what if I Want to ... very simple place to start on how to improve to be a leader why not just start with asking my team hey guys\nI just got promoted I'm a manager now you're looking to me for leadership I'm looking to be a better leader what can I Do for you what what are you looking for for me and then down the road a little bit how am I doing you know what what\nDo you what are the things that I should do to improve to be a better is to be a better leader for you\nConstantly see combat feedback and being willing to take that back in working on my own development so that\nThe barber has been our gas but we got another segment with him to stay with us though Steve is going to talk more about his book greater than yourself [noise]\nAh this is

cameras careers ended up being a pretty powerful senator during grants president state and when I was reading that book I really wanted\nIt was a big political issue and personality that period and unfortunately do cook exist that you know you have lots of great biographies was this crap but nothing that just focuses on the presidency so\nYou know anytime I see a hole in the literature I Try to fill it and that's this book came about\nThe introduction to this book and into quote mistakes have been made\nOr can you tell us about that\nSure a U.S such great is sort of an unusual politician never held political office before being elected to the president\nAnd Sherman set of him you know a a great general might prove a baby politician on some level I think you know\nThat was pretty ... uh uh thinking right or insurance part but anyway and in grass\nEighth um annual message what we would think of as a state of the union speech transmitted his his message to Congress and set in the

really all about the collapse of reconstruction and south\nAnd into reconstruction means more than just\nI'm bringing this dates back into the union and helping them adjust to placed after slavery in reconstruction is really about the wholesale political and economic social transformation of the south so that looks like a no\nAh the south is the wealthiest portion of the country or in the eight in the years leading up to the war and after the war it's the poorest because almost all of that's well within slate or in crops that were grown by slaves\nAnd so it's a really shattering transition and the result the granite ministry she spends a lot of its time trying to not only plant\nInstitutions like railroads and banks and factories but also to ensure a transition for African Americans from that\nAnd there's a lot of government resources that go into that there's a lot of effort that goes into that is very rare second term political support\nFor all of that really evaporates in large part because of that economic task begins with a ... a ... much more difficult to see where\nReconstruction flew 'em in his second\nTerm and you know his success for his successor rather have actually

D cuts in other words it's it's a ripping of the blade and that overtime creates a weakness in the grass and so it is the beginning of the end so to speak [noise] one thing I whether you look here's the good news for for\nFor all gardeners\nThe temperatures are dropping they're getting a little ... there are a lot better in the morning the mornings are magnificent it's still ... hot but I think that's going to change real soon and\nThere are a couple of things I Want to review with you number one your indoor space which which will call your pool patio area or your your coverage Glenn Nye whatever you want to call it\nI always call that the most important room in the house and the ... the reason is because that's\nWhere you are in your free time\nAnd our free time is are we charge time now for the last couple of months I've been telling you about how I re did the ... in my sucking garden which is a very large checking and all and\nI ... for for years you know I I didn't have a problem with the baking 'cause it wasn't Rodney to rethink it was it was getting a little older and I get a few boards that would come up on the in and we would just fixing there was no big deal but then he got to the point where no this is not acceptable even worried became too ugly you might\nSay just redoing that deck\nWas remarkable and I also did\nI also changed the design a somewhat by sucking garden has to ponds that has a waterfall as Kuwait fish has it gives the boat and it has a jungle scene surrounding it ... essentially what I did is I created a coaster week it in my backyard\nAnd it's very lush and very gorgeous but yet the plants that I use are still very distinct\nYou know it's not it's not haphazardly put together it was ... every single plant without feel his position\nAnd well positioned I I wouldn't change a thing all these years later and I was I'm very excited about that but the my my level of enjoyment\nJust wind up exponentially because before I wasn't even a using the sunken garden and now I'm Out there in the mornings I'm Out there in the evenings or or or late afternoon you know when it's when it's getting dark and I get so much enjoyment out of it\nAnd one of the things I Want to mention to you because I get this question to someone maybe perhaps one of the most important questions is can you trim this time of year and the answer is\nOn some things on some things no you can't for example anything that has buds or\nHas currently is blooms you're not supposed to trim right now because you know you you ... the whole goal of a flowering plant is to get it the flower right and those types of plants you would trim typically early in the spring\nOr so for um for example you don't trim Camille use and as the area's after August\nNow on as there is a community as you may not see the buds if they don't have any buds I'm going to go ahead and trim them but they hand them\nCellular early in the stem right between the two top leaves you can't see them but they're developing and it takes a long time for this to take place\nSo just because you don't see them doesn't mean that they're not for me so if you go and cut them and say September or October then you have an issue because you're not going to have any blooms at all on those areas and we\nWe see this a lot with even um\nCommercial uh people where they come with these power tremors and they keep everything nice to meet in and it's and it's like just perfect the way it's trimmed but the problem is\nThe person doing it doesn't really understand you know the ... the ...\nThe specifics of the nuances of that particular variety so so they they continue trimming and even in the fall with the flowering things and that's why you don't have any flowers on yours areas or you just have a few little spot blooms here and there when the neighbors have tons of blooms you know at certain times a year\nDepending on the variety of Syria so no there is something that I refer to as a light trimming in other words um\nNow they in this entire properly they have really good infrastructure which is really great and so it happens to be a very narrow backyard\nAnd when we come back from these other calls what I'm going to do is\nGive you an example an used this yard as an example of what you can do and\nI Believe in making your side yard and experience to walk through it instead of just being ugly and boring in a place where you store extra pots but you don't want to throw away you turn it into\nAn attractive walk not for the people walking by their house not for anyone but for you and that's what I've\nDone in my yard in both of my size or totally opposites uh depose totally different but I enjoy them both in very different ways uh let's go to Chad and see what's going on then what's um\nWhat's happening with your grass\nMorning I just wanted to find out the best time to um put some weight and feet down I haven't done it probably in a couple of months\nOr longer than that actually the whole summer and I figured everywhere getting close to the time I\nKnow you you are correct now would be the time and you can do it any time in the next couple of weeks or if you like\n[noise] hey good to have a couple of bags left over so I was anxious to put that out\nOkay very valuable directions don't put it down too heavy\n[noise] he's got it\nThe other question I had as I I had gotten into a planting some avocados and I've had a hard time I I have two avocado plant and also a couple of Maine does that I've had a hard time finding one that actually

they were like older men\nOkay or is it is just to watch for them or\nNo they actually like the heat um I I think first of all I I Am grown different types of elephant ears the the family is\nIs called alec Keisha and there's dwarf ones and there's more ruin ones and giant leaf ones and mid sized ones in ... there there really are an interesting exotic\nAs a matter of fact there's even some unique varieties you could even buy a box store now which I Am kind of shocked by\nBut it's a it's a good thing anyway\nThere's there's one common denominator that they all like and I would say go heavy heavy you're with the black how common or in other words really uh you can even put it several inches around them\nThey all weigh like a lot of open leads around them and if you were they take some coca leaves and blended fifty fifty with the uh common for the blackout\nThat yeah he really advantageous but the one who you said is not growing that one right I'm sure is not getting enough water you need to adjust to sprinkler or put a bubble or on it or\nGet more water to that spot otherwise they won't grow they'll just sit there and look at you\n... you say they they stay real grain a laser probably too you know a foot by two feet okay\nWell I mean it sounds like they're holding their own but if you if you want them to really thrive and grow you're going to need to increase the water that's the way the ... but but let me mention this yeah you David real quick\nUm around some time in the month of November depending on temperature they're going to start to go downhill\nThis is a formal process for all elephant ears they will they they actually began going into what we call pre dormant see it doesn't mean they're dying it doesn't mean they're sick it means that it's normal

increase the water and you'll be you'll be fined ...\n... that surround the land itself not on it\nUh well correct It's ... it's on the it's it's like a plane\nYou like you do when you apply a

I Do\nUm but I don't see is for oil and then in the recording I I think that we might have to double check those measurements are used for eleven\nHundred I think once you told me five foot but round up the throughout the year round up a baby fingers tiny fingers yeah if you can move 'em with one move it was\nOne player that's the best part they add beauty we have tons of different styles so maybe you on that front door the hinge door look but you don't necessarily have the space for it well we have a fix for that we have a gliding door we can put there that has the French door look so we have a multitude of things that we can offer\nNow do you have a French door that has a slight or look\nI'm not quite we do have\nA friend store that has a more narrow um what we call a rail a and you'll get to know I'm kind of a window and saw you some turns a styles and rails are what time doors for where the frame of the door that\nAnd so we do have some of the more narrow look to them but there's always going to be that beautiful French door luck [noise]\nSo you know Anderson or you know I think everybody knows the name Anderson but tell us the history about under Center for people that don't\nShare so Anderson is a usa company it's based on a Minnesota started in Nineteen oh three so it's been around for hold on a hundred and fourteen years now which is pretty impressive\nUm it was a family that was really dedicated to making a difference in the window and door industry and they've just gone on to maintain that it's still a family owned business um it which is fantastic there's a lot of people who work for Anderson windows who takes pride and we've always just been\nThe leader and windows and doors um we're always doing research and development to see how we can improve and make things better and that it's just become the brand that everybody knows which is an interesting brand to it's an interesting industry to have a very well known brand\nYeah and um your ... known as quality when you when you think about Anderson you think about quality now what is the relationship between Anderson and this renewal by Andrew sir\nSo renewal by Anderson is the replacement division of Anderson windows so what that means is we don't do any new construction so we don't handle any new build anything like that\nWe strictly work with homeowners on their existing properties with old worn out windows or old war and outdoors and we come in and we measure um all the windows that are in your home or the doors whatever you want us to look at\nAnd we will custom make new replacement windows for your home so that's what I mean by replacement division we replace all the old worn out windows and doors with brand new custom window that are made specifically for those openings so over time as they may shift or or maybe you're opening isn't as square as it used to be\nWe can account for that and our windows will fit perfectly into that opening to give you the best looking view that you can\nUm renewal by Anderson is also we're a little bit different than other sections of Anderson windows where\nWe like to say where the circle of trust or the one stop shop so uh from me talking to you here today on all the way through the design consultants who comes out to the person who answers the phone to the insular comes out we all worked for renewal by ... percent so from start to finish we handle the entire process\nSo that that way when a when you call like with the ... regular the understand group it's you know it's usually where you know that they're the manufacturer only and then you your contact a local right you'll local Joe ... Joe schmo windows they purchased the windows from Anderson\nBut ... was renewal by Anderson it start to finish the of the the a rep so when you called the the design consultants they own work up for renewal by under some yeah\nWe all at Reno by ... lives sleep eat drink windows and doors and that's how we do all day a lot of\nUm the other lines of Anderson that you're dealing with you're going to go through a separate dealer who made the other products as well so they may not be as knowledgeable so\nWe're fully engulfed in a product that we sell we only offering all by enter some products so we only sell our vibrates when do what you can only get through us so we are one hundred percent knowledgeable about what we're doing the ins and outs of it because we live it every day\nNow if you have a home improvement question the number here is aid for for two two zero zero nine six five again a for for two two zero zero nine six five now you have a special for our in the house show listeners today really\nDo have a special for the in the house show listeners today so we're really excited about it you have to be one of the first seven callers\nAnd uh we're offering twenty percent off your entire project so you've got to make sure you give us a call on the phone number to reach us at is four zero seven\nFor three four zero zero eight eight so if you're driving and make sure you slow down a little bit but that's in your own as far as the holdover yeah pull over that's probably the smarter than I might be don't listen to a far they're seven for three or four zero zero eight eight we do have people who are there for ya\nThey're ready to answer the phone or we can get out to you as soon as tomorrow\n[noise] yeah the um uh uh don't don't take her advice [laughter]\nSo we're going to go to that but I prefer to pull over or the problem is is this on this it's a special tracking\nNumber so that that way uh you know the people called in this number is the only way that they're going to get the are the\nThis discount so that's why there's the important number I'm but I'm the same number a little bit later on in the show uh so you don't have to pull over or you don't have the the the unsafe tune in later continue\nTo to to it and we'll give you the photo bridge and give us for seven for three four zero zero\nEight eight of for renewal by Anderson though that little description of what you were talking about what they understand and and why you're different you use the term called five Brecht and most people have no clue what fibrosis\nThere thinking I'm Talking about cereal or yoga I writing [laughter]\nSo um I read says are proprietary product and I'm Glad I can say that this morning my coffee is kicked in\n'em and it's only available through a set renewal by ... so what ...\nThat's what we make our frames and all of our taxes um everything except the glass pretty much and the hardware is made out of our five ... materials so it's our framing material and what it is is it's the only two composite product in the entire industry\nSo we've taken kind of the best of both worlds the best of vinyl and the best of blood a renewable energy and wanted a window that looked like a what a window but with a lot more energy efficient and durable so that's how we created the ... product\nAnd it's the best thing out there um it's not going to war it doesn't pay that doesn't crack their zero maintenance so you don't have to worry about a ... you don't have to worry about it expanding and contracting like vinyl it's the two that have come together and it's truly the best thing that's out there\nSo sue attacks question here really quick and says I'm replacing\nAll would outside will rot and so that's why ... such a\nA a great material is that it's not what it does have wood fibers in it but it's a composite material and so uh the same way that you know somebody calls and ask a a suggestion for um a for if they're installing a wood deck at their house\nMy recommendation is always don't you know you and solar would jackets ... crazy maintenance it will rot it's better to use a composite material that isn't going to Iraq right and it's the same thing with the with the windows\nOr rather than use of wood material it's much better to use the composite material that looks like wood and so with renewal by Anderson you get the look of the wood without the\nRot and maintenance of the wood and so it's really the best the best of both\nRight at the best of both worlds so it's there among the PVC polymer if you if you're really curious about what the combination at the minutes are what fibers than the best part is the wood fibers actually come\nFrom our what plant that we have our wasn't manufacturing plants of entertainment products so\nWe were like all the parts that we have and we combine it to make our eyebrows\nProduct so it's really strong it's really terrible we have tons of color combinations so if you're worried about getting that certain color that you're looking for we offer so many different color combinations and that color is actually put into the product when we're making our composite product\nIt's actually within it and he don't have to worry about that we need to take a break when we get back a jail has made the question for you a for for two two zero zero nine six five you're listening to in
