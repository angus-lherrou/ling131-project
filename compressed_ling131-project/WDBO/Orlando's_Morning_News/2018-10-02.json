Chris good morning to you a lot of questions about whether or not President Trump is going to make it back to Florida he's got a couple of candidates here that he has in the past uh supported and endorsed and and now one wonders if he still does\nWell I mean we're getting close to the return to the president coming back to mar a Lago it's no secret that he likes to go to New Jersey when it's a little bit too warm down in Florida it goes back to Florida when it's a little too cold New Jersey so we will we do expect him to be coming back and forth to mar a Lago but the question of will he be campaigning here in Florida\nObviously he had a campaign stop around during the primary you'll remember earlier this year down in Miami reference that he wanted\nYou know to see governor Rick Scott jump into the race to take on Bill Nelson so he he's made no secret about wanting to both get round Santa selected to be governor and getting Rick Scott elected to be the\nUh what would be I guess the junior senator from Florida um but so far we have not seen him schedule any events to come through Florida campaign for either one of those two men\nEven though this week he is on the campaign trail last night in Tennessee's got stopped coming up across the country went up to Minnesota and some other places this week so we're waiting to see if we will see him come to Florida\nObviously the White House you know the president has a finite amount of time he's got to go places that both\nThe White House and the Republicans think that he can really help and does he scheduled trip before right now we don't have that on on the schedule but you know there's a month left and if they think Florida is a kind of state that they that he can tip with a visit I think you'll see 'em come here\nWas there was ... has it been a bit of a falling out though between President Trump and run descent as\nWell to say I just told me point blank no but then when we we pressed him on will lose last time you talk to present you you didn't want to answer the question um you know but then the ... back in the matter is is that you look at the numbers and you say\nCan he helped Kenny come in here and drive the base to come out a mid term elections tend to be very much a base election so if you can drive that base to come out he he's helpful but\nYou know the campaigns are all looking at this and trying to figure out\nYou know is is he somebody that's going to help us are going to hurt us\nAnd um you know as far as we know there has not been a major falling out between Rhonda Santas and President Trump although you know the the ... camp had to do what it had to do and distance itself from the president's comments about you know how three thousand people didn't die down in Puerto Rico\nUm but Sanders camping and the Scott can't both came up pretty quickly that day and said no we have no reason to doubt the number of three thousand and\nYou know we we kind of disagree with the president and there

know one hours about I think ... what most people kind of expect an hour hour and a half depending on how many people you have on the stage\nI Want to see him worn down I Want to see in the ... like the octagon I Want to see 'em when they get tired and they start making mistakes I Want to see them make mistakes now you\nGot with with Rick Scott and Bill Nelson you've got to season politicians they know their talking points I don't see either one of them getting rattled are thrown off their game tonight I'm you know when you're going to hear the usual attack lines from both of them against the other one they've already telegraph through their commercials\nUm what they will go after the other one with you know Sarah some pigs sporting dog that kind of thing and and and then we'll all move on but I think you know you're going to see tonight definitely the issue of the environment the red tide the toxic algae brought up you're going to see\nA Scott go after Nelson for his tenure in the Senate and you know he keeps labeling him as a career politician\nUm so I think we'll see some of those usual attack lines and it'd be interesting to see kind of what you each of them seizes their vision because\n... is obviously running as listen I've I've been a senator here's my resume here's what I've done if you want me to continue doing what I've been doing for Florida send me back\nScott is somebody who is going to be going from if he if he gets elected going from being the governor which is basically a one person office\nTo being a senator which is one of one hundred and he won't even be the senior senator from Florida he'll be the junior senator behind Marco Rubio will become the senior senator from Florida\nBecause of his a longer tenure within the United States Senate and so you know that definitely changes both how he would approach it and what he would do so you know hopefully you get a bit of an idea for what they would do in the Senate where\nYou've got to work with people build coalitions and not just rely on having a simple majority to push everything through you've got to reach across the aisle and work with that other senator from\nYour state I feel like this is more about Donald Trump than it is about the two candidates in that do you want a candidate do you want to senator who is on board for the Trump agenda or do you want US Senator who was going to stop and block or the Trump agenda\nWell and I mean it's like anything else you know the ... midterms are always a referendum on the sitting president you always have this issue where if the president's popular or unpopular it's going to help or hurt you and within your state and Trump has been more popular in Florida than he has nationally\nAnd that may help Scott who was been very closely aligned with Donald Trump ran the Trump pack back back during the election and has been very close to him although he has kind of kept his distance and the last nine months\nBut yeah if it's a referendum on Trump and Trump is relatively popular in Florida at the time it helps God but if if Trump's numbers in Florida are you know forty five or lower\nIt helps Nelson so it kind of becomes a referendum on the president do you want your senator to be a check on the executive branch or do you want your center to be somebody who is you know kind of going along with the executive branch and that's something voters will decide\nNow pains me to say this but this debate will not be on your station or our station tonight\nNo no and and we've reached out to both ah the Scott and Nelson campaigns reach out to the Gillum and dissenters campaigns and and listen\nThe part of the problem you have in Florida is that our primary is so late in the year that once you finally know who your general election candidates are\nYou got less than about eight weeks before the general election you got to raise money you got to build a staff you got to that everybody's coming at you with the base and we'd love to have more of these more exposure for these candidates off script off their talking points and and trying to really flush out issues that matter but you know it's tough both campaigns both candidates and this is Republicans and Democrats\nThey always come into these things with like a long list of what they want and where they want these to base to be held and you've got to try and coordinate all of that\nWith a truncated timeline and it gets difficult but you'll listen we'll have our first one tonight will have some gubernatorial debates coming up a channel nine we've got a bunch of debates for both house races in the in the Florida House as well as we have\nYou know the er Stephanie Murphy Mike Miller debate so we've got a lot going on for races that are going to be
