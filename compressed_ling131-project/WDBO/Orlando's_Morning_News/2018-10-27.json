Florida arrested friday for allegedly mailing pipe bombs to several key Democrats and public figures this week\nI'm not the same year there's Twenty years difference in their age I Believe it was Twenty years older than ... however the two men to each other thought simply well certainly knew of each other very well in fact during the Mexican war\nBack in Eighteen forty it back in the eighties mid Eighteen forties I'm Leigh had been a captain and McClellan had worked under early on in his in his lieutenant 'em and had a lead and instruct him I have a place how it serves\nUm in order to fire on Mexican for his Mexican for vacations and in their time together we kinda gotta read McClellan I got to read on ... become sort of what has become sort of the historical criticism close which is the clothes they very\nPokey slow to move hesitant general Lee knew that full well for personal experience and also for over\nWhat happened that morning what went on\nWhat happened that morning was the battles at twelve hour that'll really went from sunup sunset 'em and much of the fighting and really the most intense fighting was in the morning um and what happened then was was a there are a couple of\nAreas on the battlefield and and\nThe battle kind of unfold close battle plan you might think of it is three punches a punch the one I\nPunched a Confederate 'em right I punched it Confederate left a punch to the Confederate and I know the Confederate Army in the nose and so those punches took place ... ... um can in sequence and so during the morning there was action in\nI'm a forty acre cornfield\nIt's on harvested and the Confederate in union push back and forth that cornfield by some accounts that changed hands twelve different times over the course of a couple of hours of just ferocious fighting there was also a kind of a\nYou know I almost call it an accidental ambush in an area called the westwood's people often called the ... massacre when there were Confederate kind of gathered in West woods and the union of wondered right past the west woods and gave the confederacy opportunities come\nPouring out of the west would adjust massacre the hum of the union army on the um the the union soldiers in that vicinity and then there was the opposite that many people have heard of in a tourist bloody lane\nWhich was the sunken road um that the Confederate for kind of hunker down in and just wave after wave of union soldiers tried to dislodge them from the sunken road too there were these\nConsecutive pieces of battle action\nThroughout the morning they were incredibly ferocious and also um oddly and consequential neither side was able to really press its advantage\nWho was Ambrose burns side and where does he fit in this story\n... ... a good question because that takes us right into this finally a kind of significant union breakthrough Andrews burn side was at the very southern part of the field and he was charged with getting twelve thousand five hundred union soldiers across the bridge it was called the robot bridge although any visitor ... recognize that now the\n... who who after many many hours just kind of incredible but four hundred and fifty stalwart Georgian soldiers who are really well dug in on the west side of Antietam Creek\nWere able to hold off or inside and his twelve thousand five hundred federal ... for three hours during the morning action but finally I'm Around noon time\nA ... a bird's eye was finally able to you know these these four hundred and fifty Georgian soldiers they were running low on ammo and they finally uh and then finally they were able to overwhelm them with this far superior force\nThe union soldiers there and cross the burn side bridge what will come to be known as the ... bridge and also for them to increase at that point and twelve thousand five hundred soldiers a lot of soldiers so once they were across the creek even though this has been a kind of piecemeal battle and nothing had really worked out his plan throughout the morning he at twelve thousand five hundred soldiers across Antietam Creek\nUm there were still the possibility at midday that had the union had things have broken right for the you know they could have ended the confederacy fight dinnertime and what happened was the union army had to climb\nA hillside uh master crushing it hit him creek to apply show on which the town of shark strict sat and if they could get there\nThey could cut off the the rebel army route across the Potomac, Maryland then to the safety of Confederate Virginia\nBut um as their climate hillside all of a sudden I'm least trusted deputy AP Hill showed up on the scene he marched Seventeen miles from purpose for that that morning had two thousand five hundred\nFresh troops fresh from the standpoint that they'd and fired a shot although they had more Seventeen miles so this is the union army got the outskirts of sharp spring and had his own print it cut off the rebel army cut off their means of of accident back into the safety of a Virginia\nEight he'll showed up poor down the hillside drove the union backed down hillsides right to the bank of Antietam Creek and at that\nPoint the sunset and the battle of Antietam ended and\nEnded as a a tactical draw I guess that's how people describe it although it would be a union victory from the standpoint that Lee the next night which would lead his army across the Potomac back into Virginia northern invasion would be over\nWhat was Abraham Lincoln during doing during the day\nOne of one of my favorite things I learned in my research with the Abraham Lincoln was fifty five miles away Washington D. C.\nBut this was a pre CNN era\nAnd so he really had no idea exactly what was going on now he knew from telegraph the ... general\nIt sent him the big battle shaping up in western Maryland so when he woke up on September seventeenth Eighteenth sixty two legos early riser by several accounts I came across he tended to rise at daybreak if he rose at all he was an insomniac so you might have just been up all night but\nThere is a pretty good chance that he um was awake\nAt the exact moment that the fighting broke out and yet throughout most of the day he would have\nNo idea he would think maybe it happened and he actually sent 'em he sent a number of telegrams to people like governor courting the Pennsylvania just trying to see if anybody had any Scott ... what was happening\nThey certainly tried to get in touch with the cloud just general but McClellan was otherwise engaged and then get back to them in a timely manner and so Lincoln is as I said it was fascinating to me he spent the day of the battle of Antietam\nUm you know thinking maybe a big battle happened in Maryland yesterday and I haven't got news yet\nMaybe it's happening right now maybe it'll happen tomorrow maybe it won't happen at all so [noise] so and and all that time he was or what what today would be an hour's drive away what a\nManager McClellan for continuing to battle the next day\nWhat prevented McClellan is I was one of the things I found most interesting in my research was just getting a sense of how\nWhat a manpower exercise civil war battle was made in modern warfare people launch missiles at least ... drone strikes they fly airplanes a civil war battle was just lines of man and in a weird way it was just brute manpower your line\nCould over well or flank another ally\nYou could beat them it was physically exhausting even the active firing a rifle fire forty shots in the day\nUm you you know you must get rather you know he would kick your [laughter] your shoulder kick black and blue you're carrying heavy weaponry a lot of people had poor shoes a lot of the men were malnourished a lot of them were feel as though that was a kind of a long way of saying\nPeople kind of it's kind of um twenty twenty hindsight where people wonder you know McClellan it's\nCertainly you know sort of had that had the slight advantage you might call it the end of of the the fighting of the September so why didn't even resume the next day well he got it took to measure his army and the toll that it cost you know just fighting\nUm those those man who weren't injured or dead um were either just exhausted hungry and some of them were\nJust kind of a panic today they are they seen such horrors today before they even a fan fought they weren't exactly I'm feeling it eat so it was it was really um you know it was it was a matter of I guess you might say attrition that ... that prevented him from um you know pursuing the battle of the following day\nWhat kind of a day to Stonewall Jackson on September seventeenth Eighteenth sixty two\nHere to do I I think I think most historians would agree that he didn't figure large and development give I mean he's such a um a hallowed a Confederate general he's known so much for his boldness\nInnovation and he really I'm just maybe because of style of the battle Adel was fought it very tight confines tight confines of a valley\nUm and he just didn't I mean I'm certainly didn't comport himself in a in a way that was it in any way a meal\nEmbarrassing or anything but it wasn't a momentum is still about Jackson's biography um you're anti them doesn't stand out with something like say the valley campaign is that is why one of the great you know I'm ... acts of of innovation and had boldness on on his part\nJustin Martin is

book called laws it's a book\nAbout bees the nature of necessity of bees so welcome store how are you\nI'm just fine thanks for having me on pet\nStore where did your interest in bees come from what triggered all that well\nI became interested in bees when I was doing graduate work down in the jungles of Central America I was studying these large rain forest trees and I wanted to understand how\nThey functioned as a population so I went out into the landscape and genetically fingerprinted all the adult trees up particularly species and from that genetic data I could see how seeds are being dispersed in the landscape I could see\nHow Poland was moving around and I knew\nThat something was moving pollen around up there out of sight way up\nIn the top of that rain forest canopy not just between neighboring trees\nBut among trees that were a mile and a half apart and because that tree was a member of the pie family with these big\nPurple flowers just like the garden peas are sweet peas in your backyard I knew that that something has to be ...\nSo I spent a fruitless couple of weeks with an entomologist friend of mine at a local field assisted who was good with across boat and we were shooting lines up into the canopy and drawing up all manner of insect traps and catching a grand total of zero be it was a total flop\nA never did figure out what species was moving all that taught around but the experience just sparked a fascination with in may for these creatures and their relationships to flowers and ah they're important to us so it's been a ... a long\nTime coming but a was a subject for a book that I was\nJust right for key parts of your book so let's get started the first one is simply called becoming be use a vegetarian wash the living by brought home

but they they gave up a that hunting habit and now they went on their own evolutionary pathway a developing long tongues for shipping nectar and developing fine\nThe branch tears for transporting pollen from flowers back to their nests a so they are really the the peace but these were ones the vegetarian a flower loving wasps\nAre among us and Thor that leads right into your second major topic of bees and flowers or special relationship and horror flowers bloom or tell us all about that\nWell sure all this evolutionary activity occurred a long time ago bees have been with us for at least one hundred and twenty million years since\nThe mid Cretaceous which is a period we usually associate with the dinosaurs but there were a lot of other things going on in that landscape including the rapid diversification of flowering plants\nSo bees learned to exploit this new resource in landscape and they really coat involved with\nThe flowers so when we look at a flower many of the traits that we just take for granted whether it's color or the smell or the shape are very much associated with\nTheir co evolution with bees in that you see a blue flower well blue is a color that is right in the middle of the bees visual spectrum and\nFlowers adopt those colors specifically to ruby use as pollinators similarly the the smells of flowers which can drift\nFor hundreds of yards or even a mile or more on the breeze you know just a few molecules of older are enough to help these track\nThat are sent and find the flower in the landscape so these beautiful odors we associate with flowers are often be related and also the shapes\nOf flowers many of the more elaborate looking flowers like peas with their wide banners and and the heels of pedals a or snap dragons or other things are that are complicated in shape our specifically adapted to lure in ... with ... with their shape and they're sent in\nTheir color and then to have the pollen in particular places on particular be use a of a particular shape so these are very finely a adapted relationships and they gave us this wonderful diversity that we see a meadow or a flower shop or what have you had also a great diversity of bees\nFor Hansen is with us he's the author of bars a fascinating book about bees and Thor we move now to be then people are what are you writing there\nWell our relationship with bees is really

Confederate sign up but now suddenly you said the position of defending homeland although many of the union soldiers to it might not expect it to be in such a decision a paycheck\nI'm a big factor was the sense that they the possibility of adventure the possibility of parole professional advancement\nI'm so some of the things that factored in you really couldn't say in a way I mean the the Confederate soldiers were certainly protecting a way of life but so very few of them were slave owners that you really couldn't say they're fighting and supporting institution of slavery they were fighting for\nThe um sovereignty or the south and also for your way of life for slavery but they weren't necessarily the fishers that and then north um because the Emancipation Proclamation issued yet I'm not a whole lot of union soldiers or really fighting with any kind of\nUm you know the intent of in the ... the institution of slavery there were a handful for Massachusetts apple Massachusetts is kind of\nThe cradle of al ... says us a Massachusetts regiment even at that point when you mention Asia ... secret document Lincoln's desk hadn't been issue yet who actually works\nFighting with a

more than that\nAnd these different so with these different varieties\nHave just slightly different taste\nWe're ... we're talking about lead cheese and you can buy them in the Chinese restaurants here and you can buy them at certain uh Asian markets and whatnot but it's sometimes you can even buy them in the grocery stores here in Florida they are very expensive and they are\nThey are primarily available in may and June and if you ever go to South Florida there's not many but there are a few small lead she grows and they sell them they they cost a lot of money but at least they're fresh and they're beautiful I Know that I went to I've gone\nOver the course of my life to several of these little farms there's some in homestead Florida there's some in Miami there's some in Fort Lauderdale there's some in Davey Florida and\nThese trees are very very huge and\nIt it into the trees you can't really climbed them because they have Finn branches and they would break and not to mention the danger of it so they they use these telescopes topic poles of sorts to cut the fruit and have it fall to the ground and ... and obtain it that way that's that's how it works\nMuch like the toll fruit trees here sometimes they're so tall here that you have to wait for them to drop and you have to get them before the squirrels do of course anyway our phone number here on the guard and rebel show is eight for for two two zero zero nine six five that's eight for for two two zero\nZero nine six five write that down any type of plant question eight for for two two zero zero nine six five\nMy website is gardener rebel dot com you can follow me on Instagram as Doug garden rebel you have to use the word the for Instagram\nAnd I post several pictures a day\nIt might be a fruit trees that might be of a landscape it might be of\nOf just a beautiful scene ... there's there's all kinds of things on on Instagram and Facebook that we put up there and they follow it seemed to really like it we get a lot of good positive results are from just hearing all of the the feedback and we appreciate that\nSo without further ado uh let me tell you what else was going on in the show\nI've got a um [noise] we you know it seems we rarely talk about\nA indoor plants so I Want to make sure that I don't neglect the indoor plant people because\nSome people just love the idea of having this life in the in the house and and I love bringing flowers and plants in the house or as well it's a great thing and it changes the whole vibration of the whole room that you have the live plants in and\nOne of the you know you know there are there are difficult to grow varieties inside and there are hard to grow varieties but the one thing I can tell you that is mandatory for these plants is light\nAnd a lot of times people will say well a ... it's it's dying it's just not doing well in a sea what where is it well it's on the other side of the room and\nThe problem is it's not near a window and then do the when that happens those plants are most likely going to suffer yes there are some fill it in ... and other plants that you know Ken I'm\nCan\nGrow in the lower light but\nThe vast majority especially anything blooming you need to have right in front of a window preferably an east window and sometimes people will say to me well you know the only problem is that's where I Need the plant that's what it that's where it looks best but look it's not going to look best for very long if it doesn't\nYeah you know if it doesn't do well so you have to to think about that\nNo one of the things that in Florida that a lot of plant people do when they're growing them inside and this is a is a wonderful method is\nThey'll bring you the plant inside and\nWhen they when they start to decline they move them back onto the shady patio to recover a little bit\nAnd so this works in many many cases so you can try that as well I have known a I had my own clients who have had\nTwo different plants jokes yeah that's right too different plants of the same variety so maybe they have a\nA A R Yucca plant that's Paul and sleek in a corner and and it's five feet tall and they love it there and then they just alternate it with a patio one and that seems to work out pretty good that way\nThe plants maintain a fresher look longer when you are alternating so I Hope that helps well let me give you the phone number one more time it's eight for for two two zero zero nine six five four for two two zero zero nine six five ... we're going to take a quick guarding rebel

established is there a damn around the plant that holds water\n[noise] there is there is actually um curb a long have you ever heard of the curve along now it's like a concrete poured concrete Kirby yes\nSo this this palm tree and all of our we have to try spends all this talk box held back they all have these ... along or formed a concrete damn for lack of a better term because all the way around it that it's got ... and ... as well\nFor the tree gets watered it if they make is water too much because of my neighbors got a New York and we have a yard but we struggle back on the irrigation here lately because [noise]\nRight I think we've got too much\nYou know the the amount of water the soil should be moist should not be soggy and it should not be drying up between watering hand though the ripple needs to be you know that's a huge huge plant\nSo you need lots of water in order to saturate that whole ripple and I want you to keep that in mind because a lotta times sprinklers\nJust sometimes it's not enough so what what would be interesting maybe you've done this already used for you to dig down and just make an assessment to make sure that you know you think that it's a lot of water but why don't you just dig down six or eight or ten inches in feel the soil and see just to double check and you may be perfectly right maybe it is\nA you know extra wet and that can be part of the problem the the first thing you should do the second thing you should do would be to go ahead\nAnd cut off any of the dying yellow brown or broken fronds just kept them back to the next thing you should do and you you're running out of time because of the season\nAnd that would be too I Would have you spraying the foliage with a liquid iron fist go to any garden center and you can buy liquid iron and a little bottom where you could buy a gallon jug\nYou might want to call for sometimes people only have it in stock in the spring you might be a little bit on the Internet if you can't find it locally\nCandy you dilute liquid iron into you can diluted like in a five gallon buckets\nAnd followed the directions and slowly poor that on the roots you can also dilute it into a hose in sprayer since spring and onto the foliage and I would recommend that you do both I think that would help you already said you were doing epsom salts is that correct [noise]\nI tell every

have a couple of calls when squeezed them in but um and then I've got to give you the general purpose indoor plant food\nTonic so let's get started here and not much time Justin what's happening to the grass\nWas so uh what my house about four months ago and the grass was lush green it look great um and then as it we got a little drier whether I realized that the sprinkler issue so I went ahead I recall it reached a slide your sprinklers everything\nGot it all work and great and a\nMajor my lower blade and everything are just starting to develop a round patches here and there all the overwhelming amount of dollars to eat out of nowhere and then on top of that I'm dealing with it looks like the elites are splitting and they're developing a yellow spots so of course where they split it looked like there are a yellow as\nWell it it's it was nice saying oh this feel like everything else dried up within\nYou have a couple of issues let me tell you how they're they're both issues are bad let's start with the the the splitting of the grass a number one first uh sharpen your blades I just had my\nA sharpened though I just got my lower back from the shop last night and that makes a very important in a statement to have a good short bleed or because the jagged edges that's an insurance for insects and diseases or I think that\nYou have what I Am seeing out there which has been epidemic this year and that is some fungal spawning I Would immediately get granular fungicides on that lawn\nTo arrest they send it to at least slow it down a now the the what you call it the dollar we'd that you mentioned this is a real serious we'd get so I I considered one of the three worst weeds probably number three torpedo grass is the ultimate worse\nAnd the reason is because it's very hard to kill a lot of teachers will kill it back but there's always some live and then it starts to come back again so\nYou are it believe me this was from decades of experience you are much better off by doing a complete kill on that I don't care if the spot is um six inches by six inches or six feet by six feet you need to do a complete kill with a weed killer\nBecause if you don't\nYou're then going to have a higher percentage of ... of the dollar we'd come back and you'll never get rid of it so\nYou maybe you want to give me ... I Know I noticed\nI noticed like small spots let now it's just become an overwhelming in one area and I don't know how it spreads out by cutting it um splitting that are making any\nIt spreads out All right ... ... it's a network of underground roots\nAnd and that's how it spreads it has nothing to do with you cutting it so you've got to get a weed killer on their while we still have some heat that's that's really important so I'm good luck with that it's you got a couple of major problems there oh let's talk to Lee real quickly not much time\nI've got this uh I listen to your show that I've got\nIs leading my backyard is about a dollar wheat growing a little bit under my tree\nIt's it's small lakes but then it just over takes all the uh saint August I've had my yard man trying to kill it at all as we can do is we can't we kill I've tried southern along killer or whatever on it every I dug it up and every year it comes back\nTake a ... threat that or do I do about that\n... why does he say you can't do a complete weed killer\nDirectly onto that as he says it'll kill out all the grass\nOh okay so it's it's um [noise]\nWell look I mean I I don't know what other choice you have if if it's if it's so thick that it's invading the grass you you literally don't have any grass anyway you know so uh if that were mine\nAnd there was a bigger I Would do a complete killed I just think about starting a new because you've tried these different things and it's not happening and it's not not dying back\nAnd and so that may be your only choice left is just to do you know we got us how big it is we're killing killing on and just start new\nBut you would you do this killing other people see that it's brown and they think that it's dead and you could you need to pick up some of the roots in many different spots to make sure that the roots are completely dead and you'll know it will be obvious if there's some white roots in some life to the roots\nThen it's not then it's just a matter before it comes back so\nThat's uh that's my recommendation\nOkay 'cause yeah I tried that I've tried pulling it out so I I just kill it\nAt all of that yeah don't don't comes back every year you\nKnow don't putts around with this in in ... years of of your life and just bite the bullet and if you it because it's expensive to do if it's a big section you know you could do it section by section as you can do what you could do it on the weekends or something so there's always ways to approach it incrementally\nTo save time and money and energy and all of that\nThank you for calling so

Monday we'll be the first court appearance for Cesar\n... the man accused of mailing those package bombs to democratic supporters and others this week while the investigation into the packages themselves goes on ABC senior justice correspondent peer Thomas has the latest\nSo still a lot of investigative work to be done they still want to know where these bombs were actually produced they're still concerned that bombs could be still in the system or in the mail system flowing out there still and also you have to look to see if there's any possibility of anyone supporting the suspect that's the concern is well\nOne of the things that they talked about in Milwaukee is their commitment to that if you ever have a problem with one of their tools turnaround time they paid a habit overnight it to him they overnight it back you'll have it back within five days\nMaximum five days from the time they use and that that's counting the ... the delivery time and uh getting returned back to your home yeah five business day by business yeah yeah yeah a\nTouring the plant and going up there it was my second year up there and it's pretty unbelievable the things that they've accomplished in the innovation that they've put behind their tools\nAnd really when you think about it but um you know there are motto is heavy duty and everything is heavy duty and that actually we can take advantage of that as consumers pros tumors do it yourself first weekend warriors\nYeah you know if you if you call it into the show and you said hey guys I've I've got a very small project that live in a condo and I'm never going to do another one again we would recommend something you know a tool that\nMy last one or two years and it's cheaper save you some money\nBut if you're a weekend warrior and you just bought a place and you're gonna do projects on a continual basis than the level of quality that Milwaukee puts behind their tools is pretty amazing because it's built for the trade so yeah you know it's like when you buy a a you know a heavy duty version of a truck\nYou're you're getting what was designed to do more work you know larger transmission largest suspension larger motor things like that you're getting that equivalent in a tool which promotes longevity and also gets the job done faster\nAnd one of the things you can think about is that you can hand that tool down to your your kids in in years to come or when you're done using anything you don't want it or you can pass it on it and it's still going to be a usable project a\nIn a in a lot of what we saw up there you know um has released states throughout the year because it's their annual new product symposium so\nA lot of the things we saw all available this fall maybe even into December and stuff like that\nOne of the things that caught my eye that was launched in made you could actually go and get for dad this weekend at your local big box store is that they make a fifty two inch mobile workstation it is awesome I Can't tell you I Can't say enough good about it it is\nA you know it's dad's workshop on steroids you bring it into the garage you set it up all of his tools or they're they're organized you can lock the doors to keep things secure it is heavy duty\nThe way that they they build the tools in their hand tools to\nTheir where do you call it or ... yeah ... where they fit your hands better they give you a better grip or they think about how you hang up and where are you hang 'em and and how to keep them organized and that's what they are I've never seen the quality of tool\nOr even close to his comparable is Milwaukee I'm I'm a excited about getting some of those myself for Father's Day [laughter]\nIf anyone's listening out there that's related to Ken please go hadn't had on it and pick up some Milwaukee stuff\nUm but in keeping up with Father's Day there is a there is another product that I wanted to talk about because I've had\nThe benefit of of using it for a couple of weeks now are actually maybe win over a month now six weeks um it's ah Honeywell sent me a thermostat it's called the the lyric T five why five thermostat and they sent it to me to test it and use it and I'm a project house remodeled that we did\nAnd the way it works is that it connects just like a normal thermostat would I it's very do it yourself in terms of set up I found and it's also apple home kit and Amazon Echo enabled\nAnd one of the big benefits that I saw this thermostat aside from the scheduling and programming to save money was the geo fencing and so the way that this thing works and this is\nIt's a great gift I think for any dad because you the whole family is going to reap the benefits when you put the app on your phone the GPS in your phone will tell and communicate to the thermostat where you are located in relation to the home so when you go to work\nIf you sent the geo fence up\nCorrectly if you need to come home early for any reason\nAnd you set your thermostat up to say eighty two or eighty three during the day as soon as the tax that you've broken the barrier it will immediately start cooling home Mm So if you put a cap on your kids phones\nThey got out of school early they break the barrier the AC will turn on so that when they get home it's comfortable I Know a lot of people that I talk to you\nThey buy thermostats that are programmable so they can do a schedule\nThey use the schedule but then they stopped using it because they go well something happened I had to come home early or it's summer the kids are out of school I Can't use the schedule you know the the babysitter or bring some home earlier and then they come home and they complain because the house so hot\nIs an awesome technology I Can't say enough good things about it and it's a gift that you could get dad that's under a hundred and fifty dollars so I highly recommend taking a look at it it's the Honeywell lyric T five why five thermostat\nSounds

style there but I don't often ... water dumped on to the pool deck right so I'm Wondering about the possibility of a French well under the down style and whether or not that would\nDo any damage to the concrete supporter of the house or the base of the house\nWell actually the fix for that is the what's happening is when it rains really hard the water's coming off your roof\nOr so quickly and then they have to put the super gutter lower than a than the drip edge of the roof so it catches the water the problem is when it's coming really fast\nIt comes over the top and it's not giving away

motivated one's going now he\nIs he's got a hot rod Lincoln ask about hot rod Lincoln today and I don't know about that 'cause all all they do vehicles are going to force them to have to go to a more education I understand why that because\nYou know you gotta get rid of your mom a van soccer band kind of deal good across or whatever it is but my best friend caused by going out there and he's like me he likes old school stuff he's got to be nice Nineteen Ninety eight and say well he he's got to come here are sixty twenty eight God was how you doing man\nOn the Ninety four now it looks almost brand new dude you know it's just in the garage most of the time when I'm On the road oh they won't let you bring that on tour with you [laughter] wouldn't how do how do you do go to how they're doing really\nReally really well and then I got to try to tell your last week but I was right in the middle of the the allied eat equipment show that we had another Los Vegas and the phone call last week in on the home and I wanted to call you guys and say Hi and see how things are going\nWell how did you say you did a week of Google die than you did the lighting shows what tell me what what is it what did you learn what did you see new in the I guess the are very close quarters of what you do in your business lighting wise\n[noise] well I think you know for a while there you would see little equipment that will come up by leaps and bounds you know a more automated technology is moving like\nA it's kind of settled down a few years ago I think like we even my own Eli ... actually are getting better mainly in the ... the ability to be right the light and especially when you're being a certain distance that well that was a problem but you see that a lot more now\nI'm the one thing I did see they had won like ... it's called the profile light you know like a like a spotlight but it's an automated like it goes up and the trust and it was it was probably one of the brightest flights will decide that either the\nUm and that's a and that's what's that's kind of what you see this better everything pretty much stayed the same they just get brighter and smaller\nSo you're talking about shooting beam how far can you shoot a beam of light what do you what are you a quick question what do you try to uh what are they trying to accomplish as far as distancing quality that like distance wise\n[noise] well I mean you've you've got the two environments you've got an indoor show like in an arena right and then you've got like stadium shows and then when you you know the the search like you know 'cause they had in the world war two right or you know those have been around forever those lights\nObviously very huge him and I saw those sorts of light a is very very bright but what they've done now is you can have a bowl that's right I mean we have these life they're called sharp breeze and there are the beam is probably the ... the face of the ... being was probably around five six inches across but I mean it'll shoot up and you can head clouds in the sky\nIs probably see that wow that's pretty pretty amazing wow\nBecause in the end or obviously things are controlled outside you're having to deal with atmospheric conditions correct do you\nAre you know and you you like you want to see it especially in a state of you don't want to be able to really shoot\nOutside the stadium up the sky\nAnd that gives it obviously makes the show look that much bigger and then like you said what the atmosphere there's always a bit of a have in the air it's like we used to be late spring or you can always do that later because of that a little bit of you know water molecules when we're so that's kind of like the lights are becoming like lasers they'll just just not right but bigger beamed\nSo what about like if you went to red rock and and let that place up because we already know it has an amazing acoustical sound well that'd be a little different because you're so high and altitude\nUm they're not no really I mean as long as less moisture so the bill I wouldn't be as readily a red you know by the he died but you know that's all we have have smokers used\nTo live here you're creating artificial atmosphere is what you're doing yeah so what's coming up for the month of November\n[laughter] well I actually saw down from Monterrey, Mexico on the uh next week for a there was a big festival a classic it's called omega rock show and it's a\nIt's a festival that guns ... roses is headlining and and the white snake is is opening up the the the support I just like Ken bands that day but why did they give the band directly before the roses so who they kind of wanted to hire a big gun to come in and be a lot of the joke without me\nShow you gonna do all those shows\nUm just no just one show that the one big festival guns ... roses is doing this tour they're starting in the\nIn ... in Monterey and then they had I think too or are they doing a show at South Africa I think Dubai they're going to India I mean that's a crazy as well I'm kind of guy and I'm going out on it because it's more so a lot of travel with low they often than to just it's just a lot of hard work I mean it's fun traveling like that but it's a I like the big\nHere's a here's a question where where's Monterrey in relationship to where the hurricane came through week or so ago last week\n[noise] um it's um it's and that's not close I think it was not a ... it just sounds a Texas or not the not too far down to Texas\n[laughter] okay so you should be okay though but weather wise\nYeah everything was fine you know otherwise you should be\nFine you're on the ... that's on the coast is that correct Monterey is actually going to die you\nKnow it's not on the coast is clear there is a further inland further inland just these thousands of Brownsville you know what further inland\nAre you so you'll fly directly from obviously an airport here in the United states directly\nIn the house on ... so I'm sure I'll go Atlanta to ah Monterey yeah we do a show on the third on back home on the force them to my next for a under a rock and roll out of that will be a joke Perry tour and we'd start up and the cultural center of the universe and the Sioux City Iowa\nOn ah wow around there think December for her so while\nWe're we're doing this little
