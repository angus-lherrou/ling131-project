beach there it is a channel nine eye witness news reporter Steve Barrett\nI I think have you not just as a reporter but as a stunt man as a I'm a I'm a man who doesn't shy away from danger but I I have one key question for you I watched your live reporting yesterday and I have never been so scared watching report in my life\nWas that the scariest was that this is the most scared of every man for an assignment\nMorning Joe and I think that I think it was I think it was this um I've been my first hurricane was Andrew\nThis was as bad and I hate to say this this is going to be possibly worse this is just destruction like\nI haven't seen since Andrew I I was in the train that was a mostly of flooding thing and excuse is a this Black Hawk going over the enemy now but um\nThis is uh some of the worst destruction that that I've ever seen and it it absolutely compares with Andrew I'm the images you're going to see over the next day a few days are just going to blow your mind um are are such a you know where we were I mean all we had to do was walk outside the building that we were in\nAnd we were suddenly just faced with just absolute devastation right there at at the shore\nAnd you know it's it's one of those things that video just doesn't do it justice it's like when you've seen pictures of the Grand Canyon it's not near as impressive as standing at the precipice of the Grand Canyon\nAnd and I would imagine that for those of us watching video it it costs won't have the impact as to the experience of being there as you are and what your eyes are are seeing and and the disbelief that is certainly clicking in your mind of how can something like this happen\nAnd Joe you that's absolutely right you watch this on TV and I remember this from the train I remember being there\nAnd I didn't get to see TV 'cause I'm completely cut off from the world we all are right now we don't have lights we don't have power there is no water there is no way to drive there is it night is pitch black I mean a pitch black like you don't understand like you're standing out in the middle of the woods and yet you're in your hotel parking lot or your at your house standing in your front yard\nAnd then when you go back after Katrina when I went back to watch it on television I says well that's not what it looks like that's not it that doesn't even come close to\nBeing what it's actually like to be there so seeing it with your own eyes and being here and experiencing it with the people it's something very very different and\nI'll tell you you know we ... central Florida probably only understands this maybe maybe by Charlie and Charlie would be like one twenty it's up the scale of what's happening here and that may be an understatement right there because\nThere's so much every block is just destroyed everywhere you go every power lines down the trees are just wiped out there are a trains that of toppled over I saw a bus city bus that it rolled down the street yesterday\nAnd I know that that those of us here in the newsroom both radio and TV I have big hugs waiting for you in ... when you guys get back\nOr because of what a harrowing experience that must have been and for for ... but you get to come back\nYou get to go home and get a warm shower and and cook and have a nice home to live in and and your pets in your family everybody else the people you're leaving behind their have lost everything\nThey have it and for example I have no problem with this I lost my hotel room this morning I don't have a hotel room here and the manager of the hotel
