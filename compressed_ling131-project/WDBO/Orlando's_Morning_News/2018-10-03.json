well I appreciate your getting up a little bit earlier and joining us Chris\nUm I didn't get to watch the entire debate but I have watched the clip\nAnd a Governor Scott and Senator Bill Nelson sticking to their you know the campaign slogans one calling the other a liar a Scott calling Nelson a do nothing guy up that they did get into some really interesting conversation specifically on immigration gun control a health care where where do you want to start\nI mean we we've seen I mean Scott campaign who is it going for about six months now and um we kind of go where his attacks are coming from his use telegraph a lot of those\nYou know through his attack ad that have been out there no since campaign has responded and also on the offensive in a couple of places so we've seen really where he's going to go out and\nYou know what we saw with health you know what you look at it as you say well what is what is going to be important for Florida and where did both candidates fall on these issues obviously Scott going ... for the expansion of the federal reach of health care of the Obama years old and then you know a whole you know you you were for\nMedicaid expansion then you were against it and all of a sudden you're more pro health care you know nobody knows where you stand it seems like you'll say anything get elected every number year we've seen some of these bombs but last night these two really flushed out you know standing next to each other on the stage\nAnd Chris they both blamed each other for the algae blooms and the red tide right they kind of pointing the finger at each other over the environments\nWell Scott has been going after the Army Corps of engineers and saying you know to the federal government's responsibility to take care of his views of the bill Nelson because you work with the federal government for the federal government\nThis is your responsibility and Nelson turning around saying wait\nYou're the one who has got to apartment of environmental protection in Florida you want to hold back septic tank regulations has looked the other way as water districts have been gutted across the state so both have um some fertile ground cue point the finger at each other on this issue to get these are the things we've seen them telegraph\nThrough their political ads\nOver the last couple of months so it's kind of like well we're down say to each other what they've been saying in their attack ads for the last about six months\nAnd before I let you go Chris Heath did did we learn anything new did either the candidates come out on top of this that's really what I Want to know\n[noise] no I mean let's let's be honest here you know Rick Scott his his is restrained has never been\nHis uh his ability to debate or he's never been a strong debater has never been to especially strong public speaker well Nelson by the same token has never been somebody with the Democratic party and we're guarded and somebody's going to go out there fire up a crowd and it was really somebody who's a great order so would you have these two guys on the fish they're both seasoned\nPoliticians they both know what they're talking about but they neither one of them is somebody who's going to light the stage on fire so what you saw I think yesterday in this kind of weird segmented debate where we we had the debate in the morning and we read about it all day and we finally got to see it in the afternoon or in the late evening I'm was\nWas two guys who know what they're talking about but at the same time they're not super exciting to watch them say to each other or say it in general I'm\n... and and so what we really got out of last night was you know they they just finally said to each other what their campaign ads have been saying for the last six months that really kind of setting the tone for the last forty days of this campaign where it's going to be more of the same we're going to see these guys going after each other with these same\nAttack at the same basic was Scott saying ... used in ... always talk about\nAnd males and saying stop the liar he's somebody who's gonna flip flopping say one thing to get elected and then go
