caught and to the fact of him talking too much about being Marilyn rose first husband so he was kind of low keep at it I mean he did give interviews you see them top every once in a while he lived into old age\nAnd I'm you know he he he gave a lot of and then he wrote a book of course most people who knew or did so um yeah he did but he also had a very average life yeah I think he had some of our daughters and I'm a long term marriage and worked in uh Los Angeles as a as a cop\nCharles what was the big break for Marilyn now that ... that are into stardom\n[noise] actually she was for for a few years she was on the fringes of a Hollywood geo doing ... parts and just seeing the typical struggling actress and she met 'em an agent or a very big agent at the William ... agency which was the top agency still to this\nDay you know uh and they would ah his name was Johnny hide and he handles all the big actresses of the day or Rita Hayworth lotto Turner\nAnd he saw Marilyn Monroe across the room um and it was like lightning struck him for the first time in his life he went over to her and he said I see\nA hundred girls a month wanting to be actresses and I represent Rita Hayworth a lotta Turner and all the big ones and none of them have with us and she was skeptical because she at that point she had been seen by all the top studios and rejected signed for six months and then ... are they let her ... contract lapse\nHe saw something in her and that's really what most people in the arts anything you know a lot of the big ones don't have a lot of self confidence Marilyn was one of those people so she needed someone to believe in her who had the power to help her and that's what this agent did for her it was a huge break for was around Nineteen fifty\nAnd what happened and how did it play out\nHe got her two very important roles which were turning point for her one was and it was called all about eve\nAnd they start Bette Davis was the star in Maryland head of a big part but it was a good part where she was allowed to shine with some of the big the big players in the end of the day was the last home Bette Davis and back staring Marilyn had two big scenes where she really stood out\nAnd then he got our another film called the asphalt jungles fill new are where again she had a few scenes but people walked out of the theater it was a very exciting climbed caper but they walked out at a theater saying who's that blonde\nAnd Charles this was all without any training or any background or any real practice is that right\nReal training was she talked about this when she was seven and eight and in foster care and her foster parents work they would drop her off at Guam is Chinese theater to watch films all day that was like her care keep our caretaker so she learned\nShe did eventually go on to study acting but her her first training was watching the grapes that came before she was a huge gene Harlow fan first platinum blonde and the Nineteen thirties\nAnd um she loved clothes that called there and people like that and she would she would watch those films over and over again and then and lonely existence or lonely world she would act at night in front of the mirror she'd replay those scenes over and over again and that was really a first string and\nSo what happened after these two films or Nineteen fifty what was next\nWell\nI think that the newspaper people started to discover are she was very good at um cheesecake photo type things pent up photos\nAnd the studios which had been ignoring her up until Nineteen fifty in the late forties and everything they wanted nothing to do with her because her anymore they started to see that she was getting a lot of attention she was very good in our interview she was very canny about her self image how to present herself\nSo they started having to give her bigger roles and each time they gave her a bigger role\nThe the public um\nTheir fascination and their hunger for more of her so it's it's interesting because when you see some of those earlier roles where she had not heard rules were not the star\nYou could see that on the poster for the film they started putting her ... her name above everyone else has and it was her photo like if she was in a film with Cary Grant or I'm ginger Rogers or something like that who they were the stories but Marilyn was the one who was getting all the publicity ...\nWas there one film that really did it for\nI think the one that put her over was it's a film called Niagara ... it's not as well known as some of the other ones but it was a first color film\nAnd um it's a Nineteen fifty three film and it's it's really present it for the first time the image that we know of her today\nThe porcelain skin the tussle the blonde hair the ruby shining the bread laps in the beauty mark and ... the soul train it was all in that film and then after that she explode it all over the place I mean there was no denying that she was a huge star and that's what led her to getting\nGentleman prefer blondes which was her career defining moment\nThat movie come about\n[noise] you know it's interesting because general prefer blondes had been a book and then it was a huge at the time Broadway or hit with a Carol Channing\nAnd the studio twenty Century Fox that was Marilyn studio at the time originally bought the film for Betty grave all supposed to be a very brave also but when Marilyn after she had done on those the early Nineteen fifty films in her popularity is growing and growing and then after\n... um I don't think there was any denying that you know Marilyn Monroe was now the current blonde the film was gentlemen prefer blondes and Marilyn was the biggest blind now at this point that Hollywood had seen so they nix the ideas of I'm putting a bet a grave all in it and they started Maryland\nWho are the men in her life but this time when she dating seriously\nYes the man a when her Chris started to take off the man that stepped in who became very close to her and remain close for the rest of her life was Joe DiMaggio\nUh this is where Joe came along\nYes ah early Nineteen fifties like he they they met and like fifty to fifty one or fifty eight fifty one early fifty two he had seen of a photo of her I'm playing it was a publicity photos of her play baseball\nAnd he was from the first of all that he saw like so many people uh became very taken with her and uh there was someone a mutual friend arranged a blind date and he's really the one DiMaggio really is the one if you have to look to someone\nIn her life you know the candle in the window was looking for someone to cling to one of the rings and he was the one even after their relationship ended and she had remarried and all that guy so she always went back to him up until the end\n[noise] wonder why that was\n[noise] he never used her he never wanted anything from her he really did he look he wasn't a perfect guy we won't go into that Joe DiMaggio as his only books but he was\nHe was a decent man he he truly love term I'm not because of her fame I spy for him in spite of her ... he didn't want her to have a career and that was really the\nThe the sword between them that you know she wanted a career he didn't want that for her he wanted to or to just be his wife [noise]\nUm but hey whatever trouble she was saying I'm In the coming years she would be a lot or he would always go and a rescue her it was like her Knight in shining armor and he he was the one up until the very ... up until the very end he claimed her body from the morgue when no one else did\nWhat about the marriage to Arthur Miller\n[noise] I think that's an unfortunate marriage I'm like you know as an outsider looking in and with all everything we know in hindsight I'm they fell in love with aspects of each other um they I don't think either one of them love the whole person and that's not\nA good thing to go into a relationship Arthur Miller was going through a midlife crisis he had been married for many years at a scale marriage Marilyn was just coming out of her Joe DiMaggio relationship she was considered at this point to joke in Hollywood\nBecause she played the dumb blonde so they saw her as the dumb blonde\nAnd um she was trying to be taken seriously so she fell in love with his intellect\nAnd again his uh his uh he was an older guy someone who could be a father that father that she was always looking for\n'em and so ah they started this relationship and I think that after the marriage they started to find out things about each other that they get like like for instance he\nDidn't like the idea that she was a lady with a past in his opinion like um she had been with other men she had been in certain to a certain degree a victim of the casting couch and he could never get over that\nI'm about her and she started to find that he was very condescending towards her he was embarrassed of her in front of his intellectual for as New York intellectual friends uh she made a go of it um it didn't last and um I feel that he ended up using our he he ... after she died he wrote a poisonous play about her\nAnd he continued to to use her in his um plays in his uh theater works\nTell me about that famous scene in New York with her skirt blowing up and Joe DiMaggio going completely bonkers right doing what what what are you right about that\nWell that was really the moment that um\nI think they both realized that their marriage was going to be over because it was the two different worlds\nYou know coming together have the conservative or Italian American guy who wanted the traditional housewife and her of being the the world sex goddess and the ... the scene of her the famous scene that Marilyn Monroe moment we call today when she's standing over a subway grading at her skirt blows up\nA was filmed in front of a real New York city crowd they were lined up for four hours before they started filming that so there was a huge mob watching her film it so you know don't forget this is back in the mid fifties conservatives America and Joe DiMaggio was watching the scene be filmed in front of all these\nScreaming men whistling man howling man and bears Marilyn Monroe and between every take her skirt blowing up and her patties showing for the world to say it was it was very mortified for have\nIs news Ninety

here\nHis book why to kill a mocking bird matters [noise] I've been looking forward to and visit Tom thanks for joining me how are you [noise]\nWell thanks very much for having me on\nThe book is called Hawaii to kill a mocking bird matters what Harper Lee's book in the iconic American film mean to us today\nUh I guess the opening question should be Tom oh why did kill a mocking bird matters why does it matter\n[noise] well I think because it's such a distinctly American story that resonates around the world and the reason why is because it [noise] ah I say it explains America to all of us who are Americans and it deals with\nWhat I call our original national send ups of the legacy of slavery and it also and this is what I think is so important is universal in showing us what it's like to go through those tough waters of adolescence and become an adult so I think it works on multiple levels at one time\nOr this book and I I guess from the movie it's it's opening on Broadway there's fall on my right tell me about that\nYes it's going to open on Broadway in December in a [noise]\nA new adaptation written by Aaron Sorkin who wrote the west wing on TV [noise] so uh I think it's going to be really interesting kind of different take on the story I Know that the children are going to be played by adults so right off the bat it's going to be different\nDo you think it'll do well I think it'll do really well I Know there's a I mean New York and there's already a huge amount of interest in this Broadway adaptation\nYou open your book with a chapter called Monroeville, Alabama oh what's that about\nWell it's about Harper Lee's small home town that was is clearly the model for the tone up may come in a book and the movie and it's our Harper Lee she was so uh so much a part of our hometown Monroeville and it\nKept the house there for her entire life and yet she also had to break out of Monroeville at the same type she she had to come to New York I I say she wrote her way out of her home town\nAnd then you move to the second topic and it's simply called Manhattan to explain that\nWell it's that Harper Lee came to New York she because uh you know New York is a a couple of things uh it's the center of the publishing industry in New York in the United states and it's also I call it the capital of\nSelf reinvention and you know we Americans all reinvent ourselves so she had to come here to expand her world and to write to kill a Mockingbird\nAnd is that lead to the third topic publication or Phyllis in\nWell you know she came to New York and was having a she was having to work day job she was a reservation clerk for an airline and uh she was having you know a very tough time getting the the time to right here in New York\nAnd then friends of hers who she was spending Christmas with said go to the Christmas tree [noise] there's a novel up for you and she opened the envelope and it was a check and it said here's money to support you for one year well you write your book\nMy goodness yeah so this book this book was inherited did she realizes or that it was good to be an absolutely sensational book did she did you have that feeling\nNo she really didn't at all and she she said that at the time when it was published which was in Nineteen sixty\nHope was that may be the book which self three thousand copies [laughter] you know just enough that they would publish it another book by her so she thought maybe it would sell three thousand copies and now here we are fifty eight years later and it's still sells seven hundred fifty thousand copies every year\nWhy do you think is Tom why did it in such a such a nerve [laughter]\nWell I think it's first of all it's easy for people to forget it is so beautifully written you know the language is so pitch perfect in the book so I think people respond to that you feel like you're in the south in the Nineteen thirties and I think people also responded\nTo the character of Atticus Finch because he's\nI call him an aspirational figure he is the American we all would like to be or hope we contain within ourselves so that's male or female the person that stands up and does the right thing and the crowd kept intimidate and that's enormously appealing we want to think we could be advocates\nSo we've covered Monroeville, Alabama Manhattan publication and then you write what price Hollywood question mark uh what's that about\nWell that's about the fact that this is a very very rare case where the you have a brilliant book that won the Pulitzer Prize that it's turned into and\nQuickly first rate film it happens so rarely and uh it was a\nYou know the the book the rights were sold not necessarily to the biggest bit but to the right filmmakers and that was a\nAllan Poe cooler or the producer who went on to become a big direct or self of all the President's Men and Robert mugging the director so they they sold it to the right people who made this really it's actually a beautiful film and it holds up so well today not just Gregory Peck performance but the whole look of the film\nTell me your addict has joined film\nWell it's that you know a a Gregory Peck this was his career defining role it's how everybody pictures Atticus Finch when they're reading the book they picked her Gregory pack and a ... it's a case of it was the right person playing the role

York City wide or kill a mocking bird matters that's the name of his\nTerm I must ask you about ... set of Watchmen what would we know about the history of that report\nWell do you eat you know it's a it's certainly very controversial because here this book appeared fifty years after a more than fifty years after to kill a Mockingbird and what I think the best description of it is Harper Lee herself called it she said it's the heritage\nOf to kill a mocking bird because go set a watchman she wrote first it was just a first draft and the editor in New York said to her\n[noise] you know what the part that's really good and really interesting is everything's set in childhood when scout is a little girl that's what you should concentrate on and cut out everything from the Nineteen fifties go back to the Nineteen thirties when she's still a little girl and so that\nThat was how a a go set a watchman really influenced to kill a mocking bird and but of course it was enormously controversial when\nWatchman came out because people said she's just hurt but we know this book is being published is she still cognizant and then everybody was upset 'cause any go set a watchman addict is there's a little bit of a racist so it that's why it was enormously controversial but of course it's sold enormously well\nIs that book still selling will do set a watchman\nYes yes it is I mean it will never of course equal the sales of mocking bird and uh but it was the number one selling book of the year when it came out two years ago or more than any other book and I think\nThat the fascinating because people tell me all the time you know you asked me all the time should I read it I don't want my memory spoiled and the thing is\nIt's a ... it's just not as good a book is mocking bird it wasn't edited it the the ... the beauty of ... which is not there that's really my analysis of it\nTowards the end of your book you write a chapter called theme and variations everything old is new again what are you right there Tom what's that mean\nWill it means that ... in a way we've um [noise] when to kill a mocking bird\nIt came out it was the right book at the right time because it was just when the civil rights movement was starting in this country and the civil rights movement in many ways was centered in Alabama with\nThe bus boycott and so it it does I guys you know if it was a it spoke to America's then and then when go set a watchman came out a fifty six years later there was at\nOnce again enormous so racial controversy at first she in the country you know there was a controversy about the Confederate flag flying over the state house in South Carolina there had been a shooting of a number of African American males and so what I was saying everything old is new again is that\nWe're still grappling with the same issues and and of course we've made enormous progress because ... Mockingbird was published the idea of an African American\nPresident would have been on single and by the time you know go watch them and came out\nObama had been our president so I think even though we still have so many so many issues to grapple with we have made progress and the humanity of heart mocking bird it's why I think it's still resonates for us today because it gives us hope\nYou close the book when a chapter called at peace or what are you right there\nWell it's about the fact that the key players in mocking bird by the end of their lives made\nReal peace with who they were a individually and as Americans and by those main players I mean Gregory Peck and a ... foot\nAnd particularly and that's it that mocking bird head informed their lives in so many ways that they wouldn't have been able to anticipate at the time\nAnd that it really if they changed the conversation in our country about race and I think that's it I'm In a normal ... to see\nAnd I speak to the the greatness of the of the book\nOur guest has been Tom Sandra ... y to kill a mocking bird matters thanks for joining us this weekend folks were back for more next weekend on the path Williams weekend our it's news Ninety six five in Orlando I have a great weekend\n[noise] when you can't listen to news magazines boy five W db you on the radio and hear it everywhere you go when you download the news many point five after\nAndroid devices I don't have to be at home to hear what's going on expense even break and you know\nThis is we're Orlando turned bird for breaking news weather and traffic news magazines point five to ...\nIf you own a gun you have a full time responsibility\nWhen you weren't using is sure can't do it into the hands of curious children\nOr anyone else might misuse\nMore information on firearms orange safety presidents the PC you do business in bronze you by the national crime prevention council of your own justices who served\n\nAs news maybe six point by having your baby oh we'll turn first for breaking news\nIt's quite amazing and ... and and all that so and in fact they have a they have a night historical I'm\nKind of a tour coming out one evening and the next few weeks so if you want to or go to that it's a it's an Leesburg, Florida the loan Oak Cemetery and they tell you all about the original Leesburg families and that sounds very very interesting\nWell anyway they approached me about it and they they do some evidence there\nFor various reasons I I I imagine all different types of events\nAnd in this one particular newer section and they they wanted to have like this background an island of sorts and so they said Vince we've come up with this idea that we want to know what you think about it\nWell the idea was to take and create a raised island did\nMade out of these very elongated a cross ties and it will be quite geometric and all and my ... angular because you know they're square and and that sort of thing and then they wanted to have signs in the background\nSo my initial instinct is I'm hearing the beginning of this is boy this is a this is so not me frankly I I like curves in free form and all of this however\nThe more I talked to more they talked the more I saw that the the gentleman who was who was who's been taken care of the cemetery he really put a lot of fun and to it so they they took me out to the spot\nAnd lo and behold I Love their idea and I thought their idea made sense I thought it was creative and and basically what it was was\nThese like a long cylinder oh let's go lay along um rectangular a section and then there's\nThen there's a few jobs in it and then another section and that sort of thing and very geometric rate and do what they did a beautiful way is they put tremendous is in the form of fences in the back this is kind of a country setting and\nBut they did individual trailer says so there was a trailers and then there's a space and then another trailers but a different shape in other words it was wider and then it space and then another narrow travel is like that kind of alternate\nAnd so I said you know what I'm hearing on this I like this and I and I thought actually the idea was very done if it was\nVery well done if it if you could just be put together well I showed up and do not only was put together it was like you're hired the top professional to do it it was just so done to perfection the way they\nThey were so careful in their measurements and it was very impressive and I was really excited about it so we did is we decided on ... ... Confederate Jasmine on the trail is is in the back\nAnd what they're going to do\nAnd I have no doubt is there these will grow up quickly and they'll cover that trailers and instead of leaving the vines like most people do kind of Lucy goosey on the\nOn the trail is is they're going to keep them slipped in a more formal way\nWhich is a little more work but\nIt fits in with the design with the ... look back and they're different heights and different levels and spaced and different widths and I think it's going to be really magnificent and in the interest of time instead of using these little tiny puny one gallon signs\nThat everyone loves to use I use seven gallons size Confederate judgments so they're already begun woolly and and ready to climbing\nAnd then as they do they're going to take the little twist them says I recommended anti the brothers to the fencing and it's going to be quite nice and then we there's a video on Instagram you could actually go see it\nAnd there's a few cut to videos and I put at least a couple of pictures as well and I'll probably put more later on so I I think we added a lot of the ... and things like that so it is going to be a very beautiful background for any kind of events that they have and it's a it's a good idea actually even for a backyard it's a lot of work\nYou know anything you time you're dealing with crunch size\nIt's um it's no picnic but I have to say they did a magnificent job and it could be higher done you know that type of thing [noise]\nSo anyway let's go to the phone lines if you'd like to call in our phone number is eight for for two two zero zero nine six five that's eight for for two two zero zero nine six five I Want to try to help you any way I can with any type of plant question well let's talk to Charles interlocking Florida welcome\nYes egg can morning thank you for taking my call sure I have\nI have a tip questions to ask you I I have I have a couple of lines or a rage growing in my yard in certain places that they don't want a tight as sad\nAs that and they both get flowers on them and that along type just comes up just anywhere\nIn my yard it could just come up in the center and whenever I cut grass that are just lower down I don't bother leaving it but it gets nice white flowers on the west yellow and the center\nI was wondering is it that was kind of a form of a daisy or soften\nBoy I'm I'm not a hundred percent sure about that I I doubt that it's a form of a daisy is it a big leave for a small leave\nIt ... the leaf on that is always a three leave like like like a muscle like poison ivy league [noise]\nIs is a is a good size like a few inches across\nUh it it yeah it's a pretty good sized ...\nI mean with that might be\nUm we in Florida in fact I used to have my own property up we in Florida have some different species of passion by\nTheir their native species it's where they make they make aspirin out of it as a matter of fact um why don't you Google some photos and see if um if that looks like it that could could be it and you never really get rid of that you just have to do what you're doing you know they keep\nKeep a trim and get back in and that sort of thing otherwise it would take over and covered the grass\nThat the other type of buying or have it it it wants to and and I always goes around this time in the air and it just blows up my parents and it gets and nice red flower on it and during certain times of the day when the flour is open\nIt looks like a star and then other times a day it's closed up but as it goes up my chain link fence\nI uh one side and my chain link fence I haven't met most of the train going and and it and as it goes up my chain link fence that it wants to aids on over to them the most uh train wrapped around the\nMost a tray sure and I was just wondering if it's good to leave it like wrapping around them the most of the tree\nWell I I don't believe in allowing it to take over in in to any of these trees and there's a there's an argument that can be made and it's and it's used you know it could be a little pretty hanging on a few branches and and things like that and can actually be unique look\nOn the other hand all you need is another couple of months and it could be way into the tree so I kind of fall into the category of trying to keep up with it or not allowing you to get out of hand and and all that but\nLet let me just back up and say a general thing about all kinds of vines whether it is these the seasonal lines whether they're attractive vines are not attractive veins there's one common denominator about vines and that is\nA they all grow very fast and they're they tend to be very aggressive as a rule so if you were going to\nTo have many of them they are going to work you they don't work you when they're young they work you with trimming as they age and that's the problem so I Would generally keep vines to a minimum you know the reason why even bring this up as a landscape designer a lot of um people will\nWill tell me um you know events I called you because you are the low maintenance leader when it comes to landscape design and and and all that and here's what I Want I Want the vines everywhere [laughter] well you ... they could choose anything higher maintenance than a vine there's nothing higher maintenance than if I ... and\nIf you're going to keep up with it they can be quite beautiful but if you don't it can be quite a a disaster so uh keep that in mind and I have a I have a vine in my yard\nThat I Love it was there when I bought the place I have a sucking garden and it's a fight is ... ... it's growing on the fence and it's a three three wooden fence\nThree levels and we keep a trimmed with a gas coverage rivers\nAnd when it's when it's trimmed it is so magnificent we just trimmed recently and when it's not when it gets away from me it's just like a wild hair cut it looks awful you can't do anything to it so you have to keep a trim so I get a lot of enjoyment out of it I'm Glad I have it\nRight and and before you know I'm tired of the one question let me but I have my head grass over the years ... down to ... I went away for two months and then when I came back I live in Vegas with\nAward to bake type stuff in my but here it it looks it looks like\nLike like going but his award to grass what I say water if you and it's easy to remove from the ground but it's a pleasure to invade it did they have\nI got to go to a stop for a break but um it's I Would just get a a weed killer with try making it perfect

of our area because our boundary\nNaturally is buried and the cemetery as long as as well as a lot of his family a lot of our founding fathers or does the people that were instrumental in a scene that Leesburg\nBecame a successful a little town back in the day are buried there are and we ... we we choose different people every year to to showcase if you will we try to get someone from their

you into the\nPat how a man it's a\nYeah and uh we I mean we have some people that will show um you know things that their family is you know when the Eighteen hundreds or the early Nineteen hundreds do you think that there were actually in their household or they'll bring pictures or it's it's just very very interest me\nEach I'm a person that we showcase there's about a five minute segment on them\nAnd uh it just opens up the doors to where we evolved from and it's it's totally fascinating\nJust fascinating will now we\nWe start at the beginning and we go we walk all through the military and we point out different things and then like I say every now and then we'll stop at a particular family side and and someone there will tell you something about their family\nOkay you know all of these ... we'll call them the founding families uh Leesburg were because this was an agrarian society in the Eighteen hundreds where were these predominantly orange grove families or or the families that came from all different walks of life\nThey came from all different walks of life on my show case my grandparents a couple of years ago and my grandfather was a crafts and he would come out on building a lot of the buildings and and late or churches and things like that he worked at the at the local lumber mill uh and so he so in that\nRespect he he did not come from a lot of money but he came from a lot of ... and uh and he and my grandmother worked side by side or to take care of their family and and and their their contribution was was\nBuilding sure uh uh so so yes there was a lot of citrus growers are but there but there was also um masonry done and and like I say craftsmanship\nSure was a you know a planning and zoning if you will it 'cause 'cause even back then those things had to figure it out you know you can't just march in and and plop a church right in the middle of the road or you know I don't think so yeah it is they came from all walks of\nLife of course Leesburg still has its original main street I imagine that's from that that is the original main street from the Eighteen hundreds I Would think correct\nIt it is yes it is\nInteresting well um this is great I have a curiosity crush 'em ... if you would notice\nUm there was I don't remember his name but you may know there was a famous architect who did the magnificent architectural designs for the Leesburg high school\nAnd ... do you have any idea how that came about or how they were able to contact us individual to to create this this magnificent architecture\nYou know I should I should know that but I

tonic\nYou you have your blueberries on the ground they like an acid loving a soil by the way\nAnd you take a five gallon bucket I use a five gallon former paint bucket white buckets with the handles the handles tend to break it after a while so you have to kind of always have your second plastic bucket but in\nWaiting because you can't carry the thing around without a handle right\nSo you're going to add to this five gallon bucket dishes your mix to come up some salts two cups of bone that meal one cup of peppermint pure so I\nI used to buy the health food store but I think they sell it at the grocery store now a one cup of rubbing alcohol that's just regular rubbing alcohol one cup of powdered milk I'll repeat this don't worry\nAnd a half a cup of cotton seed meal now the counting the meal is probably going to have to be ordered from Amazon most likely a so keep that in mind so you fill\nThe rest of the book it up with water and you just heard in ... but just a little stick that I use and then you pour this directly on to the the roots about once a month in the growing season like march through October\nThat's what you do in\nThe blueberries like to grow mind like to grow in a fifty percent soil mix to\nMulch mix like uh I use the oak leaf Moultrie my particular case but you could use any kind of ... ... tend to be more acid so here's here's mixes again to a five gallon bucket you're going to mix two cups of that so solves\nTwo cups of ... all\nOne cup of peppermint pure soap one cup of rubbing alcohol\nOne cup of powdered milk and a half a cup of cotton seed meal\nAnd you could buy everything locally except the cotton seeing Rio you'll buy on the Internet it by the way that cut and see Neal is good to have because\nIf you're a ... I haven't been doing well if you're communities are struggling a little bit don't worry about it because that cotton seed meal will I've seen them it brings so many beautiful plants back so keep that in mind a I've got\nI'm looking forward to today I'm going to do some tweaking in my view on it a little we control a little um tweaking uh it's okay to do some light trimming now and that sort of thing if you have some wild and wooly branches here and there are no problems so I've got the yard looking\nPretty good I had a bunch of weeds come up in the front but one of a major areas of the yard but taking care of that so the front yard is done I just have to uh\nWork on the back yard are going to do some ... today are probably a half a day\nOf yard work so but I'm looking forward to it feel

new rules because it it's been live in the front yard and it's a very good way to kind of kick start you had to get you into the zone for creating\nSome great things in the yard so uh we live with Charlotte for just a little bit so one minute for him so\nThat we think pretty much what I wanted to cover today do a little bit of fertilizing\nIf you uh if you have not done so lately you could still do some light feeding though and by the way when you plant your annuals go ahead and use\nJust a little bit of fertilizer for the ... cemetery we used to hundred any rules and the butterfly garden and\nSo we're going to recommend they go and do a light fertilizing his will [noise] with a bloomed type fertilizer and remember if you have older the rules from the summer you need to have
