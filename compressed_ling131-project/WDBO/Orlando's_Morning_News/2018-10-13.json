happened to Washington Post reporter Jamal workers showed you the Washington Post is now reporting that the Turkish officials claim to have audio and video evidence of ... torture and murder ABC News senior national correspondent Terry Moran with more details\n... a columnist for the Washington Post living in the U.S at a frequent critic of the Saudi regime enter the conflict ten days ago seeking official documents related to his upcoming wedding hours earlier according to reports in the Turkish media\nA private jet had arrived from Saudi Arabia nine men on board one of two planes allegedly linked to the operation\nThe William ... agency which was the top agency still to this day you know uh and they would ah his name was Johnny hide and he handles all the big actresses of the day or Rita Hayworth lawyer Turner\nAnd he saw Marilyn Monroe across the room um and it was like lightning struck him for the first time in his life he went over to her and he said I see\nA hundred girls a month wanting to be actresses and I represent Rita Hayworth Turner and all the big ones and none of them have with us and she was skeptical because she at that point she had been seen by all the top studios and rejected signed for six months and then let or they let her ... contract lapse\nHe saw something in her and that's really what most people in the ... you know a lot of the big ones don't have a lot of self confidence Marilyn was one of those people so she needed someone to believe in her who had the power to help her and that's what this agent did for her it was a huge break for was around Nineteen fifty\nAnd what happened and how did it play out\nHe got her two very important roles which were turning point for her one was and it was called all about eve and they start Bette Davis was the star and Maryland have a big part but it was a good part where she was allowed to shine with some of\nThe big the big players in the end of the day was the left home Bette Davis and back staring Marilyn had two big scenes where she really\nStood out and then he got our another film called the asphalt jungles fill new are where again she had a few scenes but people walked out of the theater it was a very exciting climbed caper but they walked out of the theater saying who's that blonde\nAnd Charles this was all without any training or any background or any real practice is that right\nOh real training was she talked about this when she was seven and eight and in foster care and her foster parents work\nThey would drop her off at grandma's Chinese theater to watch films all day that was like her her care keep our caretaker so she learned she did eventually go on to study acting but her first training was watching the great that came before she was a huge gene Harlow fan first platinum blonde in the Nineteen thirties\nAnd um she loved clothes that cold there and people like that and she would she would watch those films over and over again and then in her lonely existence or lonely world she would act at night in front of the mirror she'd replay those scenes over and over again and that was really a first training\nSo what happened after these two films or Nineteen fifty what was next\nWell I think that the newspaper people started to discover her she was very good at um cheesecake photo type things have pent up photos\nAnd the studios which had been ignoring her up until Nineteen fifty in late forties and everything they wanted nothing to do with her ... her anymore they started to see that she was getting a lot of attention she was very good in our interview she was very canny about her self image how to present herself\nSo they started having to give her bigger roles and each time they\nIt for a bigger role to the public um their fascination and their hunger for more of her so it's it's interesting because when you see some of those earlier roles where she had not heard rules were not the star\nYou could see that on the poster for the film they started putting her ... her name above everyone else has and it was her photo like if she was in a film with Cary Grant or I'm ginger Rogers or something like that who they were the stars but Marilyn was the one who was getting all the publicity ...\nWas there one film that really did it for\nI think the one that put her over was it's a film called Niagara um it's not as well known as some of the other ones but it was a first color film\nAnd um it's a Nineteen fifty three film and it's it's really present it for the first time the image that we know of her today\nThe porcelain skin the tussle the blonde hair the ruby shiny white laps and the beauty marking the the Soul Train it was all in that film and then after that she exploded all over the place I mean there was no denying that she was a huge star and that's what led her to getting\nGentlemen prefer blondes which was her career defining moment\nAdded that movie come about\n[noise] you know it's interesting because general for for blondes had been a book and then it was a huge at the time Broadway or hit\nWith a Carol Channing and the studio twenty Century Fox that was Marilyn studio at the time originally bought the film for ... able to be a very brave film but when Marilyn after she had done on those the early Nineteen fifty films in her popularity is growing and growing and then after\nMy I grew up um I don't think there was any denying that you know Marilyn Monroe is now the current blonde the film was gentlemen prefer blondes and Marilyn was the biggest blonde now at this point that Hollywood had seen so they mix the ideas of putting a Betty grave all in it and they started Maryland\nWho are the men in her life but this time when she dating seriously\n[noise] yes the man went out Chris started to take off the man that stepped in who became very close to her and remain close for the rest of her life was Joe DiMaggio\nUh this is where Joe came along\nYes ah early Nineteen fifties like he they they met and like fifty to fifty one or fifty eight fifty one early fifty two he had seen of a photo of her I'm playing it was a publicity photo her play baseball\nAnd he was from the first one that he saw like so many people are became very taken with her and uh there was someone a mutual friend arranged a blind date and he's really the one DiMaggio really is the one if you have to look to someone\nIn her life you know the candle in the window is looking for someone to cling to win the rain today he was the one even after their relationship ended and she had remarried and all that kind of so she always went back to him up until the end\n[noise] wonder why that was [noise] he\nNever used her he never wanted anything from her he really did it look he wasn't a perfect guy we won't go into that Joe DiMaggio as his own books but he was he was a decent man he he truly love term\nI'm not because of her fame ... and ... for him in spite of her fame he didn't want her to have a career and that was really the the the sword between them that you know she wanted a career he didn't want that for he wanted to or to just be his wife [noise]\nUm but he would ever trouble she was saying I'm a ... in the coming years she would be a lot or he would always go and a rescue her it was like her Knight in shining armor and he he was the one up until the very ... up until the very end he claimed her body from the morgue where no one else it\nWhat about the marriage to Arthur Miller\n[noise] I think that's an unfortunate marriage um you know as an outsider looking in and with all everything we know in hindsight I'm\nThey fell in love with aspects of each other um the I don't think either one of them love the whole person and that's not\nA good thing to go into a relationship Arthur Miller was going through a midlife crisis he had been married for many years at a scale marriage Marilyn was just coming out of for Joe DiMaggio relationship she was considered at this point to joke in Hollywood\nBecause she played the dumb blonde so they saw her eyes that dumb blonde\nAnd um she was trying to be taken seriously so she fell in love with his intellect and again his uh his uh it was an older guy someone who could be a father that father that she was always looking for\n'em and so ah they started this relationship and I think that after the marriage they started to find out things about each other that they didn't like for instance he didn't like the idea that she was a lady with a path to his opinion like um she had been with other men she had been in\nA certain to a certain degree a victim of the casting couch and you could never get over that I'm about her\nAnd she started to find that he was very condescending towards her he was embarrassed of her in front of his intellectual for as New York intellectual friends uh she made a go of it um it didn't last and um I feel that he ended up using or he he ... after she died he wrote a poisonous play about her\nAnd you continue to to use her in his own place and his uh theater works\nTell me about that famous scene in New York with her skirt blowing up and Joe DiMaggio going completely mongers right doing what what what are you right about that\nWell that was really the moment that um\nI think they both realized that their marriage was going to be over because it was the two different worlds you know coming together have the conservative\nOr Italian American guy who wanted the traditional housewife and her of being the world's sex goddess and the film the scene of hurt the famous scene that Marilyn Monroe moment we call today when she's standing over a subway creating a skirt blows up\nA was filmed you know in front of a real New York city crowd they were lined up for four hours before they started filming that so there was a huge mob watching her film it so you know don't forget this is back in the mid fifties conservative America and Joe DiMaggio was watching the scene be filmed in front of all these\nScreaming men ... man howling man and bears Marilyn Monroe and between that we take her skirt blowing up and her parents are showing for the world to say it was it was very mortified for him\nMy guest is Charles to steal their CEO it's a wonderful read Marilyn Monroe and we've got one more excuse me we another segment with Charles and we want to get into

by now here's your hat Williams\nColonels casino or gas in that first segment talking about his new book\nMarilyn Monroe\nMud Tom syndrome you drove here\nOr his book way to kill a mocking bird matters I've been looking forward to and visited Tom thanks for joining me now are you\nWell thanks very much for having me on the book is called Hawaii to kill a mocking bird matters what Harper Lee's book and the iconic American film mean to us today\nUh I guess the opening question should be Tom oh why did kill a mocking bird matters why does it matter\n[noise] well I think because it's such a distinctly American story that will resonate so around the world and the reason why is because it [noise] ah I say it explains America to all of us who are Americans and it deals with\nWhat I call our original national send ups of the legacy of slavery and ah it also and this is what I think is so important is universal in\nShowing us what it's like to go through those tough waters of adolescence and become an adult so I think it works on multiple levels at one time\nOn this book and I I guess from the movie it's it's opening on Broadway this fall on my right told me about that\nYes it's going to open on Broadway in December in a\nA new adaptation written by Aaron Sorkin who wrote the west wing on TV [noise] so ah I think it's going to be a really interesting kind of different take on the story I Know that the children are going to be played by adults so right off the bat it's going to be different\nDo you think it'll do well I think it'll do really well I Know there's a I mean New York and there's already a huge amount of interest in this uh Broadway adaptation\nYou open your book with a chapter called Monroeville, Alabama oh what's that about\nWell it's about Harper Lee's small home town that was is clearly the model for the tone up may come in a book and the movie and it's our Harper Lee she was so so much a part of our hometown Monroeville and\nKept the house there for her entire life and yet she also had to break out of Monroeville at the same time she she had to come to New York I say she wrote her way out of her home town\nAnd then you moved to the second topic and it's simply called Manhattan to explain that\nWell they it's that Harper Lee came to New York she because uh you know New York is a a couple of things uh it's the center of the publishing industry in New York in the United states and it's also I call it the capital of\nSelf reinvention and you know we Americans all reinvent ourselves so she had to come here to expand her world and to write to kill a Mockingbird\nAnd is that lead to the third topic publication or Phyllis in\nWell you know she came to New York and was having a she was having to work day job she was a reservations clerks for an airline and uh she was having you know a very tough time getting the the time to right here in New York\nAnd then friends of hers who she was spending Christmas with said go to the Christmas tree there is a novel up for you and she opened the envelope and it was a check and it said here's some money to support you for one year well you write your book\nMy goodness yeah so this book this book was inherited did she realizes that it was going to be an absolutely sensational book did she did you have that feeling\nNo she really didn't at all and she she said that at the time when it was published which was in Nineteen sixty\nOur hope was that may be the book which self three thousand copies [laughter] you know just enough that they would publish it another book by her so she thought maybe it would sell three thousand copies and now here we are fifty eight years later and it still sells seven hundred and fifty thousand copies every year\nWhy do you think this is Tom why did it in such a such a nerve\nWell I think it's first of all it's easy for people to forget it is so beautifully written you know the language is so pitch perfect in the book so I think people respond to that you feel like you're in the south in the Nineteen thirties and I think people also responded\nTo the character of Atticus Finch because he's\nI call him an aspirational figure he is the American we all would like to be or hope way contained within ourselves so that's male or female the person that stands up and does the right thing and the crowd kept intimidate and that's an enormously appealing we we want to think we could be addict is\nSo we've covered Monroeville, Alabama Manhattan publication and then you write what price Hollywood question mark ... what's that about\nWell that's about the fact that this is a very very rare case where\nThe you have a brilliant book that won the Pulitzer Prize that it's turned into an equally first rate film it happens so rarely and uh it was a you know the the book the rights were sold not necessarily to the biggest\nBit but to the writing filmmakers and that was a\nAllan Poe cooler or the producer who went on to become a big direct or self of all the President's Men and Robert Mueller and the director so they they sold it to them\nWhite people who made this really it's actually a beautiful film and it holds up so well today not just Gregory Peck performance but the whole look of the film\nTell me about an addict has joined film\nWell it's that you know a a Gregory Peck this was his career defining role it's how everybody pictures Atticus Finch when they're reading the book they picked her Gregory pack and a ... it's a case of it was the right person playing the role because\nGregory Peck himself had many of the characteristics of Atticus Finch she was this\nIncredibly thought hole\nA man who was close to his own children and you know was known throughout Hollywood he was um [noise] you know involved with many many causes so he was he felt the character in his bones and that's what made it come alive on the film so well\nAnd no way for like our back on it and drink and

largesse from New York City wide or kill a mocking bird matters that's the name of his last\nTime I must ask you about ... set of Watchmen what uh what do we know about the history of that\nWell if you eat you know it's a it's certainly very controversial because here this book appeared fifty years after more than fifty years after to kill a Mockingbird and what I think the best description of it is Harper Lee herself called it she said it's the heritage\nOf to kill a mocking bird because go set a watchman she wrote first it was just a first draft and the editor in New York said to her\n[noise] you know what the part that's really\nGood and really interesting is everything set in childhood when scout is a little girl that's what you should concentrate on and cut out everything from the Nineteen fifties go back to the Nineteen thirties when she's still a little girl and so that's\nThat was how a a go set a watchman really influenced to kill a Mockingbird and but of course it was enormously controversial when\nWatch when it came out because people said she's just hope that we know this book is being published is she still cognizant and then everybody was upset 'cause in go set a watchman addict is there's a little bit of a racist so that's why it was a known as the controversial but of course it's sold enormously well\nIs that book still selling well does that a watchman\nYes yes it is I mean it will never of course equal the sales of mocking bird and but it was the number one selling book\nOf the year when it came out two years ago or more than any other book and I think that the fascinating because people tell me all the time you know you asked me all the time should I read it I don't want my memory spoiled and the thing is it's a ... it's just not as good a\nIt is a mocking bird it wasn't edited it the power the beauty of the language is not there that's really my analysis of it\nTowards the end of your book you write a chapter called theme and variations everything old is new again what are you right there Tom what's that mean\n... means that\n... in a way we've um when to kill a mocking bird came out it\nWas the right book at the right time because it was just when the civil rights movement was starting in this country\nAnd the civil rights movement in many ways was centered in Alabama with the bus boycott and so we got this guy you know if it was the it spoke to America then and then when go set a watchman came out a fifty six years later there was at\nOnce again enormous so racial controversy first see in the country you know there was a controversy about the Confederate flags flying over the state house in South Carolina there had\nBeen a shooting of a number of African American males and so\nWhat I was saying everything old is new again is that\nWe're still grappling with the same issues and and of course we've made enormous progress because way mocking bird was published the idea of an African American president would have been unthinkable and by the time you know go said watchman came out\nAbout that in our president so I think even though we still have so many so many issues to grapple with we have made progress and the humanity at the heart of mocking bird it's why I think it's still resonates for us today because it gives us hope\nYou close the book when a chapter called at ... ... what are you right there\nWell it's about the fact that the key players in mocking bird by the end of their lives had made\nReal peace with who they were a individually and as Americans and by those main players I mean Gregory Peck and a ten foot\nAnd Harper Lee and that the that mocking bird headed formed their lives in so many ways that they wouldn't have been able to anticipate at the time and let it really if they change the conversation in our country\nOf about race and I think that's it um [noise] it norm is late to see and speaks to the greatness of the book\nOur guest has been Tom ... y to kill a mocking bird matters thanks for joining us this weekend folks were back for more next weekend on the path Williams weekend our it's news Ninety six five in Orlando I have a great weekend\nTwenty four

protect us from the sun sometimes they're screened in sometimes they're not\nAnd you could put tables out there in shares in some patio plants and some chrysanthemums or whatever you like to jazz things up you can dine out there obviously for breakfast lunch and dinner but there's a lot of folks I think that aren't really grasping\nThe beauty and how important a space\nAnd how beautiful a space like that can be\nAnd a lotta times I'll see that people will use their back patios for for storage\nYou know why don't you just have a garage sale if you if you haven't used all this stuff that

I Am trying to develop\nA sense for what I truly like and that's really interesting because when you start studying you see something it's like oh I Love that\nAnd then what you love so much\nYou can change because six months later you find something that's like oh that other thing I wouldn't even look at that twice now but it wouldn't even consider that because I found something I like even better and this is the great thing about research\nWe can we broaden our our horizons and were able to ah create\nSomething that we we truly are tests have customized a for ourselves are for years uh in Costa Rica\nI heard from my friends that oh you have to go to hotel Macondo you could probably look that up him make K. A. N. D. A.\nAnd every time we would go on our yearly trip or twice a year trip um I somehow forgot about hotel Macondo\nSo\nThe last place we stayed hotel Macondo it was just I'm Around the corner you could practically you could walk to it if you if you want to do so I I said to my wife I said let's go\nAnd have 'em have lunch at a hotel Macondo and let's see what all this hoopla is about that everybody loves\nWell I found out it was ... ... my my friends were telling me you just have we can't explain it you just have to go see it and and basically what had happened was they\nThey create something at a hotel Macondo that\nIs nothing like anything else in Costa Rica\nIs one of a kind and they used like for example they use some really interesting woods uh they did some three dimensional things with lights behind and in these hollowed out woods they took tile or that would be like maybe\nMaybe it was just unusual titles and used it on on walls when\nWhen that type of title you would never see on a wall they did some some things that were not conventional in other words\nThey even when you go into the bathroom it's like you don't want to leave the bathroom because it's so beautiful and so gorgeous and so I instantly saw what everybody was talking about with hotel a condo so we we loved it so much\nThat we decided to go back for dinner when we were on this last trip\nAnd they have this great big area of dinner and they have this big projection screen that does these\nInterchange in geometric shapes and it's just different what what you would expect and it's peaceful and it's gorgeous so I I have a go to friend in fact it's everybody's go to friend and Costa Rica who's\nWho's this magnificent a person and she's um she's from Germany and she may Costa Rica her home and she\nIs very a charity driven and that sort of thing and so everybody knows are so I called her and I said I'm I mean I texted her and I said here's what I have to find out I have to know\nWho this architect is who design hotel Macondo because I Want to write to him and tell him how much I appreciate what he did he took architecture and design or she did I didn't know at the time to another level\nThe spring when they are finished blooming\nThen you go ahead and you cut them back at that time some time in the ... month of march or April and then you will also fertilize them with the azalea fertilizer they also love to be supplemented with epsom salts and they also love a product called iron night\nAnd that ... that would keep them healthy one thing that I'll tell you what I tell all of my clients about all of those areas [noise]\nThe the smartest thing you can do is to keep them well fertilized because if they are a little bit on the hungry side foliage will go a little off color and they're not as attractive\nAnd not only that they won't bloom as long and it's beautiful and so just to keep that in mind\nThat sounds great man is it like as usual\nOkay you take care thank you Bye bye\nAnd uh yeah the you know the ... as he is very interesting and I and I use all different types of his areas I liked the fashion as areas which are coral color\nI use the for most is which are common purple they also come in light think they also come in a dark day in the dark think one is called southern charm\nThey also come in white which is called G G curbing and these are the the for most of varieties are the larger ones that\nCan get big these are the ones you'll see a big islands in winter park and uh and they can be trimmed they make a really nice island plant under under trees and they are an acid loving plant\nSo if you especially of Sandy soil you want to make sure that you're keeping them well fed and many of them can actually be adapted to more son than you think however this is the big however\nIf you don't fertilized but if you're not in your game with fertilizing they will not do well and and that sort of thing also when you uh take them out of the pot it's important to rough up their roots a little bit\nNow these areas that are we use our what we call first year as the years they're young azaleas so they're not pop sound nevertheless we still take our fingertips and we loosen up the tips of the roots\nSometimes a oftentimes I should say I'm ... years will go on sale particular times a year and they are the leftovers and many times they are very very root bound\nAnd it's not to say they can't turn into anything but if it is if you take out a pot of if those roots are just hard as a rock you need to take a little carpet nice for Barrett clippers or something to break up the roots a little bit\nIt's called scoring it's just simply taking this knife and cutting some of the roots cutting some flashes into the sides of the roots and the bottom of the roots\nEverywhere you cut it brand new feed her roots will come out and begin to grow so keep that in mind and also keep them moist they uh they don't like to dry out too much [noise]\nAll right very good I ... and also I like is a landscape designer I like using um ... is\nWith azaleas as well and there are a lot of magnificent community varieties that just thrive here in central Florida and I just think they're one of the great landscape plans of all time because they they have a pretty shiny leaf and the contrast beautifully with Matt Finish up in this area\nAnd they kind of overlapping they're blooming in many cases which is nice and it colors up\nThe fall and winter and early spring season really does when other things aren't blooming as much so keep that in mind\nSo if you if you tuned in late we were talking about the importance of your outdoor room that we know is are covered patio and\nI have a ... as you can imagine over the decades I have seen some just incredible incredible patios there's a lot of beautiful patios and the baby hill area\nOr been in the reason is because they're they're big you know and when you have a great big patio especially if it's elevated and they have the golf course views over there\nYou can be more creative\nHowever for those of you that I have small patios do not get into the mindset that because it's small it can't be pretty because it can be look anytime I don't care if it's a painting I don't care anything you're creating anything I'm artistic\nThere is a rhythm and there is a balance so as long as you don't use oversized furniture in a small space as long as you don't a crowded up with a bunch of stuff that you don't need you can do a kind of a clean nice simple design it looks very beautiful\nAnd one of the things I one of the most important things to me that I see a lot of people don't do\nIs they don't spend\nThey don't put enough maintenance and the floor of their patio or a lotta times it's just the ... the the concrete that the builder left and that sort of thing uh Sharon William sells a particular paint called ... fate I'm sure other companies do to\nBan it has a nice sheen to it and it comes in a bunch of earth tones and it is just ideal for due for painting the patios and a lot of you that I have a ten by ten or a ten by Fifteen patio you could knock that out and just a few short minutes with a roller and\nIt will instantly changed the whole personality of that patio now obviously you have to prep the area if it's just bare concrete you have to pressure cleaned it ahead of time getting rid of any moss\nAnd that sort of thing and let it dry out and then once it's pressure claiming clean you're ready for painting and and the ... paints a really\nA do a lot or you might decide you know forget the pain I Want to put a veneer of papers on her or wherever you want to do stone or you want to expand it that type of thing or you can do whatever you have space for and if you\nIf you are not sure what to do or how to do you can you can look at a lot of the different magazines to get ideas you can go on the Internet\nBy just putting in the term patio ideas\nAnd one of the things that has been quite popular for years and you can buy these all day long and all the different box stores is these\nKind of indoor outdoor rugs and what's cool about them is\nThey can get wet so if it rains in there you could actually playing off the patio all around them and they could get the edges wet and they'd all staying there they're designed for that and one of the things I always suggest\nIs that when you go to buy this this rug for for your a patio consider getting two of them and maybe every couple of months\nAlternate them because you when you roll up one of these eight by ten little rugs you can store them vertically\nIn the garage so they're not taking up a lot of space and I'm like I'm kind of in love with the idea of changing your room from time to time and you could keep all the exact same furniture but when you change your your little carpet clear\nYour indoor outdoor carpet it makes a huge difference so I might suggest that you do kind of opposites maybe one you want more earth tones and simple and then the other one maybe you want while in Brighton in your face\nObviously it has to match what your cushions and and all of that there for your personal taste but that way you don't get bored and tired with the same thing all the time so\nKeep that in mind I think that would be a simple thing to just kind of re new and get excited or let's talk to Barbara and welcomed Barbara how are you\nTalking on a hill and\nI have I have this question a theater plant it's hot in it that bad care yellow and fall off\nDoing is ... ... ... ...\nOkay

moment to get my phone up and take a picture of the show and the automated just how how clear is well sometimes\nWell this is for everybody out there there's no cause most there's a couple of ways that you can run a light show during a concert you can pre program it right ... and then they all go or you can do what caused most does he doesn't ... he he program to show but he fires is lighting off according to the music is that correct cause most\nIs that uh that that's that's the best way to put a correct\nThere you go so he he knows what's coming up in the song whether they don't extended play or whatever he knows that and that's how he runs his lights versus if it's pre program it's gotta run according to the music correct\nCorrect a quick track of all it\nSo it's the difference
