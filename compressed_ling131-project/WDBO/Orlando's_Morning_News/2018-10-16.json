move it's a nice a teaching moment there uh Chris uh the the hurricane as a cause a problem with that at least one president or not presidential gubernatorial debate\nYeah it has and it pushed back up both the the debate between Scott ... supposed to be on CNN and to also pushing back the Telemundo one that was supposed to be between\nGillum and dissent descent and um you know is on the radio with Tony Marino about a week ago and we were discussing debates is obviously before the hurricane and we we were discussing the fact that probably the most important debate line is not necessarily who's got no someone we we pretty much know who Rick Scott as we pretty much knew Bill Nelson as\nIt was the Gillum dissenters yeah where you know this and this was one of twenty seven members of Congress from Florida most people in this state\nReally know him before the primary I'm Andrew Gillum kind of the same way he's the mayor the seventh largest city in the state but if you are from Leon county or Tallahassee you may not really know him so we were discussing how this was really going to be a very important debate for voters who were trying to figure out where they wanted to put their vote for governor\nAnd I think it's everyone's detriment that we're not having an obviously hurricane being hurricane it takes priority over pretty much everything else but\nI think voters missing out on on a debate and you know listen to this is just this is what happens when you do have a hurricane and do you have such a late primary most states don't do there's this latest Florida we do our pretty late not only leaves a little bit of time\nSo will there then be an a debate at some point\nSo we're still scheduled to have one um and and and you know I I think it the more the better but we're probably going to get to the point where we may have just one maybe two ... if they get to someone reschedule so this is this is kind of the downside of all of his name into are they getting to the to the detriment of voters and\nI Would say that there are very few political candidates who relish a debate to love a debate I think most political candidates would just assume rather not doing it all depends\nOn where you're coming from it if if I'm the challenger and I behind in the polls I Want the debate because that gives me a chance to go out and I can just I mean I got nothing to lose a plane with a house is money if I'm ahead if I'm maybe the incumbent or I'm the favored candidate going in I'm saying I have nothing but a downside of being in this debate\nUm you're on the presidential side you mentioned that a little bit earlier a we have the president's debate commission they schedule all three it's guaranteed you will have three presidential debates\nUm it doesn't get that easy with other cancers in other races there may or may not be many debates or maybe none there may be some\nAnd you're starting to see like especially in our house candidate races where White House kinda just can't get anyone there they're going to ever show up to the band and meanwhile you have some like Mike Miller Stephanie Murphy we had them on our air and other stations have done the same tiger bay has them today they're doing a lot of debates really giving people a chance to see them\nSo it's it's such a hodgepodge as to whether or not this actually happens and you know

it's interesting to watch it doesn't actually affect anyone's lives at all um if we want to talk about hurricane recovery we want to talk about the deficit or we want to talk about what's going on internationally these are all very important issues it from a federal aspect\nThis is just a Elizabeth Warren\nDoes not like Donald Trump she kinda backed herself into a corner with this whole you know heritage thing\nAnd he called her out on it now it's gotten accelerated I think if you look at it from a pure political standpoint you would say we are three weeks from the mid term elections is what she's doing with this test helping Democrats when the house or when the Senate\nAnyone that can say the answer to that question is yes she's helping I'd like to meet you and find out how you are getting to that conclusion this seems like it at any point you could say this is terrible messaging from the Democrats going into three weeks before the election 'cause we're not talking about issues

shown\nInnocuous at best doesn't necessarily move the needle as far as getting guns off the streets it gives people who maybe have weapons that either don't work they don't want to they just don't really care about somehow they came into their possession is want to get rid of them\nYou know it gives them a place to do that in a way that we know in a gun is going to go and be you know gone and and so like it comes down to like personal responsibility if you want to get rid of your weapon if you've got a weapon you have no use for doesn't work or whatever\nThis is a fantastic thing and if you want to keep it then nobody's making you traded in for fifty dollar gift card\nAnd I give you kind of an example of this I I have had in my family for a very very long time to very old shot guns\nThat uh I'm real sure don't work\nOr their dent it up and they've got some other issues that they're they're not really worth any value they're not collector's items\nUh and I just pretty much carry that with me for moved to move because I wouldn't otherwise know how to dispose of shot guns or you know short of dismantling the drilling holes in it and you know trying to destroy it that would be a scenario where I could see myself taking it down to a gun buyback program and and get fifty bucks out of\nIt if if they're sitting around your house you're pretty sure they don't work why not get quick hundred dollars to I think Wal Mart gift cards is what they're giving out why not ... and they're going to get dispose of you don't have to worry about somebody using them for various purposes\nIt seems like that works for you and that's and I think that is the general point um the problem I think is that these things sometimes gets sold as we're taking dangerous weapons off the
