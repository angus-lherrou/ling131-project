see\nBody in a crash die it's very rare but I have to end and of course an autopsy will determine whether or not they had a carbon monoxide and their blood see my thinking I was thinking more of that uh Dale Earnhardt factor you know sixty miles an hour and everybody just ...\nYeah and maybe so maybe so in that you know there's a there's a part of you that would\nHope I guess maybe it's just me hope that it's carbon monoxide because that would just be them going to sleep and not knowing the trauma of what's about to happen or what happened\nRather than all having their next snapped in August I shutter at the thought of that\nAnd I and I feel in a sense it it would exonerate the driver or a bit\nIf they're all unconscious you know that you're speaking about athletes it was a pain Stewart

and this guy was said to be going sixty miles an hour never applied to breaks\nSo we we will obviously wait and see how that one turns out but oftentimes those of us in the news industry we will

...\nSix ten on Iran does money news are six o'clock expanded it news feed I Want to go in depth said this morning with channel nine eye witness news political reporter Christopher he's the guy the man\nThe single Orlando reporter who scored an interview with President Trump yesterday congratulations Caesar thank you very much I Am curious and for for our listeners who wonder how something like that comes together I mean how how does something like that come together how do you get to be the guy that interviews the president\nAnd he told the president comes to town there's always a local pool there's always a local law affiliate gets chosen to kind of go with the White House press pool that travels with him and\nI'm with in that and that rotates from all the stations who you know be us and then it will be the other stations on a rotating basis every time he comes to town which is you know infrequent but and then once that has been its tablet that you get to the pool you can ask to get an interview and\nSometimes those emails don't get returned sometimes they get returned with a simple no uh in this situation we really didn't hear anything and then about twenty four and not even twenty four hours beforehand we get an email from the White House saying\nIf you're interested we may be able to make this happen but I mean I I'll tell you this yesterday we showed up at the event we got about ... o'clock we didn't really know till almost noon or so whether or not this was one hundred percent going to happen because the president's schedule is very tight\nAnd I'm listening if something has to fall by the wayside that's probably one of the things that will fall by the wayside to make time for everything else so you know it's touching go right up until he walks through the door and you start the interview\nAnd it and he can be sometimes unpredictable uh in fact I was watching the the live video yesterday is Airforce one landed as the president came out of air force one there was a moment at which I think it was unclear whether or not he was in the work at the rope line\nEvery you know whether it's that or whether it's you know I remember from covering him for about almost two dozen campaign events back in twenty sixteen twenty Fifteen I mean you know the first campaign event of his I ever covered when he was still one of like sixteen candles in the Republican side\nYou know he he lands in his helicopter and and you know out of nowhere like picking kids out of the crowd and get it in a helicopter go take a helicopter ride wow\nYou know yesterday he invites up some of the police officers that were there to come on stage which\nWas not planned and I'm sure has to be you know most things were secret services like OK okay ... you know 'cause they have everything pin down and all of a sudden he's bringing people up on stage\nYou know he's done that at his rallies the same thing so\nYou know he does what he wants to do at the end of the day you know he's the president United States and whether we are talking about President Trump but we're talking about President Obama I mean I covered\nGeorge W. Bush same thing they're the present they get to do what they want now I Am sure Secret Service pulls their hair out every time a president decides to go kind of off script or outside of the schedule because all of a sudden say okay we didn't plan for this what are we going to do what are we going to do but\nYou know those things happen in schedules get thrown out the window\nI was curious you know so yesterday's speaking engagement was a was a a convention of chiefs of police who normally carry firearms I understand they bought a limb and gas that none of them were allowed to carry firearms yesterday they\nKnow there was screening yesterday and it was like any other event you go to the president there there is screening going in there they had um you know Secret Service was putting everyone through they were checking bags their dogs there I mean no this is a\nLittle ... none of them at firearms right or not that I could\nTell I did not see a single one that had a had a weapon on them now\nThere were plenty of Secret Service that had fire horse and and that's who runs the show's anytime you have a presidential visit or a vice presidential visit 'em Secret Service takes over and you are on their schedule they make the rules\nUm I've gone to several of these events in the past where there'll be like okay everybody come through and as soon as you get through like no no we don't want you and go back out yeah\nYou don't get to stop there and that's why it's like no just go back out because they're in charge and you are basically they're at their at their leisure\nDid the did the White House put any kind of restrictions on questions you could ask or anything like that\nI mean obviously it's a you know that he's there for official business they would like for you to ask at least one question about that they don't tell you what you have to ask but I mean you know he's there to talk ... you're going to\nWhat was your first quite a while you're\nHere for this just you know I mean it's 'cause it's kind of what he's already therefore anyway and that's what you would do as a journalist anyways what ... what is your message and\nYou know but then you move on to you know I'm In my line of questioning is going to be different than a national reporter before I was thinking central Florida ... and in Florida as a state second I'm not thinking about I'm not going to ask about Heidi Heitkamp race sure are or how how do you think this is playing for Joe mansion\nI mean even the cabinet or thing which I think does have a Florida impact\nIs not as important to me or to the the viewers and I'm trying to get information to\nAs you know are you coming back here to campaign for Ron dissent this are you going to come back here in campaign for Rick Scott somebody who has gone out of his way to avoid campaigning with you I mean Scott only showing up at official presidential visit he is not going to a single rally since becoming a candidate\nUm does that change in the home stretch and and the president told me yesterday yeah no I'm having a rally to sand is will be there and I and I and I hope hoping Rick Scott will be there we'll see if Scott shows up\nSide to that have shown an eye witness news political reporter Chris for heat so you want to see the whole interview with President Trump is just under seven minutes he had a lot and that's a lot of time to spend with a leader of the free world or the chicken check it out right now it's on the news that he's six twenty five ...

G. M. A. on ABC News going in front of an audience that he may not have a lot of\nCrossover with but he gets to go in front of that as the governor of Florida Andrew Gillum will probably get some attention you know as Tallahassee gets impacted by the storm he'll probably get some attention for that\nUm but ... but if we want to play this thing out politically then you know Bill Nelson may maybe not because of the Senate he's just a senator or they don't have a whole lot of other than authorizing for FEMA\nAnd raw dissent is no longer is an elected official so you know you you game this out political eastern people stand to you know stand to benefit from the storm\nWell and I felt the same way frankly when I saw the bill Nelson a space shuttle a commercial I thought oh come on yeah but what would you use that for if not for a campaign commercial\nYeah and again I wanted to say I mean it's a lot of sounds kind of like cows to talk about we do have a hurricane coming people people could get injured people could lose property we may have loss of life to talk about this as a political opportunity or a chance to score some points it seems a little bit to a certain extent tone deaf but at the same time\nThis is what campaigns are doing right now they may not be coming out admitting it but they are sitting there and they're calculating and saying okay how can we use this to our advantage and to say that that's not happening by all the campaigns right now in Florida\nA little bit naive and so to at least game it out you know we'll we'll say that's what's happening\nIn depth
