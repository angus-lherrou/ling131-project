roundabout way [laughter] what are you liking of doing [noise]\nWell what it is I had a little bit of money and um and I might have just showed um her home and she put it in a state so I had heard about this on on on the radio site\nAnd that's the same channel that I hear you want [laughter] and they were advertising and it's a vast and ... and then it's a whole bunch of people together and then they on the heat is big names like stores and things like that that have excellent credit and and\nNow I Know it kind of talked on their way and I know what should I about All right so this is a private placement real estate deal where you\nGo in with other people and you own a shopping centers or store locations or restaurant locations or whatever and you owned a real estate but not what's known as a publicly traded\nInvestment it's a form of what's referred to as a real estate investment trust and already IT\nOkay and with these what happens in a rate is the idea of them is that a bunch of people go together putting their money together and they can own a number of different\nPieces of real estate or types of real estate right what's different in this case and this is something that's been a more and more popular is that these are like private gatherers the money so you can't go to\nA stockbroker and say you know I don't want to own that read anymore and then ten minutes later you don't own it any more\nWhen you buy and you own the big concern I have with any of the private offerings are the fees that you have to pay okay\nAnd the fees to get in or usually high enough like somebody's got to pay for that marketing that you heard on the radio station\nCanada fees may make it not a good decision to go into I mean you got you got the two things one once you're in you can't just hop out okay and to you got to look at the expenses\nSo my preference in this what we're talking about here is almost certainly not a scam\nBut I think there are better ways to do what you're interested in and that is buying what's known as a ... index spot\nWhere you own little pieces of many many different owners of real estate that might on shopping centers office buildings hotels you know full office parks whatever and so I like that more where your money is really spread out\nAcross the country and across lots of different places and you can buy and sell those instantly\nAnd you can own it it almost no cost for the management of the real estate\nOh okay and did I get that answer some each month or has so\nWhat happens with depends on if you go in a retreat or wheat index funds so if you buy an actual publicly traded real estate investment trust they pay you back over time\nThe uh the money you've invested and potentially any earnings they're having\nIf you own I'm a ... index like I'm I just pulled one up while we're talking and like here's one that twelve percent of it is and medical buildings\nSix cents and hotels I'm six percent is an industrial buildings fourteen percent is in office buildings\nSixteen percent isn't apartments I mean that's you know and that's what they do they divide out all different buildings all different types\nAnd that way you're not subject to the risk of any one industry\nOkay and\nThere are many of these available you can buy I mean the throw another term actually besides read which is Ari IT up all the other is ATF exchange traded fund\nThat's how you would buy one of these you can many of them you can buy for free you know no commission going in and no commission going out and then just very very low management expenses each and every month\nOkay and that kind of safe compared to stock market [laughter]\nWell it it is a just a different form of investing you know real estate if you ask somebody an oath fiber of real estate was safe everybody would tell you it was the greatest by oh nine people would say it's a nightmare right right and so it's all about diversifying what you do\nThe stock market is only risky in the short term not in the long term owning real estate is risky and the short term but not necessarily in the long term\nCatch so going into a private placement and you know a a private venture where you own different buildings that's a lot riskier than owning a wide real estate investment trust to read because the money is not is diversified and\nYou're stuck with them if you want to be done with them and that makes me very uncomfortable with one that's not publicly\nTraded mates with us on the Clark Howard show how are you doing ...\nGood how are your car great thank

else was over there and they couldn't possibly both be living under the same roof so they were in violation\nA huge backlash and spot if I back down\nThe reality is the right answer for all of this is how Netflix handles Netflix does not care who you consider to be part of your family they handle it by limiting how many streams you can have at a time\nAnd part of their whole economic system is planning for that so to them it doesn't matter if\nOne of us on the west coast is watching it and one of his on the east coast is watching it\nThat we're all part of the family membership Netflix offers a much cheaper membership if it's just one person\nSpot if I have created part of its own problem by making a one person membership so much money more than three times what it is effectively per person on a family membership\nSo there's no way that companies are going to be able to please\nWhat an individual considers to be the members of their family group\nAnd one person is paying the

a pain if someone got it and thought out credit his advice is to log in and change the pen\nClearly Clark has not done this himself as it is not possible experience offers no mechanism to reset a pin

changed my pin\nI Know this is more of an experience stinks but Clarke should have at least research the process before recommending resetting the Penn thanks Todd\nTried I appreciate that I'm really sorry about my lack of clarity with the Experian pen vulnerability and the problem with it is that even if you've gone through the process of freezing your credit\nThere is the potential that are criminal would be able to do all your credit behind your back without even realizing buying things is if there you are getting credited as if they are you\nAnd experience process is trouble prone obviously you can't reach people they're the best thing to do this is a suggestion that has come from others in the identity protection or what do we call it advocacy\nArea is that you go ahead and actually kill\nYour credit freeze with Experian remove it you can do that on line then go back on line and start over and set up a new\nCredit freeze with Experian and then you won't have to worry about whether or not you can reach someone or get it done online you can kill it and then\nMake it live again starting over and you can do that bam bam much ... more easily than trying to talk with a

available each weekday for free off the air guidance from a member of our team\nSo I Want to tell you that there's something I brought up must be a year and a half ago there was an experimental thing from the traffic out ways WINZ ways is perhaps the most below dubbed\nAndme most hated traffic out but at the same time 'cause ways is the one that uses a the intelligence of the collective people that use it\nTo give people ideas of alternate routes what's going on with traffic before you would know otherwise that Iraq has just occurred and uses a very advanced algorithm to re route you around a tie up\nAnd ways gets to know so much about the ... but people to use it and they issue you a cartoon characters and you get points and all this stuff in it it's really almost like social media and traffic congestion together in one thing\nSo ways\nHas helped me so much when I'm In a congested metro area getting around a traffic problem the biggest hassle with ways is a lot of times it will not know that it's bringing me to a place once we take a left turn at a busy intersection with no red light that intersection\nAnd so then I just reroute my ways by taking a right instead of a left and then you turn where I legally can do it to get out of what would be a pickle but it saves me a norm is time ways has such deep information about what users\n... they came up with this experiment it's now a deal across all fifty states where a view our suburban commuter\nWays will help you line up with somebody else who follows your similar commuting pattern and we'll do a match game and you get paid for driving that person as someone in your car pool\nSo the advantage in metro areas where there are carpool lanes where you need to three or four people in the car to ride in the carpool lane and that could save me an enormous amount of time\nBeing able to find somebody through the ways car pool lab which is a separate out of ways\nYou could kill two birds with one stone you ... some of the cost of your commute because they're paying you to ride with you only reimbursing you up to iris legal max so fifty some odd cents a mile\nAnd so it helps you reduce your costs and if there is the carpool thing gets you in the carpool lane and gets you through traffic much quicker it's not like\nHaving a UFO getting your car though because razors or in fact track so thoroughly you're not going to have somebody who\nAn ax murderer who suddenly is in your vehicle because it's tough to drive with somebody trying to swing an ax at you or whatever so not good for you or the axe murderer trying to do that so this is\nPotentially I think about how many cities around the country\nThat have extremely difficult suburban to suburban commutes or suburban to entering suburb or central city commutes where being able to have people car pool whether you\nCould take away a lot of the time suck of your current commute and so if you're looking for a way maybe to ride with somebody else in a very low cost or you're looking for a way to defray your costs of operating in motor vehicle or you're looking for a way to save time", "year": "2018", "show_name": "The Clark Howard Show", "city": "Orlando",
