[noise]\nThat I'm going to achieve that yet but I got goals I suppose this also has to do with if you're going to have a family when did you start having the family and how old are your kids and how many kids do you have because this is all on average from the study um\nThey say people's favorite things about their forties don't on vacations earning a bit more money\nHaving a nicer car and then

peers yes so you're still sort of been the thick of it and you're running everywhere all the time there's that part of it and trying to achieve the work life balance but yeah it is the one part where you get more comfortable in your own skin\nI think is really true and they say from the study\nBest thing about being in your fifties you'd do stop worrying so much about what people think well look at the way I dress [laughter]\nDo you think I care [laughter] I'm way past that sir\nI mean if you dress for the occasion but your everyday where you're very comfortable in your own side very much am

the wake of the old Brett Kavanaugh stuff\nThat went down now you Arab Susan Collins who's been targeted by somebody\nRepublican senator out of Maine who of course we had our daughter was a great speech knocked it out of the Parker reasons for voting for Brett Kavanaugh ought to be on the Supreme Court um and stories are now looking into a suspicious letter that was sent her way\nTo her home in Bangor Maine well she was labeled a rape apologist right\nHow ridiculous man so they have no information to suggest that the public is in danger that's according to the police department the FBI has been notified at the uh notified do about it\nUm\nThere was no information immediately available about the contents of the letter or the identity of the center but believes it was delivered to the house and the reason why there had been sent to the senator's residents was not immediately clear I'm into I mean there's got to keep an eye on this story but it's a scary time it's a scary time to be a lawmaker\nThe reason wasn't clear right [laughter]\nThat's what the truth sickle incident that happened to Joel with Susan Collins house no idea why ... ...\nUh there was another story that made some national news a possibility of a nine year old groping a grown woman\nYeah so last week this ... this went viral and and and then there's an update to this story now a woman who was dubbed corner store Caroline\nCalled the cops on a nine year old kid who thought that uh she er she thought he grabbed her but\nShe lost her mind to this is in a corner store in Brooklyn and the cops got called because she thought that this nine year old boy yeah touched her but as he walked by and they're just a snippet of the audio of her freaking out and called the cops\nYeah one zero right around my [noise]\nAnd she's I mean she looks like something's not right between our ears I mean it was a little gray so surveillance video shows the kids backpack brushed her behind yeah it was a tight squeeze and so and she's kind of leaning over\nThe counter and so he hurt his backpack brushes past her backside she turns around and immediately says you grow up to be on call them the\nOne of the things that's fascinating to me about this is it is the collusion of two major social flat a flash points in our country right now one of them of course his race relations\nAnd the other being the me too movement\nYes both together and here you have now a woman who was claiming that a young a nine year old I mean not that it really mattered ultimately by nine year old was a black kid\nAnd she says you touched me you grabbed me I'm calling the cops instead of handling this like a mature adult and if you think this happened you can turn around and you could maybe say something to a kid or to the mom or something or you don't have to call the\nCops no no I have no idea\nWhy I don't know this person I don't know if that happened because of the nine year old was black or would have been the same if the kid was white Asian whatever you have no idea but I mean she immediately like freaked yes and\nThis is one of the things that I Know this this gets a lot of flak whenever somebody brings this up the president has brought it up others have that you want to make sure that in the meat to era you're not reaching hysterical levels meaning you or not it doesn't become literally a witch hunt\nYou know this is a danger of you know the women need to be believed heard yes automatically believed no because sometimes people do either misunderstand something or lie\nIt does and and when the president and others say it it is turning into a scary time for young men this is exactly what they're talking about cars that nine year old must have been freed the hell out because he's got this adult claiming that he groped her\nHe didn't he has no idea what's going on saying the cops are going to get called right that is terrifying stereo down about it and when you bring that up that doesn't mean we need to keep covering up sexual assault and rape no\nBut we also need need to make sure that we're not throwing people into a state of panic where they're going to scare the hell out of a nine year old over a misunderstanding\nWell and another learning lesson of this if you're ever in that situation most places for the public has a security camera yeah because then she was shown the truth yes it does backpack where do you get a ... now she is also\nGetting threats and all that and of course that's nonsense as well leave her alone she's an idiot leave her alone yeah now she's apologizing now to read the climate client is her name was with a inside edition ... what I thought was [noise]\nAcross both to know what is happening I regret that I thought it was such a way I should have said south side so I said\nYa I was yeah they were open late and so they they attract a wider audience that they're going to go have some cocktails you know listen to some jazz look at the dangerous lagoon as it is knowing where you have a bunch of sharks and all that of course someone in the crowd got video of this dude stripping down and while doing back flips and stuff make it yeah [noise]\nI like the part of the story to where the authorities like hey you know over here yeah no ... yeah he walks up to them and it looks like he's getting out now so he's swimming around the sharks whose few inches away from the speed at one point you're right he started to get out been taunted the security did it backwards die back in a tank\nSo we're wondering who is this guy\nBecause he got away security told them to stay and he just left before the cops got there so he's on the loose now there is an update to this because apparently he was really busy that night not only do to go swimming naked at the aquarium mhm but the cops also think he assaulted someone at a medieval times\nA couple of miles away from the aquarium just someone that was there are one of the character's someone that was buried okay they said he ... he beat up somebody I mean it was a\nIt was a brutal beating they said wow and then just a couple of miles away and many use decided I'm going to go to the aquarium it's what made with the sharks he was busy\n[noise] the same man if it was just someone that was like in all the garb [laughter] yeah I don't think you're all that plus even bring your sort\nOf a medieval times no but I had close friends and family that have gone and seen the pictures that looks like it could be a lot of fun actually it was the weirdest thing I only went once I went it was like a band to high school band dream\nAnd for whatever reason and Dallas they felt while we were in Dallas they decided let's go to medieval times for dinner because that's something that normal people do [noise]\nUm and so we go to medieval times up with that you never been there this is where they have like ... you get you get this big mug of what it's like diet Pepsi but they say it's meat or whatever and and you have the big turkey leg and all that stuff and then they put on a show for you they have a jousting tournament\nTo win the part of this their mating or whatever or some such nonsense\nAnd at the end it was so weird because it was all these dudes who were it was in east Texas dude you were trying to do ... just terrible English accent I think my English accent is terrible this was like English with a southern twang [laughter] and so [laughter]\nAnd do they do all this and at the very end the Victor the brave night who won the fake jousting tournament comes out any he just runs several laps on his horse waving the biggest American flag I've ever seen\nAnd I was what message are we sending your I don't understand what this is that they could see in the future
