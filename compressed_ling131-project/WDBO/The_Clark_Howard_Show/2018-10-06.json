are in a position\nTo be employed again at your new job you start throwing money into retirement you're fifty five so you're allowed to do sixty five hundred dollars each year into a Roth IRA correct

I Love Ross and just take it as one piece of information that you can use to make a decision okay\nOkay so we're the Roth IRA let me first say why a lot of it and we'll compare back and forth so with a Roth\nWith money that it earns is tax free ... it's not some kind of odd ball way to maybe get a tax advantages tax free\nRoss IRAs if you go with a low cost company will have an all an expense often about or less than one tenth of one percent per year for the money you have in a raw\nOkay the universal life products will tend to have an annual expense of one and a half to two and a half percent so\nThey will be many many times more expensive and over the years the difference between\nThose expense ratios is a difference between you going to work for years more or being retired

Want you to learn I used to be so you can keep more of what you make it was a study done by professor at the University of Texas Arlington\nAnd was reported on and one of those ... journals about public health\nThey found that when you live in a suburban sprawl county where you are going to Web just under three years less than somebody who lives in a crowded urban core\nI this is somebody doesn't surprise me at all I always thought it was because of the time people spend commuting\nAt that time when you're sitting on your rear end in a car going back and forth being sedentary is what leads to the shorter lifespan for that turned out to be only one of the three factors that lead to a shorter life\nAnd that is a significant thing though is that is your commute is a time suck\nYou have cut out of your life free time that you might have used to walk or bike or go to the gym or whatever and so again that's one factor another\nIs that if you're doing a lot of suburban driving\nAnd you're more likely to be an accent 'cause you're driving more miles but your accent is likely to be at higher speed than someone who's in an accident and a quarter urban area and best chance of injury or fatality is significantly higher\nAnd then the third factor blows my mind I remember this one research study\nSo there'll probably be another one later the disagrees with some of the conclusions of the author of this but the third factor is the root cause of all the driving in a sprawling suburban area\nThere's higher pollution than there isn't a core of a metro area I always thought that the corps was\nThe year was really dirty but it turns out that that's not the case and the dirty air is what can lead to shorter life spans as well so\nThat long commute can be costing your health and costing you three years of your life\nLarry's with us on the Clark Howard show hello Larry how are you doing\nHi Clark thanks for taking my call\nSure you got a credit freeze question for me\nI Do I

institution is pulling or a credit report to decide whether to grant your credit card or not they are pulling from a single bureau because they have to pay for every time they happen to one\nAnd I have repeatedly when I've had to sell on my credit for an application for a new credit card or because I'm getting a new cell phone service or whatever\nI have never\nEver been able to get someone at customer service to tell me what bureau they draw from and which one that I Need to thaw\nAnd so I've had to thaw all three when I open an account for somewhere where they want to pull your credit or

we're in the country you're buying a home in Denver, Colorado\nOh could you find a more difficult market to find a deal on a home in the United states right now in Denver\nWhere it has been very tough and I think we finally found the right place\nWhile I Am so glad to see people complain constantly in Denver about the difficulty of finding affordable homes\nYeah that's right press would have been skyrocketing [laughter] how can\nI be of help to you in this quest for this home you love\nThe part of this process um our builder have given up for five thousand dollar incentive if we use their preferred lender to get our national mortgage with them and get caught but it gave us a little bit higher not outrageously high\nSo just doing some quick math kind of guessing on what closing costs would be I figured that it or break even point\nFor the five thousand dollars would be about four years now which part it might make sense to have taken a deal that over the life of the loan if we go at a lower rate I think in the end it would save us around forty thousand dollars which sounds great to me\nSo loud or they want half a point more than market potentially so the only way you really know though is that half a point would really come your way is to go to a mortgage broker and you have the mortgage brokers shop you\nAnd who knows then you might be able to go back to the builders preferred lender and say hey I got this offer here and what can you do for me\nBetter now we've already spoken with him and it doesn't sound like as ... as a lego shuttle at all [noise]\nSo my question because um [noise] well the plant I'm when I'm planning on doing is taking out the loans through him to get a deal closed because I don't think I'll ever\nSay five thousand dollars on somebody like this again sure and then at some point in the near future shop around to refinance because I imagine closing costs are going to be about two thousand twenty five hundred to refinance\nDown costs all depend on it varies so much from wondered a lender you can even set a target of doing or was it was a no closing costs ... where you then in turn take a little bit higher rate\nIf if you know we would take for years before you break even taking the five thousand up front I think that's a\nPerfectly acceptable wise choice on your part you're listening to the park how
