a fan for many years\nWell great to have you here\nWell thank you [noise] um I've got a a high end luxury automobile that I've had for twenty four years and ah I watched it the ... down to about Eighteen thousand five hundred dollars but there's been a real\nCollector craze for this car even though it's a a Nineteen eighty eight and the cars now valued at forty thousand dollars and I'm I'm\nLiterally wait wait what did that luxury vehicle cost to buy new in Nineteen eighty eight\nAnd Nineteen eighty eight I bought it for for I'm Sorry in Ninety three I bought it for thirty five I understand in eighty eight it costs fifty thousand [noise]\nSo now you fast forward the clock and now it's getting back to what it originally cost all those decades ago\nIt's it actually it it hit a low of Eighteen five and then about three or four years ago it went crazy and people started collecting a light nuts and I I think it's actually worth like forty six but I'm just going to sell it for forty but I'm looking at offers from a\nNew York and North Carolina and a here locally um but I I don't know how what is a safe way to get payment from these people\nLive wire transfer\nJust wire transfer\nYeah cashier's check means nothing\nOkay and so we have two sides of this let's say you were calling me as the buyer in New York and you're trying to uh ... you're trying to buy the vehicle and I'd say well\nYou got to be really careful buying cars how do you know it's really on the condition the sellers telling you how do you know Albert's not playing games with you I you know he really even owns one and all that\nSo this is an area where when people buy [noise] I'm old collectors cars from across the country it's a very difficult process to protect yourself a lot of people do it by going through the ... motors platform\nAnd I I actually sold\nA vehicle that was in high demand several years ago through ... motors and this guy bought it from me from Fifteen hundred miles away sight unseen\nPaid me through a the ... platform which ultimately was pay pal got my money they showed up with a um with a car transfer service and my vehicle went on its way\nAnd so it ... it is it is one of those things where there's a level of trust that needs to be involved but anybody who says cashier's check where cashier checks used to be the gold standard now they're fools cult\n[noise] my wife was concerned that if I have these people routing numbers in my account numbers and stuff so that there might be some way they reached back into account hurt us later I guess that's not an issue\nNo that is possible that is possible but with a wire ... if you do a C H\n[laughter] okay if you do a wire transfer the wire transfers operate that would be much more difficult thing for somebody to move on and try to get the money but it is true with a C H\nOh I see I didn't know there was a different\nYeah Italy so with a automated clearing house and all the AC eight system is one that it has risk [noise] all the way around and those risks are greatly reduced where the wire transfer\n[laughter] okay and if if he's local people some of them were talking about that we had the same bank and we could go into the back together and do that is that a lot of good idea\nThough that actually can be just fine so if you were to ah meet someone at their bank branch you sit down with one of those people those overpriced S.

Michelle\nHi how are you today\nGreat thank you Michelle you want to talk about the day when you don't have to go to work\nWell yeah hopefully [laughter] I'm trying to get on my doctoral anyway and I'm just kind of as much research as you'd like to end up even more confused than when you first started\nWell anytime you look at information on investing in saving for retirement it can get overwhelming pretty quickly and very very wise people can give very reason to advice that can be directly in conflict with each other\n... that's what you found isn't it [laughter] yes exactly correct\nWell let's see if I can unwind the confusion and give you some clear direction\nOkay it sounds like a plan I'm Sorry I'm I'm married no kids um my husband\nAnd I have to separate towns that's just what what for us um\nWe have sold our house and right now currently living in an apartment ... there's just some kind of that I have an a checking account um that is literally not doing anything\nI'm together we have the money market account again it just it it can knowledge at the end of next year and you're probably not money put aside so it's not doing anything my personal savings upwards of let's say a twelve thousand dollars to settle on a checking account\nI Know that I can find something different and just sat there\nSo I just don't know what the fact that a potential eyeing house within the next year or cable and potentially than building a home I don't want to put too much and the fat and if I thought I Will have access to it for the palm trunk mount\nAll right that's that's some priorities conflicting there because you have the need to putting money into a new house at some point\nMaybe a relatively soon and then you've got the far far later they you're sitting there saying clock ticks I have no money saved for that that's pretty much yet right\n... thanks yes I mean it's not something that my ship it ... stage okay um I don't know delay utilize that for the country a little down payment do I start to find a different investment avenue on top of the four one K. right crime and why what my company\nOh you didn't even say that how much have you been able to save and the four o one K\nI only started that two hundred dollars a month and they vote for it and then a notch and twenty percent at this age I have about a Fifteen thousand right now\nOkay and how much more can you put in that they'll still match with the twenty percent\nThat's going to be more apt to sit down and actually chat with the company about that on the contract way out of that paycheck I Am a Lakers so that's what I felt comfortable having fifty dollars a week getting taken out with the guarantee I Will cover that\nThat's wonderful that's great that you're doing that so the area if there's more match money available the area that you'd want to step it up just a little bit even is putting them more money into that four one K. where you work\nBecause the advantage of that the other things you might have read about you probably read about something called the raw the Roth IRA mhm well that's generally just about the best place to put money aside for the long term\nBut when you have an employer match vats the higher priority\nBecause that's free money they're throwing in on the money that you sacrifice and you put in I mean you know if you can pick up more free money you talked about your savings that er during like nothing and all those years think about if you were to\nPinch your check a little bit more even if it meant you had to pull some money out of savings and every dollar you put in the four o one K through work you're getting a dollar twenty because of the employer match\nThat's a twenty percent instant return on the money that you put in their versus the money you have idled discerning basically zero point zero\nRight\nIn your situation go talk to a human resources or whoever personnel or whoever it is you talked to and that really gold the target should be to as you can afford to overtime\nTo increase the savings and that four one K. up to where you've grabbed all the match money they'll throw your way\nOkay\nSad story they are and if you find out you've already ceiling going the match that you've gotten all the money that you could then that would be where you start looking at with some of the savings you have opening your own Roth IRA\nOkay\nWho's the Roth IRA re would be the opposite of that four one K. that four one K. you're getting a tax break up front but everything in that account will be taxed ultimately when you spend it in retirement\nWith the rock is the opposite you get no tax break now but whatever money you put in it will be yours to spend tax free later on\nMeteorologist George Wallace merge right
