she have to say I'd be interested to hear\nThat I think the whole idea with that though it wasn't that kind of middle finger to the Washington media absolutely because it was thought it was she was wearing it on the going onto the plane and getting off the plane but not when she went to Texas burnt out what you went to the border right\nSo if you're reading in between the lines are ... yeah it's the big middle finger to DC media who are obsessed over ... with with every controversy and make mountains out a mole hills\nSo yeah I'll be watching that I think it'd be pretty interesting meanwhile\nYou think this is just a troll job by the president right here where the media\nOf course it is is that there is this idea floated out there that Trump's daughter Yvonne get might wind up being the next ambassador to the United nations because Nikki Haley says that she's stepping down at the end of the year are now if I was already come out and said no I'm not going to do that\nThat that is not going to happen but Trump was asked about it and I think this is one of those moments where he's he's very good at this is is identifying moments that will drive people crazy and\nJust taking advantage of it for the hell of doing it [noise]\nI've heard a lot of them are already won\nBy very literally I'm going to be [noise] people that know nothing to do it that ... this but I Want

that don't have much time but we are looking at numerous and it is it going to see the different [laughter]\nGet Anderson Cooper on that night keeping them honest so please it would be nepotism Mr President you should not do it okay he likes to throw the shiny objects out there and watch people just run after him\nYes and then for the rest of us it is sort of just a fun game to follow along with them you know and watch the outrage and you're getting better and better at predicting at all the time they did a story about a woman this is kind of said the lottery seems to be in the news a lot of different story just the Philippines right\nYeah well she played and she thought she won she thought you had won the equivalent of about sixteen point six million dollars whole night she had the right number she had the winning six numbers\nAnd she saw she saw the numbers come out from the Philippine charity sweepstakes office the ultra lotto six fifty eight\nShe matched all the numbers you thought you just won millions and millions of dollars you man ... yeah you see it yeah and all of a sudden your heart start speeding through your chest ...\n... you get like the tingling sensation

five super lotto six forty nine and among others and that's why she got confused but she I mean what are the odds of that even you hit the right numbers just for the wrong\nGame and you don't get jak for that or no you don't well no wait hold on she match three numbers for the one uh and wound up getting like thirty seven cents [laughter]\nThanks [laughter] that makes it worse [laughter]\nNothing oh wait a second yeah she did and I'm like oh what like ten grand\nAnd thirty seven and said oh no not quite enough to cover the cost of the ticket but she bought\nWasn't maybe if you're there it's easy to understand this there's the six fifty eight and there's the whatever it sounds very confusing\nYeah it does sound like there are a lot of different games that are out there that it is a little confusing I had a situation like that when I was I don't know maybe twelve or Thirteen was the McDonald's Monopoly game yeah and so I pulled off one of the tabs and it said like prize and it was a

know been through a lot in the last couple of weeks and we all it's been a weird this has been one of the most awkward news cycles I can remember in a while I mean that it's just and just because of how here and it's been back and forth\nI Know at the same time\nAnd I'm not calling yeah dude just like yeah I Know Brett Kavanaugh's been through a lot here but just following the story's been taxing

right\n[laughter] I get to sleep I hear you I mean to your point seriously can you remember a political story like this\nThat had so many people following it for so long I mean when they both testified there were twenty million people watching\nThis more than watching it up again but I Know all that was that a big deal when you just look at ratings have things and how much people usually pay attention to a political story it's nothing like the snow is a big deal yeah\nSo uh you know anyway he talked about what he's been through in about his attitude I'd be heading onto the bench okay\nTo Senate confirmation process was concerned she was an emotional\nProcess was over my focus now is to be the best shows too so I can be good soldiers were granted you know bitterness although

political rally how their Donald Trump apologize on behalf of the United states of America\nI didn't hear it quite delivered like that but yeah I certainly heard the criticism yeah yeah\nYeah I I I especially like to take of Donald Trump turned it into a political rally because he said I Apologize to you about how rough and tumble this whole thing was uh\nThe criticism is ridiculous because Democrats were literally raising money during the hearings that were going on there was a lot of stuff going on they were sending out fundraising emails\nAbout that hearing mall was going on they were using the situation to raise money so don't lecture anybody about how anybody might turn this into a political the quote unquote rally event\nWell I mean over time we're going to hear more and more things about\nThe Democratic lawyers and how they influenced him Dr Ford and what exactly happened because there's still so much that doesn't make sense we don't need to spend a ton of time on this but you know [laughter] it's like it's simple thought\nBut I hadn't really had it before and I don't think I'm Alone in saying when you watch Dr forged testimony\nYou felt bad for her but at the same time you're like there's a lot of holes here yeah this doesn't make sense you know but of course be said that your rape apologist which is how ridiculous this thing has gotten\nBut do you suppose it's possible that you know she wanted to remain anonymous ... that was true\nMan I don't know I I just don't know why you write a letter to somebody if you want to stay anonymous unless you're hoping the the only\nThe only room I can see for that is that if you're hoping that by writing a letter maybe of other people write a letter then that Congress person or in this case Senator Dianne Feinstein might say hey there's a pattern here we need to investigate this and then you could stay anonymous\nIt's because of improper plant choices\nAnd you have to be so careful about that because of

world and they're going to do your job and everybody in your family okay have you seen the latest Boston Dynamics robot this things by the name of atlas\nWell it's running it's jumping and taking off over obstacles it's doing like basic park core and then the videos UC mighty atlas jogging around a grassy field he leaves over allowed within this path\nAnd he uses his whole body legs arms torso\nSteps are about one foot four inches as computer vision on the approach they said to hit train accurately\nThey call this robot the world's most dynamic humanoid weighs about Seventy five kilos which is about a hundred and sixty five pounds\nBasically what this means that you've seen the video and fewer kids club member you're actually seen this video\nIs that outlets can shifted to wait and it's got an eight twenty eight joint that has hydraulics built and now the D O D said they're not really sure like one of these robots are not sure they would ever use them in combat but here are some things that I can do right now stand up after falling over\nRun balance on a narrow beam and get this atlas is a really good at cleaning vacuuming and sweeping All right I Know what you're thinking that robot has to be cheaper than keeping my wife\nAnd other robot taking over the world news here's something that you may be never thought of would it be possible for a self driving car it not just be a self driving car but to use all of this technology would be so bad that it can be a WMD a weapon of mass destruction\nWell research out this past week that autonomous vehicles are a giant security risk and why it had to get there before the black has to do\nIn a closed or a Q A session Ilan most said that fleet wide attack was Tesla's nightmare scenario and announced that they were going to open source their security modules so that all the automakers could work together for a safer self driving future\nAll right I just hope that when they open source of all they do a better job at that and then actually building the cars so governments are trying to get involved to putting controls around these self driving cars or I the D O D can't even changes in the fall password on a computer controlling warheads and as far as Tesla's go\nI'd be shocked if they were in business just a few years from now\nBut I don't tell you there's a lot of self driving car news has passed\nDriving taxis right and it's rolling out across the United states but how they plan to use it is very interesting and I bet nobody has told you this yet about way mo because let's do the math together\nHow does Google make its money anybody yes you in the forward truck they make a huge chunk of change of of advertising right or companies buying advertising people seeing advertising so put us all together with a self driving taxi do you see the future yet do you envision how it's going to we're All right\nLet's say you go to Google and you search for I don't know fresh Christmas tree up pops in ad for a place five miles away too far to walk too far to carry a tree or in your back but wait\nWhat do you see that Google Search you see an ad click here to had way give you a free ride to get your Christmas tree\nSo hypothetically we could start seeing promoted rides for free in place so different searches on Google no way must have this past week itself driving cars had ten million miles of experience on public road I just glad there isn't a self driving car run by Microsoft because every day we hear about some crash crazy stuff\n[noise] and finally as of July twenty ninth team

we go with the von in California Novato, California Hi there John\nHi Ken welcome thank you what's going on um well\nA little confused um we're traveling to Europe next month and my husband and I both have gone to identity theft so I'm very careful about what I Do and I was reading that I probably should have a\n... an app but when I'm using ... and I'm Wondering how important is that I research telling blurry either [laughter] and it's good his fat\nDifferently is any free ones out there what kind of like can you shed on me that that's\nAll right well let's start at the very basics okay is that when you're on a public why everything that you do is like traveling right through the airwaves okay\nSo if you are typing in your bank account and your password your Amazon dot com past winter may be\nIs that anybody can just pluck that we're so ... and so the whole idea behind a VPN or what's called a virtual private network is that they use all this sophisticated encryption so it's going to scramble it all up so I was traveling in the airwaves you won't be able to just pick it out OK\nOkay and so the whole idea behind using the VP an app is that we're going to have this magical tunnel that you're going to use when you are scouting around in Europe where you guys going\nUm we're doing um London, France Amsterdam and Germany oh how fun yes can't wait I'm\nSo excited for you know London you're going to make sure that you get this app it's put out by the London museum oh and so when you're this is like the coolest thing you're going to totally love Esteban when you are like standing in a say in front of Buckingham Palace or pick her daily square or whatever it may be\nIs that you hold up your phone and augmented reality\nSo you can see where you're standing what it looked like in say Eighteen sixty two\nOh my gosh oh it's so cool it's so cool and then the others they are ... are you into like military stuff\nAh my husband is okay\nThere's a museum and I made the mistake and I didn't mean to go to this museum which means like a lot of people don't mean to go to the museum which means most most people don't go there and say is that is the imperial museum\nIs also in London and then of course in France make sure you take like a a cooking class for chocolate and ah it's just an old had to pick like the right Christmas songs and you know if you do a food toward any of the city has been great I went back to your VPN so when you're sitting there\nHaving your tea and Crumpet or your wine and the souffle or whatever it may be is that I Want to make sure that the hackers in the bad guys don't get you so uh so you're right there are all these different VPN those some of them I Can't say on their cars like hide your whatever\nUh then there's nowhere to BP and then there's also freedom VPN which\nThey were actually a sponsor of our show at the company by the name of F secure and it's a public company and this is the VPN that I use than it is free or like for example when I was in London last month and so it does slow things down\nA but if you want to be safe and secure and I'll put a link to this over I commanded a comment that show picks buttons you can find it\nIs that is truly the best way to do and of course before you go tell your credit cards that you're going I mean you ... you know all the drill and then there's a there's another app that you need to get its called mobile passport\nBeard we talk about that I'm no okay you need this app okay\nJust if you don't do anything else you get the okay All right so you leave the United states you're on your way back there's four hundred and fifty people on the plane right right [noise] and they're all coming down this pipeline all go to go through homeland security\nOr a border patrol\nNow if you have mobile passport on your phone I guarantee you that four hundred and thirty four people are going to be standing in line and sixteen of you are going to be on the mobile line and you're going to get through in like three minutes oh my gosh I have to have\nThat oh you have to do it is just had to do it and so and it's like one of these things like before everybody knew how to get pre check you know it was good to get free check but [laughter] but now everybody has pre check [laughter] so it's kinda like that same thing with this mobile passport and so\nSorry count rhino

six point five ...\nBack to Monday Night football as we get ready for the forty niners and the Packers time not to be joined for our weekly conversation with patriot quarterback Tom Brady Tammy how are you this evening\nDoing great Jim great talking to you\nGood to talk to you a big win yesterday Thomas brought you as always exclusively by Macy's guys check this out Macy's has the active here you'll need to look and feel like a pro from working up a sweat on the field to relaxing in style like an it'd be paid by all the active designer styles and fits you've gotta have\nNow only at Macy's [laughter]\nStand up ready twelve let's go for this interview [laughter]\nI'm here and accounted for I'm ready [laughter] what was that all about\nThose might pick up everything I Know it I was I was trying to get drunk to stand up the formation was ready to be in a stance but based on what his role player was I was trying to get them to stand up give ... little hard time getting around the edge\nThat was pretty funny so time when you're in a shootout like this you win the game forty three to forty basically the last guy who has the ball is going to win what's it like to be in a game like that where you know virtually have to score Everytime you touch it\nIt was one of those games and that we haven't had too many of those over the course of my career might even close to the high scoring game we've had in when we went into the game knowing you know they had a hot often one that was scored ... points fortunately we had it at the end that we're able to make the place that we needed to get in the field goal position to win so ended up being a pretty sweet victory\nTom I Know you're not a defensive coordinator but why can't any of these defenses in the NFL including the patriots seemed to stop anybody why have we seen so much of that particularly this season\nBut I think it's the evolution of of officers on football I think you know some of the rules are playing into that it's it's just less of a contact sport now it's much more of a space gain much more of a skills competition I Would say that what it used to be\nAnd they made it unfair for the players because ... that just come right out and said he was worried about getting her up in the past recall he bought you throw the ball didn't finish the play you a scale and go ahead score\nAnd we got to the point where it's gotten so far tilted that it's not even football is we recognize that in the defense of players are so worried about a flag refined it just felt like\nWell I definitely think the defenders are worried about flags and suspensions and fines which is pretty unfortunate\nSo Tom I Know you want to get to a thousand yards rushing in your career you are inching ever closer\nIt is a good word ... but you got three yards on that run I run yeah what was one of my longer ones are no\nI'm just wondering and all that time that you spend with Ben ... and and Alex Guerrero and on the beach in Santa Monica where you're having these guys hold you buy the bungee ropes and you do it at Yellowstone and you do it in Boston is that what you're thinking when you finally take off and and all that preparation that nobody sees\nThink that's what it is it's just you're at forty one it's just the ability to maintain your muscles\nYou know firing quickly and trying to work those in awe season you know when they come up to a certain bumps you got to take advantage and they don't really come up for me that often and unfortunately instinct surely I don't have those instinct to just take off and go you know I'm always thinking throw it throw throw throw it throw it in its ever saying hey take off and go in some guys do have a lot of confidence in their speed\nThat becomes more part of their games are you afraid of getting hit not at all I Would say no not in the pocket not out of the pocket I've never really been afraid of getting hit I and I think that's a good thing for for me as
