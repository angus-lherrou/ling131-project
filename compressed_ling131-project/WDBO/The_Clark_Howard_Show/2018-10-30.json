bank routing address and everything and I feel very uncomfortable with just with this situation especially with all the hacking that has taken place with Facebook and most recently as well\nYou know that's the thing to do with ah with the bigger players go find me and the smaller imitator the Facebook finding option or you have to give your checking account so they have the place to put your money into\nIt and I did uh did uh go fund me as well that's what I have actually given either one of all my banking information of course I was waiting to consult with you as a fall and you for years appreciate your glass\nAbsolutely so first things first I Hope that you get the insulin pump as quickly as possible\nAnd second with both of them go ahead and give them your checking account information because that's how you're going to get money the way it works is you don't get the money minus their credit card merchant processing fees that belt charge right\nSo what happened was go find me used to their business he used to be based\nOn charging a percent\nTo people for having to go find me page plus the credit card merchant processing phase now they are laminated um the money

it's just so many people are used that successfully but I could not get any feedback at the time from Facebook's ... a fundraiser Programme I'd known anybody that had used it\nI'd never and our first

she saw that were like anything to kill us just ... will probably you probably like a little bit more money than I Do\nKnow that that is generally good advice and the fact that you're being skeptical

can I serve you\nWell I'm a few years from a retirement for non charity or a non profit and um I have a full three day and a traditional i._r._a.\nAnd a couple of other sources of income that will be available and I'm retired but I keep getting emails from an organization that a\n... is pushing something called an infinite banking concept and I can't find out anything about it except that looks like it's tied to a [noise] a dividend paying whole life insurance\nYeah yeah player and got it and they'll\nPut that forward to that for insurance and that I just didn't know it was a a viable thing for retirement income\nYou know I don't like this at all and it was something that has been patched so many different ways in recent years I've had a lot of calls recently that people have referred to it as a seven oh two Jay ... and things like that where\nWhere the people pitching this stuff make it sound like it's magical then it's like a loophole in the tax code or whatever and life insurance does have a in certain circumstances\nSome tax advantage to it but the problem with using the whole life insurance\nAs a vehicle to find some amount of retirement is that the expenses and commission so involved with the whole life insurance policy are so gigantic bit and the efficiency of your money\nIs not very good there's such a focus on if you do this you're going to avoid tax\nThat that's the whole big pitch but one thing you mentioned you said you were doing a regular IRA do you know what so superior\nTo this strategy that it's being pitched around whole life insurance\nAnd on any time somebody calls me and asked me about using whole life insurance is a way to pay for retirement and I'll ask for you fully finding a Roth IRA\nRoss IRA beats fanning life insurance policy\nThree hundred and sixty five days this year 'cause there's only three sixty five is not a leap year leap year and beat at three hundred and sixty six days so your darling you're doing good strategies the only modification I Would make\nIs instead of contributing to a regular IRA anymore I always instead contribute to a Roth IRA\nWell if if I only have like two years or so to retire lend is that going to pay off\nWell I don't know how much money you would put into a whole life insurance policy right\nWell I'm not going to do that at all\nOkay but if you worry if you were considering and you were thinking of doing that whatever money you would have potentially put into that put that instead into a raw you put aside up to your past age fifty\nSo you put in up to sixty five hundred dollars max but you can put in whatever you can afford into a Roth and the fact that you're approaching retirement\nDoesn't take away from the advantage of a raw because we're a Roth\nIs so great is its flexibility you put money in it you retire you're not working anymore but the money in their can continue to grow tax free for years and years and years to come until maybe later in retirement when you need it and then you spend it tax free\n...\nSo that's why the Ross partly so you're Enron man\nThat I put my could but in sixty five hundred a year and the traditional would you recommend that I'd just stop that if I can do about stuff that and put it into law\nExactly okay\nExactly 'cause you're already are doing that for three B. plan you're already doing a lot of pre tax stuff\nI Want you to have some post tax money that will not be tax later and that's why doing the Roth IRA in my mind would be preferable option to doing the traditional i._r._a. but anybody's pitches about how\nThe magic of whole life insurance is going to create this\nFor well for you and you're gonna cheat the government goes you're gonna have to buy him any tax is you're going to be able to pull all this money out tax free\nYuck yuck yuck I hate it you're listening to the Clark Howard show [noise]\nAnd border protection officials say more than five thousand additional us troops are being deployed

oh well thank you how about yourself good good you want to talk about your mom\nYes my mother is Ninety years young and she has decided to sell her home kindly so\nShe has been living on her own up to Ninety years of age\nUh she'll just about eight months ago yes wow very aggressive\nAh yes very um so what she did with the proceeds from the home she purchased another home she's going to continue living with me\nAnd so the money will be for the purpose of living expenses for her\nA living expenses or I'm a son in case she does need a care and I we had or hospital or nursing home\nOkay All right so ah and then ultimately when your mom does pass away what are her wishes with these proceeds if they're not needed for medical care or things like that\nTo be divided among her four children\nOkay All right so\nI Would say that at her age you've got to just play it as simple as possible because you don't know what point she might need some medical care may need to be in an assisted living or whatever and there's going to sound so unbelievably conservative\nBut I Would put the proceeds into a simple\nSavings account Wally yeah because you\nTold me that the proceeds from this she's really not going to need they're all going to be inherited by her children\nThan I Would recommend something completely different I Would recommend investing the money and the wedding at our grow 'til the time of her passing that hopefully you're still a long way from now maybe she'll break the century mark\nAnd ... and then you'd be able to whoever it would be the executor would be able to distribute those proceeds but in a case where you don't know if the money's going to be needed for her care you can't really invest\nIt OK correct that that's what I was worried about it and so that's why\nThe proceeds need to go into his simple savings but not at a traditional banks should be at an online bank where right now you can earn about two and a quarter\nPercent okay and then the monies available as it's needed and if it's not needed then ultimately a it would be distributed per her wishes yet so nothing exotic here no real way and\nIf you go on or give me a couple of

joins us on the Clark Howard show Hi John\nHi Carl how are you so much for taking my call ... or you\nGreat you want to talk about your daughter\n... my daughter is a skier students and we were planning on going to community college and we sleep changes she wants to go to the in state college which cost about twelve thousand dollars a year without truly board\nTwelve thousand dollar tuition used to be considered there'd be a giant amount for in state at a State University or flagship State University and today that's actually probably a little on the low side\nA lot of states for in state tuition\nSo that's why she gets on to go to the state for the theater program you know I've been listening to you for a while and my concern is is\nHer getting it should as we don't have enough to pay that\nHere for four years [noise] and it being theater and I'm more I my wife wants her to follow her dream and do whatever she wants more and a conservative side not white hair to getting a gag and so forth after you know I listen to you that's a major concern for me\nSo my wife was a theater major in college\nYeah it is an actress and loves every minute of it except for the fact that your income is so we're regular and you never know when you're going to be working because actors live their lives being unemployed you know Sunni at one job man made it from the actress\nPart she wants me and ... feet are designed like ... design\nWhere you know that our signers are set designers if they break through actually have potentially more stable income than the actors were forming on stage but your concern is a valid one from a dollars and cents standpoint\nThat if she borrows money for school which is say she borrowed dress the tuition for getting room and board country live at home is the university near when I was\nLiving at home and we plan on ... you know playing a majority of it but we won't be able to you know pay the whole thing\nShowing worse and worse case scenario ...\nPer year\nHow much per year\nAbout four to five thousand dollars for a year per year for her to borrow\nThen when I Would relaxes or father letter per se dream\nWould say that's not enough borrowing to be a crisis for her if she graduates with less than twenty thousand dollars in student loan debt or west\nThat will not be a problem for her even if she were to face periods of ... under employment unemployment she'll just have to hustle and and and work part time doing other things but there could be a compromise is well I could throw out to you\nGot me more than ... [laughter]\nSo I Would say the compromise is that you ... pursue her dream she gets her major in theater designed but she also gets a minor in something that is a practical thing they could be a fallback kind of position for all we\nWe discuss ... so she said that she would go for communication is you know to make us happy so she'll be getting a could double degree\nSo communications wouldn't make me happy because it's not something that specifically translates into some kind of clear career path or some way that she fall back on for income I Would like somebody who is a little meteor in terms of something very different\nThan the arts arts degree that she'd be getting from the theater department\nBut having even a minor in something that is that is a good thing to fall back on weather does she have any stem mind you know um computer technology data ...\n... ... with the computers she's good at math but her passion each has its theater so\nI got that the soil so she had where he did that as her major and did some minor where she picks up we know ours and it could be designing a Web design something like that she had that would also be a skill that would help her very much get into a theater\nBecause they need those skills to\nPay and so I I Would want her to put her major energy into her passion and her minor in energy into something that would earn her some money
