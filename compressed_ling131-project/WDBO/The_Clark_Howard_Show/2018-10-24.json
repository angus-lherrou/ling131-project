O. new records out today casting doubt on Democrat Andrew Gillum exploration of how we got tickets to the Hamilton Broadway show back in twenty sixteen his opponent\nRhonda saved is asking about it during the debate on Sunday would kill him saying he did not take anything for free his campaign says the tickets came\nThey somehow gravitate back to the brand names because a dollar in your wallet just doesn't feel is important\nWhen the dollars have gotten a little fatter and your wallet and to me a dollar is important at all times but I wouldn't be me\nDidn't feel that way right Amy's with us on the Clark Howard show Hi Amy\nHi Clark thank you for taking my call sure how are you doing I'm doing well thank you\nSo you have a bit of a conundrum that let's see if I can be of help to you\n[laughter] yeah actually it's my daughter who um seems to have lost her birth certificate and her Social Security card and um I Am wondering um what to do what what to offer her in terms of like\nWell the most important thing that would be an immediate move is to freeze her credit file if she has not done that yet\nYeah we've she's done that\nSo if she's done those things you cannot change the Social Security number there's almost no circumstances where the Social Security administration will change or number so for her if or is it possible the card was stolen\nI mean it's not it it's I think there's a small chance that it was it wasn't um it it's been in this place and it might have been misplaced in a place where somebody could have picked it up\nAnd taken it although it's really hard to know so I I guess I just want to make sure that any event somebody does have it that um you know we figure out what to do to try to prevent something from happening\nWhere you know I talk about credit freeze is something I Want everybody to do anyway\nBut in her credit freeze is very valuable because with the information if the information from the birth certificate\nAnd the Social Security card with its number on it if those two items fell in the hands of a criminal that's like opening it up wide for identity theft and applying for creditors if\nThey're her applying for um service with companies as if they're her and so by having the credit frozen it's like the perfect example of how to deal with the perfect storm of key personal information being out there\nSo they do pay not really anything else for her to do other than a day when the time comes that she needs to fall her credit for some ... I Would like her to sign up with credit karma and credit sesame\nSo that she's a monitor and going on\nAt all times of what's going on with their stuff both of those are free to use you can't set out with them while you're credits frozen though\nMhm so yeah she actually she does have a credit card accounts oh\nGood good that's great so we'll have realty to monitor anyway and she's got it frozen so the monitoring is really if somebody were able somehow to defeat their credit freeze system and so she's done which she should and\nYou know getting a new copy of her birth certificates very easy and most jurisdiction huh and the replacement Social Security cards not hard either\nSo getting new documents that it's not hard it's worrying about what somebody might do with the documents that were misplaced that's the part that's aggravating\nOkay and that's basically those that are basically the things that she has to do and and she doesn't have to notify um you know the Social Security um office or um any of those any official office or you\nKnow and how old is she\nShe's twenty nine\nYeah so that's not really an issue you know if we're if she were in our fifties or early sixties and her Social Security card had gone missing I Would recommend a process with Social Security where you can set up\nOr something called my Social Security were you able to monitor that nobody is attempting to do an application to Social Security but\nIt twenty in her twenties that's not an issue\nOkay great so she's great great thank you very much for your advice\nAnd best to her and it sounds like a situation that could be messy she's well protected by having that credit freeze already there generally is with us on the car coward show Hi Kimberley\nHi Clark how're you doing\nI'm doing well how are you\nGood Kimberly I'm so glad to have you here because I have had quite a bit of feedback and the two occasions that I've talked about people doing their own a T straightening\nAnd you have a perspective on that that you wanted to make sure that listeners heard about the idea of buying one of these at home she's straightening cuts\n[noise] yeah absolutely um being a business manager for a dental office you know there there are issues around direct to consumer or sit on it we all see that I really feel like the vast majority of consumers may not be aware of\nA hit us with because what you're going to share as the perspective of when things go wrong because I hear plenty from people who've used the at home a T stringers bit are thrilled with the result but I'm not hearing from the people who you\nAre privy to tell me what kinds of things are fouling people up\nShore so it's not the appliance itself the appliance\nStructurally is going to be very similar if not identical\nTo a clear line or that you would get from your dentist or it honest uh where are the issues come in and we're we seen all health issues and in some cases costly oral health issues not to mention painful [noise] uh it really comes from now on the line or itself\nBut the active straightening a patient peace without the ... percent supervision of a dentist orthodontist\nRings on what kind of uh things make people vulnerable that are using these at home a T straightening cuts\nYeah yeah that's a great question [laughter] ah you know really any oral health issues and particularly a oral health issues that haven't been diagnosed\nThe big one is going to be gum disease or particularly\nAdvanced gum disease or\nYou know so any time with with gum disease involved or if there's really any number of procedures that a patient would need things like ... or a root canal or crown that hasn't been diagnosed and hasn't been done or you can cause severe damage to your key um\nWhat brought this issue up for me as a patient and or is it on his treated a adult patient who is a threat teeth torso loose adult permanent fees or so loose and\nLooked like I was watching a video of a child losing baby teeth smiling it's shocking um but that patient tied advance gum disease I just didn't know it [noise]\nSo let me ask a question Kimberly if somebody is going to a dentist for teeth cleaning and exams on a regular basis twice a year they're going to be\nAware already aren't they that they would have gum disease\n[laughter] yes and that's more of the ideal candidate you know if you're gonna do or sit on a treatment\nWithout the direct supervision of it in a store or hit on it you want to have been regularly see your dentist to ensure that your mouse it's healthy enough for that so that's the exact uh you you know in most cases is uh that can help mitigate problem ah you know however there\nCan still be issues that come up just in the process of straightening teeth that even if you've been cleared by her dentist you can still have issues I'm One of the bigger ones that I hear about and I talked\nTo a patient last week about is that she she kept describing it neither her teeth or claiming and banding together and the more that I talked to I realized that what she was saying she doesn't Dario uncomfortable painful what she was saying that she can't close her upper and lower\nTeeth are so that's another part important part of the orthodontics process it's\nHarder to really address you know when you're not seeing a patient in person is not just straining or cheat but a lining their teeth so they stay together comfortably when\nBetween work the kids' school schedule the holidays that are approaching this is now becoming one of the busiest times of the year and
