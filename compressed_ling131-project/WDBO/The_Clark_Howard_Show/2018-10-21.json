is when I really started developed a passion for craft beer\nFirst one or the editor of ... dot com joins us as we celebrate cigar October fest talking about the state of the beer industry and just kind of looking at trends and taste and what's going on\nSo Chris ... how did you uh uh how long has that been around and the ... I'll tell you the website is fantastic ... tons and tons of information which I enjoy it it's on one of my book mark pages that I a scholar every week stuff's about ...\nYeah so a broadband as part of a large organization called ... ah we're a business to business trade company we posed a business conferences around the country we have three different websites one for a non alcoholic beverage professionals one for\nUm a food professionals in one for beer professionals and we publish daily a brew bound I think was launched um you know right around two thousand ten thousand eleven at the time it was just sort of a a pet project internally for a couple of guys here\nA horse were super into beer and they didn't really um you know how much direction or you know what they wanted to do with it at the time um and our our owner John ah you know kind of took the project on and said let's expand and into the beer space and\nUm yeah it it sort of transition from more of a a blog site into a full fledged a daily news publication um so I came on board\nI think my uh my first day was a gosh uh January tenth two thousand eleven um and I think that week we had\nI don't know maybe a hundred or a hundred and fifty people visit the site and now we're going to have over five million page views this year\nIncredible it is a great site tons of information and when we look at the explosion of the beer industry specifically it's really been the craft beer movement\nThat has really provided all the growth and I think it's a testament to that is the fact that the big boys if you can't beat them join them and he's seen in ... Bush we should all the the big guys come in and start to acquiring\nA number of these craft brewers or or boutique brewers and ah they're there and and so it's kind of an interesting\nWave of what is going on right now and there seems to be a little backlash from some of the a diehard ... brewing aficionados [noise]\nYeah so over the last few years I'd say I mean you\nYou can sort of trace back much of the merger acquisition activity to [noise] um I'd say two thousand I think it was two thousand eleven when goose island or was purchased by Anheuser Busch um and that was really sort of their first their first acquisition and\nI don't think they even really new kind of what they were going to be doing I'm In the crafts base when when they bought the silent out of Chicago\nUm and their strategy didn't really develop until a few years after that I'm so they sort of a plot it of course for a regional strategy buying breeze and different areas of the country I'm In fact in in Tampa where you are they a game really really close to a purchasing cigar city\nUm ... yeah and and that deal fell through 'em and cigarettes and he ended up selling to a different um craft brewery collective uh called can Artie um which was formed a by the founder of of Oscar booze out of Colorado\nOr as well as a private equity firm here in the Boston area firemen capital partners so um\nYou know we've seen a lot of deals says obviously Anheuser Busch has gotten into the space pretty heavily spent a lot of money and inquired about ten different breweries a Miller corps has a few breweries that they've purchased over the last couple of years that constellation has three breweries funky Buddha and your neck of the woods\nUm that I purchased um Heineken purchase log and eat it so I'm everyone sort of has a their their craft a brewery horse if you will and the race um and then we've also seen a lot of transactions on the private equity side so\nI'm you know really since I got into this space or it's been sort of a flurry of a ... a activity it really picked up um you know twenty fourteen twenty Fifteen twenty sixteen slow it a little bit last year and it's been\nA relatively quiet this year as well as everybody's plates are pretty much full\nChris wrote Ari editor ... dot com is our guest Christmas interesting you mentioned the some of the company cigar city brew enjoy reading or we do very well we've done numerous shows from there we've kind of watched as she's gone from a very small operation and to\nA large state wide now certainly a more of a regional type of distribution I'm southern tier brewing\nWho you mentioned talking about some private equity getting involved southern tier now purchased I think ah another ... and I want to see Charlotte if I'm not mistaken or somewhere or Philadelphia maybe and uh so they've now kind of gotten together a you mentioned funky Bhutto we've done we've had them on and in fact they were involved in our ... pleasure festival flight line\nLast year there beers are phenomenal and it's very interesting so what we're seeing is these really creative a entrepreneur brew master type ... and and and just entrepreneur is that come up with these just totally different unique tastes and packaging ideas the big guys come in and the concern is always\nOkay are they gonna do to those companies what they normally do whereas they buy successful company they buy it because it's successful ... because it's got a great marketing dish\nAnd then all of a sudden they say well we're smarter we've got more MBAs we're going to tweak it and then they kinda destroy the company there's always that does that balance you see\nSome of that starting to happen [noise] I'm\nNot so much I think ah we've actually seen sort of the opposite I'm you\nKnow I think it would be kinda foolish to spend as much money as they they they spent on these companies and then you know want to run them into the ground or um you know jettisoned them somehow I don't think that they're\nThey're buying these uh these properties to somehow kill the category of ... which is\nI guess um you know a a misnomer um they're buying grows they're buying brands that are\nUh that that consumers are gravitating towards and and they want to participate in the segment so we we haven't seen that quite as much um now that being said I think that they may be misunderstood a kind of where the market was going in some cases so if you look at constellation for instance\nThey spent a billion dollars buying Dallas point out of San Diego thinking that they'd be able to have this national a craft beer brand and you know kind of scale it and that consumers would um you know continue to love the ... brand at a national level and\nReally what we've seen since that transaction is\nUh the hyper local as a nation of craft and um you know the the ... that are the the larger companies that purchase breeze in different pockets of the country and focus more on a regional strategy you're actually faring a bit better\nYeah you know your interesting mentioning talking about the local type of craft brewers are very close to the ah John sheet resource senior or junior of Hamburg brewing up in the buffalo area and there you know market really primarily as western New York and and you know Rochester buffalo going\nTrump can do shows very soon today but I Will

B. E. M. to soften the Buffalo News here's the headline from a two days ago new craft breweries have opened in western New York with lots more planned in coming months\nThey're looking at a one two three four five six seven eight\nAbout eight to ten new\nCap rooms and some micro breweries a and in fact what's interesting is there's ... house that they've been working on trying to open for the last\nI think I don't know three four years and getting a gestures and a ... brewing actually which is based in Buffalo they're opening their own ... brew house so it's kind of interesting to see how in in pockets of the country the enthusiasm for beer and brewing houses in chat rooms is a is she'll she'll growing\n[laughter] yeah you know I think um it's\nTo me it's looking more and more kind of like a restaurant business uh right you know if you think about uh just the way that ah these breweries are financed and you know the way that lenders operate to um you know they're they're lending a significant amount of money\nTo actually build out so they're spending on construction to build out the abilities and to build out these tap rooms and then you know make them look beautiful and and that's not money that a bank that we're getting back um so it is very similar to the restaurant business right there's not a whole lot of\nAssets that they're that they're actually financing other than the equipment I'm so ... in in my opinion or any of these operations that started up I think that they should be trying to do it as lean as possible take on as little as possible and open as quickly as possible and start selling\nBeer directly to consumers at the highest margin possible so that they can service that debt and get you know quickly get to profitability\nAnd and you know what's interesting is when you look at some of them look at some pictures of some of these places are they have a picture of community beer works up in Buffalo that open this past summer\nAnd again nice ah interior not overly crazy uh but that seems to be now the place where people you know want to congregate and hang out not necessarily a a a club where there's banging music and it's just loud and didn't you know crazy lights\nIt seems there's been a shift it's almost like the ... of yesteryear and this is what you're seeing more of a socialized social atmosphere and I think you hit it right on the head that if you could open up\nNot go crazy you don't have to be the biggest you don't have to be the best you don't have to have a three million dollar build up in fact a lot of the successful ones are the ones that are ... ... they they just make good beer and and people will go regardless of you know whether it's a three hundred thousand dollar build out or a third three billion dollar bill that\nYeah exactly I think the bigger question though for me at least is you know how sustainable that model is um you know if you have ah two breweries on on a on a city block and then two more open\nYou know you haven't created any new customers now there's just for companies competing for the same customers that were walking down the street right so I'm ... ... on one hand yeah they're bringing a lot of excitement and enthusiasm the category but on the other hand\nYou know does the industry ... kind of turning it back on traditional bars and restaurants and if so you know what the ramifications of that you know five ten Fifteen Years down the road\nWhat we've seen a number of restaurants that have actually gone and within the restaurant creating a small it almost micro micro brewery just to create some of their own beer and kind of as an attraction we've seen that a number of restaurants here in the\nIn the eastern city of Tampa but I'm seeing that more and more where restaurants are looking saying you know what we want to get in on this action we don't want to go crazy but they're still kind of unique market to do that yeah\nI mean I think you know we we talked about the opening and closing more breweries are going to continue to open for sure and we're seeing you know I think what like two two and a half breweries opening per day is is the is the clip\n'em and and that will probably continue in ... into next year I don't know when exactly it'll slow down many people think that\nUh there could be as many as ten thousand breweries and brew pub throughout the United states here very shortly um and most of those again are going to be pretty small tapper and focused or like the ones that that are mentioned\nIn that article from from New York so it'll be interesting to kind of see how it all shakes out in long term you know how many of these businesses survive I think you know the big\nThe big looming question overall this is like can we get more consumers to drink beer at a time when their sales are you know overall relatively flat because\nYou know if you think about it just like a bar you can stick more attacks in the wall but that doesn't mean you're going to sell more beer you still have to get more consumers and your door right so the same kind of rule or theory applies to the to the broader industry yeah you can have them thousand breeze but if you're not creating new consumers than you know who's drinking all the beer\n[noise] Chris ... dot com joins us today as we celebrate cigar October fest Chris let's take a look at some of the breweries that are really starting to expand that have been successful in their own markets that maybe\nYou are are are a ton of stores are ... that are listening should be on the lookout for I Know for example Brooklyn Brewery started in Brooklyn they've now grown to do I think we're twenty nine or thirty states across the country but give us some names of breweries that are really starting to grow\nThat we may be able to find their products that we haven't been able to the last number of years yeah for sure\nUm there are a few that come to mind a you know if you think about uh now that the the trend is obviously more local right so a lot of these companies that are growing um tend to have tighter distribution footprint so access to their beers\nA for a lot of your listeners might be a bit of a challenge um but you know some of the names that come to mind in terms of you know really successful uh quickly emerging\nCompanies would be a like a Ryan Guy brewery out of Cincinnati I'm Melvin brewing out of Wyoming\nAh there's a company in our backyard that expanded quite rapidly I'm lord hobo brewing um and and their beers or actually available down there in Florida and out on the west coast so they've taken a slightly different approach um you look at a company like three weavers uh which was a choir there out of LA\nUm you'd better be well capitalized\nUm you know I think a third leave you should have a really strong tap room and you should be um you know in an area where there is some foot traffic or at least\nBeing an area where people can easily access you um I think that because there are so many breweries out there now and because so many more breweries have opened up either satellite tap rooms or places to experience the brand in you know within a city [noise] um\nThe days of sort of being in an industrial park you know thirty miles outside of a a major hub and you know expecting that people will travel there every single day or every single weekend\nUm I think that you know those days are sort of fleeting as well\nYou have something really really special you know that they can't get anywhere else um so I think those would be the things that I Would look at\nAll right we will look wrapping up our final concluding segue was Christopher in our area brew bound dot com and we got back we'll give some are

over subpoenaed materials to Congress\nWell I don't think there's any question that Congress has dropped the ball on of course it gets so to pay his but let me just say this because this is really
