O. J.\nSo that I I think that is what needs to be called for first\nUm and and and maybe ... you know that that that needs to happen first prior I mean it just that there's nothing else there's no other way around it today in stupidity came so anything oh are you from Louisville\nAnd pulled out of straw Jim Acosta 'em by the way that the history of the media to downplay\nThings like during the Obama administration the downplayed ISIS the dump their well this is the cost of downplaying the whole migrant caravan cause your journalism at work\nWhile doesn't really give us a any clear guidance as to what the role of these are soldiers will\nBe they've already tried to show National Guard troops down to the border as sort of a show of force measure measure and all these migrants are about a thousand miles away and they're not going to be here anytime soon so to call this an invasion or it might be the most pathetic uh invasion of our country in world history of if this were actually an invasion but of course it's not\nGood so uh what do you call thousands of people who have\nProfessed to come to the border in want in demand and tree I don't understand why it's being downplayed but this was the stupidity of some of the news media out there and they are the ones that are actually putting this out all the while pointing fingers at others for being politically divisive and are inaccurate and ... show\nRight now where you go I go so that folks concludes our show today have a happy and safe Halloween and I will be back with you tomorrow [noise]\n\nMaybe six point five ...\nIs news maybe six point ... how do you ... turns worse for breaking\nStarts\nEight o'clock at night to point five WBAL our top story this hour [noise]\nFlorida\nA long time candidates Ron dissent is and Rick Scott\nJohn in our country and just six days the people of Florida are going to Rick Scott to the United states [noise]\nCapital one and discover\nOr both doing things to reduce the chances that they're going to get burned and they're doing it or you choosing their own strategy but I wanted to tell you the two most common things you'll see and they'll come out of nowhere\nOne is where an issue where we'll just shut you down\nAnd the most common reason that they'll shut you down is because of lack of use of a card\nAnd I think just lately how many calls I've had about that on the show people who have out of the blue gotten a notice from their credit card to ensure that due to extend it an activity that their accounts being closed we had one\nLast week from someone who had a notice that they had to use their card by a certain date or they'd be shut down that's a little friendlier\nBut the point is issue where's had become nervous and if you have not use the card at all which usually referred to as a backup wallet card you want to strategically use those I've recommended in the past they use the card twice a year\nJust so that as far as the issue or system is concerned that's an active in use card who's you don't want to have out of the blue in issue or shut down a card because that affects your credit score potentially in a big way by reducing the total amount of your available credit\nThe other thing that's been happening is people are suddenly finding their credit limits\nDrastically reduced so if you have a credit limit of let's say five thousand dollars you may get a notice it's being cut to eight hundred\nOr twelve hundred or whatever that also dramatically affects your overall credit score and standing with issue we're starting to pull in the rain some here's my recommendations in addition\nTo remembering to use cards that you have forgotten that you even half\nThe next thing I Want you to do is if you have very few pieces of plastic\nOne or two in particular\nAbsolutely if you have only one credit card I Want you to apply and get a second one you don't want to be in a position where if the issue we're the only car do you have dumps you you then have no credit trying to get new credit if you have two cards\nI like you to go to the safety of having a third one with the potential of insurers dialing back wanting customers\nSo you want to create more breathing room in your credit wife to protect yourself and remember this with credit card issuers getting nervous\nMissing a payment for any reason just cause ... for God\nOr oh I was travelling or\nYou know over Christmas I I just didn't remember to look at my bills oh make sure you get\nPayments in Syria shores on time even if you have to take an old fashioned thing like a piece of paper and write down who your bills are and when payments are due and check 'em off manually just see you remember to always get payments and particularly when patterns or abnormal\nDuring the whole period from Thanksgiving through New Years just as the patterns are so abnormal in their regular during summertime\nChristie's with us on the Clark Howard show Hi Christie\nHi Claire how's it going Christie great\nChristie you got a question for me about how to make sure you have money before you run out of ... years\n[laughter] yeah thank you so much for taking my question and then what our best sorry don't be nervous were just having fun here\n[laughter] I've been listening here forever so it's like it's a real honor to talk to 'em but I was wondering if you had an alternative to what we always hear that four percent role as far as the ... and retirement [noise]\nWell I I Love the four percent rule and let me explain what that is so that others know with that is mathematically\nYou're very likely never are the odds are very low you'd ever run out of all your money if you never spent more than four percent of what you've saved in any year and retirement now there is an alternative that I can tell you that I have\nAh been really interested in in recent years because of the fact that we don't know there's no crystal ball says exactly how long we're going to whip and the big concern is if we're blessed with exceedingly long life\nThat our money may not stretch as long as our years might so there's something called longevity insurance have you ever heard that term before\nHe I've heard you talk about that\nSo longevity insurance works generally I'm most commonly where you just try to make your money last 'til age eighty five\nAnd then early and retirement you buy was a pretty cheap policy\nThat provides a big monthly benefit every month that you live beyond age eighty five they're counting on the fact that most people's life spans won't go that long and they just get to keep the premiums from those who don't live that long and then if somebody does\nGet lucky in the longevity department there okay money wise because from their eighty fifth birthday forward for as long as they live they get a huge check every month that will cover\nPretty much anything you'd want to spend money on unless you like I'm buying gold jewelry all the time are flying in front of us or whatever\n[laughter] 'cause I always you always hear about the four percent role was not touching the egg and I was just wondering if people who don't have children or don't have anyone younger than than you know to leave the egg to if you're not worried about that what kind of numbers should way they thinking\nAll right so that's the beauty of the longevity insurance is that you spend all your money that you have\nEvery last sent you have the day you turn eighty five you got nothing basically and then the insurance takes you the rest of their way but in your family tree how long do people tend to live\nUm it has has varied and it's kind of all over the place so so people have with an end to their nineties some people just until the early seventies\nSo I you know in my family it the range as much wider than that\nUh how how young people die and I'm getting close to my expiration date is a male and my family tree already so who knows what I've got in front of me but um I play on where I'm OK moving forward and in my case I Do have\nFamily that it's going to be behind me so the question I ask often if you're worried about uh you know living to frugal life and you hit a point where you've got all this money leftover is there any charitable organization that really means a lot to you\nOh yeah and I don't think it's a matter of how they kill lots [laughter] having just into probably more like a ... for the oil and the president\nBecause there is an angle on a charitable giving where you can give money to an organization and then they in turn essentially set up the equivalent of a pet\nAnd for you and as long as you're living they send you or a company that they've contracted with sends you a check every month for the rest of your life and then at the time you do pass away they're done paying you and they have the benefit of the money you donated\nYeah\nOkay and so that would be an alternative but I'm the four percent rule\nMakes sense in that later in life you if you do end up with longer life like one of your family members that lives in their nineties\nYou tend to have more medical expenses later you may need help from you know may need somebody assisting you you know I'm with living\nIn that case you've got the money and what you preserved to provide for the care you might need later in life even if you decided not to buy a longevity insurance policy\nRyan's with us on the car coward show Hi Ryan\nHow are you doing\nGreat thank you Ryan you have an impossible question for me pretty much\nWhat I

there's a changing attitude about screens where we go in all the rest Facebook just reported results that we're really not good for them at all and people are starting to say wait a minute\nWith all this technology and all this time on screens because we know as adults\nHow we can really be addicted to our phones and I notice everywhere I go now because I travel a lot so I'm Out and about in airports in public spaces and people have this stoop\nAnd it looks like they were going to get a full caveman stoop overtime\nAs humans as we continually are looking down and the addiction is real but no one is more affected by it then children and I saw a story and the New York times that I thought was really really\nImportant for you to think about and that is that people who work in the technology field are very anti\nChildren being around screens with people who work in Silicon valley\nHad banned screens from their kids and one of the moves in school systems in the Silicon Valley is no computers no tablets\nObviously no phones that kids learn the old fashioned way with books and paper and truck ports\nAnd no screens at all that it's even referred to as a digital divide that people who work in the digital field don't want anybody in their family to be an screens because they work with it every day they're the ones that are trying to get you and me addicted but think about a kid\nAnd then think about young children really young children I don't know if you saw this there was a study that was done at the University of Michigan they found that Ninety five percent of apps that are geared towards the all important preschool market\nOn tablets that Ninety five percent of the Arabs have ads and them\nAnd their kids don't have a sense of the difference between an ad in fact until well a lot of adults don't either but anyway kids don't have that reasoning power until they're like in the fourth or fifth grade\nThat an ad is looked at as real and the kid will say that I'm not that I Want that I Want that\nAnd so you can have this problem with kids wanting to do in app purchases at three years old you better not on your tablet have any payment form sword with apple

you are someone who has a really nice person has a landlord but that's where it in ... huh\nAll right so let's think about eight years now a like a like I said I have a great relationship with my lab or however we definitely need here though oh I'm I'm Wondering what the best way I thought about I guess getting hurt out she's actually in another state\nWho and she doesn't use a property manager right so what I recommend if there are things that are nagging that need repairing\nShe probably doesn't want to deal with them and it may even be just the hassle even more than the cost\nOf actually I'd want to lose a tenant so would I Would recommend is that you send her pictures of what needs repairing and say you know that you know she's across she's not nearby and then it's a hassle for her that you are willing to\nOversee the repairs and you'll even pay for them and just a duck the costs from your rent moving forward\nI think it was before so out of that uh that I guess like anything\nBecause I'm saying that you'll go a step further anger you'll pay for repairs and oversee them that way she's not laying out the money you're adopting from your future rent for those repairs\nSo you're making sure you're there to watch the contractor make sure he or she does a good job you're paying for it but you're only laying out the money in advance that you're getting back with the offset of rent\n[noise] gosh I think\nThat his work so well for so many people may not every landlords gonna agree to it but if she somewhere else in the country all she wants from that place she wants to check\nRight so if you're in a position where she can't handle the things that need to be handled the rich she faces is that you say you know I really like you but I got to move\nAnd then her rent income coming in goes to zero and before she can rent to somebody else she's going to probably have to do the repairs anyway so then she's got no money coming in and she's having to lay out money for the repairs\n... All right well I appreciate the information\nAnd you know what if she blows you off on doing it where you take the burden off of her what does that tell you\nThat Israel writes Bernie's with us on the

is that you can only save money on the things around your trip like where you stay where you eat\nBut you will find it extremely frustrating trying to save money on the actual admissions\nOkay and that's just the way it is a there is something that you may have heard and that's that\nDisney and universal now we're using variable pricing or what is often referred to as dynamic demand pricing where what you pay\nTo get into the parks is based on demand either historical demand for the day you want to go or rolling demand for the day you want to go to the price is no longer necessarily the price\nDisney is now set rates where you can go look at a calendar and see what it costs for each day at the park and Disney isn't using a huge number of prices yet\nBut that's one way you can save a little bit of money is you take the grand kids at a time that Disney's charging its lowest prices per day\nHere we were actually looking to November course and nobody wants to go to Florida in June July and August [noise] uh we were actually looking at November with which you know my wife's big into the Christmas decorations and we'll figure that you know she could get a lot of satisfaction out of that it wouldn't be as hot so\nWe found that some of the prices during that time of year is a little relaxed and the crowds are not as bad either for what we are here\nExactly you have the cheapest two weeks historically of the year or actually in early December right after the Thanksgiving holiday ends I don't know if that's the time that you have a kid\nWhen postal workers early December is

Maus savers dot com no\nGo check out that site that's for people who just love everything about Walt Disney and at the same time they are really into saving money and they post a continuous stream of updated deals every single day\nOkay\nAlso trip advisor doesn't do as good a job is mal savers but has enormous information about Orlando central Florida all the various attractions\nAnd may be a way to improve your trip and may be saved me a little bit of money to\nOkay now I Do have one more quick question said something about you got to roll call for Thirteen dollars a day now I Know that's a real accomplished probably\nSalute you and you walk in the door and say okay we got to give him the best deal possible but how did you do that Thirteen dollars a day\nNobody nobody's giving me a special deal because I Walk out because I bought my car rental specials ahead of time okay and I do a number of things to look for deals I always start\nAt Expedia dot com because Expedia does a great survey of all the car rental companies\nOkay and so you can see the prevailing rate that everybody has and that'll give me what I Need to know that then go to price flying dot com and beard on a car rental\nOkay you know most of the really cheap car rentals I get are from ...\nYou know I've never used price line for cars but I have used them several times for hotels and I've never really follow that for that is a good idea\nIn addition to doing that I have information at ... dot com about how not to get taken that the car rental counter 'cause I get so many complaints about people getting taken advantage of on the car rentals\nYeah I heard some of your advice that you were talking about surcharges that might be added in when you turn a Korean or even in the contract sometimes as your side of the\n... so you're up to date on that one other thing is that you would be wise to book a car rental early\nAnd then re shop at me and once you do a price on bit if they accept it you can't do this step but he won't haven't booked price I just spoke to a regular car rental from wherever the week before you go ... shop your car rental\nAnd I'd say at least eighty percent of the time car rental rates have dropped from when I booked early on to Barry White and car rentals there's no fee for canceling a rental except again price line which is completely non refundable\nOkay well that
