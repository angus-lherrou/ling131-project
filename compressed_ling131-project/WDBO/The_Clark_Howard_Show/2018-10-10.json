W db\nThis is six point five maybe [noise]\nYou know I see stories\nEveryone always act like they don't exist but they do and whenever you know we we have discussions about um toxic masculinity or something to that effect there's always these ... there's a ton of these stories friend let me just say this idea this was just last week since October ...\nHigh school click a five mean girls are sued for targeting a boy with false sexual assault allegations because they just don't like him\nHis parents are now suing the girls and snack valley for damages the unnamed boy was fired from his job and forced to serve time in juvenile detention the girls later admitted to making all the allegations just because they quote don't like him\nNow twenty six page federal ... has been filed in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania on the eve of October third the boy's parents said the girls are ... a click of mean girls who conspired in person and be electronic communications devices to falsely accused the boy of sexual assault on two occasions\nHe's now home schooled and has psychological trauma because the girls bullied him and then later admitted to line about their claims\nAnd then they said that the sun experienced gender biased by school officials who did not take any action at\nAll against the females involved\nNone none he\nUh after the girls falsely accused him the accused and he was charged in juvenile court with indecent assault two counts of harassment he pled not guilty but they put 'em on probation um and it ruined his life they took him out of high school and he was put in leg and risk shackles\nAnd he uh was a identified as a threat to the community he spent nine days in a detention center he was sent home on house arrest\nBut finally the girls admitted that they had lied about him they said they had lied now he's got to deal with us now he's going to go to visit a psychologist because they ruined his life\nAbsolutely ruined his life and they weren't punished at all\nNone\nThere was they were not punished by the school they were not charged with false reporting\nNothing\nAnd the lawsuit and apparently there was evidence where one of the girls told classmate in October of last year that quote she would do anything to get him expelled so she made up a story about him assaulting her at the pool\n[noise] wow I feel so bad for this kid he um I I mean he was oh my gosh just ruined his life\nAnd the school district this school district oh my gosh schools definitely do participate in gender bias they absolutely do they do against boys\nAnd the district\n... it it's it's they said that the last that has been filed without merit because they're named now and parents are seeking damages because they've helped ruin this kid's life so of course now the school's going to defend itself because they're\nMore on unreal\nAnd by the way these girls had been reported apparently previously for bowling bullied and the school turned a blind eye\nBefore they even made these claims no punishment to these girl Adel whatsoever and this is a problem\nAnd there are so many I there are a lot of stories like this um I it just infuriates me no punishment for these girls there is no deterrent I think that they should have the book thrown at him and I think that they should have I think that they should uh be expelled from school I think they should be sent to Julie\nAnd I think that they should be considered dangerous to their communities will there are legal measurable damages here I Hope these parents get them for everything they got these are absolute measurable damages to this kid's life ruined his life it ruined his life\nBecause of false accusations\nIt's infuriating to me this is why honestly\nI I don't think teenage boys I think it's too dangerous because they could be falsely accused and social justice warriors they clearly hate boys\nAnd they're going to take out all of their grievances on men against boys I don't think it's safe for them to it I mean goodness we made rings chaperones bat 'cause you know who never left for such Puritans and horrible uh folks are\nToday stupidity real quick Stormy Daniels was

winds of one hundred twenty miles per hour\nOr just trying to get all the windows and stuff boarded up getting shutters on turn all the gas stuff of it you know whatever product we have all property whatever we can fit in our freezer that we have over to where health a property or trying to move everything\nEvacuations are in place across the Gulf Coast hundreds of thousands of people being ordered to leave their homes meteorologist June Jersey is an Appalachian accounting error\nBut what they did in their case is why John wanted me to share the story he said it was brutally tough but they chose not to file bankruptcy\nHe said he'd heard me talk about going to the national foundation for credit counseling\nAnd they contacted them and they directed him to a local accredited counselor and they went on a payment plan with all these credit card companies I'm sure none of which thought they were ever going to see all their money\nBecause once your debt goes credit card debt goes above fifty percent of your annual income odds are very low you're ever going to be able to pay off the debt with credit card debt was way past a hundred percent of income\nSo they sacrifice everything they could in their lives and made it work\nAnd and just under eight years John and his wife\nMade their last payment and paid off the entire hundred and Seventy thousand dollars in credit card debt today other than their mortgage which they are very little on versus the value of their house at this point you know now it's been eleven years later\nThey are almost at free\nAnd living a life of frugality they were able to make it all happen the irony and I didn't say this is John and John if you are listening and here this if you would call me eleven years ago I Would have told you that you had too much debt\nTo be able to pay it all off\nBut you had more faith in yourself and your wife and I would have in a situation where the debt total was so enormous\nAnd you made it happen\nAnd so and the spirit of what John and his wife accomplish I Want you to know that if you find yourself because credit card debt levels are rising again at a very rapid rate you find yourself facing a lot of debt know that\nYou don't give up\nThat learning better ways to handle your money\nOr if it's because you lost your job or whatever you ended up with that you got to be patient yeah I have a plan and you may have to make changes in how you spend money to tackle that debt and yes it's true eleven years later as it was done in FCC dot org\nNational Foundation for credit counseling and FCC dot org\nIs a great place for you to go for budgeting or beyond for negotiating with your creditors so you can pay off your dad's and a reasonable period of time\nSo congratulations to you John and your wife and your whole family most interesting thing John said to me was it early on it was a strain but later\nAs they made progress their marriage got even stronger as they fought through

can earn in the country now are pretty much a ad or above two percent\nAnd they're headed steadily higher towards three percent so versus one quarter of one percent would I Would do is I was a link your checking account at the credit union to a savings account at one of the online banks and start earning two percent or so\nAnd there there are now a bunch of FDIC insured accounts that you're covered up to a quarter million dollars that you can open with one of the online banks\nAnd I'm looking right now like one that heavily advertises right now Marcus Spain one point nine percent American Express paying one point nine capital one one point eight five percent I'm One that I'm not familiar with\nCalled I I go banking is paying two and a quarter another one called bank\nPurely is

bank operating systems way beyond just trying to take over an individual account at the bank but in fact to disable their computer systems at the bank\n... nobody's saying but you can just assume that it's a state actor who would try to completely disabled or computer operation at a bank even according to federal officials maybe even to wipe the data clean\nOn all account holders\nThese warnings coming from his office there is on the federal government I saw this on Wall Street Journal dispatch about this there's an office of critical infrastructure protection and compliance policy that the

contract job some other requires travel and I tried looking on ... and different apps to track those kind of ...\nBut it just seems that airs on the list as long as to what I'm looking for and I just wanted to call and get your input on that or any kind of suggestion\nSo you're looking for any of the apps that will allow you to track your expenses is you go\nYeah not only that but also if ah if they also allow how best to categorize rather than keeping receipts and piles and piles of er seats that there's some ... either more efficient or better way to go about that\nSure so there are any number of apps for both iPhone and Android most of which are free they give you the ability to track your expenses and I use one called smart receipts\nIt's not necessarily better or worse than any other it's just the one I like to use\nIn the way it works is when I have a receipt I take a picture of it with my phone\nAnd then it basically categorizes and if it doesn't know how to categorize it they'll ask me and I put it into the category it will do the driving reports if you're trying to track your driving and get reimbursement per mile\nAnd there are many of these ... and expensive fi is both a if I remember I used a website and and out\nThat allows you to track your expenses there's not any one that is like the category killer and the ... the absolute best for it but if you were to if you were to just put in as a Google or bing or whatever search\nPut an expense account apps\nAnd walk through the various reviews 'cause there are a number\nOf online reviews of different ones these expense account apps and you can see which one does best what your needs are for expense account tracking it's been great for me 'cause I don't know if you notice I Am a complete flight\n[laughter] and believe that at all it's completely true I'll be on a trip and I'll ever see for this a receipt for that receive or the other and then I'll get back in like what did I Do with that receipt were not do with that one and so now second I get the receipt I take a picture of it\nAnd then I have it and it's categorized and essentially it helps me with expense report accounting\nOn its own for each trip and it's got the date that trip started ended all that and that's why these things are so wonderful is a way to track those expenses specially when you're any kind of independent contractor a sales person where you have to keep really good expense tracking\nJim is with us on the Clark Howard show hello Jim\nHi Clark how're you doing I'm\nOut doing beyond good

that there may be because of the special circumstances of the time share and not actually existing right now that people have figured out a way to eliminate their obligation to it\nAnd this is a case

score\nCorrect I'm looking to buy my first time this year\nAnd basically true my credit union my rates are determined by my credit score so I have maybe about ten K. saved up right now you know growing it every paycheck and I have some days in collections that negatively affected my score\nAnd I'm just wondering you know well it helped my score to pay them off and and chicken are my savings and paid\nCollection debt off where am I better keeping that cash on hand for my down payment on my house I've read on line that even if you pay off things that are already in collections that has a zero impact on your credit score\nSo if you have a collection on your report that is the main factor and what happens with your credit so if you pay off\nAn old item it will raise your score potentially some but it depends on the scoring model being used how much effect it has so the newest scoring models like the new a spike oh model\nGives you a good bumping your credit score if you
