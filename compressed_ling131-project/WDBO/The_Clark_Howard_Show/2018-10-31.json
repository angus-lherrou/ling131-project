going to actually have a Tour de in Copenhagen I'm probably that'll eleven o'clock that\nMorning I got a message from a group of it was that ten at this at all went together and they said you need to hurry down we had just found out that they are going to guess embark\nAbout five hundred of us because they're worried about whether ... and are decent bark ... got to be um outside of the Early Show basically it's like you're off the ship\nIn Copenhagen and you have to take\nResponsibility quickly to find flight arrangements hotel whatever before we\nGet you to be terminated the cruise a day early\nYes yes they terminated decrees Weaver says to go in\nThere that day we that we were told we were going to be getting off the ship the next day whereas we're supposed to have a full day in Copenhagen than snake on the ship\nAnd go on to Berlin or outside of the ... the lover says to get some bar and we had flight reservations to go home from Berlin and hotel reservations but the problem of life they said okay here's a room with about four or five computers [noise] um\nYou just need to figure it out and we will reimburse you a three hundred dollars a piece for all your you know your problems and I give you\nOne day credit on the ship which was the day that we had to spend um that the credit was going to be that day we get off that the day we spent our last leisurely day there were like five hundred people in a small area trying to figure out how to go home\nWell that sounds like what was an experience turn really really sour if they are\nVery much so I asked my my uh as I did before I actually did a formal complaint and shit you know the the bottom line is the way it was handled they never made they just sent a letter to our um statement\nThey never made a formal announcement there were some people it was four or five in the afternoon before they realized that they were going to be getting off the ship the next day\nA group of us that had all come together we spent that last day frantically trying to figure out how to go home and I'm Caitlin\nPeople were in line for like seven and eight hours\nIn a very narrow hallway ...\nSo what what do you want\nNow from the cruise line for having been so careless and not carrying all about you or the other five hundred pages how did they pick which five hundred\nOut what happened was the at the white it's happened was we we embarked on the ship and Germany but there were there were people that had embarked they cut the cake\nOh so they were dumping all of you but five hundred over you were being dumped it the wrong place why right yes\nOkay sit down on one level if and actually for when you know you were you were not being dumped in Berlin anyway because Berlin is not near the low\nLevel it's it's hog more and more important to me I Can't pronounce a place\nWith him or if it was dangerous than you know if there was bad weather and all that let's take them at their word that it was dangerous having you not go into danger is preferable than having you sail under danger\nAnd that I agree with that I Will onto the website uh for the um port a which is called me a it's why Monday raw stock in Germany\nAnd I happen to see I pulled up I said I Would like to know ships came in and out and our particular ship naked in that day the day that we were supposed to get some bark\nThat ship actually with an adopted seven o'clock and it lasted twenty two hundred\nSo who knows who knows what all was going on and you may not ever hear the real\nEver know that you know what I what do you and your fellow travelers want\nOkay the the things that we would like to be totally reimbursed for any change the basic three hundred dollars a piece for us it was like four hundred and thirty dollars\nI don't know how they owe you what it actually cost you yet I've got to be easy I have a question for you and anybody else in your group were you aware of anybody in your group is meant posting on cruise critic\nHe actually have a right\nAnd the cruise lines all monitor what are people are saying on cruise critic and on social media you should stay very active and see if you can find other people who were also displaced like you were an all help each other both\nPutting it out there on social media on cruise critic and also staying in touch with each other to find out what people have been able to accomplish with the cruise line is what you should be doing and offering you a refund or the day you didn't get\nAnd not enough money to deal with uh the rescheduling and train trees and all that is ridiculous and that's why you should stay loud\nAnd keep posting and don't deal with customer know service at the cruise line because that's all you're going to get pay only responded

preparing a everything for possibly a mortgage loan next year so\nAs I've learned from you get a free annual credit report every year and I downloaded that last week something stuck out on their report and I had a dilemma about what to do so on my credit report is a credit card that my um parents opened in Nineteen Seventy six\nAnd I wasn't born until Nineteen eighty five so you know I was probably added to that credit card once upon a time as it authorized use or you know teenage or something like that so my question is do I do want parents to me as authorize user of court or has a card\nActually been helping my credit over the years\nBut it may have helped at one time but at this point I mean here you are at a point that you are I'm thirty three years old\nThat's correct and thirty three you've established your own life you of your own credit you have your own history and that are being grabbing that card listed may be irrelevant\nAnd as long as your parents are good payers it may be a little bit to the good and mayor better prior time been really to the good\n[laughter] well that's what I was looking to understand you know it's got a twenty thousand dollar limit a average monthly spend on this card is about five ... and and it's been paid on time for you know years and years and years so it definitely is in good standing\nWe are we believe it be and you know right now I have a mortgage lender and the underwriting department said ooh Ryan you got too much available credit we're worried about that\nThat would be the point at which you would check with your parents see if you are in fact and authorize user could also be an error and credit reporting\nYou're listed and so that would be the only reason you would want to have it removed is some times

months because she had a tough year she had broken every time she got out of the habits\nGoing and sorority house to house or a physical recovery going\nPretty good pretty good oh I'm Glad that\nYeah when she looked at her statement she saw a charge or a hundred extra dollars per month ...\nHundred and sixty one dollars yes so somebody's take an eight hundred and five dollars of her money or something like that\nThat train [noise] oh that's great\nAnd it seems with a credit union and they said somebody true way I'm kinda check it's made out two warring T Adnan division\nI don't know what that supposed to be but the curious thing is where they come up with her share drafter checking account number at the credit union and the first place\nWell they had he paid the they she checks all the time and all they needed her account number and your name\nThat is true\nSo maybe a credit union undoing their their credit union can stop them from drafting moving forward and she has the right to dispute the last two giraffes to yes how great you know as\nThey did give us every month facts how we were lucky with that\nBut I'm lucky in that that means that four hundred dollars is gone from her life right\nThat train and train\nAnd you know this happens every day it's unusual the amount of money involved usually it's a smaller amount that someone's drafting that goes unnoticed\nYeah this was quite large and the bank said it could happen any time say people could do it again will change count number and\nThat advice from reading your in is all accurate and uh even if it had been a a improper posed to her credit card it still would have been limited to that a two month window for disputing\nAnd so I Would recommend if you would help your mom by filing a complaint that FTC dot Gov\nIf Casey that guy's okay\nAnd the reason it's important is if she got taken other people may well get taken as well and if there's ever a civil action taken by the FTC they need to know who the victims were in order to pay back restitution if any does develop\nOkay I Will do that\nBut gosh that's terrible to take advantage of her information with the busted hip and I'm really glad the credit
