{"month": "10", "state": "FL", "station": "WDBO", "content": "It's seven receptions into Thursday night game a ... ... you had six receptions as they all seem to be okay and Josh Gordon came onto the scene and had to do receptions as well as a touchdown to have weapons now as well as white coming out of the backfield is that what the change has been from the first three weeks\nI Would say at the receiver position I mean to add the depth in quality that we have a short period of time it's great for that group you can rotate guys guys a different skill sets it makes it tougher for the defense of the fat and along with the running game that's really picked up we're playing better off instantly they have a dynamic off and it's our defenses actually gotten a lot of turnovers this year\nIn their defense or plus five and turnover ratio so we're a little bit behind them so we got to do a better job protecting the football because I feel like we're going to give it from our defense\nIf we can do that and increase our turnover margin that's going to lead us more and more points given up less points and that's going to allow us to give us a better opportunity when you get\nThrough your eyes what do you see when you see Patrick ... out there playing\nI see a guy who's totaling command and he knows the guy he's playing with these you eat out their looks like he's just dealing you know you've got play makers and when they haven't gotten open right away he has the athleticism buying time you could open the he's making some phenomenal growth so you've got a great skill set great young player him he's only been out there for this even\nAs a starter a little bit last year but obviously you can see the potential\nThat you know coach ... salt and they treated Alex Smith\nI said last week he reminds me of Steph Curry because he's so much fun to watch when you get the ability to just sit back and watch like he did it and you were just watching the game on Monday Night football as opposed in scouting and yeah you have that same feeling that it's just it's just fun because you don't know what he might be able to do from a particular play to the next\nYou know some guys are you know really surgical out there everything goes as planned you know I think a Peyton Manning up the rivers Drew Brees myself to a degree and then I'd say you got other guys that do things more unscripted Cam Newton Aaron Rodgers Patrick there's a lot of different ways to move the ball you know all of them are on the watch just depends what you like the most\nDominant will be your thoughts on this evening on Drew Brees or if he throws for two hundred and one yards will become the all time passing leader in the NFL for yard you're just through for your five hundred\nRear touchdown Drew Brees is going to have all of these are regular season records what's impressed you most about him and when you see a guy play for as long as he is played almost marrying your career to be able to do this for so long and be so effective pretty incredible isn't it\nHe's just published a pastor I remember growing up watching them Reno play and it was a lot like that every week it's three hundred plus yard maybe get some incredible stand about five thousand yard seasons I've only been at one eight manning did at one Drew Brees about five times\nYou can outlast him are you going to stay on the field at least one year longer than him like he did with manning and and so forth or or what's\nGoing to happen here we'll see maybe here and I have a sit down at the end of the year and talk about our careers and see what's going to happen so I could play a little bit but I don't plan on going anywhere I think he wants to play a long time too so we'll see\nTom on a totally different subject we all see the paint that's around all of the NFL field this October part of the NFL's a crucial catch initiative or they broadened it out just breast cancer to all types of cancer now this was largely started by Tanya Snyder a breast cancer survivor the life of owner Dan Snyder when she started as a think tank and now it's taken off everywhere\nI Know that your mom is a survivor and all that this is something that hits very close to home with you and it's something that we all are are very much a native try and find a cure\nIt's really cool that the NFL has done that and and the crucial catches is one that touches so many of our lives I mean in our family you know affected you know multiple times you know you just realize the need for the research\nDollars the man hours you know
