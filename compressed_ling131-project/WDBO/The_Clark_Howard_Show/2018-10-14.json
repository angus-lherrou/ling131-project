your thoughts usually don't\nUm but you're going to need some basic you know ... you're going to need a a bottle cap or a big spoon um and then patients uh you can't rush the hands of time you get out now so once you start making your beer the whole process takes about thirty days so you'll have your official brew day which is usually\nThree to four maybe five hours um\nAfter that you let your beer do its thing and just ferment I'm a you know to a certain temperature for a couple of weeks and then usually the bottle age or bottled condition after that you could also go to a keg which takes another week or two\nWell the nice thing about home brewing as opposed to well first of all it home brewing is one hundred percent legal as opposed to distilling your own distilled spirits meaning vodka or whiskey moonshine and there's ... there's a couple of reasons for that but first I think probably the most important is\nHealth and safety right right yeah I Would still and you could you could really mess some people up like you know poisoning them or you could well yourself up as well you make a bomb because I think there's two types of alcohol there's one eighth or alcohol and evil and one is deadly\nIf I'm not mistaken ... one of the deadly in one you can drink one right okay right right and the key is you want to get the one that that you can drink it's okay but there's there's much more a regulation and that's why you see these ... it's technically illegal but home ruling is legal ... or correction counter Meyer the master brewer\nA ... a hundred percent legal very different than just the ... we're talking about absolutely that Mike Tyson close I absolutely even closer are absolutely much better\nOr third time's a charm so very big difference and uh what type of people are you seeing coming in is there any specific age range or is this more men than women using give us an idea of who's coming in here to actually learn how to home brew\nUm for the most part it's twenty five to thirty five year old man and a little bit older I'm mostly people that have found that they either want to make it cheaper where they want to make something that they can't get it to breweries and they they want to have something seasonal for themselves they can make for each season for each day for each month\nFor an event or for a party they want to make their is they want to have their own thing going\nSo I think there's also something very cool and I think maybe a little bit a romantic about saying I'm a home brewer I brew my own fears where you have people at a party and you can sample some of their beers and people can actually be very proud of the offerings that they're serving absolutely it is you know I think there's something there's a there's a wow factor\nTo that oh yeah you could address flavors you can do anything you want so you can make it a stronger as light dark and heavy or you know barrel aged or whatever you like\nNow one of the people that we know mutually Phyllis ... who is uh he's known is still are blamed on these cigar Dave show my producer for many years now helps us with creative services\nHis homework and it comes in here purchases home brewing supply and he is he's told me he said I I finished very high I didn't win the award yet and of course I resident resident about it all the time\nBut the one thing he always tells me is that he loves to be able to experiment and try different things and I think that's probably the one commonality with home brewers is they want to try they want to have fun it's a hobby is make us great beer but is is that one of those ... are pretty they're they're off the charts what so what makes a beer off the charts how does a home brewer\nAble to be able to Bruce something to say that's off the charts what is it is a ... is it how they all\nIn perspective and personal taste you know I I like uh I like I ... some people hate him you know I'm not a big stout guy uh but that's all some people will ever drink so to make a chart that fluctuates right either you know is relevant to someone's taste I don't know how you could do that it's\nIt's all personal taste but overall what about the beer did you enjoy I'm probably the Roma the ... the clearing is to Chris Chris ... um the overall flavor and you know it is the last I PA did I think there was a a a mango or something like that in there and it was just\nFull of flavor and again there's no right or wrong so you could have five home brewers coming up with an eye PA everyone's going to be slightly different depending on what they put in and and and I guess the hops they use and the other ingredients so really it is it is a custom creation\nAlso their equipment in there Bruce style and\nHow they specifically I mean the temperatures can change everything temperatures are fermentation temperatures of your mash everything can change in each brewer has different preferences based on what they want out of it she can make a drier you can make it a little ... body can give it\nMore Roma by adding hops late you can give it a little bit more bitterness batting hops really early so I mean each brewer knows what they like to know what they want and I mean there's\nThere's great beer in every style every little bit is a little different but it's wonderful and its own way\nSo we learned so far that before we even get into the science of brewing and home brewing before we go through the different steps\nYou need some key equipment and Jeff as you mentioned Bruce capitals fermentation vessel a fermentation lock

October fest is the perfect way to do so perfect excuse for us to light up a find cigar do some beer bearings and I'm looking for a magnificent beers here at avid route company downtown St Petersburg we're talking about home brewing water one the science\nOf brewing it is becoming increasingly popular hobby\nSo this week we're talking about everything you need to know about a home brewing the equipment you need the process so we welcome you back to ... company downtown St Petersburg with Jeff Taylor of the owner and master brewer counter mired I should say gentleman that\nThat downtown St Petersburg always experienced day renaissance in terms of restaurants and and housing and and activities but it's really become a beer epicenter a cool little micro center of beer activity\nTotally it is it's it's grown over the past few years um we've been here about four years um you know green bench kind of started the whole revolution around here and bring in some different unique beers and and uh\nUh you know cycles following cage and they'll they'll work saint Pete brewing um they instill going\nAnd you know what started the will put up a map a cigar day dot com where we will put little pins on all the different breweries that are in the downtown St Petersburg area actually we're looking at one right now it's called the brewery bay I didn't realize just looking at the entire cigar city area Tampa Bay area the number of breweries\nBut ah there's a ton of them in downtown St Petersburg so if you're considering a visit\nDown especially between the months of light December and march perfect time if you're a beer enthusiasts some great places great restaurants the great ... right here in downtown St Petersburg Russia will outline that no\nOne of the things that you gentleman mentioned that brewing is all about time and temperature and as we learned in step to measuring of the grains you basically steep the grains whether it's wheat or whether it's cracked barley in hot water between a hundred and forty two degrees and a hundred and fifty nine degrees and you both said\nTime and temperature that's all brewing is about\nCrucial absolutely I mean if you if you don't go long enough it's not going to convert all the starches and then you're just going to have less alcoholic beer\nAnd if you go to long which isn't too much of a problem but you can start extracting slaves you don't actually want to\nKnow hour and a half and the temperature you one for the body are trying to find is really important to kind of nailed down and taking notes being sure you're you're repeating so if you make the same here again you can either not make the bad beer again or make the good beer again\nRemember those composition books we used to have back in grade school where you write everything down they were kind of bound I Would say if you're going to be a home brewer that's a good investment to make because Everytime you make a batch I Would assume the exact amount of time temperature so you could look back and take notes and say you know\nI liked that particular beer but let me try one degree more for maybe another few more minutes see what that does and then you hit that a ha moment\nWhere you get exactly the formulation you're looking at oil fulfilling I'm sure it is [laughter] so when you brought your everything the exact same way absolutely have you know that I have an entire rest of your book full of his notation throughout the whole process and that is guarded I noticed\nA very large fault as you walk in here that his garden nobody's getting near their practice there's patrol dogs right right around the secret service [laughter] All right so time and temperature key elements in brewing now after you match the grains and you said roughly what an hour\nMhm okay what's the next step ... which is basically a fancy word for renting the grains out where you live where you need to rent that sugar out of the grains that you've converted the searches you can burn sugars now you're trying to rent salvo sugar's out into another pot or\nTake the grains out of that I went to the sugar side of the great so you just want to separate the grains from the ... so you want the sugars out do you want the sugars in so that you can use that to boil\nSo you want to share tried to remove the grain also wants the green is don't you don't need it anymore you know my understanding is that many breweries when I was up at shipyard brewing they told me that uh they show the remnants of the grains\nTo various farm so they have continuous for use in the area yeah you can make\nDog biscuits out of the two and I'm sure as my chickens love it they'll go crazy after a while and then they'll they'll gorge on them\nSo it's like a dry it just becomes like when you try it out and just dry up it's pretty empty of any nutrition but it's just ... there's chickens like it into the compost compost is another alternative okay here have a a ... give our brains do for his coats really mhm\nSo basically there's no way whatsoever constantly cycling that's it alright\nFantastic so ... you are reducing the sugar out of the grains you're getting rid of the grains your retaining the sugar and the water which is Cold War was to W. or tea now\nWe have actually sampled the war and when it's warm ... he's pretty good it's like a Swiss ... it's like us we get rain T where we're at a uh did even brewing and ended up Mike Brian said try this I said boy the smell is incredible you could actually make a tea or a soup out if there was actually I thought it was just drink it in of itself we we\nBottled a couple of bottles of a I'm a black guy PA and it tasted just like a ... a a non alcoholic stopped because it doesn't have any alcohol in it um so it's that's pretty good stuff\nSo the word is basically the ... the sugars with the water\nOr after you have matched the grains so the ... of the sugar out and then you create the war and that's going to be the base of your beer absolutely okay so that's you're basically that's your stock that's your your ingredients right there that's the that that starts the process so now that you've got the war\nWhich usually is tastes sweet up these sugars in there you next go to\nThe boiling component was boiling do well boiling does a couple of\nThings that sanitize it it evaporates things that you don't actually wants to know jazz\nJust feels so things just things you're not actually gonna need or just evaporate and also that rates water so condense is it so you have\nA stronger sugar solution

nine steps to creating beer first is your ingredients by the way all these are ... dot com executive smashing of the grain steep and greens in hot water for an hour between a hundred and forty due to a hundred and fifty nine degrees ... wrenching the sugar out of the grains creating the war boiling for about an hour\nNumber five is adding the hops is where we left off and counter you just gave me and you have to just gave me a half a glass year\nOf ... and these are what ... ... this popular up very okay especially among the idea is that what that was one that sold out because everyone wanted it last year I'm getting notes so planning his worthiness floral little ... very credible now these kind of like little pellets is that how they're\nGrown or they created and the herbs are grown in these little cones but pellets are easier to transport because an ounce of of a holy hops can actually go out a lot quicker and they they it's about you know a lot larger so they said they just pulverized it and put them through an expert or that and put some of the ... gotcha so this is an assistant and even in about them all to\nThis is what gives the beer a lot of flavor a lot of the various tasting notes whether it's real happy those bitterness units or the other case that you would get on the ballot mhm right now we go to showing show the beer is boiled for just about an hour you're adding hops throughout your reading the hops okay then you go to\nShow you know as I say about earlier with the hops but when you add them changes whether you're going to get better and it's from it around the from it or a flavor from it so if it takes you an hour or two hours to chill down all those Roma hops you put in\nHave been in hot water for long enough where they were comparing hops so the quicker you can chill it\nThe more you can retain the flavors that you want also the less chance for infection you have\nArt and below eighty degrees mhm what's the temperature each other I usually go for about Seventy five Seventy five yeah if it's too high you're gonna kill they used was too cold is just going to get used to sleep you got to your friends you you will you want to make an environment for them really uh I'm happy well it comes to beer obese does your does your friend not however\nAre filled the next thing is pitching they use this is where you give life here\nThis is where it becomes clear ... well yeah that a living thing I mean he does is is a beautiful thing and you can make alcohol you can make CEO to show me it's just this is where the the life comes to come and there are different types of used there are there's different\nStrain yes range from different regions and they have different quality you know qualities each each one might produce same with water water water in east or or um you know related to the regions they come from [noise] okay so then you pitched to used and how long is the only time after you've cool down\nSanitation is a very key okay you don't want to infections of other bacteria is a wild use this where you can get really bad off flavors so once you Joe that you've sanitize everything that's going to touch your beer at this point is still considered ward until east is added but\nSanitation is absolutely key okay so you've pitched to use then what happens stepping you close it in ... in the form enter and you add an air lock or a year yeah you you should have been drinking the whole sort of address\nFor you make it so there's nothing you can get into it so there's blow off to basically or an airline which just bless the CEO to the east is creating come out but nothing coming\nSo fermentation how long about a month among so basically you you when you pitch to use you then are you're putting the east into a new container into the ferment ended up from entering gotcha so you take the worst\nThe ... that has the hops you show us down and you put it into the ferment or along with the used for thirty days no difference between a logger and a nail involves these he'll back\nTemperature temperature temperature um luxury east typically ferment around fifty five degrees and alleys typically from tweens sixty two to Seventy two degrees\nAnd one is a top fermenting and the other's bottom from it for the most probably for the most part okay gotcha so thirty days is now gone by now I'm looking here you've got beer ales sixty two to Seventy two degrees two to three weeks logger fifty five sixty degrees two to three weeks\nNow the term logger actually logger ring is aging it cold temperature ... a logger you'd ferment at fifty five fifty seven for two or three weeks and then you would log or it for up to three months and that's actually the process of logging is about\nThirty five degrees and you maintain that for for two or three months and actually clears the flavor it clears the beer out for clarity\nSo loggers or longer ales about thirty to absolutely ... require a lot more patience to correct so thirty days have gone by with your ... your ... now what do you do comes out of the matter so you\nPut it into another container that's also sterilized or you as a set amount of sugar and then you read what now a set amount of sugar a landing on how much carbon nation you won so this is this one he's still alive\nOkay so you put it another bucket you add sugar and then you put it into each bottle and Catholic okay and what that sugar to the east will eat that sugar inside the bottle and creating a C.

Rosenstein uh conduct now the president met yesterday on air force one apparently had a meeting not a lot of details about what went on in the meeting\nWith Rod Rosenstein there was talk about well he might be fired after it had been discovered that he was talking about well you want me to wear a wire\nAround the president and his answer was you know at least has the spin was while I was just saying that you wouldn't want me to wear a wire around the president and it was all in the tone in the cadences of what he said we have three articles in front of me right now one by Katherine Harris ... box one by Sarah quarter won by John Solomon\nSolomon's article goes on former FBI lawyer plot to record removed Trump was not a joke and John Solomon let me read the article don't tell for FBI general counsel remember James Baker he was one of those that resigned that those infamous discussions\nAbout secretly recording president Donald Trump and using the tapes to remove them for office where a joke he apparently doesn't believe it and he yelled quite the vantage point is he was on the inside of the FBI bureaus leadership and may twenty Seventeen when the discussions occurred and Baker told Congress last week\nThat his boss then acting FBI Director Andrew McCabe remember ... and Lisa Page both took notes of the meeting and McCabe was\nYeah Rod Rosenstein had in fact said this anyway now James Baker is saying and Andrew McCabe is saying that in fact they were dead serious about about the idea\nSarah surreptitiously recording the forty fifth president\nUsing the evidence to make the case that Trump should be removed from office according to every source now in all three articles and Baker told lawmakers that he wasn't in the meeting that McCain had with the deputy attorney general Rod Rosenstein in which the subject came up but he had first hand conversations with Medicaid\nAnd the FBI lawyer that was assigned to a ... page about the issue so Baker talk to both of the un quote as far as Baker was concerned this was the real plan being discussed set a source directly familiar with the congressional investigation it was no laughing matter to the FBI\nOr member then you can go back to what was the insurance policy to remove Trump\nIs five months now into his presidency isn't just before the appointment of the special counsel\nAs soon as Justin ... at that time frame around the media elite strategy that was occurring anyway so it goes on word of bakers testimony now is surface just days before Rosenstein said to be interviewed them private by the\nHouse Judiciary committee lawmakers that's supposed to happen Thursday of this week and the New York times first reported allegations that Rosenstein the number two at the department of justice has tried to downplay his role in all of this in his office suggested that\nHe thought the discussion was a joke that Rosenstein never gave in order to carry out any such plot and he doesn't believe the Trump should be removed from office\nBut making those statements through a spokesperson is a bit different than having Rosenstein himself face Congress answer the questions under the penalty of a felony if lawmakers think he's lying and bakers account lawmakers this month clearly complicates that already complicated picture\nAs it relates to Rod Rosenstein before Congress assuming he shows up for Thursday's interview but even more so Baker story lays Baron extraordinary conversation and we go on from there and now we've got to really take our time with this issue today and\nWe're going to now begin to put the pieces of the puzzle together because what this is we're laying out here are the top people at the upper echelon remember twenty five people have either been demoted fired or have left the FBI the OJ their\nUpper ranks here and James Baker is one of them and Andrew McCabe at least a page of both corroborating what apparently now James Baker is set about Rod Rosenstein anyway John Solomon ease but investigative reporter is what the hell rag Jarrett Fox News legal analyst\nAnd of course the seller of the number one book the Russia hoax thank you all for being with us I'm John let's just I I Want to also put this in context where people because it gets complicated\nWe got a first start with the timeline the timeline is may have twenty Seventeen or that's when Robert Mueller is getting appointed by Rod Rosenstein just before that we had people like ... at least a page in and Peter Struck talking about uh media elite strategy\nThat had to do with the dusty a while it now appears that that was all being league for the purposes\nAnd again ... all it was was the dot CA recycled and different news outlets for the purpose of initiating the special counsel so would get appointed that we're discovering that they're even talking about Sarah ... taping the president of the United states so that they can remove him from office this sounds like a cool to me\nOr if there's one other event that occurs and that may timeframe but rarely I think if the shock wave for this conversation and that was the termination of James\nComey's the FBI Director of it all out all this Russia investigation to go on and we know now from ... to market may they still have anywhere from a proving any form of collusion with Russia so they've been nine months out of James Kobe's let this go on for nine months\nHe's let two agents who have an anti Trump a virus read that investigation he gets fired and once the natural reaction of all those who've been supporting James Comey roses are McKay\nAnd a stroke page it's hey maybe we can remove this guy you'd rather be re can't prove that he did something wrong with Russia maybe we can prove confident and will will record him and uh and maybe try to take 'em out through the recording and the twenty Fifth Amendment this is not what the FBI were brought into the wrong track record talk about history his book\nLays out a real possibility that this was a soft grew right look at this we have the FBI they're not investigating a crime here that in fact they can't find a crime by a ...\n... pages testimony just to be clear she said they and they had found nothing and nine months leading up to the point\nThat's right so they switch gears right maybe we can remove them through other means and and this conversation is so extraordinary ...\nIt says that job at the FBI or twenty Fifth Amendment never envision the FBI being involved in it she got the FBI the deputy attorney general or allegedly our conversation you have it's a joke\nThey say they're dead serious about it and they believe he was dead serious about it and it will matter which way it comes down is just another example of how far down the road with the FBI\nWas beyond its core mission which is to investigate crimes stop counter intelligence\nAnd again this has nothing to do with rank and file agents that all this this is John group of rogue power hungry upper echelon management types and if anything they took the the cases away from the field offices purposely so that they can involved themselves in these nefarious activities that's why\nIt really does explain a great Jarrett why every FBI guy I Know is so angry about this because they know was ripped out of their hands\nAnd this and all of them say that if this was them they know they get fired\nThat's right and in fact I interviewed former top officials or the FBI who are angry at people like James Comey Andrew McCabe James Baker Lisa Page\nPeters struck for ruining the reputation the good name of the FBI I wrote a column recently that said Rosenstein actions\nIn an attempt to hose the sitting president United States is the equivalent of an attempted coup not a bloody violent coups what's known and John refer to it a moment ago as a soft coup ah using and misusing\nTheir power in the law to remove a sitting president and so here we now have not just James Baker\nWho was told this was serious but the people in the conversation with Rosenstein\nWho are Andrew McCabe and Lisa Page you said he was\nDead serious recruit people to invoke the twenty Fifth Amendment and secretly record the president to gather evidence in support of it uh Rosenstein whenever he gets caught engaging in wrongdoing\nClaims oh I was misunderstood he threatened the intelligence committee staff members in January first denied it\nThey fail there will be separation they don't Scott [noise] you know\nIf they fail the separation it's a terrible situation where president\nWas on his way to

who is resigned and Lisa Page and Andrew McCabe that is now under criminal investigation all corroborating that Rod Rosenstein\nHimself was discussing wearing a wire to seek alert secretly recorded conversations with President Trump\nAnd the hope she'd say something that they could use and then in both the twenty Fifth Amendment and remove him from power Andrew McCabe telling that in and confirming that along with Lisa Page\nAnd going to the office of the general counsel James Baker he's corroborating all of this and ah they're saying the Baker's set it bigger and heard about it and the other two actually took notes about it at the time the other story that we're following is\nWe've pretty stunning revelation since it directly contradicts what the Justice Department\nAnd the FBI
