with eastern grains and one day and one of my fellow bakers invite me over to his house for some home brew\nAny open up the bottle and the thinking it formed all over and it really wasn't very good and but then I thought you know he's not that great of a Baker and I've been I could do better\nAnd I wound up moving into a house in uh January of Nineteen eighty with three other guys who like beer and ah it'd become legal and I went out and bought a kit and started brewing beer in the basement and um\nAnd you know it's kind of watching what was happening out on the west coast a sheer opened a that you're in Nineteen eighty\nI think Eighteen eighty to the real ill company opened in Chelsea, Michigan I spy on them and kind of figured\nThat whole trend would move eastern which of course it

New York times piece that he came out with the ... it to me it's absolutely stunning\nAnd the things that he's saying because while the FBI's pack it in the middle of it when we handled the Hillary Clinton email investigation while he was writing an exoneration himself prior to the real investigation which didn't happen until three days before he publicly exonerated her\nUm but then he goes on to trash the president at length\nAnd then he talks about FBI agents are experts which they are interviewing people and quickly dispatching leads to their colleagues around the world to follow up with additional interviews\nAnd they will confront people with testimony and other towns and you know yes the alleged incident occurred thirty six years ago but FBI agents no time has little to do with memory um which I found a little strange\nUm and then you know for example everybody remembers if it rained on their wedding day uh I don't think that's a political in that particular sense maybe to somebody who is traumatized by could see that but for somebody that's not traumatized maybe not\nUm once they start interviewing every witness knows the consequences he says\nIs one thing to have your lawyers submitted statement on your habit very different thing to sit across from two FBI special agents and answer their relentless questions of course the bureau won't have subpoena power only the ability to knock on doors and ask questions most people will speak to them then there's what he says refusal to do so\nIs its own kind of statement now I Want to just address that because my FBI friends my friends in the in the bureau special agents have all said to me never ever\nTalk to the FBI unless you have a lawyer ever and I'm like why I'm somebody who loves the FBI don't love the upper brass under Khomeini and the cave and struck and page but the FBI is is blocked the FBI people I Know the soul to the earth people\nAnd I said I'd course I'd want to help him he goes no and then they say look what happened to General Flynn\nGeneral Flynn is accused of lying to the FBI and the up here I didn't think he was lying to them\nAnd you just it's dumb to ever talk to any law enforcement without a lawyer that's what all my law enforcement people friends say\nBecause it's a crime if you lie to the FBI let's say you said something in the Senate Judiciary investigation and it doesn't exactly match up you could be charged with a crime of lying to the FBI it's ridiculous\nAnd you know the irony that says if you look in his company's coming and low right now is just to try to destroy Trump with everything he can and it's just another another section in that play book but the irony at the exact same federal law provision\nThat says it's a crime to to lie the FBI is the one that that that's a crime to lie to the Senate\nAnd their ... with a investigator it's not just you know a similar penalty is exactly the same statutory violation so that's just not they've been kind of pretending they're ... that I guess playing a little bit on people's images maybe from the movies of what the FBI guys to say that they somehow it's going to be a separate different thing\nWhat they're really doing here is there going down the St Louis to people\nThe Senate Judiciary committee has already talked to\nThey're getting the same statement in some cases they might get exactly the same thing because the FBI can't ... can't force them to talk to them\nEspecially if all you know as I don't remember that I wasn't there they they couldn't be dealing with taking the same exact statement from the same lawyers for the same the same individuals that that's ... that that is all we can no ... just because of the nature of this old investigation so the FBI isn't going to find anything new here that they're they're my prediction\nBy announcing that morality IRA and that they don't have any other thing\nThey've already moved on I guess ... Romero's and and that's the one that came out in the New Yorker piece and you know ... that's the one we're even the New York times that said they attempted\nTo interview over the course of a week several dozen people they couldn't find a link to one to corroborate her story and then saying that Mrs Ramirez\nContacted former yo classmates asking them if they were called the incident and told some of them that she could not be certain Mr cabinet was the one who exposed themselves which at that point tells me you know what\nAre they investigating here if she's asking if she's telling other people she doesn't know what are they investigating\nThe more shocking thing is even right and it's you know right before\nThis whole um ... most recent face exploded I think with the morning on of the vote she actually her lawyer with telling people she's not even still share it with him she has like ... that he was in the room\n[laughter] I'm positive he adjusted his hands but if that means that so but I but I Can't say for certain it hit it and so it's even after talking to her lawyers for six days to kind of work up\nA her memory that she didn't have when she initially talked to the to the New York New York or could they also said she couldn't say for sure he was there when they initially talked to her I I I'm I'm a tractor even counted as a credible allegation but you know what\nFor the FBI could talk to her um they'll they'll get their statement and I think that if you look at the people if they're\nOnly going to hold on wins and they don't make any recommendations they'll just going to give very handover the information\nThat's it the the three ... and and maybe we'll get those thrilled to have been waiting for thrilled to forever as it relates to Bruce or and
