than you just paying cash for that medicine\nShopping around them paying cash it will vary from ... but you need to know the importance of shopping around and the importance of asking before you fill through your insurance\nIs this cheaper for you if you didn't have insurance or a program like good our ex if you're not familiar with good our ex dot com check it out other surprising news on health front\nIf you are an individual buying health coverage on your own\nFor the first time since the Obamacare exchanges started premiums on average around the country you're going down for next year not up you know during open enrollment you can shop around\nAnd see what's available but now insurers are more coming back into the marketplace\nAfter a number of years of having less and less competition on the exchanges there are more insurers offering plans and that creates competition not everywhere in the country are prices going down but the general trend around the country is prices are actually declining\nAnd you ... if you do buy your own individual plan\nThe next open enrollment period starts November first and you have only a six week window to sign up for individual coverage\nFor twenty Nineteen and that's great news about premiums having not just moderated but started a trend line of declining we don't know if this is a one year thing who knows because nobody expected\nThis to be a release when the rates were released by the department of health and Human Services nobody expected the premiums around the country would decline and these are for a full uh\nObamacare compliant plans meaning no exclusion for pre existing coverage for ah all illnesses coverage for pregnancies all that so it is another bit of good news on the healthcare front where the news historically has not been so good\nAndrew is with us on the Clark Howard show hello Andrew\n[noise] hey how are you\nGreat thank you Andrew you are moving towards the end up paying off your student loans is that right\nThat is correct what kind of journey if you've been on with that how ... then\nUm I Would say I would say it's been pretty rough of shy to focus pretty heavily on trying to get this paid off as soon as possible um but it has taken a lot of um a lot of work to do so and I had to make some sacrifices but we're nearing the end so I'm pretty excited about\nWell that is great news how much do you have left burdening you\n[noise] I got just over sixty one hundred at the moment [noise]\nOh that's fantastic because you know when I hear from people calling me about student loans usually it will be in the tens of thousands or or probably one in five times there will be more than a hundred thousand dollars in student loans that someone's asked Comey about\nYeah I started at the right at about thirty two I'm a couple of years ago and so I've I'm nearing the end so it's a very great showing that\nWonderful well how can I be of service in this quest to be done with the student loan lenders\nSo the question I have is so I got just over the sixty one hundred and ... and it's a red at four percent four point zero one percent interest on that [noise] I have a a little bit over seven thousand built up and just individual savings and so I'm I'm just I'm questioning too I just go ahead and erase the student loan it'd be done with it\nOr just continue it out and I'm looking at potentially making your last payment and march or April next year\nSo that's it even if you did not um kill off your savings you'd still be done and another half here\nYes that's correct [noise]\nAll right so that means you're a very determined savor your very careful with your money I Would go ahead and blow out the student loans and extend in early Christmas gift to yourself [laughter]\nOkay because you're on that kind of trend line where you're paying five hundred or so a month towards this balance you're going to replenish her savings pretty quickly\nAnd getting to that goal line of getting rid of the student loans is so worth it with the slog you've been through reward yourself and wipe it out\nOkay yeah I appreciate that 'cause that was the kind of the same thing same thought process I had as if I go ahead and remove this now that just benefits in the long term 'cause I could put all that extra money back into savings and punished that that he thought it back up\nAnd pretty quickly to the one thing though that I Want to make sure you're aware that record keeping by the student loan servicers is pitiful and you need to keep the documents showing that you have successfully paid off your student loans for gas outlawed\nForever\nThat is right for the rest of your life you need to keep the proof because over the years it's been so disturbing to me when I hear from someone who's being hassled by a student loan collector on loans they long since paid off even decades before\nAnd they have no way of proving they actually pay them off and Congress and its wisdom gave student loan collectors extreme powers where they don't even have to prove the validity of a debt and that's why having your proof of pay off is so key\n[noise] yeah I I I appreciate you reminded me on that I'll definitely make sure I I get that um when I Do get this uh cleared\nEight thirty a news that six point five WTO as officials to assess the hurricane devastation and the pan handle the death toll from

minimizing my out front axis\nAnd giving me greater flexibility and my airs greater flexibility in the long term now the downside is that how to using my non retirement income and other times to pay those taxes\nRight so that is the question if you in dribs and drabs each year move money from the traditional four one K. ended the raw and because your income slower you're lowering the tax\nAs long as it would not infringe on your lifestyle too much you could afford to do it with the funds you have and the money in the four one K. being money you may not need for a long time and retirement that is a very sound and wise strategy\nI appreciate that I I couldn't see any downside to do but I thought maybe I was missing something and\nMeasuring sheer missing nothing as long as you live a lifestyle where you can afford the tax bill that would occur each year it's great because the flexibility it offers you when you turned Seventy and a half you have to start making mandatory withdrawals from that four one K.\nAnd as you have less and less money in it as you've been able to migrate many of the wrong\nYou're reducing by a meaningful amount how much mandatory withdrawal you'd have to make this is important in your case because I can tell talking to you the way you handle money you have been a good steward of your funds and you're in a position\nTo pay for your lifestyle without really needing all the money that would come from a mandatory withdraw from the four one K. each year\nThat is actually the problem I see in the future and the higher tax rates that I think we're gonna have to\nWe're going to see in the future as well so I think that is because you've lived your wife in a way that you have that flexibility I can never remember where I recommend it to a retiree to move money steadily from a four one K. to a raw\nBut you're not everybody in your situation fits doing that perfectly Natalie with us on the Clark Howard show hello Natalie how are you doing\nHi good I'm doing great thanks for taking my call\nSure you have a teenager who is tempted by something you want to run by me\n[noise] yeah I have a fourteen year old girl who is pretty introspective and has decided she want some remodeling classes because she wants to gain some confidence income toys\nAnd she's been looking at a couple of local modeling agencies and it seems like a couple of places it just looked at have given her and I ... and called her back and then at the call back don't explain all the um in and out of well you need these classes and\nAnd they can and get

tempted by is completely one that I've had so many complaints about over the years and I can't believe they're still around stealing people's money\nGo on the website Yelp Y. L. P. yeah\nAnd look at what people have to say about the specific company that she's heard the pitch from recently with you and you should see if people could be any more angry and the post they put about these crooks it would be awesome all\nWell and my thought was you know if if I'm paying kind of a coalition can gain for classes that would be of value\nYou know I'm not necessarily looking for my fourteen year old daughter to become a model you know if if and I thought if they would provide you know toys and confidence than it might be worth investing [noise] um they said they'd tuition money for\nIt I got a much better option for you then 'cause I heard most about your daughter can give you a much better when Natalie yeah there's there's nothing that beats a child who would like to gain more confidence and be more outgoing than to do a theater school were theater camp okay\nAnd there are every summer all over the country local theaters do theater camps where they teach kids the fundamentals of acting on stage\nAnd the confidence that kids get and the interest they build up and not to mention how good that that is is broadening\nYour daughter you know learning how to be a stage actor is a great thing and by the way those classes are ultra cheap okay\nAnd so I think it which I think it would serve all those needs you expressed to me and keep her away from being scammed
