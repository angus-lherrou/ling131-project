much how can I be of service you\nWell I this is my second marriage that it has been quite some time in the first one and so being a late in life right here\nIt's going to be quite a while to change my name but I'm committed to going ahead and doing all of that and I got an email ... saying here is the discount on a package to help you change your name and I'm Wondering if it's worth it\nTo try to do something like that and if it's not if you got any tips on how to go about doing that sure a fully established at all [laughter]\nAll right so the thing in that area if you go on the Web and you look at the name change services for brides a lot of them are scams that are just trying to get your personal information and then they can engage in a day that many of them will say they'll do all that stuff for you for free run away from anything like that\nAnd if you do go to a service to do name change there are two in particular that are considered to be completely legit and don't charge that much money to do all the name changing for you one of them is the big wedding chain David's Bridal and the other\nAnd you might think oh is that who solicit mhm\nAnd the other one is do you know the website that not dot com can OT than so they have one called ... a hitch hitch\nSwitch say that three times hedge switch and it and the David ... David's Bridal service are both very legit how much is the one from David's Bridal\nIt got two options and Sally a thirty dollar or Seventy dollars service and they're offering you a ten dollar gift county sign up on the email that they stand\nAnd the one from hitched which is similar I think it goes up maybe the high end so little higher but not a lot\nAnd so I think that's a perfectly legitimate way to do it but um this is an area I'm so glad you asked me about this you never want to use some UFO site to do the name change and\nAnd do you think that it's better to go through one of these services or to try to do it yourself I Know you start the security off\nAnd yeah this is completely a convenience question and I'd say if you're doing it for convenience go with a higher level when for either those sites because they do more of the work for you\nOkay that's really good to know Christianity that and I never thought about the identity theft ... side of that I was just thinking about how much work it was going to the to get all of this switched over to\nThink about that you know you try to save work and they create a big hassle for you with it in any theft and again Heather congratulations on your upcoming festivities Michael is with us on the Clark Howard show hello Michael\nHey great thank you you have a three year old who's already ready to start saving money like crazy [laughter] what kind of ... what kind of job does your three year old ...\n[laughter] as he is pretty much and either in a car that's about it [laughter]\nSo he's a goal three year old Mary though\nWell what are you trying to do for him with money\nI really want to go or ... or ... credible firecracker collared\nYes and I really want to hear that are happening ... herbal ... own literature another state\nYes completely unless there are a small number of states that have a prepaid tuition plan which is a form of a five twenty nine plan and those transfer very unfavorably to a different state\nBut a traditional five twenty nine plan which is one that is an investment plan that you put your money on it grows tax free it's spent tax free\nIs usable in any of the fifty states for school and you're eligible once a year that let's say you don't end up liking your state plan you're allowed to even as he remained a resident of your state you're allowed to move\nThe money to a different state plant okay and have you seen my five twenty nine plan guide\nAhead not now I have ... dot com\nOr my list of the best plans in the country and I have hyper links has a number of states have multiple plans and they may have to good plans and three bad plans or something like that so I've got a link to the best plan available in each state\nOkay\nNo college is one thing what are the odds that in your family culture is your three year old going to college no matter what\nA ... ... there are ... there but I'm just hoping will\nThe reason I asked that he's you know with the five twenty nine and they're great and less\nKid doesn't go to college and you don't have another child you can you can move the money to ... the tax treatment of five twenty nine money is great if it's used for eligible college expenses and its plain rotten if it's not used for college\nOkay yeah we're going to ask if there's something else [noise] [laughter]\nWell that's why I asked the question because if the odds favor your child going to college then you just go ahead and do the five twenty nine because it's the best choice\nFor a kid but my preference is always for you to save the maximum you can\nIn your own name first before you look at options that might be available to put money aside for a child and my default go to is that you and your bride should be saving the maximum under the law\nIn a Roth IRA before you even consider putting money in a five twenty nine for your child\nOkay for the Ross has so much flexibility to it and it grows tax free and then you spend it tax free and retire\nOkay and\nAnd that would be that would be a choice I Would do way before I Would start looking at other things to put money aside for your son\nOkay then that raw whenever a credible and use it for college with that ... ... ... so\nSo there's an interesting twist with the wrong if you Fifteen Years from now want to use some of that money for your son's college as long as you leave the earnings of it behind you can pull your contribution money out tax penalty free\nOh okay\nSo it provides an additional level of flexibility that you don't have with the five twenty nine plan you're

something that I've been getting a steady number of questions about on the air and ask Clark says well parents trying to figure out how to do all went to school age kids\nOr how to pay school age kids for chores whatever's required in your family in order to get allowance and how to do that because how did you used to do that you gave people cash but now more and more\nThe parents have young children don't carry cash themselves I mean why our ATM's disappearing all over the place because caches use so much worse than it used to be parents using plastic\nThat's all the kids ever see 'em do and the kids plastic is cash so that's led to a bunch of products that it's been a steady stream of product introductions where\nYou have renewable cards you as a parent can monitor on an app on your phone or on a website and you can even with some of these cars you can control what your kids spend money\nNow the downside with these card programs is usually you have to pay fees to be part of these programs so you're paying money to be able to give money to your kids which I've never a fan of\nOne in particular though has been really intriguing to people in that green light\nWhich allows you to use green light as a way to try to encourage your kid to say you know I'm so into the daddy match on retirement plans where\nMy kids and teens as they are the two older ones raging out of this but as they would save money from jobs I'm match a dollar for dollar\nGoing into a Roth irate to encourage saving not spending\nBut we're talking about with green light having one of those cards it costs you sixty bucks a year to have the card sixty\nSo that's a lot of money to pay to then have the ability to encourage kids say within the card plan\nSo this is going to be weird\nI Want you to turn back the clock\nAnd what I'd like you to do instead\nIs allowing to your kids were that are chaotic thing called money give 'em money you won't have to pay any fees for it kids get the finite and is with the actual money in their hands that they don't get with a plastic card\nAnd if you can afford to do a match\nLike greenlight does when you allowance a kid if they're willing to save money that they then turned over to you periodically for you to put it in a savings account or put an investment account or something like that you tell them the incentive is\nEvery dollar they don't spend you're

CDs\nBut I remember that the call that prompted the stink\nAnd I remember wondering why cart didn't bring up copyright issues at the time\nAs I recall the car said he wanted to sell his CDs because he'd already made digital copies of the content and didn't need the originals any more if you buy a CD you have the right to make your personal copies for your own use if you transfer ownership of the

you recently stated that money in your retirement account should be well diversified quoting you verbatim well diversified what that means in simple English is that having money in a variety of stocks not your employers own in fact ... percent I like to have an employer's on stock in a four one K. is zero percent\nThis is good advice until the part about not having any four one K. money and employers an stock\nThere is nothing wrong with having some money in the ... and ... especially if you work for a stable company or a blue chip company listed on the ... the Dow Jones they're present is actually too conservative eliminating any risk when especially young workers should be taking on some limited risk\nThank you and let me respond to that so I'm really strident about not having employers stock in your retirement plan because a lot of people I\nHave a an issue with investing where if employers stock is offered\nIn a four one K. people go way too much all when with the employer stock\nI have to be really really stark in stride and with that to get people's attention because people feel like oh I work here I Know everything's great it's going to be wonderful to have my retirement and my employer stock best too many eggs in one basket 'cause you're also getting a paycheck from that employer\nAnd you never know when a company finds it's lost its way look at one of the blue is to blue chips General Electric that isn't so much financial trouble now and if people working for the very heavily put GE stock in their retirement plan\nThey have way too much risk involved I'll say this\nIf you really feel a strong sense of loyalty to where you work\nAnd company stock is one of the options you put in up to ten percent of your four one K. and company stock just so you feel like you're showing that loyalty but no more than that but my preference still remains zero\nYour advice was less than stellar and certainly not complete about building a home and I needed

for a long time you said call them and ask for the general manager or even better the owner for reference for good GCE\nHe said they will know who pays their bills on time who does good work who buys the cheap supplies for the good stuff\nWho has a good crew who has a good reputation et cetera I got a reference there and my general contractor did a great job\nThat is a fantastic post and thank you for sharing it it's funny when I talk to people who have actually built their own home\nUsually when I asked people if they would do it again the answer is flat out no in your case it worked out very well and I love the methodical process that you're a brother the architect recommended\nWe recently had an article on on a clock dot com called why you should be aware of sharing a bank account with

discuss using software or an online service to draft a well however legal documents especially wills are not an area in which saving money is paramount\nGetting it right is what counts first a computer program is no substitute for the advice of competing attorney accomplished attorney will ask questions or the client drafted will that will meet the needs of the client and explain that will in simple terms at the clock and understand the document\nWhat computers can drop the will that includes the results of a questionnaire computers are not yet capable of doing\nOf doing for providing advice tailored to the needs of a client or explaining their work\nSecond unlike a computer online service the attorney will watch the client notary and witnesses execute the will to make sure that was properly done if it will is not properly executed as required by state law the document will be invalid\nThis problem is surprisingly common as many people are not very good at reading understanding or following instructions also the average person is not going to recognize their mistakes due to lack of knowledge and experience at the turn of an attorney as a result the problem with the execution of computer generate document will probably\nWill not be discovered until the executor tends to follow the court house after the test said or has died\nThat'll clerk at the courthouse

will\nParticularly the minor children you can account for who you want to raise them\nI Can't dispute anything you said\nBut what I face is trying to get people to even think about and do a will in

make\nIs so amazing\nWhat it's like now\nWith flying with airlines trying to feed you for everything especially for bags and you can have a bag that is a fraction of an inch\nLarger than what an airliner wiles and they're gonna tear your wallet apart charge you all kinds of fees so\nAs I share with you a few months ago when my daughter was headed off to college we flew on southwest 'cause bags are free you can check to bags each person free and so we're able to car dollar stuff off to college\nAnd so I was meticulously using a tape measure to make sure we met total inches and for each dimension and all that and gosh it was\nReally kind of a pain to make sure that the bags are okay and we carry ons you have to deal with that was spirit frontier in college and if you go I just in the end of an inch over suddenly they charge you a hundred bucks potentially at the gate for your micro carry on being too large\nSo now kayak has a new feature\nThat will actually figure out if your bag is A L K for whoever it is you're fly\nAnd it only works right now for certain iPhones know Android version yet but with it you can just with your iPhone\nTake the camera or whether kayak out and it takes a digital image of the luggage calculates the dimensions and then we'll be able to tell you yes or no you're okay with that bag\nNow I Know this drives people crazy but whenever there's an issue on when I fly a legion frontier or spirit\nI always take a black trash bag with me so that they were jak my carry on\nI Will abandon the carry on suitcase and put my possessions and the black trash bag and that was not original with me I saw it happen and the spirit gate\nWhere somebody was prepared and put their things into the trash bag avoided the hundred dollar gate checked the\nAnd just carried on their stuff and the black trash bag and so I'm always prepared you know Boy Scout motto will always be prepared right so I'm prepared and isn't it funny that that's where we are the strangest thing though\nIs it's hard to tell who's a full for airline and who's a discount airline anymore and how they treat you with the baggage because United does that same junk with most of their coach passengers\nThat you aren't allowed to put something in the overhead bin any more\nThan what they called basic economy and\nSo the all the baggage fees are huge revenue for all the airlines except southwest and so it's all about you buy the ticket and then only buys you the privilege to be charged fees for anything else you want to do seed assignments whatever\nBut at least you don't want to get to the airport and find out your bag is too big\nAnd like I said a kayak most people aren't androids come up with a version that works for Android\nCharlie's with us on the Clark Howard show Hi Charlene\nHow clock Charlie and you've got a question for your son what's going on with him\nOver all the way the college ... on his first student loans holding on to any of amber he has three

the best course of action to positively impact his credit score and he paid off in full or over time\nIf one of my grandchildren yelled something that ridiculous I'd have to stifle a laugh\nMy husband uh fifty years to not have to stifle alas he took it seriously he did not defend his remark nor did he not defend men he set hunched didn't hurt and he listened right because this angry clearly mentally unstable to whack a doodle\nMade this guy this her husband feel like ah like nothing basically made him feel like the ... he probably is I continue for a moment it occurred to me to be grateful that I'm married to a man who will listen to a woman\nWins conned ever so slightly in that moment and then the storm surge weld up and me as I realize the prosthetic impotence of nice men's plan to rebuild the wreckage by listening to women\nAs my rage rush through the streets of my mind toppling every memory of every good thing my husband has ever done and there are scores of memories I said the meanest thing I've ever said to him don't you dare sit there and sympathetically promise to change\nDon't say you will stop yourself before you board out some impatient annoyed controlling remark no I said you can't change you are unable to change you don't have the skills and you won't do it you I said one of the good men you respect women\nYou believe in women you like women you don't hit women over ... women or in any way abused women\nYou of applauded and funded feminism for a half century or a ... you were at one of the good men and you cannot change you can listen to all you want but that will not create one iota of change\nIn the centuries of feminist movement set of washed up in a way good men of not once organize their own mass moving to change themselves and their sons or to attack the mean spirited teasing punching thing that passes for male culture not once bastards don't listen to me listen to each other talk to each other\nOr in your power for once\nThe gender war that has broken out in this country is flooding all our houses it's arising I'm tired of memories that every woman has those memories have come loose from the attic\nAnd the basement where we've stashed them\nThey're floating around us there is no place left to store them out of sight not just memories of sexual abuse memories of being dismissed disdain disgusted memories of having to endure put downs at the office cat calls in the parking lots barked orders at dinner parties\nAnd for some reason\nThe most chilling memory of all the one Christine Blasey Ford called up and that we
