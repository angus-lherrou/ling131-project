vehicle market that I Want to make sure you're attuned to several factors coming together all at once they mean that if you were interested in a vehicle [noise] your timing right now is very painful [noise] so let me hit you with the factors affecting the marketplace\nNumber one we've got a situation where we've had record or near record vehicle sales for the last half dozen years\nWe've reached a point where we're way past people who needed new wheels and we've covered a lot of people who wanted new wheels and so now the dealers the manufacturers are running out of the people need and want so we're playing much harder to get\nBecause their replacement market for old worn out vehicles is not that large right now and the number of people who have vehicles that are older not as many because so many people have gotten newer vehicles have light\nAnd then you add in higher interest rates interest rates on car loans has gone up quite a bit as interest rates and the general economy have risen car loans reflect the increases immediately\nSo now people are looking at higher monthly payments\nThe third factor is something I shared with you about six weeks ago and that is that after years of an under supply of SUVs and crossover utility vehicles things we call MTV's are actually see these just you know what the difference says\nA true SUV is built on a truck platform very few in the United states are built on a truck platform almost all of them are built on a car platform just where the body put on top of them that looks like it's it's a little higher like you think of as an SUB\nSo manufacturers were caught flat footed\nSeveral years ago when people shifted from wanting passenger cars to wanting these crossovers so there was a continual shortage\nNow is easy to get your

congratulations are in order\nTo you and I got married recently ah before that though I Do have to embarrass you a little bit uh I always thought if I guess the last few months\nUp but the reason that the coastal around and I noticed that name I recognize that goes I live in a New Orleans right now grew up watching the TV on the news all the time in fact I got a lay a crisis recommendations for a\nWhile you're at it and ... stuff on the news so that was a really valid I got ...\nWell that's great to have you I Hope you enjoy our podcasts\nAnd yeah it's been great so far up and learn a lot for sure\nThank you so just got married\nYes yes so we got married um and we're in the process of combining all our finances all that kinda stuff and so I was just got older and um we're both on kind of the same financial standing uh she's got a little bit of a school that I've got a little bit of credit card that we both like I say I'm Lonnie\nI'm so as far as combining finances go as water you know there's a lot of best practices stuff like that because I was trying to read on the line and there's lots of information all over the place\nWhere one of the factors I look at is how well both of you are\nOkay uh we're both in our mid thirties\nAt that point when you get married after you've lived independently for a long time don't rush combining everything up because you've each develop your own habits no matter how much it feels like it\nFrom the same wavelength you're not going to be exactly on the same wavelength having been in a position where each of you had made all the decisions with everything involved with money\nAnd it can cause tension especially um and the first couple of years of marriage if you just all of a sudden combine everything so a joke or it's different for people get married in their early twenties wish not as many people do anymore but getting married in your mid thirties which is more common now\nI'm white for you to have his money her money their money\nAnd by that I mean are having a joint household account\nThat both of you share and you have money that you eat to contribute to that\nEach month for rent slash mortgage other household expenses that you figure out and then you still have some money that shares in an account and she has money that's hers and account look up and then on credit cards\nI don't want you to combine those for a a few years\nAll right so credit cards for a few years yeah that was actually going to be my next question because as far as you know combining it to a joint that child that's a checking account that or you don't like debit cards\nUh so I was reading you know there's a thing like with credit cards especially for groceries things like that I can make her like a cow holder or under my credit card or I'm a joint credit cards or anything as far as that goes with the credit cards\nSo for spending that you're going to do that fits under the house account category like groceries you're going to both eat 'em your cell phone bills have you combine a cell phone plan any of the stuff you're doing is a combined activity\nIt's great for you to have like a house account credit card\nThat you pay in full each month that has some kind of rewards attached to it\nThat is your first joint credited Cal but for things like when she's going to buy closer you are or she's going to get her hair done or whatever\nBecause you're each approaching it from years of making individual decisions those things are best at least for now left as individual charges on eat on individual cards rather than on one that's Troy\nOkay and so we can do like a joint credit card to realize that was the thing\nYeah you can be co owners of a cart\nOr she can add due for a house account she can add you as an authorized user you can add her isn't authorize use or one of yours for the things that fit under house expenditures the concept is that you know over time you'll find how best you're spending merges is your wife\nOr goes on together but doing it all at once can cause tension that you didn't even know could be there and that's why\nThe merging of finance there should be gradual instead of a media and

in an afternoon news conference you said South Florida is now in focus for investigate\nLaw enforcement agencies are now deploying additional resources to South Florida to pursue evidence as they try to track down whoever sent pipe bombs through the u._s. mail FBI analysts had been examining the on detonated devices and ABC News has learned the authorities are chasing promising leads that point to South Florida as the suspected origin\nBut then will generate tax and penalties for the typical person somewhere between thirty five and forty five percent of the money\nAnd think about if you don't have the money at that point you're going to have a big tax smell due to the IRS for fan of money you don't have\nRight so can you tell\nWhen somebody calls and asked me about borrowing from a four one K.\nI. like tightened up when I'm answering the question 'cause I'm hoping there's no reason I'll ever green light been borrowing from the four one K. because the if then the consequences so the situation has to be completely desperate\nBefore I Would say do this and why why am I talking about this again\nI got\nA email from a friend of my wife who was asking specifically about\nTaking money out of a four one K.\nTo pay off credit card debt which is probably the most common reason people do it\nAnd I was able to explain to a point that she was comfortable that she shouldn't do the money withdraw from the four oh one K. to pay off the credit card debt and you know the most important reason not to do that if you use\nMoney from a four one K. to pay off credit card debt in most situations people will end up having the credit cards charge back up\nWithin a year and a half of when that withdrawal is taking place\nSo please I Know it's easy to do the ... four one K. borrowing but don't do it unless the situation is dire\nAmy is with us on the Clark Howard show hello Amy\nHi how are you\nGreat thank you you want to talk about hitting the bulls eye on the retirement target\n[noise] Hi I'm looking at the proper used or misused retirement in line and I mean how strong force it that you need to have a hundred percent a year and ethnic retirement fund to retire at ... or yeah\n[laughter] well I wouldn't say a hundred percent or not and\nBut the idea is that if you're let's say you're building\nA portfolio and a four one K. or you're building one and a Roth IRA or traditional i._r._a. the idea is that if you're in for people aren't aware of what we're talking about a target retirement fund is where you pick a year\nKind of in the ballpark of when you expect to retire and they tend to be and five year increments like year twenty thirty twenty forty five whatever every five years\nThat you're messing up the whole purpose of a target retirement fund if you put money into it and then still put money into other things in your retirement plan a retirement account\n...\nIt's not like it's something you shouldn't do it's just suggested that if the whole idea is to try to get the right mix of stuff that you're invested in\nThat it really is only effective if you go all in on the target retirement fund where are you in your head with this and how does it affect you well\nI had that choice I'm In my legs but I have I'll say they will play ... and um I just had this as part of it ... and I'm hearing that the rate of return that I Would expect what they are they\nOn average about cheaper than last that if I work at all and the target retirement side\nYou know I I Can't speak to whether you would have\nAn overall lower return over the years by diversifying out from it the idea that target retirement fund is really for a different purpose it's to put you in a position where you have the proper level of risk at different stages of your work life\nAnd then as you get closer to retirement\nSo there's nothing that says the you taking some of your money and your four one K. and putting it in other choices is going to get you a lower return it's even possible that could get you a higher returns\nBut it also might involve over the years potentially more risk to you\nAnd losses you could suffer at various points of your work life sure okay\nIf anybody says oh putting forty percent and the target retirement fund and putting the other sixty percent and other things is going to get you a lower return that's not an accurate statement\nOK information okay have a great day and can't entail\nWhat's amazing with the target retirement funds\nIs that any of a number of providers of those in a IRA Ross IRA or four one K. are offering extremely low costs on them and others offering very high costs\nOn the target retirement fund portfolio vanguard which is generally considered to be the gold standard\nCharges typically like

information from you they're sure do ... ah I've been contacted by Fran regarding a multi level marketing company that are promoting a digital coin and I'm not really familiar with what digital coins are\nAnd they're talking about going public and they're not register with their safety and it looks like a ... game to me but I was wondering if you had any information regarding digital calling\nAll right so when people refer to digital coin that's generally a generic term for that one brand name that did establish itself in the marketplace called bitcoin\nAnd bitcoin is an alternative way for people to pay for things around the world and it is which generally referred to as a crypto currency is not a government back money\nIt is one is that is accepted based on a daily value the people who are willing to buy and sell bitcoins are willing to take that value what you're calling about is not bitcoin\nSomebody who's trying to trade on that basically what is it that you would do\nIf you were to get involved in this coin business\nAre supposedly don't have to do anything it just your diet invest a certain amount of money anywhere from a hundred and fifty to I don't know four five thousand dollars\nAnd then the coin is like is worth like two or three cents now and it keeps the posing to rise above the leaves gonna rise and they're going to start a company where you can use your going\nOkay so I Would not go anywhere close to that because first of all when somebody any of us could say today we're going to have Fred money are we going to have Clark money\nAnd I want to buy Fred money 'cause it's going to go through the roof and I'm In a safe red money is worth so much money today but I can tell you in the future you're going to make a fortune on Fred money\nYeah for\nA cart money so I Would tell you that having alternative payment forms is going to be part of the future but they're not designed to\nBe an investment they're designed to be a payment platform just another way to buy and sell things in somebody's promising you're getting in on the ground floor of a get rich quick thing I Would not get involved with anything like that\nThey're they're ... you are eligible for if you do this and get other people to buy them or anything like that\nYeah you can get a commission if he can bring other people and that's what my antenna\nAre and how much commission like if you get me to buy you said a hundred and fifty dollars worth if you get me to buy a hundred and fifty dollars worth\nOf this this electronic Coyne how much do you get to the commission I did at ten percent\nSo he's got Fifteen dollars and then whoever is putting this together gets the hundred and thirty five\n... uh evidently\nAnd the whole product is this supposed that money that you're supposed to trust in that doesn't actually exist yet to be used to buy and sell things\n\nThat's that's the story\nOK I Would tell you don't even think about getting involved in that because that is there's no true product or service is being sold if it's just speculation that at some point people will be able to use these electronic coins\nAnd that sounds to me like that could very dangerously ended up being an illegal pyramid\nMy favorite alternative now you mentioned self insuring\nThere's something that is the same cost is self insuring free but gives you a\nBenefit because of the hyper

their minds and the country for Republicans number five issue and healthcare has been a subject\nOf debate in our country now for a long long time going back to ... generations at least and how we provide health care who pays how people are covered if they are covered and all the rest who've been through all the debates about Obamacare\nAnd here we are at a point where we are spending far more on health care\nThan anywhere else on earth even versus national income spending more than double anybody else\nAnd our lifespans are shrinking in the United states not growing we now have life spans average lifespan\nThat is reaching down to where some third world countries or e calling us what we're doing is not working and we're really affects you is if you have health care provided by your employer health coverage\nYou are making less money in your check than you would if health care wasn't so incredibly outrageously expensive the cost of health care and United States one fifth of our national economy is my belief that the uh partisans\nBoth from the Republican side and the Democratic side are all missing the real issue arguing about what kind of coverage there's gonna be and why\nIt's going to cover and all that was going to cost ignores the real problem is the way we deliver health care and the country and what that costs and I want to go back to an example that I address briefly or we think it was like four years ago\nAbout how one of the poorest countries in the world has managed in a decade\nTo increase life spans of its citizens by an unprecedented amount may be unprecedented in human history\nAnd they've done it in the most basic way possible the country's Rwanda an extremely dirt poor country that when they came up with a new idea a new way of delivering healthcare\nAt the time Rwanda average citizen was lucky to hit even middle age\nToday the average Rwandan lives into their mid sixties which isn't fantastic but it's outstanding compared to where they were before and the way they did it\nIs the kind of thing that could help us so much in the United states\nWe right now in the U.S have a very hospital based medical system hospitals are expensive they treat people when they're acutely ill\nAnd everything about hospital systems in the United states is about hospitals gobbling up independent doctor practices and specially practices and using them as a way to funnel patience end of the hospitals\nAnd that's the beast that's being fed by the way when one of the hospitals buys a doctor's independent practice in order to come up with the money that they're paying the doctor to buy his or her practice they raise rates fifty percent typically\nSo we're all paying money for a system it's all about not worrying about people big time till they're really badly ill\nWhat they did in Rwanda is they recognize the lack of medical care that's available in rural areas and in poorer areas\nAnd if you think about so much of what we argue about how we're going to take care of people is about people in rural America and who are lower income\nSo what Rwanda did was they said we are going to provide basic medical care from Paris professionals\nAnd generally in Rwanda very lightly trained and that one change led to a massive increase in lifespan\nFast shipping visit outdoor limited dot com right now receive five dollars off
