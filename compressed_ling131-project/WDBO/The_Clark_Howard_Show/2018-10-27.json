to the weekend eight o'clock news Ninety six point five\nWTO attorney general Jeff Sessions says today's arrest of a suspect in the pipe bomb mailings only shows the determination of the Justice Department and the nation's\nLaw enforcement is a law and order administration we will not tolerate such lawlessness especially not political violence\n... turkey has more details on how they tracked down south Florida's Caesar say Oct\nYou recount identified by the department of justice as belonging to Caesar's say occupy Ventura Florida is full of right wing content and aggressive criticism of prominent liberal figures including some of the intended recipient of the improvised explosive devices he is now charged with sending attorney general Jeff Sessions was asked about motive\nAnd that that you know how ... going to the teacher I can I add anything to happen that then there's nothing that he could fall back on like ... it had to have paid off\nAnd that thing the way thinking about possibly at least in the house and have you can live off that income and all that kind of went on my question is why it\nWow how interesting so if your parents were to pass away and they own a home free and clear and you're trying to come up with how are you going to have enough money to support your younger brother you are a real sweetheart to be more they're trying to come up with the solutions for this good for you\nAnd so the idea of at a time of your parents passing to turn the home into a rental property that I guess you would manage for the money of benefit to your brother\nI think that that may be unduly complicating a situation where what I Would think would make more sense is to sell the home\nAt the time that your parents might pass away and besides we don't know unless your parents or an extreme failing health they can be with us for decades to come right\nRight so so that possibility of the home being a potential answer for your brother it's just too hard to say that right now\nSo I like the idea of better of your parents instructing and there will that if you are to be the executor eggs that the home be sold and the proceeds be put into a trust that you manage for the benefit of your brother well okay\nThat way you you have no idea what's going to be going on in your life all the years later hopefully your parents are going to live a long long time and who knows what circumstances will be at the time they would no longer occupy the house no longer be on this earth\nAnd so there there's more flexibility if you didn't have money that you then have available to seat of the care of your brother\nOkay yeah we we did think about that and email it back to the you know it probably a straight guy down there and I guess I can think of what can we start doing now I have that as an option that we can get into she chaired by you know\nWhen you're a parent and can do some things right now potentially for the advantage of your brother they can set up what's known as a um five twenty nine ABLE account\nAb Ali this is an account for children are dependents that have special needs of some kind of cool and so it's an account to your parents can contribute fourteen thousand dollars maximum to each year\nAnd the money can then turn around and grow tax free\nFor your brother's benefit and then when the money is spent on his needs and care than the money is spent what's in it and all its earnings tax free\nOh these are new accounts and if your parents have looked at this stuff before they may not even be aware that this is a new opportunity for people to put money aside for a child who has a you can be various types of special needs\nSome excellent yeah we didn't know that that would that would make great\nDo you think you're a parent and afford to put aside that kind of money for your brother each year\n[noise] no I Know I don't think they can\nDo can right so let's talk about one other possibility either your mother your father or either both of them in good health\nYeah than I thought how\nSo another way that people find that needs for\nA child that they're worried about\nAh when they're gone is to buy a life insurance policy\nWhere the proceeds have better paid into a trust for the benefit of your brother okay and that is a relatively low cost way to take care of your brother's needs in the future and to keep it simple your parents would\nAh in the insurance policy that they would each by they would name you as the trustee\nAnd you would administer the trust because then it's a whole lot cheaper than if you hire a third party like a bank to handle this road for your brother\nAnd in fact hold that sounds like a planned Keystone line\nAnd if your parents are hard of any association for autistic children if they are in any support group there'll be people in their who've done this stuff that we're talking about and we'll be able to be of some help to them likely\nOkay fine yeah they have to ... miles on

don't live as well as their parents did\nAnd then where people in America are living as well or better than their parents did and I tell you particularly last decade when we had the banking scandals and the great recession and immediately following when I Would give speeches I Would ask\nWho thinks their kids are going to have a better life and they had two things are going to have a worse like well those were very pessimistic days but overwhelmingly people would say that their kids were going to have a worse life economically even they had\nAnd that is not how it worked out overall in America\nKids continue generally had better economic success then their parents about\nBut there's a clear divide and it was also clear geographically generally in the southeast kids are not doing this\nThat was their parents in the mid west kids are doing much better economically than their parents which is interesting if you think about the years that the mid West was referred to as the rust belt and all that and the lack of jobs and everything\nBut what was clear looking around the country and I just gave two examples there the dividing line was absolutely education\nThat in areas of the country where there's a big emphasis on education kids do significantly better than their parents have done economically\nIn areas the U.S and the southeast more than most anywhere else education is not valued as much and going to college not nearly as valued and college participation rates in a number of southern states or\nSome of the lowest in the United states\nKids do not have the economic mobility or economic success or their parents\nCollege is not for everybody and it's not even necessarily about college but it's about going on to technical school state supported technical school trade school where you learn skills that are in demand in the marketplace\nBut in an economy that now demands more and more knowledge and skill\nKids not getting the education\nIs what creates what's known by a condom is\nBy the awkward and terrible phrase downward mobility I don't want that phrase they have to be used I Want your kids to have upward mobility that's what you want them to have and so I encourage you to encourage your kids wherever you live in the country\nTo understand the importance of education and training\nTo get into a career and education and training threw out there

attorney general Jeff Sessions was asked about motive\nYou said she should take the new to pay out which is much less than ends with her death\nI couldn't believe my ears in my opinion this lady will be leaving thousands if not hundreds of thousands of dollars on the table by taking what you called the simplest solution instead she should find a qualified investment person who can explain the options and get her invest it wisely so she can live off the interest each month and not crack the golden egg\nConfusing since it seems contrary to your normal advice\nSo the reason I like for someone with a pension to not take the lump sum is that the biggest problem people face in retirement is that they outlived their money\nIn order to generate a kind of return that you suggested five to ten percent would require somebody to be way out on the risks meter and what they're choosing to invest in and many people tend to be\nA set your mind that money would only go into CDs or savings accounts which will never generate the kind of money that you'll be able to generate from an ongoing payout\nFrom a pension rather than taking a lump sum all up front so it sounds incredibly conservative on my

the caller some details that the rest of us would love to know it might be because you already know that is by the info that was given to you from your screener but we don't for example last week a woman called about buying a business franchise and a house at the same time\nHe advised her to wait on the house but what was the franchise even just knowing that type of franchise if not the brand would be something it's like watching a suspenseful movie and having to cable having the cable cut out just before the mystery is solved thank you and you don't really stink\n[laughter] ah well gosh I remember so many of the calls today usually it's like it's such a jumble so when I took the call\nUm I never asked what franchise because I Would have gone down a whole pretty quickly that I never would've addressed\nThe house and the franchise issue that I talked about because with franchises I so strongly recommend somebody go work in a business before they ever buy a franchise\n'cause it's not as important to me what the franchise was I didn't have that information\nAnd if I'd asked it and they said it then I Would have had to be careful how I Would have spoken about that specific company that specific enterprise and the advice may have sounded fuzzy at that point I made a decision not to ask\nAnd maybe you're right maybe a lot of people were sitting there saying well what franchise what franchise\nAnd maybe I should have handled it differently\nClark love your advice keep it up I think you missed on the terrorist issue I support free trade the problem is that China

the tariffs which are taxes on the goods we buy are going to be effective as a way to deal with\nSome of the behavior of some of the practices in China there's no doubt that China is an

operations in China and those are true market distortions\nAnd so this is not\nAn easy one that easily fits a simple solution tariffs on the other hand or a blunt instrument to try to deal with the disputes we have with China and it's my feeling the tariffs hurt the American people\nJust like they may or may not hurt the Chinese people but much more likely to hurt us than anybody else\nClark has

the Clark Howard show where it's all about you and that ... of yours for you to learn ideas me so you can keep more of what you may\nWant to talk about what you may [noise]\nYou may be aware\nI have I was always a very eager student of economics an undergraduate and graduate school and I have long been skeptical of minimum wage laws\nAnd they have enormous popularity with voters and whether a state is a Republican oriented state or a democratic oriented state or were they call that purple a mixed state\nNo matter when there's a citizen vote citizens vote overwhelmingly of all political persuasion to raise the minimum wage\nAnd again I never\nThought the minimum wage was good economic policy\nAnd I've always held to believe that if you raise the minimum wage too much that you create unemployment is employers ... to automate functions that people may have done at the lower end of the wage scale I even cited to you last year\nA study done at the University of Washington\nThey put out a paper showing that increasing the minimum wage in Seattle had been disastrous for employment and of course what's known as confirmation bias I saw that and I share that with you so today\nI eat crow because the researchers at University of Washington and a year later have said oops we were wrong\nAnd in fact the increase in minimum wage improve\nThe lives of people who had been earning the minimum wage and did not decrease their employment\nSo that was something that\nI was not prepared for first I Want to give the researchers props for being willing to revisit the research and acknowledge professionally\nThat they were wrong and that under further examination the minimum wage increase did not destroy employment\nAnd\nIn fact it did lead to net fat or pay checks for people because I had always held that the theory\nThat you would reduce hours that people would be scheduled for work and you will reduce the total amount of employment\nAt lower end jobs and on both scores it turns out I'm wrong at least according to this is deep dive research done at University of Washington normally when you have\nResearch that points to a different direction than prior research it's the methodology and it's people who have an agenda\nIn this case it's the same exact people coming up with a different result so\nYou know one of the things in life is you have to be willing to have an open mind and recognize when what your beliefs have been and what they'd been said at that those beliefs can be wrong and on this one\nAt least looking at one of the largest metro areas in the country the Seattle metro area\nI'm wrong\nAnd we'll see over time if in fact you do this place employment is wages move up and up you know we've had this big push around the country for which for to as the living wage which is a Fifteen dollar an hour minimum wage\nAnd I\nI have been someone who has felt that if you want to improve people's earning power you get the more skills you get the more training and you create a better position for them and the work marketplace but it may be that\nIt is about re allocating the pie in a way that I have never looked at and never respected as possible looking at the pie is being effect size I've never seen that perspective and now I say with all humility\nThat maybe there is some validity to the minimum wage\nTo you that may not piece of big route revelation credit's been held opinion of mine for as far back as I can remember\n[noise] uh I don't know I agree with that I Will tell you that um that is that's in line with the school ... school shootings he's also said that before as well um but I Do believe in that you saw the social a website that he was using\nAnd the language that was being used in that at the clock on social class one I think we need to make phone calls these officials when the when they were allowed to say those things is going on for quite a while it just felt [noise]\nDo backwards you had someone called see you are legally possess those those are at least those don't yet\nIt was illegal possession of the uh I Believe was Fifteen was was the weapon your right to use [noise] so uh I think we could have acted we couldn't stop this is so we we may have been that way where it's difficult to say what if someone had made that phone call about this individual that the I like this\nCheap I also want to ask you about the the actions of the officers who responded we were told that a Robert Bowers was exiting the synagogue as the first officer arrived on scene about a minute after the first nine one one call\nThey exchange fire and the gunman retreated back into the synagogue there were four officers hurt but they were all credited with saving more lives\nI Believe so this is active shooter protocols that very similar across the nation or where it's ... it'd be go towards the target\nSo um that's what the throughout the country right now they they vary a little bit with each with each other you spelled it but it's still the same thing ... entry you will not wait no I understand that there are swat teams are\nAlready dispersed with their patrol a program so they were on to see very quickly that they didn't have to respond to the location that's good news um but yes uh patrols\nPolice farming is the front lines who'd be to stop these things this fellow said quite a few times to set\nA
