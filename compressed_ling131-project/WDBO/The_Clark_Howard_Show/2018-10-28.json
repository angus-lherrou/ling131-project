to tell you something I Will walk away I Will do everything I can do to walk like I Do part of martial arts on the arts that I practice we ... we bow out if we're doing weapons training we show great respect if we're doing grappling or or\nOutright full contact we do it with respect we respect the tap we were ... you know we're not there to kill each other we're there to make each other better\nI'm so there's a certain discipline David associated with that and but most people don't know how to defend themselves and be they're going to react like that's just not then they're going to get past and somebody's gonna get hurt\nI couldn't agree more and it is a danger for people in the public square and especially people who hold themselves out as Christians whether you're a pastor or you have a Christian themed blackout you really gotta be careful at it but we do anyway we need to be civil and and when some people on Twitter ... and our other interactions\nBut I don't think that means we don't fight I don't think it means we don't uh communicate our ideas as passionately and as intensely as the left that this ... we don't have to get his dirty as they do\nWell I look I don't know why are we just had Newt Gingrich on and pass to what he was saying is between Cavanaugh I mean all these American\nValues that have have served us so well due process presumption of innocence and then you see that there was no core operation any of these charges\nIf the Democrats really cared about the issue they'd be going after Keith Ellison right now demanding an FBI investigation of Cory Booker will be having an FBI investigation and Claire McCaskill's husband will be having an FBI investigation\nAnd Bill Clinton would be in jail for the rest of his life\nBut they're obviously playing politics with with very important issue so the hypocrisy is there but between Kavanaugh the mobs the caravan that's happening and the fact that we've had on\nParalleled economic success fourteen state record for states record low unemployment\nRecord low unemployment for African Americans Hispanic Americans Asian Americans women in the workplace are vets record low unemployment youth unemployment lowest ever I I'm hoping that people factor that in in fourteen days when they vote or if they vote early\nI think the man on the street will factor then I don't think the people on the street are stupid Democrat or Republican then stupid the party leaders are stupid but the man on the street they're able to see this process that they know that Kavanaugh was that whole cabinet issue was a sham they see the hypocrisy of the left on full display\nThey know that this a caravan is not simply a random\nOccurrence that you know a a all these unconnected people just randomly deciding to all walk thousands of miles to America to look for better jobs they can see the orchestra now some people are going to vote the party regardless but others say listen I'm tired of this because out of the nonsense seems to be coming from the left\nAnd the very behavior that they pretended to criticize they've put it on steroids and I am the lady so do you know they said well we don't like the some of the behavior the president during the campaign\nBut you say they have it to another level and you're you're propagating it\nYou're you're out of Cleveland, Ohio okay you're a an African American conservative you took a lot of heat for supporting Donald Trump out at the results are in\nAnd we're seeing all of these jobs being created for the people look at that picture over there that's the forgotten men and women of America that's what that's what twenty sixty one was about for me the Thirteen million more Americans on food stamps the eight million more in poverty after Obama's eight years\nNow we've got four million jobs created eight million fewer people in poverty and on food stamps we have\nFour hundred thousand manufacturing jobs that Obama sober never coming back\nWhile the president didn't get credit when you break down boats demographically with the black community because they're never doing better they've never done better\nThank God he's going to get the votes you know a ... in the Bible nicotine was came to Jesus by night and there are a lot of ... diem is and they say listen we see what Trump is doing we embrace with Trump is doing is not what they told us that waking up and you know if they say is thirty six percent approval rating\nAt twenty or thirty percent to the fifty six sixty six percent believe me\nHis message just rent cream tell him as a message with amazing the black community I\nCome from a traditional democratic family years voted party forever blacked it in my family and our fear are now so ... to it that they're either going to not vote at all which is which is really up for\nWhat we're doing with the conservative movement for\nThey're going to vote with us because they're starting to see that this is a charade here you know the media constantly but right and President Trump for no reason they've been doing it all day today CNN blacks used to go and get their news from CNN their politics from CNN and MSNBC they're starting to see\nWe got to get in the trenches we've got to figure this out so we're getting a bunch of calls from people saying hey what's going on houses going how's Trump doing this how can we help on this particular side he's going to get on the all the black vote than any other Republican president I'll throw this day but if if we all\nBelieve in in ... the father Jesus is okay and I think all of us here do if we believe that that we all believe one thing and that predicated on that he created every man woman and child on this earth we agree with that right okay yeah so in that sense where\nBrothers and sisters we're all Americans to right and if we really believe that in every human soul God put some talent some ability\nAnd our goal is to to create an environment where that that talent that natural talent flourishes the word education from the Latin is in ... to bring forth from within\nThat tells you that God put their our job is to put enough sunlight and water on something make it grow and help people\nAnd that's what I see Trump's doing and it's and it's now hitting the forgotten men and women David that's the great story of the two years at Trump so far\n[noise] yeah yes and and we want to get back what Trump is trying to do when he says I Want to make America great again it means to restore its founding principles is Judeo Christian founding principles which is based on the idea that we're all created in God's image and that's why we had an alien Abul lights it flows from that\nBut I think the left this authoritarian by nature their economic coercion can lead to political corps you and that's where they are and I I think the left as losing it because they don't have any ideas that worked and I don't have any proposal so they're frustrated and they resort\nTo identity politics and changing the rules and this identity politics\nDividing people on the basis of race and gender\nEvery four to four years at the same thing rich first for versus young

than twenty five percentage points but now because of uh Pennsylvania Supreme Court decision\nOr they decided read do you draw that state's congressional map it is a district that has a chance of flipping and as Perry has said he knows the people the fourth district I grow up with them so when the district was we redrawing it was heartbreaking\nThat's a hand you're dealt and or any way a congressman Scott Perry is with us She's also a Freedom Caucus member and I wanted to give you an opportunity they really tried to screw you in this redistricting didn't they\nYeah Shaun thanks for having me on they have a I read the book they want it to flip as many seats in Pennsylvania as they can and they drew the district to make\nIt ah to make it much more difficult for somebody especially somebody like me who's the Freedom Caucus member a to win and not just the you know you've kind of highlighted some of the things are doing of course the big thing they're doing which they're not just doing it to me you know and talking to all your friends whether Jim ... wherever\nA it's the same playbook which is which actually is kind of absurd when you think about it\nAnd that's this this whole thing about preexisting conditions and healthcare a showing you know they're the ones that screwed up our health care system and and passed Obamacare and uh you know you know a twenty five you're going to say twenty five hundred dollars keep your plan and keep your doctor all that stuff all lives right\nAnd now they're blaming us for medicine it up um we tried to repeal it of course you know what happened with John McCain put wet thumbs down but you know Sean when we fought the original the Freedom Caucus in particular for that original a bill\nOut of a you know the ... the replacement for Obamacare because if you remember we're gonna vote to repeal Obamacare and immediately repay replace it the original bill didn't deal with preexisting conditions among other things the Mark Meadows Jim Jordan the whole crew\nYou know went and talked to the president talked to her leadership and said you know we can't support this you can't have insurance companies denying people with preexisting conditions that we we got that right\nIn the buildup we finally passed yet they're running this play book all across the country because they don't have anything else that we broke\nHealthcare well it's all hardly ... tried to fix it\nWell millions of Americans now they lost their doctors their plans and they're paying a lot more that's number one number two you know the

insistence by people like Mark meadows yourself and others to get that in the bill that was passed ultimately in the house\nOn top of that the individual mandate is gone I mean it will all all Obamacare was was one huge redistribution scheme where are you going to have the young and healthy literally buying plans that they don't need or want be enforced by law habits or penalized if they don't get it financially and then literally\nRedistribute that money to the ... the elderly and disabled in some redistribution scam\nAnd meanwhile they're young to get off a lot better by paying for
