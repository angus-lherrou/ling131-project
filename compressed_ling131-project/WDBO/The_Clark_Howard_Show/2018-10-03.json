as well and um I Know\nThis as this gets barrel as all of this barrels a closer and closer to the conclusion which I think all wrap up the beginning of next week the oh by the way here's the other headline I found it 'cause I have so much stuff do you know the lawyer who cleared Keith Ellison of domestic abuse allegations his partner at a fern that donated half\nA million dollars to Democrats just in the last election cycle because now that do you think that that is significant came\nI think the the the number of goes back to Nineteen Ninety I think they're actually pulling all the donations from Nineteen Ninety eight on ... according to the center for Responsive Politics data\nThey say that even not even half of that five hundred grand was ever donated to Republicans over the same amount of time era so that yeah it's clear that which way they lean it's not it's not a secret\nNow now and then of course there was a two on blips filled up with rice and that were sent to the Pentagon apparently one went to Madison's office\nAnd I like what the hell are you people send in rice and the Madison's office for you know he's going to clear out the office mental ... taste because he's hardcore or he eats rice I somebody made the joke you eat the rice and crispy Mattis won't play with the al\n... eat your style fried rice I'm joking by the way I'm just you know because some people needed explains too because there are so sensitive you know because he's tough that's why he did it because he's impervious to rice than guys understand it during the ... out there who don't get it\nIt doesn't have that you have to explain comedy to the left because it's just like they they will take the worst political\nThere there on ... and ... than comedy is no longer there not be aiding because they they try to be as purposely stupid as possible so as to feign outrage like a contest yeah I Can't I don't have the energy to live your life like that and why are you making\nThe world stock stop just stop it already I Can't it's can you imagine by the way to think for a moment before we get to the same stupid they take you know capital will get confirmed and then say there's not a vacancy\nOn the Supreme Court before twenty twenty what\nHow are these people going to flip out over that because then you're definitely talking about changing the makeup of the court\nI mean where do you go from here you have to sort of fascinating people\nDon't joke about that that's not even know how far can they go the ... obviously they can't go that far but what I'm saying is it's well I don't know the guy who shot at the congressional numbers on the bay area it's like they is it just keeps compounding it's like where will this help or not you in on this I Hope people\nCheck themselves but I don't know I mean I'm I think people like Richard Blumenthal and I'm not I'm hopeful that ain't stupidity\nCame when we got into Blumenthal I considered as Eric Swalwell guy like a\nSelling them in the works um he's always out there smearing and exaggerating and doing things in\nThis take on Kavanaugh's also\nTake typically just will not be disqualifying for any Supreme Court nominee the fact that they arranged in college so I Do to those people in ... but what it is the qualifying because she has payment himself as a choir boy who never engage in any of his behavior and all of the evidence seems to go\nThe other way okay first of all there's no evidence\nSecond of all he's never painted himself as a choir boys ... ... what was that was like beer beer beer I like beer beer but like not once did Kevin I'll say that I'm a choir boy those words never came out of his mouth\nBut because they can't challenge him on facts and with actual evidence this is what he goes out there and says that normally just wouldn't be disqualifying for any\nJudicial nominee now but in this case it's disqualified because he painted himself as a choir boy\nIt's weak stupid and Swalwell as

is\nThey're with Ninety million accounts they're forcing you to sign out and signed back in to try to short circuit the method that the hackers had been able to get into accounts but I Am very concerned about\nWhere one leads to another leads to another leads to another meaning\nWhere things are chain together\nAnd either using the same password or the same user name or using Facebook or any other social media is the sign in to other unrelated accounts\nThese are things that levy wide open leave you exposed to having a heap of trouble putting your doorstep that you didn't cause it's not your fault\nBut you suffer the results of\nCathy's with us on the car coward show Hi Cathy\nClark how's it going it's going well how are you doing\nWonderful thank you which is very important that we are both doing well when you want to ask me about long term care insurance right\nExactly so what's your scoop\nWell I'm I Am sixty five my fiance is sixty seven we're both retired and we're getting married and congratulations\nThinking and we had a meeting with its financial planners to get help planning for our financial need during our retirement and to um [noise]\nWell looking at it as in many states planning tax planning and that sort of thing and we want to make sure that you know either one of us at the net income in the end of our death and we don't want to be in our families and so on\nAnd on and what are they for if you're not going to be a burden on your family in\nFact the right [laughter] and so in that way you know we didn't get with um [noise] you know the issue of long term care\nAnd insurance and it's it's really expensive I'm\nWondering if he might have any suggestions or you\nKnow this is this a real problem because generally you have a segment of the population that doesn't need long term care and that's people who have a very large number of assets generally north of three million dollars okay\nAnd then people who don't need a long term care\nBecause they got nothing they don't own a home you know they're renters they have a very little money say they've got no investments\nSo there's this group of people in the middle that don't have millions of dollars and assets and do have some things like maybe owning a home and other accounts they don't want to be impoverished\nBy long term care and you mentioned not a burden on the family so if you're in that middle section and would you say that you and your fiance you're in that middle\nI Would say that we're in that middle\nYou you do have to think through what in the world are you going to do it one of you ended up needing assistance with what's known as life's daily activities needed long term care needed a assisted living for nurses skilled nursing home what do you do and [noise] the market\nOffers am perfect answers instead of the long term care insurance will generally pay for a three to five year period depending on what you buy\nIt will have an inflation adjustment to deal with medical cost inflation over the years the premiums are not guaranteed they can go up and even initially you're looking at several thousand dollars a year aren't you\nSo it is one of those things there is no good answer\nA there are strategies people do where they go see an elder law attorney and title assets in a way that the assets are not at risk is considered to be a um a a strategy that some people don't like the ethics of others are happy with\nOr you are you by the long term care insurance\nOkay and I read on line about an option or regarding investing in community care\nAnd\nI get the idea that it's basically investing in you know community care facility where\nThe the life stages ones yeah you go in and independent living\nAnd then as your needs change you move from place to place but they they don't provide the care for free I mean you go into a stay at a facility that deals with the stages of aging you're still gonna have to pay\nFor the care right so it doesn't relieve the the cost burden so if you if the two of you want to make sure that you're not a burden to each other and you're not a burden to your kids and you're both healthy now\nAs much as it hurts to write a several thousand dollar check a year I Believe it or not I recommend it\nOkay but I Want you to get a five year benefit if you can afford it and the decent inflation adjustment which would usually be minimum three percent per year\nCovering inflation over the years 'cause a benefit to you today is sixty five let's say you wouldn't need any kind of

Talking to a school group something like that\nAs a way to really get their attention I say you know it was really easy when I was a kid not to have to eat vegetables all the time or eat fruit all the time because we only had root vegetables when it was in season\nNow and they got really interested in that now because we live in a worldwide food market\nIt seems that things are in season all the time that whatever fruit or vegetable you want is pretty much available twelve months a year without food chain we now have has come with the added complexity that people can get sick\nWho source of the illness hard to track\nAnd keeping people safe\nHas become so much more difficult so we'll have these outbreaks of foodborne illness\nAnd you can have fatalities you can have illnesses they can go

check\nWell actually missed that point because some new information was presented to me after my sixty seconds or\nSo okay let's see here\nI'm about to go swim upstream against some of your advice I've listened to for a long long time and you've been really consistent about Social Security wait as long as you can enter a Seventy as possible and I made that decision sixty two now I made that decision five years ago that I was going to wait until Saturday\nBut I was reading something called the Sunday newspaper\nAnd in the business section there is a question to answer and there was something about Social Security and it it surprised me it basically said if you were a Social Security age with a minor child the child could get Social Security benefits\nSo I was kind of started with that so I went to the essay dot Gov Web site and found\nSeveral scenarios where kids can get Social Security the parents died there disable the child is disabled and then there's the one I was looking for it just simply said if you're simply old enough and your child is young enough that they can qualify for Social Security of course they were more politically correct and they said if you were Social Security age and they were a minor\nBut it didn't do anything to say what the amount would be so I made a phone call the Social Security and I said you know here's my scenario where do you think of is the end result of that conversation was they said yes there's no reason your son wouldn't get fifty percent of your benefit\nWell that sounded exciting but I've learned that you don't trust\nPeople on the first phone call or customer service kind of people I've done that before I've listened\nTo the advice made a decision turned out they gave me the wrong information and I made the wrong decision so I thought I'd better double check this I made another phone call different day got a different person they basically said the same thing they brought in this idea of a maximum family benefit\nBut she said yeah you get fifty percent of what your benefit is though she called me a number that was why you love your show now I'm left with wondering well what do I do like a another phone call too I Know\nI Wonder if I Want you to spend some money to see if it's right for you to do this now costs to forty dollars to do what I'd like you to do\nTo ready ready\nThere's a website I'd like you to go to called maximize my Social Security dot com\n\nIt's the most fish Decatur tool that I've ever seen or heard of that will allow you to run the exact scenario of your exact situation\nAnd figure out if your answer is different than the the general answer the back of the envelope answer is always wait as long as you possibly can preferably days Seventy to take Social Security even though nobody seems to do that\nBut if you run the analysis\nPutting in you have a minor child and all that at maximize my Social Security you will get the answer that will be definitive
