choices so that you build in some freedom in your life to make the decisions you want to make you don't want to be one of the people who I oh why oh why oh softer work I go\nAnd that's why I talk so much about the importance on living on less than what you make\nAn saving money each every month each and every pay period we in the United states culturally are terrible at that the average American saves around three cents for each dollar he or she makes\nAnd if you listen to me for a long time you know that that compares or poorly do a lot of other countries in the world where it's routine that people say thirty percent of what they make\nBut there is a counter movement in the United states\nAre people who think heavily influenced by what they saw happen to so many people getting crushed\nLast decade by the great recession that people become fears about living on less than what they make certainly not everybody but it's even got a name FIRE movement\nAnd it's about being financially independent so you can retire early but not necessarily retire early it's really about the first two letters financial independence were you then have the choice of what you want to do with your wife\nAnd the people that are beginning to the FIRE movement\nAre also big into austerity sometimes too extreme with austerity but it's what works for them\nAnd I'm a big fan of what used to be called max savers those are people who live on half of what they make\nAnd a lot of people that are with this modern FIRE movement or many ways echoing what was part of the Mac saving movement of a different era\nAnd there was a a pod cast with someone I've been on their podcast before follow pay on there was a podcast that she had she had Suzie Orman as a guest\nAnd asked Suzie Orman what she thought of the FIRE movement expecting Suzie Orman to say it's wonderful this is great people are saving so much money and said she said I hate it I hate it I hate it I hate it\nAnd I\nHeard about this and I was like what what's there to hate about people living on less than what they make\nAnd she went on to talk about the fact that the amount of money that FIRE movement people had his goals to save to live and independent life were ridiculous dollars that people really need to have a [laughter]\nTwenty thirty fifty or a hundred million dollars be like me okay [laughter]\nSuzie come on you're allowed to touch their [laughter] [noise]\nPeople don't need twenty million dollars for like you a hundred million dollars that's where you have to live in independent life and be comfortable it's all about the lifestyle that you become comfortable with it so the key is the ratio is a formula\nAnd it's pretty simple you save money to the point that you've saved twenty five times the amount of money that costs you to live in one year\nAnd once you hit that target whether it's in your thirties forties fifties sixties or never\nThat's when you know you have enough money built up for the lifestyle you've grown accustomed to that you can afford to live and definitely on the money you've said\nAnd it I Know that's an oversimplification but it really is that simple as soon as he went on to say to Paula ... you need at least five or six million really you might need ten million dollars\nTo retire securely and respectfully I strongly disagree with what Susan said there are people who easily\nCan get by for the rest of their lives when they hit the point they've saved a million dollars it means they're living a\nNot a a barebones lifestyle but they're living more careful frugal
