[laughter]\nBecause I'm always nervous about putting money in a kid's name because as precious as our kids are when they're young we don't know exactly how much are they are going to be and responsible once legally they have access to money\nSo now is a Thirteen year old seven year old and one is going to be one soon you are in a position now with custodial accounts you get to make all decisions\nBut once said she was considered to be adulthood which is actually often before kids mature enough to make good decisions when money if they find out the money's there they have the ability to take control of it and spend it on things that you've worked hard to save you might not be able to control\nSo you're ready for my weird suggestion I recommend\nYeah you've heard me talk about Ross IRAs\n... is that something that you and your husband do\nWe get out right now on hold out we didn't have any\nOn back at ... ... ... ... now that lay right on Lake ... point where I'm an identical they're ... it's quite the impulse four and ...\nAll right so let me tell you the beauty of using the Ross is a way to save for your kids\nYou control what now and in the future and everything the accounts earn they earned tax free so your intention is to give a decent amount of money to each of your children are sounds like and maybe mid twenties\nOr I went on red red ball um well I feel like they're ready for it\nRight so you maintain a hundred percent control if you and your husband each fun Ross\nUp to age fifty or each allowed to put in up to fifty five hundred dollars a year in the days\nAfter age fifty sixty five hundred each but anyway you can ... soccer way enough money over these years moving forward that you can fully put money aside they will meet what your goal our goals are for these three kids but see here's the beauty\nYou can only give them what you've contributed to it the earnings stay behind with you\nAnd stay there although now till you\nWould need the money and retirement\nSo it becomes like a partial retirement account for you we've completely tax free growth you maintain complete control of the money\nAnd when you're ready for them to have the money you've contributed on their behalf you can give it to your Thirteen year old ten or so years from now and have it be a completely tax free event\nIf you don't think you're a Thirteen year olds mature enough at that point you want to wait a couple more years you wait a couple more years but you completely are in charge because it's your account your money\nSort of the loop hole with a Roth is the money that is earning a Ross has to be left to side ... year fifty nine and a half or older but the money you contribute to the raw you're free to use for any purpose at any time\nBomb off ... ...

the Clark Howard show Hi Matthew\nHey how are you\nGreat thank you you got a question for me about the stock market\nA year or so I'm a college student and I had taken out some money from much alone that subsidized loans and the stock market and to some well known stocks\nAnd um was wanting to use that money to um I guess have access to the dividends\nTo curb those games and so I Want to know what your thoughts on uh is is too risky um you know for a college student and I would I Would there be a better place or for that money to loan money so\nYou have the ability to borrow a under the federally subsidized loan program where there is no interest paid until six months after you graduate interest starts right that's true so\nThis is free money but the question I Would ask you if we had a ... a tough spot in the stock market you've put this money and the stocks that you borrowed\nAre you prepared to deal with the consequences if that money is not there when you're out of school and you've got to pay back\n[noise] uh yeah yeah it's it's not it's not too much to where I can handle that I'm On my education right now I'm I'm expected in school for another uh two years\nIf you are comfortable with the risk and you wouldn't lose any sleep if you lost the money\nThen this is essentially\nBorrowing money at no cost\nOkay but\nI've had this question I should tell you over the years I've had this question at least half a dozen times from people who have borrowing authority that they don't need to use under the federal student loan program\nYou got to really do check with yourself that you're going to be OK if let's say you put a few thousand you do in a few thousand each year and the stock market\n[noise] right right like uh I've just started that um and I go to a bar

ways to keep more of what you make [noise] there's a big push coming out of Washington\nRequire drug manufacturers in these crazy TV ads say do for fraud disclose any ads what prescription actually costs for the drugs tend the pharmaceutical companies are going crazy\nLike what in the world are you thinking why would we ever want to tell anybody that knows beautiful models running through the beautiful setting where the backdrop of magnificent mountains are lakes or oceans or whatever they're smiling year to year well the commentator says\nMay cause your right arm to fall off or may cause you to have really sad suicidal thoughts or whatever\nDavid ... of the Los Angeles times\nHas written recently about the proposal from Washington that pharmaceutical companies post prices and what's your perspective on this about having to disclose that smiling people are taking a drug that would cost you two thousand dollars a month or whatever\nWell first let's get a little credit to the president for at least [noise]\nSpotlight ing drug prices as something that he's concerned about and indeed since the campaign he has repeatedly return to this and even said that drug companies are getting away with murder when it comes to pricing but that said he has offered no significant\nManeuver or rule whatsoever to lean in drug pricing and what we got out of the administration last week was simply a proposal that along with all those crazy side effects that get listed what we see ads for prescription Mets on TV and the drug company also has to include the list price of the drug in the intent\nHere now the the administration says it's to shame of the companies seem to bring these prices down because so many of these places are in fact\nIndefensible oh there's a bunch of problems to this first of all what price would they put it in the list price which nobody pays the actual price of the wholesale price\nThat sudden clear ah but the bigger problem is the drug industry to look at that said we don't think\nSo and then they turned out the first amendment and said you can't compel us to say things we don't want and I put out so called to some constitutional lawyers to say well is that true I mean they've got a list only side effects kept they also be forced to list the price\nAnd the lawyers say now it looks like you can make a case from the government's point of view to coerce speech if there was the public interest or public health or safety involved and that's why you do get the requirement for all the side effects\nBut it would be very difficult for the government to argue that there is a public interest in simply shaming these guys with the scarlet letter of having to publicize their\nPrices and so the lawyers are saying you know what the drug industry is going to take this all the way to the Supreme Court where they will probably win in Citizens United environment where drug or\nBusiness has never had more rights and more power and the upshot of this is first of all this is a fight there for the government isn't a way to win and second of all if the drug industry has forced to litigate against what they'll just pass those costs us\nFirst lady

C. pick up every single dollar\nThe employer will throw at you and if overtime they'll throw more money at you you increase what you contribute and end the plan there will be if I'm gathering investing is new for you is that right\nYeah I had just basically started with a ... program before I transferred into my new job so I've only ... you know I'm only dabbled with just a little bit or I you know with my employer now they seem like they're offered a pretty good deal so I Want to\nTake I see you around and around every bit of it that they're giving you free money and then as far as an investment choice at least it first keep it as simple as possible and one of the choices you'll likely have as soon as a target retirement fund\nAnd based on your age of thirty six you would want to look at uh twenty fifty find that that would be the year there would be your target for retired ...\nOkay and and so you just put all the money you're going to contribute ended that twenty fifty and they'll handle how it's invested for you in a variety of things that would be appropriate for you being at this stage of saving for retirement\nSo congratulations to you again on Nora and best seen in

how're you doing I'm fine thanks good how may I serve you\nWell I have an older car about fourteen years that I've driven\nPretty much to the ground [laughter]\nAre sold a plan that has taken brilliant that kids do you know a there was a guy who used to do personal finance stuff who ran the numbers and figured out that if you will\nKeep the cars that you drive the vehicles you drive on average if you buy a new and keep it ten years or longer changing nothing else in your life that that one thing of of keeping vehicles a long time allows you to retire five years sooner\nWell I hadn't heard that but I Am I I'm\nNot even close to being at that point I Believe [laughter] sorry savings and all that so [laughter]\nBut think about the whole you would have buried yourself if you got new vehicles like so many people do every three or four or five years\nRight right and then even fighting warning lying out there now [laughter]\nAnd you said this one is Thirteen or fourteen years old\nRight wow\nWell you have you have earned the right if this one's breaking down to jump in and get something else [laughter] you don't feel about that but\nWe're hoping to have it for my daughter but down the transmission have gone and we replaced it with an older and a couple of years ago [noise] so I'm Wondering how we can still get any money out of it\nWithout putting another transmission on their chest care salad\nSo what would it costs to replace the transmission\n[noise] I think we're figuring even for it with an old used one that would probably end up around they don't get to town\nAnd do you know if you looked up to see approximately what the vehicles worth your was working on that one show\nI had thought about it but I haven't done it yet I thought maybe my husband might have great I'm ... around three thousand\nSo this is gonna sound weird to you but if you can fix the transmission for somewhere a little less around two thousand dollars and it truly would be worth three thousand\nI Know this is nuts but the math says it would be worth fixing it and then having your daughter Dr okay\nMaybe downloading and getting a ride on\nYeah I wouldn't do that and you got so little for it because the reason is is that and this is this is something I'll tell you my for me I'll tell you what Consumer Reports says my formulas been when the value of a vehicle\nIs such that the cost of a repair exceeds fifty percent of its remaining value so in the example you gave\nIf it really is worth three thousand dollars and it costs you more than Fifteen hundred to put a new transmission transmission I'd say dumping but Consumer Reports ran the numbers and they said that's ridiculous but if you can repair a vehicle\nAnd even add again the costs of the repair it's west of the remaining value say anything less than three thousand you're better off repairing it and driving it you know even if you get just several months out of it you were still ahead of the game\nOkay\nNow as far as the way you would do for yourself whether you choose to repair it or not and there are two things you've got to find out before you do at first what would it really cost to replace that transmission\nAnd then second what's it really worth it you may decide even if those numbers still looked like your shoe repair it you're just done with it at fourteen years that's
