traffic coming up for you to mom at first it as our top local story tonight Cruz where do you see will be working through the night to repair a rupture water main downtown Atlanta channel nine eye witness news reporter Jeff left Coolidge\nAnd as I walked around lower Manhattan I was a it was doing stories on Wall street\nAnd you see the vibrant everywhere and the crazy thing is Seventeen years later but lower Manhattan is more vital and more alive than it ever was\nEven before the evil look back to\nAnd if there was ever a sign of the fortitude of our nation the resilience of our nation\nAre can do spirit seeing New York so alive and so dynamic is it is all over the city in fact if you go to the what they refer to as the outer boroughs\nThe vitality of Brooklyn now the Seventeen years ago Brooklyn was still a backwater\nAnd it's still alive and then there's this area called Long Island city in Queens which was a industry all kinds of slum area and now they're all these gleaming towers they're probably thirty high rises there and that area's become a hip kind of area\nAnd you see what is so fantastic about our nation and that is the spirit we haven't had time as we approach the terms\nThat we in one respect have lost our way and something that's so frustrating for me and that's that that was among those that are part isn't that our political\nLook at those they disagree with is their enemies ... uh dehumanize them and act like they're a lower form of life for the people of either perspective look at the other left or right look at the other is if they're not good Americans I mean this is nuts\nBecause we are all privileged as Americans to live in a land where we are able to disagree and we need to remember the thing that Ronald Reagan and Tip O'Neill one Republican one Democrat\nSo eloquently stated so many different ways so many different times the concept of disagreeing without being disagreeable I saw with my own eyes\nIn a visit I did to the Pentagon or a few years ago to give a speech and you may not know this but I worked in the Pentagon has a civilian employee at the end of the Vietnam War\nAnd then I was back to speak at an event at the Pentagon\nAnd in between of course in all those years there was the attack on the Pentagon as well on September eleven and I saw there that the people more than their losses rebuilt and\nThe Pentagon is there as it was before to provide for our nation's defense and security I mean what what I Want you to really reflect on\nIs what a great country we have the privilege of being part of and how we as Americans\nAnd as a people showed that we would not be defeated by those who wish to rain evil upon us and death and destruction upon us we lost thousands of our fellow Americans that day\nWhat we found afterwards was our strength as a nation\nAnd our ability to move forward and succeed in spite of others who wanted to bring us nothing but failure\nWe showed in a time of adversity what we were made of and that makes me so proud to be an American\nMartin is with us on the Clark Howard show oh Martin\nSlow o'clock now are you today\nGreat thank you Martin if you've been to New York in recent years\nNot in recent years no sir I was there when they were first constructing the towers back in the I guess late sixties early seventies when they were that was on a family vacation\nFor if you went back you would see a completely different New York was interesting when you were in New York New York was as a city was flat on its back crime was out of control and nothing seemed to work\nAnd today in New York is send amazingly ah for lack of better term user friendly place things just seemed to work there\nFor a while though that's that's kinda know tells into my question let's say I wanted to go to the or just to see that but I didn't care all night where there's lots of other places I'd like to go to Florida so I wanted to see him of always wanted to see 'em but I don't care when a when I go but I Want to go at least expensive time\nAnd I was searching the Internet age is difficult to find a if you don't care when you go how do you find when is the cheapest on together\nSo you've got different tracks here so [noise] it in the case of hotels depending on the city you can figure out that pattern really easily it's like I had this question from someone who wanted to go to Las Vegas with his girlfriend and I was talking through\nHow you can go to these price calendars for the big casino hotels and you can see week by week month by month\nWhen they're at the cheapest right and you can do that same kind of thing\nWith um any city in America not as easily as you can do it in Vegas lay out there but you can you can go to let's say you go to trip advisor and you put in a city you're interested in going to and\nYou put in um whatever level of hotel you're interested in three four or five star whatever it is right it's your level\nYou put on you put it and and then you can put in the dates and put in try different dates over the course of many minds and you'll see the prices move up and down like crazy\nOh I Know over many months but I don't it's I don't care who had over the next two or three months I don't have to put in you know every day for the next Ninety Days\nAnd that way if you're if you're going to be a traveler who's trying to save money and you got to pour yourself doing this stuff so likely they're there's there's\nNo way to just put in Saint Augustine Florida you know in a range of November December January and it tells me when the cheapest\nGo right to the software go right the software because I don't know anybody who's done that with airfare it's really easy like if you there is but if if you better go dot com slash flights\nYou can put down a destination and it'll show you in a in a split second where you can see month after month after month the lowest price is\nGoing to place there was no equivalent\nWith hotel so you have to be that's a shame Saturday morning my article is\nNice places to visit I don't care when I just you know over the next six months you know if he got the cash in on that you choose a plan which I Would think most people get to choose when they go well if they don't care when they go let's go at the least expensive time and\nNo Clark some of us don't have time to do certain week week trip for six months trying to\nSay what's cheaper than actually [laughter] you know\nIf you don't care it went over the next year let's say you're right that's another thing European overseas travel\nIt'd be nice there 'cause you you know of course know when the when the off season is in all these places well I have I mean I'm here in Pensacola I Know on the off season is here but I Can't tell you ... years ago I didn't even know what else he's also the state of Florida any different than a year [laughter]\nWhat what you could do is one strategy that might work if you sign up for the hotels specials at a there aren't that many big hotel chains anymore if you did it at Mary odds website Hilton website and hire a site yes I've seen\nThat and they send you those that would be a way that would be in a work who prices are really low right now to blah blah blah on the air fare yeah inch and patterns so the cheapest time to travel\nTo Europe is November to march except during Christmas right as far as the cheapest time to travel anywhere in the United states it is the first two weeks of December\nRight after the Thanksgiving holiday closes out except for New York city everywhere else on the contrary yeah those are the cheapest two weeks of the year so\nTraveling too but I'm I'm Still looking at driving you know a couple of states away to a town somewhere

door\nYeah I don't even remember why I was there but um I used to spend a great deal of time in Virginia 'cause I went to American University in Washington\n... okay great so let's talk about son\nYes we have a house that the back side of it in secret money enough that I mean it actually kind of didn't in our first deck\nHardly got they got a composite that because of the Senate side there so I started thinking what is the great if we could use solar power because we know that it's very sunny side of the ... it would be the back of the house so you know when you have to be on the front panels Bruce\nAnd what we did get a quote and had a couple of course and they kept on a guy with giving us that he said that they are currently federal tax credit\nThirty percent but what kind of OK quote did you get for installing solar before the tax credits\nI'm only been about twenty eight twenty nine thousand dollars\nYou must have a pretty big house\nWell we have about three thousand square feet but it's a ... in that it that three stories to get there and say so that when that believe it or not that one that's covered the whole ... I'm trying to remember how many pounds I mean I think I was just sick than all\nRight I think you've got to do some more work to get some more quotes that sounds way too high\nOkay All right so what would you say for let's say if he would tell me thick panel what would be a good right\n[noise] well you don't really look at that because the system's supposed to be engineered based on what your power demands or and somewhat translated from your square footage\nAnd it it would not be unusual for you like we have a solar installed with thirty two panels and you're like\nOK wouldn't be unusual that you might need somewhere twenty four to thirty two for your house and even that many panels would be surprising if it costs that kind of money\nSo you only have one quote so far yeah that would be where I'd really concentrate what's your current monthly power bill average as best you can guess\nProbably around two hundred and thirty a month\nRight so if you're spending a so let's just rounded off let's say you're spending three thousand dollars a year on power you're not going to go into every thousand to zero if you ... twenty eight thousand on panels to get the thirty percent federal tax credit because you know drop you to let's say Nineteen\nFive right\nI don't ah that would take for ever to get paid back on yeah ... yeah\nSo that does not on the face of it\nThe numbers don't add up to me and that's why you gotta go get more quotes okay they want to be able to get a pay back net of credits in less than a decade\nOkay they say that after ten years my total out of pocket with the center of five thousand how's that\nIt is the way that they said you know the monthly installment I'm certain that would be a hundred and forty three and then the installment minus the energy saving energy production would reduce like in a year to be an estimate about sixty dollars a month okay\nLet me tell you when you're running numbers never take their assumptions based on installment payments or anything like that\nLook at it from the wrong numbers of what you pay for a system minus thirty percent credit take your three thousand dollars a year power bill so you're out how much of that you're likely to say let's say you cut it in half the ... say Fifteen hundred dollars a year\nHow long would it take you to make up that Nineteen five plus interest you're looking at for ever and the day and that's why I Need to go get more quotes and see where the numbers really would flesh out there this is somebody who is a strong strong so we're advocate\nSherry I Need for this to work for you financially not be something you do when you're like why\nDid we do this why do we send this contract we have to pay all this money and where's the savings Robby is with us on the Clark Howard show hello Robbie how are you doing\nOh I'm doing great Clark thanks for taking my call waiting for the wonderful things that you do to a educate thousands of people well thank you\nYou've that what's going on with you\nWell I have a credit card account with one of the banking institution\nIt is a little bit it spread about Fifteen thousand dollars [laughter]\nI have money saved up which which I could actually pay it off but that would exhaust my um emergency savings I don't want to do that\nI have another institution it's a credit union and they currently have a promotion going on where you can do the balance transfer and it's at two point nine nine percent for twelve months\nSo I was thinking about doing that and in doing that I was planning to close out the other account that has the sixteen or right over Fifteen thousand dollars in it but I've been hearing I'd heard often I think even from during your a show\nDo not close the account keep it open and use it periodically\nWell you don't have to use it I'm constantly but if you use it even twice a year for very small purchases it will keep it in your credit mix and that's very valuable for you to do you don't want to have just a single credit card\nYou want to have I was called the Noah's Ark rule you want to have at least two credit cards okay\nAnd the reason is is that the available credit that you have on the two cards added together versus the amount you have charged on cards figures directly into what makes up your credit score okay and so you want to have substantial available and use credit\nYou also want to have multiple lines of credit that you can be graded on essentially in your credit report and your credit score\nWell see I've also heard well actually I've been through this before probably about Twenty years ago I'm retired military\nThank you so much for your service\nYou thank you so you bet you bet and uh years ago my wife and I were purchasing a fan and we were told at the time we had too much available credit right silver had to do\nSo that a mixed message right yes I'm telling you cheap credit open and then it's unusual with a vehicle loan they tell you have too much of a a well credit but where you'll hear that the most often is when you're applying for a mortgage\nBut at the same time when you're applying for that mortgage if you don't have multiple lines of credit it makes your credit score lower and then people may not make you the the home loan or they may charge you a higher interest rate\nSo okay wait until something happens if somebody says no we don't like all that available credit and then you choose maybe their clothes something but otherwise leave the lines open because if you look at what makes up a credit score is\nAnd the two major areas of a credit score it pays for you to keep that old line open\nBeth is with us on the Clark Howard show hello Beth\nHi there how are you doing great so excited to be on it\nWas great to
