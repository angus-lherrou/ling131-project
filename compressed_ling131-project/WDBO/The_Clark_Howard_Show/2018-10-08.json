USA Today's story Brett Kavanaugh was quote belligerent and aggressive\nThat's from a yo classmate which is weird the way the story is laid out\nUm this is Chad flooding ... socio professor of history of North Carolina State University and released a statement said that Kevin has quote not told the truth when denying he never blacked out and downplaying his drinking\nThis guy ever know if he blacked out or not because it never says that again and the rest of the story and you just say no I saw him slurring alive staggering around and when he got drunk he was often belligerent and aggressive\nAnd so you have all of that just adding up and that's the stuff that's really good and covered as far as media goes ... oh you see this\nHe's a big boozer man\nIs it just me or is it still like the big big thing with Dr Ford and what she said was her good friend was there and she has no recollection\nLast I heard didn't know Brett Kavanaugh that but the and along with the rest of her story it's not that I don't have sympathy for her but there are too many things that\nDon't add up right it's not like this guy's going to be boosted when he's on the Supreme Court bench right it's not like he's going to come into a steward setting a sit down and go\nHey Ruth that black robe looks fantastic I don't know I remember a couple of years ago the waiter Denver passed out during the state of the union because you had a couple of glasses of wine but you know on a true story and it took about blackout drunk oh yeah mhm so I don't know where all this goes and then you've got the Michael ... at ya against\nJulie sweat Nick is the person that he's representing she has other accusations about Brett Kavanaugh about gang rape and drugging women at parties those accusations are falling apart she was on MSNBC yesterday and she was so not credible the today show didn't even play their own exclusive\nNone of her because she can't even get the timeline of when she decided to come out with the allegations right those didn't make sense\nAnd so they are going around she's changed your a story from the sworn statement that she put out last week it's changing a little bit ... says though ... they're not falling apart you know even though it's wet and it has gone back on saying that you saw Brett Kavanaugh andme are judged by the punch at parties that were this gang rape stuff was allegedly going on\nNow Michael ... he got defensive last night on CNN talking to Chris ...\nOne of her friends informed her of what she just put in a declaration or what was a test to tune the declaration and last night at ten forty PM I\nHad a telephone conversation with a woman who will go unnamed who lives in Florida who told me directly that mark judge and Brett Kavanaugh would spike the punch with a grain alcohol and quiet lives\n'cause she's seen it or she heard he knows it because she saw it and it's about the fifth conversation that I've had with her last fall as to where the FBI a hundred percent and this is what we associate nameless for us but she would give her name yes because she doesn't want to be out and publicly she is prepared to speak to the FBI and Chris\nThis is what I keep coming back to okay\nWe're not talking about a lot of resources to interview my client\nThe woman in Florida and other witnesses that I'm aware of we've got to make sure that we get this right as a nation\nMy my God latitudes on that and yeah what's this going to come down to if you've been injured at work I wondered in turn of the camera and say that [laughter]\nNow you're entitled to a settlement [laughter] call this number [noise] playing out now that he's got a\nCredible none of this is credible brand blood let's see who are they stop what they say well I've got five people who will go nameless and we haven't seen yet who haven't offered up any testimony whatsoever but there are there and here's what they said\nMurkowski Collins flake where do you see this going are they going to confirm or not\nYou know there was on every day it was coming on the side of me today that thought for the first time that Trump would withdraw the nomination\nThat's not happening I don't think it will I really don't\nUm however I think he would from a political standpoint he could say this guy's been through enough I'm not making them put his family through this any more withdraw the nomination before the vote if you knew the boat wasn't going to go your way\nAnd you feel that way they call you could make political hay with it by saying I had to withdraw the nomination because of what these people did\nI think you can make political hay out of that at the votes to fail and I think it's\nBasically a coin while and you may wait around for I think I'm definitely going\nSet a few days ago man a Democrats are better be helped a careful what they hope for ... because if ... if this nomination fails the confirmation of Brett Kavanaugh fails its nuclear war from conservatives meeting I mean that that blue wave is gone\nBecause they are going to look at this and say oh it's not that they aren't serious accusations but when you have even this lady's
