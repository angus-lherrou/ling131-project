what that is [noise]\nI'm In my last payment on my student loans [laughter]\nThat has got to feel great [noise] uh\nHow many years have you been burdened by student loan debt\nNine years\nWow it's going to feel great to be done and there are a lot of people green with envy that you turn your student loan to zero and less than a decade because some people are facing Thirty years with student loan debt but that's great that\nThat you are done did you pay off on a more aggressive schedule or just work out you were able to pay it off and nine\nMore aggressive schedule I I kind of laid up plan a of getting it paid off in less\nThan ten years because I didn't want this over my head like just just said over Thirty years that's just too much I'm really a ... with it a little more way more than the minimum payments and uh got paid off in nine years\nAnd I don't know if you've heard me say to others in the past to successfully paid off student loans you need to keep your proof that you have successfully paid off your student loans for the rest of your life\n[noise] right and I needed to contact me about that before sending that last statement right\nExactly and ... you know has had a lot of spotlight on them for abuses in the student lending industry and so they especially your one that you want to be a hundred percent certain you have a proof that you have successfully paid off your student loans from in this area is that\nStudent loan lenders were granted extraordinary power by Congress I think in two thousand five where they don't even have to prove\nThat you owe a debt they're able to ah sees your bank accounts are able to see easier paychecks\nIt's unbelievably abusive what student loan [noise] lenders are allowed to do and that's why you've got to make sure you have every bit of documentation you can to fight back if five ten Twenty years now\nThey come back and say oh no you owe money you need those documents to prove and I would keep a copy a digitally and the paper copy as well 'cause paper can disappear\nAt some point over your lifetime [noise]\nA question for you said I mean last name it would be a money order personal show just to electronically like are they doing\nElectronically is fine and you should have an electronic record for them showing your balance and that last payment would show that you've taken it to zero [noise]\nRight and then they will also show they canceled check a final thing that [noise]\nAnd so everything you have that proves that you you did all that is what you want to be about what's your next chapter in your life now that you have stayed to this you've gotten these student loans wiped out what are you going to do next [noise]\nI got to say it's a it's a good feeling but it's like all over the next challenge and the next one is going to be a new law which I took out foolishly of four yeah foolish reasons but I'm done it like I say what the civil loans they get paid off [noise] um but my question was and when I wrote in\nUh I'm getting ready to take a vacation to Colorado to visited a family my grandson that's also over there\nAnd uh [noise] just I'm wanting to know what if they okay to maybe splurge a little bit maybe three months worth of those are five hundred dollar monthly student loan payments\nAre suing reward yourself I mean you have you ever work this thing so hard for so long if you want to just uh have some fun it's like when I always say if somebody comes into unexpected money\nThat you don't be practical with all of it you do something with it just for fun whatever it is and in this case it's like your graduation gifts from student loans\nThere you go to a real quick court for all the listeners out there I'm an outlet I mentioned the names or whatever but there are certain things that are out there like surveys and there's another one that you know if you make a promise to it's like I say the name of that they will actually contribute to your\nStudent loan payments and that's why I say that helped me out you know I I was on it and doing it to a program and it shaved off a year's worth of pain and maybe a little bit less [noise] um but it helps out it's less money coming out of your pocket so you know if they will do research it\nYou know that this potential for free money out there to help pay down your student loans\nWhere I'm going to step out there for ... and take a risk and you go ahead and name who it was he wanted to name just then\n[noise] ah well she promised\nOh you promise oh yeah yeah yeah you promise is a very interesting program and you promise actually helps you to phrase some of your costs ... or yeah and so you promise has any of a number of features that help you\nSave money for school use money for different purposes they really designed around education and so it's the letter you promise dot com and you go have fun and Colorado and don't feel guilty about blowing some of that money\nThomas is with us on the Clark Howard show Hi Thomas ...\nGreat thank you Thomas you have a very enterprising young son I gather\nYeah he got an opportunity or get a little side jobs fever cabs a dairy farm and I'm excited for him to for what he's gonna learn there but also he's\nMaking a nice wage for an eleven year old and I was just wondering is using a Roth IRA would be as a savings account for him would be a doable strategy\nSo doing the raw for an eleven year old is beyond fantastic because you have to it has to be a custodial raw\nRight ah all three of my kids had Ross from the second they started working and so it allowed them as teenagers to start building up money\nFor the long term and so you can open a Roth with any of my low cost companies I've got and find it a only up to the amount your eleven year old earns in a year okay and then that money can either grow tax free for the Next Fifty years\nAnd will grow into an amazingly large amount of money over fifty years\nOr your son when he reaches adulthood can pull out contributions that have gone in as he's a young child to read that and then through the teenage years\nHe can poll contributions out tax penalty free any earnings would need to stay in their till

in earlier we heard from a gentleman who had finished paying off his student loans getting ready to make his last payment and student loans have been enormous burden in this country\nTotal across the economy one and a half trillion dollars give you a perspective that's fifty percent higher than the entire outstanding credit card debt in the country for\nStudent loans the good news is that\nPeople entering college now are much more wary about taking on student loans they're playing harder to get\nColleges are having a tougher time getting people to say yes and the result is that tuition costs after going up year after year or roughly three times the rate of inflation\nNow aren't going up generally at all\nThe list price may be going up but in order to more students into their classrooms colleges are having to offer deals\nPrivate colleges had become really aggressive at offering deals and the actual cost of four year degrees\nIs not going anywhere for cause the increases we've had over recent years have all been because the ease of borrowing money and people unfortunately not realizing\nWhat can be lifelong implications and burdens from taking on those student loans so the marketplace is now working\nAnd it's working because people are making better decisions\nAnd a lot of private colleges if you're going private instead of a a government colleges state college\nA lot of private colleges now are short of students some of that just demographics playing into the equation but they're struggling to fill their enrollment and that means that you don't have to be\nThe number one student in your high school class or number five student in your high school class you may still be able to set off a competitive battle a bidding war if you will\nAmong schools they would like to have you as a student\nRemember my rule though you're never going to protect your wallet if you only negotiate a first year deal you need to negotiate a four year deal\nAbout what that school is going to offer you versus another school versus another school you may have heard me tell the story that my daughter\nAh after she made her decision where she wanted to go to school and rejected places one of the school she rejected came back and offered her a monster scholarship if she changed her mind\nAnd go to that place instead of the other one that we're she's actually attending and I was kind of hoping she'd say monster scholarship I'm going to take it but she didn't but it was out there and that's the thing is to use the marketplace to your advantage and with state school systems\nVary somewhat state to state but more and more states are now going to three T. or for tier\nStates supportive school systems where they will have what is for lack of a better term maybe sometimes used in a state\nThe flagship state universities charge the highest tuition\nThen there'll be second tier third tier forest here is a community colleges many of which now offer a four year degrees each here has a different tuition level the greatest irony of it though the whole system\nIs that people who go to a first tier state school\nYour freshman and sophomore year will be in far larger class sizes than someone who goes to a fourth tier community college in his state\nSo you might be in a classroom that has fourteen hundred students or eight hundred students or something like that at a tier one the flagship university in a state\n[noise]\n\n\nDuring the death toll for hurricane Michael continues to rise there have been twenty nine confirmed storm related deaths because of

I. S. T. W. E. B. dot com\nOkay and when you go there it's a clearinghouse for a zillion\nWeirdo scholarships where somebody maybe went to such and such college and studied in the school of blah blah blah and they want to give a thousand dollars each ear to somebody who's studying that same major or whatever they're they are\nI don't know that they're called micro scholarships but a lot of the money for a kids' college you cobble together and if people were patient and you find\nThe scholarship opportunities that fit you as a student and you start submitting applications it's a lot of work\nBut I Know people whose kids have picked up you know two hundred and fifty dollars missed one twelve hundred from that won five hundred from this other one and after a while it it's real money to defray the cost of college\nSo this is different than when you think about somebody who let's say as a student athlete and gets a hand bride or free ride for someone who is one of those very rare or kids who gets a full free ride because they're unbelievable academically you know for most people it's\nGetting a piece of money here a piece of money they are a piece of money every where the line\nAnd by the way your um

you Andy where you are on the age spectrum\nI'm mid thirties\nMid thirties John you want to do the the raw four O. one K. unless you make a huge salary\nOkay and the reason the reason you want to do that is the value of the current tax deduction for a pre tax dollars going into the\nTo the regular four one K. is not worth enough with the time you have in your mid thirties for that money to grow tax\nFree and then be spent tax free and so that's why the raw four one K. is such a superior choice for you\nTo do you recommend than that I kind of put more money in the ... and just but it's not just are not in the traditional just meet by company match\nYour company match will happen even if you're doing the wrong their match goes in is a pre tax match and will ultimately be taxed\nYou know when you spend it down the road but you don't have to be in the traditional four one K. to trigger the company match it's the active putting money in the four oh one K. whether the Roth version of the regular that triggers the company match\n[laughter] well thank you very much\nSure and by the way do you know I pulled the terrible trick on you okay yeah\nBecause because they keep putting the same

are the ones I I don't rent time on a a bird or why but I have my own scooter and uh as you may recall\nAbout four months ago I fell off my scooter and broker tooth and got myself up pretty badly but I still write it\nAnd I've learned from that experience where the helmets really good idea is any hospital emergency room seeing people come in on the times and the birds getting injured they'll tell you the element is really a nice thing to have but I never see anybody wearing a helmet\nThen you know you got the weather and all that so where do these scooters all came from\nIs from China all the ones that pretty much the bird uses are from a company called mind by that's who makes the one that I ride\nAnd there are a couple of hundred dollars but also coming out of China not to the U.S that I've seen anywhere yet or a weather protected widow for lack of a better term like micro cars\nToyota actually has one that I've seen in San Francisco it's a little teensy tiny electric I'm almost car and so you're protected from the elements and all that the interesting thing is these things\nTend to St price out and about a thousand dollars so four times the cost of buying one of the little scooters but again you're protected from the elements\nAnd where we would put them in the United states uh 'cause it's not an if they're coming here they are coming no doubt we're gonna have a continued evolution\nOf alternatives for short trip transportation in urban and more congested suburban areas in the U.S we have a complete breakdown\nIn transportation in so many metro areas of the country and so many situations where public transit just isn't going to make it work because cities that developed on the automobile\nDon't have enough natural population per square mile so easily make public transit work\nSo having micro vehicles that you're able to get around in for shorter distances you think about the climate bird scooters tend to be for rides a two miles or less\nBut having something that could handle rides up to five miles which believe it or not carries an enormous per cent of trips that people do better ultra short and being able to get more vehicles in the same space\nIs really an exciting possibility for us to expand on how mobility works in the U.S because\nMore pavement not going to happen and\n... besides when we do more pavement all we get is more congestion so I don't know if you've ever seen the picture of the three wheeled vehicle one person vehicle that I used to ride around as my only transportation in the early eighties it was called the freeway I think we've posted a picture and collect dot com awhile back\nBut I was way ahead of time with that and I think that\nIs where a lot of close and transportation and the U.S is going to find
