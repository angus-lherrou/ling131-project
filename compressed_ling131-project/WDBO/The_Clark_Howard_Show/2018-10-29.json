Russell the paper was\nConfronted by a young man nearby grabbed a bag of gum from her and threw it on the floor\nHang on a second\nSo I make sure that I'm following it wasn't that she was gone it loud and long run it's not none of that there was the rappers right\nBut it's a bag apparently it was a bag of gum okay and so then the guy takes the bag and throws it on the ground and so ... quite near at the sympathy but everything apparently seemed fine and then the woman though she was just lying in wait because ten minutes later as the crowd was applauding\nThe gum to we're\nSmack the glasses off the man's face turns around and Joe pops him in the face\nOkay now her male companion wound up Berlin down with another guy in the crowd he got no choice right well he's got to defend their honor now you got that one of those situations where it's like well [noise]\nI knew she was a wild card when I got what part of what I Love but it's also what leads me get a black guy every now and again [noise] so what happens now this all\nPeer to calm down for a little while or the woman's companion talked with the new to add a glasses hit off and well as\nThe body and towards getting up around the guy gets in a little bit closer to the man who had his\nGlasses smacked off and punched him in the stomach [noise] jeeze [laughter]\nSo your usual symphony fair you don't think of a mosh pit when you think what they like metal in Sweden so I understand that they like metal in the states too but at a symphony it's a little bit different crowd unless it's one of those terrible symphonic metal shows like Metallica doing Ehsan em remember\nWho I yes I Do remember that some fans like that I'm a wife and I know it's not my thing um but\nYeah barely and so they're they're the the venue has had to come out and say by the way no food or drink [laughter] it'd be a hundred times I'm not going to say this was worth all of that and thrown a bag of gum\nDown but the rustling of papers is just knowing when it's quiet and you're trying to hear something [laughter]\nYou to tell me it's not annoying [laughter] no okay I Wonder what the car ride home was like though\nWhy would that couple that get involved in this brawl\nOr they kinda laughing about it as they get home or is the guy just a little frustrated with his with his girlfriend\nI think it probably when something like this you know\nAnd then I kind of thing and I mean it's not the gas [noise] ...\n[laughter] I think that's somehow [laughter] okay so you got your a mega millions and take it you're all ready to go jackpot one point six billion I'll get one on the way home okay\nYeah that's one of the big stories out there is that you could buy every possible ticket still turn a profit well before taxes the\nTax man comes around and then you lose everything\nYeah but that is interesting\nHow would you exactly go about doing that do you have to hire like thousands of people to fill out tickets don't you yeah\nI mean it's more fun to talk about just like the math in it yeah\nBut I mean to you by half of that many tickets were like hey man now it's like relax geo one out of two\nAnd I don't know\nI think you just pay your two bucks and resign yourself to the fact that you're still going to have to go into work tomorrow you know I don't know if you've heard the story you know that we had it yesterday Ninety to Ninety five percent of people just do the instant pick mhm just random numbers yeah\nWhen people here that they don't believe it was like why am I always stuck behind the person that has their specific numbers\nWell not only that but they also have like forty scratcher tickets but they want to also redeem at the same time mhm [noise]\nAre you judging right now All right well a little bit see I don't I don't have a problem with you you buy the bought a ticket or a scratch off every now and again that's no big deal but yeah I've I've ... the convenience store near my apartment\nIs every day there's like five people there who have a ... back and they take forever getting through the line 'cause it's will go through that one no I thought that one was good for five dollars and it's like I'll give you five dollars if you just get the hell out of the\nWay [laughter] [noise] I'm trying to think now collectively between David you Craig and Robbins how much you guys have spent and got nothing\nI'm like hey we got to be close to a hundred bucks [noise]\nI could actually do the math on that [noise]\nDuring the break and what you know yeah something like that [noise] and it's not a hundred dollars

heartedly let's go long haired I buy her president and the president he said quote make no mistake despicable acts of violence and harassment are being carried out by radicals across the political spectrum not just by one side\nRegardless of who was responsible these acts are wrong and must be condemned by Democrats and Republicans alike period I agree with that I agree with that to your soapbox but\nCall Hillary Clinton saying knock it off\nBy saying yeah we could have peace why you weren't wearing rarely when we have our then get in their face by the way the response to this from liberals has been very quick to a tow trucks\nAre Democrats are being sent bombs and Chuck Schumer top priority is still appeasing Republican see there you go I mean come on that'll solve things\nYou know what they say about character right [noise] but yeah good times everybody's got great character is through adversity it gets absolutely revealed mhm\nEverybody every individual has you know their own things to answer for with either what you post what you say all of that right mhm so when the blame goes to one guy and it's all Trump Trump sorry hold on a second\nThere are things that have been going on for years or eight years let's not blame one person for the state of where we're at right now\nThis has been part of us for a long time and it's just getting exposed and I think when you're talking about social media in one of the things the right upfront exactly there are a lot of different things the world we live in now you can't blame one person you know give me a break with that so\nWhat do you do or he is hardly do stand up they both collectively need to stand shoulder to shoulder look in the camera and say enough I don't really agree and like and and I'm Talking about anti ... out of all the jobs that is breaking the law\nStop it stop\nBut it does get to be okay there's also got to be law and order yes that's what people want right\nAnd then you've got this caravan coming out of it\nAnd it's what a political issue it should be simple there's got to be law and order and I mentioned that another one started I Will be another one after that and another one after that you know a completely switching gears um play this for David earlier and you should hear the Scott\nBecause yesterday David out of the story about millennials saying they have the TST from the last election but like twenty five percent\nYeah but that's also because you're you've got people during the pot on social media all of that it's time to take a step back from all of it\nAnd just realize that your wife isn't that bad it was the survey from Arizona State university ... where they yes a quarter of the respondents said that they had Pete TST but he had this guy George Jones combat veteran a double whammy tea\nYeah uh he defused bombs that was his job in the military he has suffered from the TST right and he was on Fox and friends this morning and Fox and friends asked him about this particular story and I thought it was interesting 'cause he starts off by kind of explaining what we know about pi TST right now and why it affects particularly combat vets 'cause he says it's not just\nThe act of being in combat a lot of times you have other underlying issues that wind up getting exposed I'll just let him explain to\nPull us in a first of all time high stress disorder isn't isn't a negative thing it's something that a lot of men and women suffer from because they were put into a traumatic experience\nBut when we really started to pull back the layers on these thousands of military service members who are diagnosed with ... see what we learned is that it's a it's a dramatic and it's a boy a misnomer across the board when you fall peel back layers of the onion these men and women ad\nTraumas a child they had a divorce that things that happened in their social whereas with the people they care about before they ever went to war what happens is war kind of risk that scab off\nAnd it reveals these things we have a lot of people diagnosed with David ever went to war [noise]\nSo what I'm getting at is this misdiagnosis this let's let me take that banner and put it on them all life is creeping into our civilian lives as well\nSo you know I have people claiming that post amount of stress disorder because they felt this comfort and uncertainty and I tell you something about these people sell me a self imposed stress disorder what is the equivalent so bad hair day\nHe's right this is a bad hair day is one hundred percent right go through words have lost their meaning mhm I've gone over this a hundred times these words used to mean something post traumatic stress syndrome meant something you know it means bad hair day as he just said\nWell I get tired and I have a ... I mean my gosh man I feel\nLike I'm facing a challenge right now and then there's uncertainty that's not the tea as the you know that's the reason to drink it's keeping things in perspective then there's a follow up here but I I think is interesting\n... what is your message to the stats are claiming ... I think that a war and that has friends in body bags yeah\nAbsolutely listen you can take your study or degrees are entitled opinion and claimed whatever he was like\nWell this country needs are men and women are strong line is strong faith that to serve this country and fortunately those are the people who are truly have suffered from the uh but thankfully there are strong enough and we believe in them enough that will get them through it\nUh men and women recover daily from disorders of post traumatic stress a and simply being upset over an election in my opinion doesn't raise something like that\n[noise] well said perfect thank you where do you add onto that about the uh\nReal quick I Know somebody guys or bummed about not winning the lottery um I Wish I had more time to share it or you can check it out the Washington Post it's like an eleven page piece on how this dude jak Whittaker won three hundred and fourteen million in Powerball and it ruined his life\nOh poor baby what's good Joey Jones who take on that one of your life's already ... might as well have the money to\nOkay so I'm just saying his granddaughter ended up dead oh well see that's the problem is the ... like a jerk now David how did that happen now because of the money they didn't know how to handle it okay or drugs it's not the money it's their fault character got revealed okay\nYes and it's not the money's fault though I'm saying it just he says it ruined his life so I mean I'm not putting the Google poor baby and the grand daughter's death and yes it's a sad freaking story I still like take a crack at it\nFor all the billion dollars yes do you think this person's going to end up remaining anonymous I Will and that they don't have an right they don't have to be honest I absolutely would I yeah I Would absolutely when you read all these other stories ... yes yeah but it's going to get out you know that's a matter of\nTime and again man one point six billion or whatever it is after taxes that's fake your own death money that's all I'm saying wow and thought about that you're right that's on my bucket was number one you'd have to be pretty good at that do you man All right thank you Scott\nMan are you OK outrage I Know I'm All right there's things that are ... today no doubt about it um we also get Anthony Scaramucci said ... what do they mean by that\nComing up [noise]\nRelief in mainland are stepping up their patrols as members of the Jewish community gather to mourn the victims of the Pittsburgh shooting\nOne thousand miles away from the U.S border thousands of Central American migrants continue their Journey Through southern Mexico\nWe're going to get these need your help identifying a man wanted for attempted robbery you can see what he might look like and the reward offered in the news Ninety six point five WTO at ...
