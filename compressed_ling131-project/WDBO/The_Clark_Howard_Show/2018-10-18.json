{"month": "10", "state": "FL", "station": "WDBO", "content": "[noise] so she got me to one little first I was wondering why is that why is that um but then also mechanical he actually offers a stock purchase planned for employees that use a ... percent discount when you are just stuck\nYeah I Love those plans to hold it or at least one year before you can show it and I was wondering what would you\nIt goes out and see it I'm\nI'm fairly new to investing overall as long as you're doing it for a couple of years I'm I'm thirty eight years old and he's just back into the game kind of leave 'em and so my ideal is is the kind of keep it there um and just let it grow\nA long wish my four oh one K. um however when I heard the other day I thought maybe that might not be the best idea so I was just wondering what your suggestion would be\nSo I Love these plans where the company offers you a discount and I guess they take a little bit out of each paycheck and find the purchase of the stocks that they give you a Fifteen Percent off\n[noise] is that right [noise] yes that's right\nYeah so I I Love that because they're giving you a direct incentive and you've got a guaranteed Fifteen Percent\nSeal on the stock I mean that's pretty great and then the iffy part is you have to own it for a year\nAnd then add a year you can sell so it's possible the stock would go down over that next here and even though you got to discount you might lose money beyond the likely\nThat he would lose money consistently and it's really a a great gift they're giving you\nGiving you an opportunity to be an owner of the company and part and on the stock so I don't have a problem with that\nUm and you could at the years mark ... salad and take your profits paid the tax on it\nOkay the four oh one K. thing\nThere's when you load up a four O. one K. with company stock that's the money you're depending on for your retirement money that you're doing and the stock purchase plan where you get the discount you can use it for any purpose you want after that twelve month holding period\nOkay and you know it was good at all out at that twelve month so are there different issues and different concerns\nOkay actually but I guess I was wondering if I should be taking that money and you know selling it taking the property and then you know moving that just something else like an IRA\nWhy we're live at a you took the words right out of my mouth would I Would love him smiling as you asked that because you made it sound like you don't get the investing thing at all and you ask the perfect question so if you ... for a year you sold it then I'd love it if you put it in a Roth IRA\nAnd because you're allowed to put up to fifty five hundred dollars a year and a raw you put money into Ross and it grows tax free all through the next Thirty years you'll be working and then you spend that money and everything at CERN tax free\nSo and then that automatically diversified you away from the company's stock in a four one K. you have what are you putting your money in and hit\nA with a company matches or six percent shoplifters so six percent match in there\nAnd then what do you ... what do you investing in the end\nOh oh well most of it was in um the vanguard I'm targets on\nThat's perfect and I would put it all and the vanguard target fun for since you're thirty three let's look like um oh what would that be great doing like twenty six the twenty fifty five I Want to say is\nTwenty shave Steve Jobs I Want to say yeah\nThat's fine and there'll be a great decision and then you're completely diversified away from what you're doing in that company stock\nAnd then if you did a Roth IRA with money you'd sell after a year of that company stock plan you could put all that and a Roth IRA with vanguard in the same target retirement fund twenty fifty five\nSo you'd have your a four O. one K. at work it would be a ... times and then you have Iraq there would be after tax money and that would be a beautiful combo so sounds to me Brandon like you're doing a great job and you should know that\nIt's saving money for a time or thirty three puts your head and most people don't really think about it till they have their fortieth birthday so you're not behind you're kind of a head of a lot of people\nMarlins with us on the Clark Howard show hello Marlene\nBut after ... lego and\nI'm having a great day and I hope you are to\nCertainly are um [noise] just a question or one question I have um a state employees retirement fund I've been a good way to with my employer for about twelve years\nAnd I'm a\nI'm needing to it's higher in order to draw the sun's out so I could do that um and take a lump sum would would there be any other\nPlans that you'd recommend take a I think it's maybe for about twelve thousand dollars which is in a great sum but should a correlate that with another plan\nSo you said this is a state retirement plan\n... public employees retirement plan\nAll right so you got this twelve grand and so your option would be to take it where they give you just a monthly check for the rest of your life forget that twelve grams\nSo until I D.C.'s by receive that amount but they allow payable too I'm an air war um you can write\nThis depends on the state plan and uh uh my thing generally is on light for you to get the monthly check\nAnd the reason as you're not as likely to be able to generate as much money from that twelve thousand as the state will pay you every month\nAnd if there's somebody who's really depending on you I'm In the event that they outlive you you you marry that you have a wife who'd be depending on you yes so what you can do\nIf you're if you're say plan just terminate set the time of your death and doesn't offer a survivor payment to your wife at that time you could do something pretty simple you could buy a term life insurance policy\nThat at the time of your death would pay a a benefit to your wife and then ... regardless of where the sources of funds would be she would get a that amount of money in order to have to live on in the event that she outlived sci\nFi say so I couldn't buy a term life I'll say that would be like hey that for some time is that what you're\nYou know the white term life works and you buy it for a period of time Fifteen Years Twenty years song is Thirty years and so it's got to set premium for a set amount of coverage\nAnd in the event you do pass away and the Fifteen twenty Thirty years it just pays a lump sum to your wife as your survivor\nIn that way you don't have to worry what's gonna happen to her if you're not around um you know she'd be grieving over you but she wouldn't have to worry about money\nOkay now I Do have a term life there was a ... year plan which probably will expire in about six years and I'm asked lady I'll probably outlive it so\nSo if you are a good health and you want to make sure she's protected for a many years to come you could buy a twenty thirty year a policy and you could let the one with the six years remaining lapse if you wanted\nAnd place it with a new one oh are you\nWhether overnight through tomorrow morning down to

scroll down a little you'll see the phone number and hours available each weekday for free off the air advice and information from a member of team Clark\nThis is something that\nHas come out of our Web team is something they very much want me to talk about and there are so right that\nA problem that has appeared over and over again that we've noticed and is happening to so many people in the country is you'll resolved you're going to set up a Roth IRA or you're going to set up an IRA even put money into the account after you open it\nBut you forget one more step\nAnd that is\nYou've got to choose the investments that money's going to go in\nSo many people's dollars are sitting in IRAs earning basically nothing and the default equivalent of like a money market account like a savings account inside an IRA or off\nYou're not even going to be able to keep up with inflation it's\nAbsolutely essential but when you open a retirement account that you go to the next step\nThat may or may not be obvious when you open that account that with the money you put in you choose what it will be invested in a lot of times people will be overwhelmed\nBy what psychologists referred to as the paradox of choice there's so many different funds there are so many different options used basically shut down you put the money in the account but you don't ever choose how it will be invested\nSo keep it very simple\nMost places that have you on any of the low cost places I recommend you were going to be able to put money into a target retirement fund\nAnd you put it in the target retirement fund for the year closest to when you're going to retire\nAnd just put all the money on that\nIf you whiter want to do things that are more involved in let's say you decide well I Want to put some money in\nEmerging markets the term for third world countries or I Want to put money in some form of bonds or I Want to put money in a European stocks or whatever it is I mean you want to do things more exotic have\nAt it but for so many people starting out with a Roth IRA or traditional i._r._a.\nJust picking a simple default choice to target retirement fund will get your money heavily diversified mean simply spread out in many different types of investments many types of stocks here and oversees all in One Fund and so\nWhen you do find that IRA or raw\nMake sure you complete the

you you don't want to try to understand something about what gives you your grade on how you are doing with credit is that right\nYeah my my question on you often talk about a ... veil of all credit below thirty but around twenty ... and when you talk about credit cards all the time my question was why\nThey're fair number also include blind flying good credit specifically home equity lines of credit\nWhat a great question and as a general rule if you have a home equity line of credit with the veil will credit let's say a fifty thousand which is a very common number for a home equity line of credit\nThe percent of that you're using would also factor because a home equity line of credit many times is looked at as a personal line of credit like a personal loan or a credit card\n[noise] personal and also get affected into cooler than just credit that's evolving my\nUsually it's mental I'm In a home equity line that's a form of revolving credit so in in ... alone like a car loan a mortgage loan would not be figured into the ratio for available credit there's a clear\nRelation that the credit bureaus can demonstrate and particularly fight go can demonstrate that the percent of available credit someone is using a revolving credit is a direct indicator\nAbout when somebody is going to be a risky person to win too and so it the way they the way the math works you pointed out the thirty percent thing that you know money uses thirty percent\nOf available credit is considered to be a low risk or or somebody who uses ten percent of available credit is considered to be an extremely low risk or somebody who was likely\nNever to be an issue with the default on the other hand somebody who uses fifty percent of available credit is an extremely high risk of getting delinquent or defaulting on debt\nOkay because it used to be in the past if you had a lot of available credit to look bad because they have said that he should get into trouble you lack of a lot to get it right now to like it's gone and the other direction\nActually it hasn't and this is where it gets confusing Dorian is that when you're talking to a mortgage lending underwriter he or she hates\nThe available credit because they're worried just like you said so it's such a mixed message because qualifying for the best raid on a mortgage\nIs partially a factor of you having extremely low utilization of your revolving credit like credit cards and on the other hand that gets you the rate from the mortgage lender and then some underwriters will say yeah yeah yeah but\nI'm nervous you're going to take that visa card that you're using four percent of the available credit and you're going to go crazy going out and buying stuff\n[noise] correct\nThat so that's why it's it is a confusing message so my attitude and my advice is this\nLive your life using his widow of your available creditors you can and if you get to the end of the line and it's time to close on a mortgage and the underwriter throws up a roadblock\nAt that time he may have to close a line of credit or to to get the mortgage through\nBut the principle of having a very low utilization is the right answer and the right thing to do\nWell thank you very much\nThank you and you have a great day Sabrina is with us on the Clark Howard show Hi Sabrina Hi how are you clock great thank you you are trying to help a relative what's going on\nWell architects I got over his head and get\nOh I'm Sorry I think he yeah we knew nothing about it he didn't come to a call at ... feet\n\nHe even had the four oh one K. to help pay off their credit card oh yeah exactly [laughter] so what we did was we were going to come up with a plant that I got taken point\nWhat we would like to do it it's not too much I got to look at papers and see how much that that is what could pay off in the Clinton credit cards are twenty four percent we will obviously they can pay it back but it may be three percent\nOkay and they wait wait wait wait wait wait staff you right there because I hear your heart\nTalking so Sabrina somebody who has run up a lot of debt and as a family member and you\nDo a work out for them that's what I just call you know work out where you pay off the high interest rate that you become the wind or for the lower interest rate\nDebts you said something right there that I got to throw the flag on you said and of course will make them pay a bat\nThe the odds are that he may intend to pay you back but they're not high that it'll actually happened\nSo when you if you were to do something like this you have to think of it in terms of you are you will call it alone to him he'll even have loan terms but psychologically in your own mind you have to be prepared that this may ultimately be a gift not alone\nOf course of course and knowing him the way I Do he well selling to Oregon can pay back in ... show and that's why I came to eat what's written over having run up\nDidn't want to come to us\nAnd what kind it was a lifestyle things or did he have a medical problem or what caused the debt as best you can tell\nIt started with a car that died and he had to go out and buy a car\nAnd then from there we also think that he got himself into a credit card debt Betty started bad maybe buying scratch on our own now that you know the answer is getting a lottery\nAnd then I think it's no I don't know because he hasn't told us the whole story yet but he used to send me pictures of his cell phone telling his credit rating of over a country so he can integrate spender in the past I think he just got in over his head on that\nOkay so let me tell you what I think needs to happen next and it's not you giving him alone\nOkay what he needs to do is if he's got the best of intentions and things got out of control won him\nHe needs to sit down with a budget counselor and there's a group called the national foundation for credit counseling have you ever heard me mentioned them I had a he may have to hear it several\nTimes before he'll be willing to make an appointment and go in but they'll take him to the root cause of because everybody's always got a story about how they ended up where they did with that right but it's a it's a plan\nAnd a map basically the gets you on to a new path\nAnd you just winning and the money I don't think changes whatever it was that got him to where he is\nAnd that's why I think he needs the tough love of a budget counselor to help him see a path to better way of handling his money because even if you wait or choose to win and the money the things that brought him to where he is those have to change first\nCall I completely agree\nSo what I Would say is ... have you broach the subject with him of lending money\nNo we've had we were going to meet with him not either tonight or some kind of sleep\nGreat because I don't want that out there yet as a carrot or possibility\nRight I Would I Would go in with the idea that you want him to go sit down with somebody at the closest and FCC affiliate\nAnd you go in with the information for them if you go to an FCC dot org you'll be able to find the closest affiliate and generally they sit down and do counseling with the ... most affiliates that's free or it's so cheap it's like then significant\nGreat that they can go with the ... step if he's really boxed himself into a corner they can actually negotiate a payment plan with the various companies he owes money to\nAnd they may even be able to get the interest rate marked down to zero should we better their early ... percent sure and then you're not in this thing where you have lent money and then the awkward thing happens well you didn't pay this month\nHe didn't pay next month I mean we got to get to the\nHeart the root of how we got there and how he's going to get out so I said I strongly recommend this is a path instead of you writing a check and maybe at some point writing a check all become part of it but he needs
