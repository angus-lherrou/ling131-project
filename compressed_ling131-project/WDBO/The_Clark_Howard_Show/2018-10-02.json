union and Equifax did this experience staying with the codes for now the unique secret code that each person would have from each bureau but that's the answer to the question that has come in from so many people\nAnd the good news\nAnd it is really good news is that with this procedure now being free there is a much greater chance that someone who didn't do it because there was ten dollars to freeze and ten dollars every time you saw it and most states now that it's free there is a much greater likelihood that people will freeze their credit\nWhich is a good thing for you to do\nBack he's with us on the Clark Howard show hello Becky how you doing\nVery well how are you a cleric great thank you Becky how can I be of service to you [noise]\nWell I Am in the process of purchasing a new home it's a little bit more expensive than the initial on that on end and my family has some concerns as to why on\nIf something should happen to me\nLike death because that would be covered by life insurance but if I become debilitated little counter injury um [noise] ... make my payments what happens to my home and I was told that there is a mortgage protection insurance available but I talked to my insurance company and they said it that's not typically done anymore\nSo I was wondering what your thoughts are and\nIf you look at it that's because I'll keep is clean and I won't use the word they usually use in the industry but it's junk insurance so let me tell you this the background and the industry they refer to this stuff is crow can choke\nSo croaking show ... paying the if you die choke paying your disabled and so they ... talk about it behind our backs because it's an intensely profitable\nInsurance product like the mortgage life there's a there used to be a blended product mortgage life and disability but the thing is is that what's more important and you set it right yourself\nYou said well I don't need mortgage life insurance for cause I have\nWhat'd you say you had\nLife insurance exactly it's your insurance that you name a beneficial before and that better fishery can then use the money as they wish it would be the most appropriate which may not be paying off a mortgage\nBut the big thing is that the mortgage life insurance that's pedaled so heavily costs roughly ten times what a individually purchase life insurance policy would cost\nTo life insurance is only going to crow\nRight to say it would choke so which I Hope you have ... you should have more concerns then if if you became disabled and you were unable to work than just what's gonna happen with your mortgage because there are so many bills of life\nThat continue to go on if you're not able to work and that's why having your own disability insurance policy for disability insurance policy through where you work\nIs fantastic to have and it's something almost nobody buys\nBut is a very valuable piece because during someone's working lifetime there three times more likely to become disabled than to die but people will even though not enough people by life insurance almost nobody by ... by disability so\nI Do have short and long term disability rely work\nThen then you're good okay you're good and uh how how much would you say you're a wife or with where you're working\nUm I think it's for three hundred\nNo no I mean how [laughter] I guess I didn't write raise that and then goes so how likely are you to stay at this place of employment\nFor the rest of your working career\nI say it's highly likely that in the field that I and it's also common that people do Lou from company to company\nSo if your health is really solid\nI think it'd be worth it you getting a quote owning your own disability policy [noise] rather than one through your employer because if you own one through an employer and you switch employers let's say you're not in health at that time to get the disability policy owning your own becomes portable just like having your own life insurance policy\nIs adding a term life insurance beneficial for me as well animals that they so\nYeah so I Love term life insurance\nAnd having that to provide for their remaining cycle of your working lifetime depending on your family circumstances like the minor children no I'm Single okay so the purpose of having that insurance is principal you to provide for survivors that depend on you for income\nIf you don't have anyone that depends on your friend come there's likely not a big reason for you to have\nMore life insurance but the disability that you would own would be very valuable\nOK
