water they want to kill your children and some look alike of your Congress man or woman is going to throw your grandmother over the\nCliff now they've even taking it a step further than that you have the center for American Progress which is John Podesta as oh group ... created this thing and another think tank I've never heard of the third way they're fighting Democrats what they should do and not do and the lead up to the electorate what they should say what they should not say\nSpend as little time as possible talking about immigration don't tell the people the truth about immigration sanctuary attacks a pack a punch it says that a memorandum\nOh okay there are times got a copy of this thing\nDemocrats the strategy is preparing the memo or advising all Democrats that they could neutralize the attacks if they responded but they should spend as little time as possible talking about immigration itself instead pivot to more fruitful issues like by the way health care in taxation\nFor healthcare means he pulled bomb a care I don't know how that's fruitful for them look you know keep your doctor keep your plan and pay less that hasn't worked out very well people millions lost their doctors their plans and they're paying two three four times what they were ones paying and the only thing they want on taxation is oh they they they want you know they use the rhetoric\nYou know redistribution tax cuts for the rich the reality is\nAh that's never been true in half the country only pay three percent of the tax bill the latest numbers came I was in Bloomberg\nYesterday top three percent of Americans pay the majority of taxes in this country the top three percent\nTop one percent pay forty percent the top fifty percent of all taxpayers paid Ninety seven percent of the total individual income taxes let me say it another way the bottom fifty percent of taxpayers only pay three percent of the tax bill that's it\nYou know which small percentile of taxpayers you know also paid three percent or more well you know if you look at the top fourteen hundred taxpayers one thousand four hundred people in a country of three hundred plus million people\nThat group alone pays a massive share of fourteen hundred people pay nearly ... percent of the taxes just just fourteen hundred people\nTwo thousand one bottom fifty percent paid nearly five percent now it's down to three percent that's it you have this progressive tax system that they want but it's still not enough they want their crumbs back they're not going to tell you

we just want to keep it quiet well\nWe're going to do well that's what the center for American Progress is recommending they doing immigration it's very difficult to it on immigration with vulnerable vulnerable votes in states that Trump carried in twenty sixteen the strategy memo goes on arguing\nEven the most strict Kony in a Republican policies like family separation threats to deport dreamers undocumented immigrants cetera et cetera\nFailed to sway most voters emphasis added let me interpret this for you Maxine being quiet don't tell the people the truth of what we're really going to do

three downtown or land or Ninety five in winter garden and at the Walt Disney world resort make sure you have plenty of water\n[noise] [noise]\n\n[noise] [noise] and all of you know\nWe discovered that McCaskill is receiving money from democratic US Senate minority leader Chuck Schumer\nThey get money from ... onto our link I pack oh okay yeah I don't know how things are right you get the money\nYou know given on the deal yeah I was not fly fundraising or\nI think [laughter]\nWhat I'm saying is they ask in let's say specifically asking voting for the wall we should let them down going to need to think that [noise] so like I said when she thinks she's on the wall and they don't ask me then let them think that\nAnd if they don't ask let them think that that's what the rule is now for the Democratic party even the center for American Progress sending out don't talk about immigration Maxine Waters admitting that she's being told don't talk about impeachment gesture shop about it we we know we know we're going to do but we're not going to\nWe're not going to help people the truth ... an election that's Claire McCaskill and and people on her staff people just can't know that she wants a semi automatic rifle ban and that\nThat of course you would vote yes on gun bans of course she supports the semi automatic rifle ban\nYou know she's quiet on guns because she has a bunch of Republican voters but secretly she says she supports say hey gun control group you know in our staff is saying well we'll wait until after the election to bring up Trump impeachment to voters get over it we can't do it now we got a line now\nWith you know three weeks Twenty one days collection they why would we ever tell people the truth people just can't know McCaskill\nAnd Obama essentially the same views on everything wow now the people in Missouri I Hope you're paying close attention but it's bigger than that a project Vera tosses got this undercover video they got the undercover video the week before about former governor of Tennessee Bredesen Marsha Blackburn is now up by fourteen points\nBecause on that tape it's the same line he'll he'll do the right thing when he gets the of course we don't agree with everything Trump says no not at all do what ... what we're saying we vote for cabinet of course he wouldn't vote for Kavanaugh\nI mean this is all part of a light campaign propaganda campaign and it's all about power and it's being exposed to very high level I mean this is really you know seeing people how they really are is should be so enlightening to the people in Tennessee in Missouri\nA James O'Keefe is with us he's the founder of project Vera toss\nExposing these senators I you know I watch this and I'm just like what a bunch of liars\nThat's all I think when I see those great job\nYeah Sean this is a pattern you know we really the Tennessee won the Tennessee Senate candidate bread is and you know respond to\nFrom the security graphics that are\nBreaking up with this red alert to tell you about a major problem on the roadway and she's got a disabled vehicle on ice four he's found it's right around Princeton\nNo one on scene yeah to help him out so he's in the right lane you've got a backup solved from the tea good half hour or you might want to take a leaking into downtown if you're going to stick with it stay to the left for red alert tend to your phone text traffic did two one two three two I'm Jackie O'Brien's new Ninety six point five red alert traffic advisory\nAnd the guy goes will tell them get over it\nAnd that's the that's the ... it's that this is that the guy next arose field organizer tells us he says a quote people just can't know unquote than the cast on Obama had the same views I confronted Nick on the street yesterday with the micro five Nick why don't you why don't you tell the truth\nAnd of course the reason is and this is true in Missouri it's true in Tennessee it's true in North Dakota\n... some of these red state Democrats they have to lie to the voters to get elected it it's a necessary condition so we're doing is exposed\nAnd you don't want you know I don't say agree with that point they don't have the lie they have to lie if they want to win and it's a question of whether or not they will put aside any any sense of decency honor honesty\nAnd embrace any level of truth and they won't and that's the point and you know I think everybody on this showing on TV\nIf you look the houses and play the senators and play if you vote for any Democrat in the house you're voting for polo see\nIt'd be a boat for Claire McCaskill or Bredesen or a high camp or cinema or Donnelly or Bill Nelson you're voting for Schumer because that's who's going to own them in control them that's what they're going to vote to be their leader\nWell you know and and Sean and some of these states like Missouri in particular the pro life Democrats and pro gun Democrats used to be a thing decades ago misery was the stalwart when I came to those things but that's a shrinking\nGroup of people and and people like Claire McCaskill half state in order to when they have to or they think they have to mislead\nAnd again this is a Greek chorus of staffers these staffers are not necessarily villainous I suppose there's honest because they're going along with it but they're just telling the truth so tiny very interesting to see British and after we played those tapes on your radio last week British and\nTalk to local media this kind of the Senate candidate he told all the local media stations well into these ... these young guys were caught and kind of misled staffer said well they don't work for me when in fact they did he apologized so it's going to be\nVery uh by the way that was a lie to the first thing is that well they're they're just college kids no they weren't they actually work for him\nAnd the guy apologized this guy brown who is that the Democratic spokesperson for the British and campaign he actually apologized to the media can you believe that Sean apologized\nFor misleading people without our videos so it's very interesting to see how McCaskill's in response now this guy Josh Hawley the Senate candidate the turning against a McCaskill has responded he's tweeted out this video um he's jumping all over it so the question is the really interesting thing is because\nWe're going to get him on the program later this week I mean we're basically following the work you're doing um you know one of the question is going to ask but go ahead finish your thought\nWell I was going to say that McCaskill has in this video it's she says of course I'd vote on a ban some type of gun ban we asked her staff or what type of ban is that he said semi automatic rifles now this is an issue that nobody wants to talk about Missouri particularly Claire McCaskill so\nWe're hoping that she gives a clear unequivocal answer about what her positions are on the gun issue and that's going to be very interesting if we can somehow get her to speak on the record publicly about this now that we've caught her red handed\nWell I again I think that you're rocking the world of big state Senate candidates and exposing them who they really are look I've been saying and explaining for a long time now what the agenda is what they want endless investigations\nAlthough they'll stop the investigations that help them the ... they'll they'll protect their deep state buddies\nThat conspired to to first stop Donald Trump remember winning and then later to destroy him um and then they will have endless investigations impeachment if they can do it\nThey want their crumbs back they're even saying that openly they're hiding their positions on open borders and eliminating ice\nThey're not talking about really wanting to keep Obamacare under any circumstances and that's what they want to do and stop the president's agenda that's been working so these tapes I think expose what's going on in every congressional and Senate district except you don't have the manpower to get every single one but you've gotten a couple of big people already\nWe've got we've gotten request to do it in every everywhere and we have to be a judicious about where we do it and when we pull people out because I could have got more nations if ice but they're you know it's people are already early voting and some of these states and they get the bigger issue is like I said he last week or the few days ago\nAbout don't lie to the people I ask this guy next roast when I saw him on the street yesterday said why do you have to why do you feel the need to why why why is our politics so broken that that becomes a condition to having to win the honest because voters aren't going to end in Tennessee this guy just lost\nThere's a new poll out New York times poll and he's down fourteen points after video it doesn't help you when people find that stuff out but some of these senators Sean only going to run for one term so they say like Heidi Heitkamp\nCredits filming but yeah they say on trial I mean that's the point the lie to get the one term and stay right there James O'Keefe ah project Vera ... dot com you can see the videos we've linked it on Hannity dot com um and the big question I'm going to ask him when we get back is is\nTurkish official says police found quote

California I don't want ... and that's our governor I was living in San Francisco when he became a San Francisco and he could ruin that city\nListen I you have a great Republican candidates out there John Cox he's a great businessman his his problem is simple math it's sort of like New York city although it's happened in New York City is even happen in New Jersey Chris Christie Christie Todd Whitman um and and then all the other occasions Tom Kaine is another example where Republicans were elected after Democrats make a mess\nI guarantee you that Cox could wind up now that the sanctuary state of California\nWants to put up a sign and say free health care for everybody in the world it's a sign you're basically our governor saying illegal or legal doesn't matter resident non resident doesn't matter we're going to give you free health care\nNow if the average California is that is tax that Thirteen and a half percent statewide on income if you're OK with that good luck to you because it is unsustainable it will bankrupt your state there's my prediction\nIf people want to experiment with is that you know what am I I'm not there to tell people\nCan't really can and can't get on it and I think it got to get out of California can't afford to take care of that yeah\nI mean it's unbelievable look why do you think there's a mass migration out of New York and New Jersey and Illinois to states like Florida Texas in the Carolinas why California is all going to Texas you know what what uh Democrats on what they're hoping for that California demographic shift so that the people that ruin California and left might do the same thing a Texas\nSo unbelievable which is what the beta O'Rourke has been all about from the beginning\nAnyway you know good luck um I Would say John Cox will be a great start and that would start in the world will tell you that on election night three ... three weeks from tonight it will take a break we'll come back eight hundred nine foot

outcome that people can use and you also see it Christian cinema is imploding out in Arizona\nProject Vera toss what the tape that they release the Claire McCaskill is devastating that she's hiding what she's running on to that same happened a governor governor Bredesen and Tennessee\nHave Heidi Heitkamp was already down by double digits Joe Donnelly is in big trouble are we now see Heller was very important state of Nevada he's now a by seven in the latest poll at least eight I'm really worried about right now is Florida and Rick Scott just has done an amazing job for the people of Florida\nWell yeah and then the hurricane obviously that that was devastating but but the response to hurricane I remember that benefit there in the last year where we're Scott has really shown if you're a member of showing the two thousand twelve election\nRight here in Jersey uh that's where Hurricane Sandy hit and then President Obama had the advantage of\nActing like a commander in chief and going to the devastation what Mitt Romney's basically left helpless they say that that hurricane may have tipped the scales back to a ... member on me at all the\nMomentum in the world are going into that storm so yeah look a Jim Messina who was speaking of President Obama two thousand Trump he was the campaign manager for a strobe I'm at that time\nHe said yesterday I said why did Senator Warren have to do her announcement with our DNA now he goes why can't Democrats ever stay focused and I think there's a list but Warren\nRevelation or lack there of will only hurt the party further because I don't see how you could ever say many media outlets by the way Shawn said that this was definitive proof right I'll give you literally the headlines\nAround she's Ninety six percent European I mean at at that one one thousand done twenty four she has perhaps maybe Native American ancestry of some type\nI mean but it is it but her she literally personally change herself to minority status when you ban and then at Harvard that she was billed as the first minority\nFemale professor there of Native American heritage that the Cherokee Nation has spoken out and said this is just outrageous there are there are outraged by it\nRight and that was a turning point right when they when they came out and said this is wrong this is inappropriate mockery then we're going to say is attacking was with Warren is it still conservatives or does it actually Cherokee Nation but I mean that that the headlines yesterday Associated Press Warren DNA shows I have Native American heritage\nA CNN Elizabeth Warren releases DNA tests with strong evidence of Native American ancestry ABC News Elizabeth Warren really reveals proof of Native American ancestry again what\nProof this so backfired on her ... nation got involved and and all the mockery that that ensued from there this is going to follow her I Know people think that she is a front runner\nBut the fact that she lied about our heritage to advance her career I could see the signs are already at Trump rallies and twenty Twenty one one thousand twenty fourth just written and that's it\nBecause now this defines her and this is not something you shake very easily and suddenly she's kind of morphed into Hillary Clinton where you can't really trust what she says and then on top of that she has no real economic message ... outside of you didn't do that\nSo yeah I Know they're going to see who the Democrats settle on right away and and twenty twenty because I think the left wing of the party is taking over and that's not the way you'd be President Trump\nOne of the things that I'd been pointing out I don't know if you had a chance to look at the center for American Progress and it was a group born by none other than John Podesta but they're\nRunning their reelection ... very revealing the Maxine Waters says they keep telling me not to say it I keep saying I'm not a lot but I'm going to keep saying it anyway meaning impeach forty five\nSo they're hiding their agenda we learned that in this project ... with Claire McCaskill in her own words also\nBut now we know that they're being told directly not to talk about their immigration and all you know a sanctuary attacks packs a punch says the four page memorandum I'm like yeah OK and anyway the New York times or obtained a copy of it\nAnd Democrats and

Michigan Pennsylvania Wisconsin to win over those voters that see jobs coming back and companies coming back unless they put up a centrist fiery centrist candidate can have a lot of problems on\nThe one poll that shocks me the most the latest one out of Wisconsin had Scott Walker who I think that a phenomenal job in the state of Wisconsin and now he's always had notoriously close elections he's always had all of these groups and millions and millions of dollars pouring in from outside of Wisconsin that he's had to deal with\nI'm not sure if the poll is accurate but it has him down and that surprises me but I think especially when you look at the Senate I I could see the Republicans again with three weeks away I don't have a crystal ball\nAlways tell everybody play like you're behind and you're losing and you've got you got to make up ground and anything can happen between now and election day in Twenty one days but\nYou know I don't see Heidi Heitkamp making a recovery I think a Christian seminar is falling apart in Arizona I see a surge of just the right time for Dean Heller in Nevada which will help him\nUm I I look at other races Donnelly now is beginning to fall back in

going to be down during a town hall with him this weekend around the Houston area I'll I'll give up that announcement later in the week\nWell there you go yeah and and remember ... federal roar got more money than any count my guys are eight million dollars and he's tattered already has a twenty twenty presidential candidate you know\nI I think they'll probably be twenty to twenty five candidates and that's not an exaggeration because Republicans in Eighteen but yeah that would have been a very big symbolic victory of ... somehow could've unseated cruise but that's going in the right direction for Cruz as well so the Senate you gotta think they're probably gonna pick up three or four seats and now I Would have told you two months ago and like I don't see how\nDemocrats don't win twenty three seats to win back the house and given the history Eighteen or the last twenty mid terms I have gone against the party in power by an average that something like thirty three seats a bottle of sixty three seats in two thousand ten\nSo I was thinking you know I I Can't see that not happening now I I think it's a toss up it's fifty fifty that Republicans keep the house and if that happens after all this negative press that President Trump has received the Republicans have received to overcome that and keep all three branches oh my goodness\nBut I Will tell you I think the fact
