Chuck Schumer is a really smart strategic senator and he's the leader and he looked at that map and he said this thirty five seats up twenty six or eight hours\nEntering states that that Donald Trump won what can I Do to try to take back the majority\nAnd he probably made a calculation if we can embarrass cabin or that the Republicans poll him it was suppressed the Trump voters so that a good number of those sixty three million would stay home because you only get Ninety million come out in the mid term elections so they they made they hit the Republicans stuck from the president stuck with him\nAnd the Democrats were exposed these voters are now outrage that the Democrats would put such a late hit on\nAnd try to mirror good person who would remind them of their father their their their son their their their brother\nAnd said this was totally unfounded uncorroborated there's no evidence to it\nAnd they're trying to destroy this man in this family and the Republicans are ... the Republicans and independents who supported Trump or coming back out and you're seeing them in these polls that Missouri poet McCaskill behind was appalled that we did for a super back she's down ... points now you're seeing this I'm seeing this impulse every day\nIt's it's not a big explosion but what it is is\n... ... soldiers coming back in and\nGalileo while Trump voters worked on what what\nWas a huge enthusiasm gap just a month ago a lot less than a month ago two weeks ago two and a half weeks ago um has now totally and completely evaporated\nAnd conservatives have been awakened and and by the way Doug shown the party that we saw protesting and the party that Russia's to judgment\nThe party that doesn't believe in due process a party that doesn't believe in the presumption of innocence for the need for some corroboration and the party that defended Clinton and the fans Keith Ellison\nA I don't think they're looking too good here to the American people right now and they they're being shown to be the radical party I've been describing for some time\nAll shot I mean I don't quite know how to reply about our ...\nAnd you can say I actually agree with your characterization in their handling of all of this has been pretty stupid and detrimental um to you know any sense that they have have any sense of moderation in this day and age\nWell I don't think they have any sense of moderation but what they do have\nIs an ongoing leaving the house which right there you\nLead to pick up the house and I think from what I see looking at the Senate races there are all very very close within the margin of her and I really think to get a definitive answer will have to come back and in a week or ten days after Kavanaugh is as I think we all expect\nNarrowly confirmed to see whether the effect job than you\nAre talking about Sean is actually going to hold over time I think it really has to play out and I think there's a good chance that the protests you've seen from the Democrats from women\nLike him or not we'll continue and will ultimately a benefit particularly in suburban congressional districts less so Senate races the Democrats\nHow's it going to play with the voter in the rest of the country not in New York D.C San Francisco and Los Angeles\nOr or Illinois or Chicago how's it going to play all of America I think it's going to play very differently\nI think the the real challenge is the one John raises I think it's that's right will this re engaged the Trump voter I think as of today probably some evidence that that\nIs gonna it inside twenty point enthusiasm gap just a ... and sixteen days\n[noise] let let's let's wait a week Sean and we'll see where\nThey don't think this leaves a bad taste in people's mouths what they did it to the man\nWho support the war didn't disgusting and somebody who lives in ...
