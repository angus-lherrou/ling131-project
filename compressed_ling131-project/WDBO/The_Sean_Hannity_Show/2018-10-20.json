{"month": "10", "state": "FL", "station": "WDBO", "content": "Why first of all I mean I I don't know where those numbers came from Christian but I'm guessing somebody took a look at markets or that period of time and said hey if you had put twenty five million in here um it'd be what four hundred percent more hundred million that's huge okay yeah I mean markets can do obviously they can do very well\nAnd we hear this all the time but if we had a crystal ball we would know exactly how to position at chances of them doing that right and ... million at risk\nThan really really aggressive portfolio is to get to a hundred million is really really unrealistic right we don't we don't know exactly what's going to happen moving forward\nAll of the Clinton is definitely a wealthy family because they struggle al but that's not real life but realizing that you work with all types of people over the age of fifty here in Florida with their investments and you have some pretty wealthy clients so some types of planning strategies the ways of going about this that you use with clients who has\nA rather larger nest egg\nSure what we're working on and and what we've been doing for years is active management of portfolios and people hear me talk about that but but and unless you actually see it as hard to understand exactly what that involves a most investors are dealing with portfolios that are very static and what that means is\nThey aren't actively manage somebody has sat down and and hopefully done a good job of putting together a diversified portfolio but there's no real tactical strategy for moving in and out of stocks are moving in and out of bonds from moving in another real estate based on certain indicators that are going on\nAnd we want to fall that because it helps us be smarter investors it's easy to easiest example I can give is if markets are doing horribly in the stock market is crashing in and we could use two thousand eight as an example\nHow many of our listeners we're\nIn a situation where nobody gave them any advice on what to do about that and they had to decide for themselves whether to hang in there and just write it down and then ride it back up or did they feel kind of alone and having to go in and liquidate portfolios and maybe doing it the wrong time\nAnd then maybe potentially never even getting back in I mean we do meet people who had that situation it's hard to do and you have to be careful and that sort of guidance is really where we come in and not because you know we're a bunch of rocket scientist over here or anything but because we literally work with this every single day\nAnd it's our job to not only protect or ... portfolios\nAnd then help our clients be successful in retirement\nSo you know strategies to helping clients with larger portfolios for smaller portfolios are the same right\nTraditionally individuals who had more money\nTens of millions of dollars would have access to actively managed portfolios and very very strategic per fully utilizing algorithms and that sort of a thing\nWhat we've done is we want to bring that to everyone and we want to make sure that individuals who maybe not knee and maybe they don't have tens of millions of dollars can still benefit from\nActively managed portfolios and if we're able to do that and just how people not only be more comfortable in retirement help them participate in market gains help them not have to worry as much about market losses help them no you know they have an advisor that has a vested interest them doing well and putting all that together is really where we're at\nAnd that's what we're showing individual is when they come sit down and if you feel like we're providing value what happens risen as individuals decide to work with them if they don't feel like we're providing enough value then I don't get to work with us right and we don't have an expectation that everybody out there should should work with is right I mean everybody's got their own thing but\nYou know coming in and sitting down and letting us I'll be what the analysis showing how to make your ... more efficient at least you're going to walk out of our office with uh\nSome ideas on how to make that portfolio more efficient um letting us put together that financial plan for you will show you how to implement that on your own if you honestly want to do that I don't have any problem with that but of course a lot of people don't want to so will implement it for him at any rate if you give us a call the next ten minutes we can do that for your complimentary\nFor zero seven to seven zero one thousand that's four zero seven to seven zero one thousand it's all about active wealth management and you can find out more by having Mike and the team put together that comprehensive financial plan that the Fifteen hundred dollar value\nComplimentary if you call within the next ten minutes is it has to be guarding your nest egg dot com and\nIt is officially fall one of my favorite times they've probably absolutely my favorite time of year now that I sang it out loud\nAnd it's all the time of year that most of us are making enrollment decisions about health care including Medicare might get advice for people listening here in Florida who may be going through this right now because talking to some friends of mine that their phone is ringing off the hook if they are in this demographic of age\n... bringing us up because yes fall is a time when you are going to get bombarded because as what's referred to as open enrollment when it comes to these plans that cover expenses Medicare doesn't cover All right\nAnd so for a lot of people that's going to be a Medicare supplement a there are also Medicare Advantage plans I don't want to get too far into the\nWeeds on exactly the differences because there are a lot of differences between them and the different plans that they offer\nBut if you were age sixty five are older and you're eligible for Medicare you were in the crosshairs you know for this marketing\nAnd I think what is going to boil down to for individuals is making sure that they have the best plan that they can get right for the amount of money that they're spending\nChristian at you gotta be careful of the few things here or there are representatives who\nWill come to you every single year and try to switch from one plant to another that's not a good thing is not even technically legal if it's not in your best interest but the reason they do that is the commissions that they get first year out are more than the commission as they get if you just stay a client sort of feel like you're in that position\nTo be careful and then also the marketing in general there are a lot of regulations around it but I hate that individuals have to talk to maybe you know three or four or five different sales people just to get the information that they need to try to make a good decision which is why\nYou know I tell them well management and through a radio program we have individuals that work with all of the different Medicare Advantage and Medicare supplement plans out there\nIn that way so for our clients when the when they sit down and they have questions you know they don't have to go see five or ten people they can add on with us we can look at all the plans that are available and whether they've had a change in their life or whether they just want to\nYou know maintain what they currently have\nWe can do that for them of course and we can also do that for our listeners if you don't want to sit down and talk to again three or four or five different individuals or have to go to a whole bunch of different meanings to find out what health care plan is right for you you can sit down with our Medicare specialist\nAnd they can walk you through all the options help you make an informed decision Christmas part of the overall financial planning process I mean yes we help people invest money and yes we want to help you get the highest rate of return you can get ... feet\nBut at the same time if we're saving money on things like health care or we're getting you better coverage for the same price that's a big benefit we have CPAs that we work with Christian and that are employed by us\nAnd the point there is we don't want our clients to pay more taxes and they have to pay\n'em and that's part of the financial planning process right it's not just about the investments we want to help you save money in taxes we also have attorneys that we work with\nBecause the state plans are really really big part of any financial plan\nAnd we have to understand how our money works for us now but also eventually Christian as they say what's guaranteed death and taxes right you know eventually we're going to pass away so how do we make sure that our assets transition as as efficiently as possible to our beneficiaries we want to keep on call Sam\nRight out of our state we don't try to keep the our state\nOut of our state and uh so stay planes are really really big deal so as we wrap up today's program we want to make sure we're providing our listeners with good information on how to be efficient when it comes to investing\nParade financial plan a successful retirement so give us a call the next ten minutes if you'd like to come sit down for that

today\nEight for for two two zero zero nine six five only to open line now to get those calls lined up and we're going to start how we in the hill Billy calling and Billy welcome into the magic mechanic\nHello how are you taking my call thanks oh I have a\nTwo thousand Fifteen Toyota Camry that only has about twenty thousand miles on it but when I was walking through the ... last night I heard a noise sound like a fuel pump running underneath the driver's side back tire ...\nHank well you're in fuel pump territory\nHave you had a situation to where um [noise]\nIf you had a bad a dead battery in the morning you\nKnow the cars right great and that and it was actually running the noise was for ten minutes long and then it shut off\n... um let's do this that next time you hear that Billy there could have been an effort of um\nA fuel control motor that's back there uh that could have been running you know I don't know whether this vehicle is equipped with one or not but if there was excessive pressure and the fuel tank\nAfter you shut the vehicle off sometimes these things will have a little electric pump that actually pumps the vapor pressure into the charcoal canister in order to remove any vapor and smells that would be vented from your fuel tank\nNow I Can't tell you a hundred percent for sure if that particular car has it or not I don't really have the time to research it but what I'd like for you to do is the next time you hear this ... you don't really have a gas cap correct\nOh it's actually my wife's car I imagined it has a gas cap\nWell some of them have it on what's called an auto fill that where you don't really have to remove the gas cap if you do have a gas capitalists do this when you hear that when you hear it and making that noise\nTake the gas cap off off ... and ... and see if there's any pressure or anything vents out of the tank if not\nThen you know there could be something electrically and and to be honest with you\nIt may be something that is normal I doubt it because nobody would want an electric fuel pump to continue running for ten minutes you shut the vehicle off if that is the case\nYou could have something with a computer issue that is a you know and when you hear of something like that um if it is a computer that's keeping a really energized and make the fuel pumps continue to run\nMost likely it's probably not a bad computer but it's probably something that needs to be re flashed it actually needs new software actually put into the computer itself if if it was it was doing what it's doing right now\nThere is a real good chance that it may not shut the fuel pop off and allow it to continue to run into it runs your battery dead\nBut let's try that if you hear it running again loose loosened the gas cap see if there's any pressure comes out\nIf it is it may be the evaporative fuel system just venting the tank if not then most likely you probably right it may be the electric fuel pumps continuing to run and if that's the case it's probably a computer program is out of calibration and needs some new software downloaded into it\nAll right good call their Billy wake us off good we're going to head to talk with Bill now in central Florida here he's got an overweight Sebring different build different question what do you want what do you have ... mechanic today bill\nHey how are you taking my call them my question is are my two points I got ... which they easy are vowing to go back to the games are there any easy way to get in that order at the data all up and\nI'm In\nA sea ... you're probably going to have to pull the plant um\nYeah I'd love to shock to it they're very tiger to do it all over your mind all the way to hit\nYou say it's got the you've got the two seven and this one yeah if you're traveling have you ever done any research on that motor\nFive do little research on it I bought a thousand miles last February not letting a hundred and twelve now I came here to do about a thousand miles a week\nOkay there's there's a lot of information at a to point seven leader ah the those are good motors one one of the actually\nThe first one hundred percent computer design and and seeing seed motor which is pretty impressive computer did all that mess underneath your hood can't blame it on anybody [laughter] but [laughter] and and and my opinion is that a great job there was one thing that it didn't take into account\nAnd that was the ... between the oil south and the oil pan\nUsually on those engines the south is literally Preston sandwich dried into the bottom of that aluminum all pan\nAnd those motors run starving for oil their whole entire life it's like somebody putting your hand over the end of a vacuum cleaner but in what we've done with them was we pull the wool pans off of them and actually banned the oil sop up a quarter of an edge and put the pans back on\nGot some of those motors out there with a half million mile on now but the other ones that never had the modification they usually last around a hundred dollars a mile and then the lower ends go south and um [noise] it's just because they're not getting enough oil flow to the pump you know so you can only get out of an all pop what you put into it\nAnd if you got your hand over the end of the vacuum cleaner they usually have a pretty rough way to go just food for thought do your own research\nAppreciate the call bill will head back to the calls after this but we got to hit the three big things you need to know one open phone line now wait for for two two zero\nZero nine

affects for the sticker says it's fifteenth city Twenty one highway mileage is getting about Thirteen point six average than cat really ever get above that and just curious what we should look for\nWhat engine does he have an it soaks record five echo boost\nUm is it a tour for water of short we'll four wheel of time [noise]\nYou know Craig I've I've got pretty much the minds a little bit newer but I got pretty much the same truck and uh\nYou know and I can't say this ah for for him but you know every time a fuel economy starts\nDropping from about a all I guess what you'd want to say around the average about Seventeen miles a gallon on line you know uh that's in town and highway and everything I get around Seventeen um\nBut when I notice my fuel economy starting to drop down if I start getting around uh in the fourteen or Fifteen air filter [laughter] probably can of beans number one [noise] um\nYou know I replaced year folder every time we do the loop service on the truck and if you don't have a a a good clean air filter in it um you know it's it's it's one of them situations to where you're just fighting a losing battle\nIf he has no check engine lights on 'em and he's not getting codes and the computer and the truck seems to run and performs properly or whether the air filter looks dirty or not\nI put one in ... and the reason being is\nThe air filter will suck in so much pollen and micro dirt that it's not just old black nasty looking air filter\nThat filled or can be plugs solid with pollen and really restrict the Airflow and you know as much a air is them echo boost or motors need a you know any kind of restriction any air filter itself is detrimental to your fuel economy\nYou know and it like I said if you if you don't have a a coach said or check engine light\nWhy you could throw spark plugs coils and you do all this tune up where he won't make any difference air flow that is the most important thing\nYou know by by an inexpensive airfield or throw it in their reset is mileage and and let him take it and drive it and see if that makes any difference or at least I'm gonna tell you like this that's the place to start\nThere you go ... for

real quick um want to do a transmission fluid change and I'm ordering the filter cat and they're asking shallower deep Hadiya tell on the transmission in which when you got\nA ... you're you're shallow is going to probably from the edge of the transmission down it's going to be about three three and a half inches\nIf you've got a deep pan is they're referring to it's going to be about four and a half inches in debt so\nUm I I Would say go by three three and a half four four and a half you know so that kind of gave me the idea of which one you're going to be dealing with the other scenario is to uh if you're doing the transmission service yourself and you drop in the pan\nUh as long as you got another vehicle you know you can take your old filter and with you to you know to Bennett auto supply of course [laughter]\nAnd a match it up and make sure that you are getting the correct filter so you know if you've got to run to a parts store during a while you got the pan off it's not going to be no big deal and less you've gotta walk or [laughter]\nYou know maybe it take you but best best just take the filter with you and match it up that way you make sure you got the right one in it\nYou don't want to put a short when uh you know a a shallow filter and a deep pan and of course vice versa you wouldn't be able to get a short pants on to a a deep filter so\nIt would keep you from doing it if you got a a a shallow filter in a deep pan you wind up sucking air so you you don't want to you don't want to have that happen but\nI just take the filter with either Bennett auto parts let them match it up for you when you got to paying off of it\nThat'll be the simplest way and probably the safest thing to do they're just so you said earlier it gets the exact right one and isn't playing a guessing game their aid for for two two zero zero nine six pilots go ahead and talk with Jeanne in Kokomo gene you've got about a minute here we might end up having to hold you

zero nine six five dealing in Florida welcome on into the magic mechanic show what's your question for Larry Perry\nThing to ... um no we went on a road trip ... gym sins here and we went on a road trip and\nThe cold air blew perfectly fine and then one day the uh the drier froze over and equip one cold air okay now when I got back home I put in a new drier um or if it's to cut off every that blend or actually there all day\nAnd even that kept blowing audit\nOr not higher but I mean regular attempt\nWas made by why did you put all this stuff on there over the\nThe drier freezing uh\nUh well I thought when I looked up on line that kind of looked into it a little bit on everybody even on the you know try that began their\nWhole bunch of money on nothing and I'm like I don't even make sense something's got to ... an image freezing up that means is working to good Dylan\nYeah well but they didn't want to blow in equal there I'm when I'm when I\nDid the evaporate or freezes over into a block of ice nowhere can blow through it\nBut my ... but I honestly don't if you gotta excuse me and my youngest son's name bill and so I feel like I'm reprimand\n[laughter] you can hear it all over there you know one\nAll right doing your problem is is your compressors nut cycling off to let the evaporate or fall out\nYeah well and I took it to me so I put in a new one\nYou're I'm putting words saying stop putting parts\nOn it you've got either a bad low pressure switch or a a an evaporate or temp uh sensors bad something like that see when when they evaporate or gets to a certain temperature it's gotten to cycle your compressor off\nEither by a low pressure switch because what's happening is you're low pressure side of your air conditioning system will pull one to start pulling into a vacuum\nAnd when it does it'll cause the compressor to cycle off and tool the temperatures well started equalizing and the interior temperature starts going up\nBut but you're you're compressors not cycling that that's why it's doing what it's doing not because there's anything wrong with it you got a little electrical problem and\n\nI first thing you need to do is find another mechanic um but it sounds like you're getting pretty good at replacing the say see stuff though I mean you buy an hand he wanted these days but what the problem is compressors not cycling off and the system is freezing over\nIn ... and don't put no more parts on it until you get a mechanic diagnose this\nLow pressure switched thermostat temperature sensors something along those lines is your problem don't don't put no more parts because the next part you mean you need is probably a Fifteen or twenty dollars but you were already replaced everything on the system that you didn't mean to replace\nSo you get into something like this again how hard is it to go to magic mechanic dot com click on tech questions Larry darned\nAir conditioning systems freezing over what should I Do if you're not bringing it to me I Will give you a clue and prevent you from spin in last week's pay check on something that's not going to help you and how much do I charge for that Chris I Believe it's free Ninety nine three Ninety nine\nBillion ... thanks for calling him and I hope I hope we helped you know video games until you get that song [laughter]\nI'm\nVery I'm very proud of my son so we're very proud of bill unforgiving this uh giving it to good old one to ... it was going for\nThat I'm like you know some are being determined is great and I thought I'd ask people all the time last them it's broke how much worse can you break it\nDown there aren't part anyway I give it a shot you know so it's the same way when it comes to fixing the car you know the things broke you know ... give it a shot you know ... image within your real you know when you got tools to do it with ...\nBut but you know something like that you know he just needed that much yeah advice it all just went for that\nAnd much of it on buddy told him where I read it on line listen you you fix very few cars\nBy what you learn on my own and don't go to Google dot com and type you're questioning goat imagined\nMechanic dot com and type your question and you actually figure out how to really fix it you know so we we try to help folks we try to help everybody a swine where he is every Saturday and let me tell you how life works All right and and I know I've got people holding hearing you don't want to hear long drawn out story but\nLook at it like this people when you help somebody\nAnd let's say it to do it yourself or that can tackle Ninety percent of everything that goes on with his car you know ... ... ... is he going to bring a tournament probably not but but you know what\nIf I if if if somebody in his office or where he works has a car problem you know what those are the people that recommended to us you know some inadvertently you help somebody and somehow or other is just the way the cause of making the universe work\nWell and then if they come across a problem they can't solve themselves will say oh I remember I asked Larry Perry what'd you do and he gave me an answer I'll just go\nTo him but the people that are most of our recommendations are from people that has never used the shop but somewhere in in Britain lean down the line I've I've helped them in some way shape or form or fashion so that's the reason I say you know life is kind of a two way street like that you know you you help people sometimes it does come\nYou could have a head\nThat has a cylinder head or even a blocked that that that you know maybe has\nA gotten a porous place in it you know that is that is eating its way through\nBut the first thing I Would probably do and and I I agree with you I'd probably changed oil maybe run some new oil in it a drain it out and then um go ahead and run it and make sure and and then just see if history repeats itself\nYou may just want to run it on a on a on a host you know a with a pair of ... on it for a little bit just to see if it does start getting it back in there again if it does you know you're probably going to have to go on a hot like I said you know it's either going to be\nMaybe a deterioration issue with the head gasket maybe a ... problem uh corrosion with the cylinder head or something along those lines if you don't find anything you may have to pull the power head which isn't no big deal on at motor yanked power hit off of that thing and twenty minutes\nYou know and then it ended inspect the exhaust and make sure that hits not deteriorated\nUh and it's coming on a salt water motor you will see quite a few of them were the exhaust will actually deteriorate and it allows water to get in there\nAnd when it does the exhaust low they have an overlap it can actually suck water right back a ... right back into the engine so you know I Wish you luck with that job if I can help you could imagine mechanic dot com

Honda that uh that low air pressure came on I felt that tires staying on I don't know how to get it on ...\nUsually if Leslie usually if you top off the air pressure and they're right usually have you driven since you put pressure in it\nYes okay\nYou'll see even if you're if you're tired pressure low tire pressure like comes on and you put an air pressure and you usually have to drive in a short period in order for the the computer system to recognize that it's full of air and then it'll reset itself\nIf it does it reset itself man I mean I wouldn't think so but you may have to have a scan tool hook to it um that would be pretty crappy if you have to do that every time you put air and your car\nBut you know at this point I Would recommend have somebody put a scandal on it and let's just check and make sure that the computer system is actually reading all for tier pressure sensors correctly and the other thing too is\nMake sure that the spare tire if the vehicle is equipped with one which that's a kind of a toss up nowadays\nThat there's sufficient air in the spare tire as well because they can cause you're low tar pressure like to come on as well All right Melanie real quick last question last Saturday on the magic mechanic show what's your question for Larry Perry\nIntend dodge caliber that I recently had to have these ships or cable changed in a way for class Donald Kennedy's day this afternoon and went straight acquire last came out of the car wash ended up at the Taylor\nHaving to have it read catch tightened and they're telling me it's because I took it through the car wash and that just sounds fishy to me\nAre such a good [laughter] you you pay attention I Love this there are so full of crap it's rolling out of their ears\nThere oh yeah you know the neighborhood out you know and it's nice to be on a neighborhood out and and here's another one um what's it called a how's\nHow's that another website or something they call home advice yet advisor calls me on Wednesday made me feel really bad you know like I a guy goes can you take on a couple of more jobs for the year and I said no I'm not interested\nTo take on and pay for I don't pay for leads and it goes why would you pay for leads us is because I pay to be on the radio\nHe goes but you know how expensive radio is I said well you know let's do the comparison of what I can get off one or two of your job junior gonna charge me oh couple of hundred dollars maybe a thousand dollars for lead that I may not get so to me\nThat would be like playing that one point six billion dollar making the right and and what are your odds of winning that what is it one in three hundred and two million yeah that's about three dollars and thirty cents a ... a a person\nA at a drawl from last night by it's up to one point Sixers three hundred and thirty million people in America it's about almost four dollars and almost five dollars a person\nIf you think about that ... now what would you do with a hundred and one point six billion dollars I think you're bringing home would be about nine hundred million dollar I promised Larry I'd get them in whatever car he wanted yeah whatever ... well what my wife and I we have amazing plans because we're we love to give back yeah we love to get back you know there's so many ... amazing\nAnd uh charities out there and I love kids you know it's one of the first things that we would do if we did this as you know we would go back to I had such an experience at a job as trainers in Erie, Pennsylvania okay here darker man ... yeah tear up and\nSo you know once you're a ... patient you stay upright patient to you're Seventeen years old I Believe saint Jude does amazing things are so many great organizations my good friends over at Texas Tech Will Shortz Tim Miller who started that years and years and years and many many years ago and what the things they do so many great projects out there\nFirst off if you want that kind of money you're never going to spend that money in your entire life the sad part is is most people that when that kinda money one broke\nIsn't that sad yeah that's right I mean what it it's it's asserts that it's like they end up broke and depressed and then even on some of them end up then\nOr found under the house now and that's not uncommon arts and I'm not saying that's not uncommon but that has happened in the past but you know there's so many things you can do for it but you have to be smart about it of course you know what I Would do I go out and build you an amazing backyard Chris think about that you would get you\nOut of the apartment we'd get you into a house with picks you up you know when I get friend Larry Perry week we you know he's ... that preceded the comment I don't pay Larry to say what he says about my company I don't or about me but I Love game you're way advice\nYou know it isn't that ... if it was a pay per call and for advice I guess I'd be broke would die because they have a lot of people call but I Know I have listeners because what I Do go to these projects people do listen to what I have to say on the radio so the couple I met in Saint cloud yesterday\nPoll spa a specific needs they wanted to be able to sit in a spot and look at the TV on the back patio think about when you sit down and design a back yard\nAnd you want things like that think about things you need to do today and things that you can do tomorrow\nThat's really important because knowing what your um your options are gives you the dreams to build for the future now one of the things I asked my customers when they're wanting to build a pulling back or how long do you plan on living here what are you what is the pool but to do for you and your family any special needs and the family\nWell the one that won yesterday morning was a kind of needed some special needs needed to make sure that the kids and I love this we've got two kids and one on the way I Love it\nThe other one I met your staff knew we have one child and one we're going to happen to hear so planning for the future you know what I mean just so you got to make sure it's kinda like infrastructure you wouldn't want to live in a one room home and then plan on having seven kids 'cause it's just not going to work\nSo you have to plan for the future so and that's what swimming pools are what can I Do today and what can I Do tomorrow and that's kind of what Larry's doing Larry had went in and uh he read it as deck\nA re did his poll interior you did a spa a rated as a equipment put a waterfall in phase one\nThen you got face to then you've got faced array some people\nLike to tackle the whole thing at one time and become overwhelmed or spend out of the budget now this is really this is important Chris when you went and bought a car or\nDid you stay within the budget of what you were going to spend I when I buy a car I Will you ... I'm Still driving a two thousand four mini van that somehow still working soccer fan\nYeah soccer man yeah Larry Larry's actually help keep that things on there you go but see you stayed within a budget yeah you you knew what your budget was but it has to be a realistic budget right you know someone said that they can\nBuild a pool spotted deck for forty four thousand dollars it's not happening\nSo why is that not happen let's let's let's be Frank right here and that's my name's not Frank and your name's not bill but here's what I got to say the reason pool prices are going up and

that has not gone up what's it come from cement\nSo I'm not really sure what's happening with ... but it's getting out of control and that's one of the reasons I don't pour concrete decks\nIs because I refused to pay into that it will cost more young my gun I which is awesome man yeah hasn't gone up what up earlier in the air small amounts but these are huge leaps that the cement companies are taking so why do I use papers because they already comes correct\nIt's a puzzle I put together it isn't dissipated every poll contractors contracts says specifically isn't dissipated that your
