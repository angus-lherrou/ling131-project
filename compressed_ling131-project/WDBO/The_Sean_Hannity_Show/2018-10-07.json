E. D. V. O. F. at\nIn the news maybe six point five after [noise] this\nIs six point five ...\nBack to talk of news Ninety six point five W ... not much time left so Andre class you want to finish up the two and three of the big three things you need to no\nSure thing uh so uh the first malware to affect system for more directly has been discovered um basically um the from where the computer is basically the internal software of the actual hardware that controls the base functionality including a\nI'm going to start up in the interface the operating system\nMost newer computers that start around the third or fourth generation when I'm Out of ice series when windows he came out that was when you we asked by technology started being used\nMore frequently a unified extend the bowl from wearing her face and it's a the more modern method of a operating system and from work communication\nUm it was discovered that a a an anti theft agent or a load jak type of software that the code had actually been modified and maliciously and develop into a virus that can actually route itself into that hardware from where\nSo even to a point where wiping ... ...\nSystem wouldn't be good enough that that actual machine the actual backbone heart from where was actually affected by this type of a threat to\nUs so far it's not really being seen that widely spread at this point in time but\nIs the first example of a new type of security threat that says manufacturers are going to probably need to focus on also threats that are security companies are also going to need to focus on to try to fight to try and block a based apple malicious software that can\nMetal and actually damage the internal hardware functionality\nThe third big thing uh the wife by alliance which is a group that develops a wife by specifications as announced a major re brand\nFor their specification series um they're trying to make it easier for everyday people like you and me to understand\nThe current popular standard which is a to point eleven a sea is going to be re branded as why five five NATO to point eleven and which is the previous generation star will be rebranded as why five four\nAnd the upcoming eat a to point eleven a acts will be rebranded as wife by six\nSo why sick some will be coming out next year and uh it's basically going to be the next generation technology for wireless communication\nAnd efficiency and a ban with throw puts a definitely something that we want to look out for\nReal quick I might go and can get into a business ... thanks several different businesses in companies that have come to rely on refreshed computers for their computing need my go ahead and thank aging medical management Justin Clark an associate rex marketing center and that's why Sutherland construction\nFirst class cleaners being aged trucking R B services suspect imaging\n... church of God NFL guy again they buy lots of computers within the past few weeks Bible Baptist church new tech national address exhibiting an alley auto service we thank you for having to rely on refreshing and fears central forest technology leader\nCan that date twenty each state route for thirty four in long with rope until five o'clock today doesn't get to them and get your free flashlights that was Andre class of refresh computers and other awesome show another awesome\nNow that you know why would I say such a thing largely 'cause it's true okay bad how do you necessarily see this reflect and and the and the environment and ... and it goes something like this\nAs we get older especially women as women get older they start to develop something called ... which is lack of calcium or cows vacation within their bones bone density is really what it is it's more than just calcium but calcium as what we tend to to look at first\nAnd it tends to disappear and the ducks look at this and they go well if you're missing calcium in the bone it must mean that you need to take more calcium in your diet that when you think about that it makes all kinds of sense that that would work\nThen why is it that you can't reverse refund arrest osteoporosis by giving heroic doses industrial strength calcium to people and the answers because the problem may not be that at all\nIt's the digestive tract as you get older the digestive tract becomes less and less efficient so it takes more down the hatch in order to get the same net effect she have a kid she gave the kid announce alcohol\nOkay kids are going to get goofy a whole lot faster in spite of the fact that that kid may be bigger than you are it has something to do a size a lot to do with age\nA good deal to do is overall physiological conditioning okay and so it does make a difference they haven't had time to become a adapted to it either you know there's there's there's just such things adaptation to these toxins tolerance tolerance your body will in fact\nUm deal with things differently overtime if you're continually bombarded by the same poison\nThat's just the way that it works except for fruit does\nOkay fructose as kind of seen as oh I don't know it's like a super charger I Want you to imagine your car for a second okay so your car may have for cylinders it may have six may have a they may have twelve soldiers who the heck knows mhm okay but it has a bunch of cylinders and it has a means to take gasoline or some such a liquid\nOkay whether it's a gas it could be propane could be natural gas but usually gasoline\nAnd these things are ... so you make a gas out of the liquid and then it it gets that night it fires off these pistons well how do you make the engine have more power okay you put a turbo on the darn\nThing you put it would be used to call a lung okay when I was a teenager and we were out there doing stupid things you serve and I did manage to survive as many of my friends did back in your wild ... I'd never would make it to the Supreme Court I can promise you that\nAnd the way that you would increase the horse power that engine was by putting a lung on it a blower a turbo charger\nSuper charge or whatever it happens to be\nAnd what that does is it cramps feel down the throat of the engine themes that no it force feed it feeds already pushes it down rather than requiring a gravity like the old downdraft carburetors used to do or using a just a spray technique for your fuel and directors this thing would actually ram it down\nIt would push it and it was very inefficient but you really did like that extra hundred two hundred horsepower it felt good on you know an acceleration really bad on the pocket book yeah\nWell guess what your body sees the fruit ... very much the same way\nAnd you're going to go well who cares about this and why should you care\nAnd you should care a lot okay fruit toasts as interesting stuff what it does is it to poison in two ways you're going to think about it well it's just ... it's just a hundred calories who cares you know for person that group are okay hundred calories who cares because not all calories are the same\nFruit does does something very interesting it acts as an insulin receptor antagonist and you're gonna go wow that sounds pretty technical who cares before my eyes glaze over or before years ... appropriately ... over\nIt means is that means your body needs to kick out more insulin just to maintain a normal blood sugar now if you have a normal pancreas is really really easy to do this and most people have very adequate pancreatic function\nOkay it's rare to end up with a child at a diabetic and it's it's it's fairly common for people to have normal pancreas but\nWhen the insulin levels go up and it rams that that sugar into the cell\nIt rams it into cells that sometimes become a cancers kind of interesting so it actually increases your chances of developing cancer over your lifetime and then it gets worse\nCancer cells are ... are glucose obligates they can only eat sugar they can't eat triglycerides that can't eat amino acids and so and so forth to derive energy\nSo it rams into them so you find statistically over and over and over again\nThat individuals that have high end ... and high sugars in their in their blood at a lower survival rate when they do get cancer so they have an increased risk in a lower survival because of that chemistry change it's physiological change to be certain but it's a very very important one and we're killing our kids were the stuff\nWe're killing 'em Everytime you go and eat to eat the pecan pie which is Mike kryptonite okay it short and your life you know you wouldn't say well you know if you smoke cigarettes every cigarette smoke short and is your lives\nSeven or eight minutes I don't really know how long or short and so they can tell you it doesn't belong in your life\nBut a good healthy pecan pie is going to make you die happy\nBut a lot faster than you otherwise would what about that monkey bread we are eating in here about aren't there to death I brought in on that you said you need a you know you didn't see I did not see me selling you guys life insurance so the way these sorts of things were again everything in moderation but that is a particularly\nNasty one I've got to tell you but it tastes so good yeah yeah or the a few days I gave up all my life yeah your your life was shortened by by the week and a half after that but if you had any of that he didn't need it yeah it might not be a ... a week and a half anyway\nI guess it all depends but that's what we're doing\nThese days that's what's coming up on Halloween that's what's coming up and Thanksgiving that's what's coming up on Christmas that's what's coming up on New Year's and it's\nNot just fruit that does it so we you know even in candy where else we see it\nYou're going to see it wine in particular okay now it's kind of an interesting thing you know basically as a grapefruit juice that's been allowed to to er grape juice that's been allowed to ah ferment mhm\nOkay so there is still a good bit of sugar in it you know beer marvelous stuff you know I mean I spent a great deal of time in college you know really worrying about my ... my beer and take but the way that it short and your life is very very interesting but what we're doing to our kids as we're teaching their physiology\nTo like this stuff now when I was a kid\nWe were not allowed to have um soldiers in the house but probably the worst thing you can give any child is Coca Cola Pepsi Cola Mountain Dew and so and so forth\nBecause it's not just the the fruit toast that causes damage it's also the caffeine it's also um it it it's it's it's kind of an interesting sort of a situation you you start you start pumping these stimulus into children and you've really you're going to find yourself with a problem\nThat's going to be your problem you're the one that did it so yes now doc I have a question about things only audio I Know when it comes\nTo Halloween is there a particular candy that parents should be aware of like they should at least like avoid altogether or is like all candy kind of equal and that is all very terrible it's all very terrible\nOkay when you get right down to it you know ... what about diabetic candy and well okay so the problem there is that the non sugar sweeteners also tend to kick insulin up well although not as much\nSo you're kind of ... your goofed I'm at this time of year there's not a lot you can do because culturally we've backed everybody each other into a corner southerners are just as bad as the Hershey bar absolutely oh yeah it it doesn't really make a lot of difference by the time the kids are done with this they're knocking down five or ten pounds of candy over a three week period I mean let's look at it\nOkay you know these children are coming in with large bags full of stuff and it's not just the kids that are getting fat from it it's also the parents while I'm going to take this away from him I yeah I don't think you should be having a na na na na na na na na na na they knock it down so what do you do okay you teach your kids to eat in moderation\nYou know and that's not unreasonable you teach them not to have the sweets his treats then you start training people to do the wrong thing\nYou know you want to train your your your child to act like a dog that's a great idea here set up bag you know you have your treat now really it's it's the sort of thing that really doesn't make a lot of sense so you know given your kids treats for certain performance doesn't make any sense at all you do it for other reasons\nFind other reasons to to to reward them use other things to reward them but these sorts of sugary things just think of them as bullets aimed directly in between your child's eyes [laughter]\nEach and every one of the most eminent as one of the time is\nAlways a pleasure listening to the doctor would sign here on stage in life doctor a doctor flying here it'd be in the ring or a bad news on candy ahead of Halloween that's okay I don't think we have too many children\nLeft the Grinch you you'd be surprised actually yeah yeah I I've got kids that come in and yeah they do listen I don't want to do anything I tell them to do and I'm not going to dilute myself I'll be happy if their parents at least listen if they can pick up a bit of it I'm happy you know cut it back for God's sake\nYou know yeah how did back don't don't let kids eat their fellow this stuff cut it back if you want to\nTalk of the guy you're David Klein if you want to talk to him about this if you have a reaction if you want to challenge him on it and who ... for two two zero zero nine six five again eight

half hour\nWell we're going to talk I think by the color that just just dropped off wherever and some technical difficulties here okay what was the cold and so Tom ... somebody called in and he was asking about tremors and he pretty much said do you cover it to recover I'm not sure whether whether he means by cover\nOr the remains to be treated the answers of course\nThe thing about tremors that you need to understand is that they're not all the same and there's some things that you can do to deal with this on your own show arresting tremor okay it's not the same things Parkinson's arresting tremor is something that's very very common especially as you get older and it's something that is addressed simple as a medical condition\nParkinson's involves the base of Anglia don't mean issue the ... of the brain start to deteriorate ... then you end up with a shuffling gait you end up with\nUm the host of other issues but resting tremor okay is treated\nVery differently and I think we got to come back on the line okay which is an area are home from Kissimmee back on the show you how are you there for you you get dropped off it I just thought it would go ahead and start answering your question for you so why don't you want to refresh at least give me a general idea whether I was getting close to what you're asking\nI ... about two years ago I was in the\nEye strain meeting and I had a pamphlet there and I had to pass so papers and when I started reaching for the papers the separate it my hand started shake it okay and I said the group I said I said my assistance to pass out and they see this is so important to me that I'm losing control\n[laughter] never okay how old are you I'm Seventy four okay so the one hand or both hands that are that are shaking like that it's both hands or does it and yeah go on\nAnd what happened was I went to read the newspaper a couple of days later and every time I Try to separate the pages my head start shaking her taking any idea how are you taking any medications\nAbsolutely no good I've met\nFor them and I I'm Sorry I don't call that a medication I call that a vitamin\nOK Go along with him that won bronze already [laughter] so tell me ask you a question okay so if you took\nYour handle both either one doesn't really make any difference and put it out in front of your palm down and you took a piece of paper you know ten by ten piece of paper and laid on top of the hand what would that tremor look like you're going to see a piece of paper start to shake\nOkay is it is it bothering you when you're resting or is it bother you when you go to do something that arresting tremor Orson intention tremor very very\n... engine trimmer okay so ...\nGot it okay a couple of things need to look at okay the likelihood of this of this being a Parkinson's or Parkinson's like is very small okay but an intention tremor can either be very normal you can see these things genetically some people have a propensity to go you know it's funny but my grandad had this and my dad had this also\nAnd the way you typically treat this okay is with either a something called a gab ...\nOkay and that's ... highly technical and really it's not

and then that would reduce the dosage just one more time increase the methadone to thirty milligrams a day wait two weeks and then drop it off entirely and then I Would have you on between thirty and forty milligrams a methadone which all you would need\nThen we start getting you off the methadone how do you do that you start backing the dosage down by five milligrams per day per month\nAnd then out you go I'm not a big proponent of using opiates to treat arthritis these because it tends to cause addiction but if you use the anti inflammatory is this way it shouldn't be any problem at all you'll get the relief that you need and off you go now where is your arthritis the worst ... where do you feel divorced [noise]\nShoulder and say\nWhat I Would do to take care of that I Would use something called volt tearing one percent gel and you take a slug of this stuff I called one good healthy sneeze worse okay and you put it on your hand and then you put it on your shoulder Okie rub it in the shoulder you take two healthy sneeze worse than you put it behind\nEach of your knees not the kneecap but the soft area behind the knees okay so in other words it could be bent your if you if you sat down put your knees or Ninety degree angle okay there's a soft ... and actually behind the knee called the ...\nWhen you use the ... in that area it'll go directly into the joint it doesn't take it more than a couple of minutes for this to occur and you'll get more relief from that are done but anything else you're gonna do I also used my product called ... which is a lot cheaper and a whole lot easier to use but I don't want to sound too terribly self\nUh I'm serving on this we like cheaper I Know well history for thirty bucks for eight ounces I mean it's pretty darn cheap but the ... you know with the volt tearing something at most everybody can get by prescription anyway\nAnd then you should do well but getting off the federal patches is a proper thing to do I'm not a big fan of those suckers when you when you put a short acting medicine like ... in a long acting base you know made a for them okay you know a company makes them it's called ... and it's in Palo Alto California\nIt what it does it makes it far more addictive than a whole lot more dangerous\nSo getting off those things exactly the right thing to do at what's more as they don't come for free those are expensive suckers even that even the generic ones are expensive so I don't like using federal patches not a big proponent of them I'm I've been doing pain work for almost forty years and I have only a handful of people that take the patches at all because I just don't think much of a Methodist\nProbably the single finest ...\nThat there is a right Freda are in a pocket thanks so much for your call\nWe were pretty that's pretty much brings us to the end of of stages of life that I Know ... another edition and now we do have a probably about forty seconds left so real quick real quick that just is a marine oh at least think about vaping I think it sucks okay what happens is\nBefore they started getting into it to court legalization of marijuana in the state which isn't it's just decriminalize you get caught with that stuff in Ocala national forest and you can see just how decriminalize it is the problem is is that it's going to lead to\nAuto wrecks and so and so forth view thrived on ice four which is sometimes donors bumper cars to central Florida okay you're going to see an awful lot of people that are texting and equal number of people that are facing and they're not vaping tobacco products why for three years ago you didn't see them out there for ... like you to know\nWe'll get into this more next week I feel like yeah I certainly doctor climbed we'll be back next week at three o'clock for another edition of stages of life we're gonna break the news right here on news Ninety six point five ... [noise]\nYeah or you know as our kids as our kids say it's fire ... your your kids say that yeah like you're like we go out to dinner or something a good restaurant my son says oh man that state was fire\nOkay\nI Know actually what I Am Sam you say that right now I say it's led led okay let let okay I don't actually say that I Know people say [laughter]\nNames the\nProducer for us right I'm just for people that didn't know that anyway the word fire John ... it's actually a kind of a I don't know if it's an acronym but it stands for financial independence and early retirement All right by\nOur alright that's a new thing we're going to be hearing about that fire well I don't I don't know if it's a natural independence an early retirement\nI don't know if it's I think you're going to be hearing about because I I Know that uh as I was reading this article the thing that brought me to it was the fact that Suzie Orman hates this concept really\nYeah world renowned Suzie Orman\nYeah she says that if you're going to the concept here is that you want to retire early this was apparently not a new concept I I really don't think [laughter]\nUm but you want to retire early and you want to have financial independence right right those two things I don't think anybody is going to walk about that uh but ... says\nBe careful here because these are people that are in their forties in their thirties in their twenties they are wanting to retire\nAnd she says you shouldn't do that unless you have at least five million dollars saved up in the bank [noise]\nWell if you were in your twenties or thirties and you were going to retire I Would think you would need at least five billion dollars\nSo yeah yeah if you expect to live or you know a decent long life like most people hope to you I Would think that you've got to have a pretty significant amount of money in the bank but you know this this whole thing this fire thing\nAnd I don't know I this this is news to me but here's what it comes down to it it's not really about retiring\nPer se is retiring to me means you you're not working anymore right what these folks that are pushing this fire thing are saying is that you can just adjust your lifestyle and what you're doing for work\nTo kind of transition into a lifestyle where you're not maybe having to go into work everyday\nAnd you've got a little more freedom in what you're doing and you could travel and still do what you want to do there was a book while back called a four hour work week\nThat had a lot of the same concepts applied to it but the thing that I was really interested in was the fact that they had a list of things that could help you to become financially independent and retire early a lot of this so far sounds like you why do you say that\nBecause you have a flag you as a professional traitor if you will you have a flexible lifestyle you're kind of how much money you make is kind of depends on how much you put into it uh you read the book\nAbout a four hour work week and you were only work like six hours a week\nSo that's not true I\nI Would probably work eight or ten hours say okay ah don't sell it short [laughter] right okay I get what you're saying I think that I think what it comes down to as yeah if you're a trading that could be your lifestyle but check out this list of things uh you know some of these things we actually talked about in the workshop\nUm but the top the\nTop of the list we don't talk about this and the workshop so number one hears the\nNumber one thing or the first thing you can do to move yourself towards financial independence you're supposed to lower your\nYour fixed costs and shove all the money that you have into index funds downing stock index funds it's mutual funds that don't have a lot of fees okay okay okay so here's the first thing lower your housing cost\nI think for a lot of people that's hard to do right I I mean you could move your family of five into an apartment [laughter] girls you could um\nSacrifice though everyone every every body that's a multimillionaire you know talks about how if you're a regular Joe and you want to get wealthy you have to make sacrifices and I don't know about you know obviously you you to save money you probably need to lower your costs and\nPeople will say you know drive a used car and make coffee at home don't buy it at Dunkin' Donuts and all of that stuff\nYou know what driving used car that was the second thing on the really so you're on okay you're on fire [laughter]\nThe other thing is cutting the cable don't pay for cable far right but then you can buy Hulu and Netflix and whatever Seventeen other things ESPN go or whatever it's called and you have your built back up then even though you don't get cable and all the other trials\nAre lowering your tax liabilities K whatever that means\nI'm using a cheaper cell phone service that's probably going to get your rich don't you think [laughter] um I you know what I have searched around for ... cheaper cell phone service and always seems to come back to exactly the same price no matter\nWho you're working with the same here because I Know you have a big family plan like I Do and it's it's it's never gets ... there's no such thing as cheaper cell phone I I Know I Know it's like ten bucks a month then you got to get a new phone and start all\nOver yeah exactly so I don't know how that's gonna make you\nRich rent financially independent um use credit card rewards now didn't she say something about um what's that guy's name who was talking about the credit card\nOh yeah Mark Cuban Mark Cuban yeah so I I saw a story and I don't want to get you off track but Mark Cuban who some people love of the you know Mark Cuban says if you use credit cards you don't want to be rich\nWhat does that mean you know I've read some of Mark Cuban stuff and he's kind of saying some of the same things that you're saying here and he says you know you if you want to be rich you have to make sacrifices\nA and you shouldn't have any debt or if you can't afford to pay off your car then get a cheaper car he doesn't think you should have a mortgage which I don't think most people are capable of just going out and getting a house without a mortgage right I'm going to\nGet out in my bag five hundred thousand dollars in this bag and dropping a rival right so uh and and I\nAs a person that uses credit cards I Know I understand what he's saying you know if you if you use credit cards and you build them dead and\nAnd you're really take off and if you've listened to the show before you know I say this all the time but I cannot stress that enough there is so much opportunity and the financial markets it's just that most people are not aware\nOf the opportunities and you don't need a whole lot of money to get started either with some of these different aspect classes that's another one of the misconceptions and Chris can talk about that a little bit more on the other side of the break\nAs we head to the break if you want to learn more about trading leverage to asset classes like futures for X or options pick up the phone right now called the number I gave you

T. A. making a select number of seats available for free for radio show listeners ...\nThe three hour comprehensive workshop has a three hundred dollar value but again if you'd call right now tell them you're hurt us on the radio you can get into this week's workshop for F. R. E. guide Chris you ready for the second half of the show oh it's my favorite part\nIt is a everybody's favorite part apparently what to\nTony in the news this week what did Tony CNN News is\n\nUnfortunately I saw a lot of stories about how the market is getting ready to tank once again [noise] um mainly\nThis article entitled the stock market is trading at a record which most people know what to look under the hood shows some troubling signs so what kind of science are we talking about Tony wall there's three major conditions here three main conditions that imply stocks will plunge\nOver forty percent in the next bear market as you and I have discussed on this radio show many a times it's not a matter of if the market's going to have a big pull back or plus\nYou're retrace or whatever you want to call it correct so when is it going to happen next and I saw this as a this is really interesting this is what got my attention is what made me to bring the story to the table a there says more stocks are declining then rising\nThat there's more fifty two week lows being made been there are high is being made\nHa ha you know we talked about the fact that the markets have been up over three hundred percent uh there has to be five hundred for instance has brought her three hundred percent since two thousand nine\nIt's been a really nice run to the upside but there's also typically every Seventy years a correction that's ten percent or more\nAnd basically I mean we had a little wiggle in February um but we haven't had that real major draw down that typically washes a bunch of people out and creates new buying opportunities for other people\nAnd the further we keep going in this aboard momentum ... the more concerning it is that we've got a major retrace meant coming to the downside and there are some things that\nThat traders will look at to determine when the market is potentially rolling over in our workshop we talk about our core strategy and that's how we actually determine where there's turns in the market uh we teach people are patented course strategy that\nUm nobody else has because it's patented um\nBut you can find out more about that in the workshop but when people when when most traders are looking at the market and looking for signs of the market's going to roll over one of the things that you'll see is that there is a a transfer of monies\nFrom the the really hot stocks to beat up stocks so you'll see money coming from technology in to um like energy energy was beat up for a while and now you know what's happening with oil prices right they're going to them and the ...\nThe oil prices are are are back up all their almost up to a point where people were saying five years ago like you'll never see that price again\nYou want to protect the profits that you have at some point you're gonna have to move things around\nYeah the market moves in a cyclical nature did I say the right cyclical yes you are and and the the big guys very moving money around based on certain times of year you have certain stocks performed better than others\nAnd if you are just camped in mutual funds and your ... never make a change you're missing out on the opportunities that the big guys actually take\nBecause they have the luxury of moving their their investments around and if you understand just a very simple difference between mutual funds and exchange traded funds ATS which I won't get into here but we talked about out of the workshop right you can potentially a\nRetain a whole bunch of money that you're losing and make a whole lot more than you would have otherwise\nSo if you want to learn how to protect the profits that you already have if you want to learn how to generate more profits in a down market if you want to learn about self directing or any of the other things that Chris just mentioned the time is now my friend do you need to get to the phone\nEight eight eight six what eight nine

again we're all ready to the home\nStretch there is so much opportunity to talk about a so much exciting stuff in the\nDifferent asset classes and Chris once we start talking about the other asset classes and talking about leverage and then talking about making money while the stock market's going down like we were just a few minutes ago I mean there's there's so much ground to cover and I get so excited for it\nThe centers that are getting turned on to things that they didn't even know existed like making money when the stock market goes down all the time goes by so fast [noise]\nLet me throw the phone number out there one more time before we get wrapped up here eight eight eight six one eight nine two four nine eight eight eight six one eight nine two four nine call right now if you haven't already done so the seats are filling up quick you can get into this week's upcoming workshop in Orlando or in St Petersburg\nFor free eight eight eight six one eight nine two four nine the workshop is a three hundred dollar value so we were talking about making money as the stock market goes down\nYeah and when we talk about making money on the way down\nOr whether you're a long term trader an investor\nA it's really an issue of well I was gonna say it's an issue going short the markets ... and you know we we mentioned that in the last segment going short just means the ability to make money as the market is going down\nBut there are other ways to make money in the market as it goes down as well and we shouldn't limit ourselves to stock market we have a tendency to get in the conversation about the stock market because that's what most people know but as you and I both tried to point out\nTraining isn't just about the stock market it's about the options market and the futures market for X market and there is as you say so much opportunity out there for people that sometimes you just need to be exposed to it um you know making money as the market goes down there are ways\nTo make money with options as the market goes down um that don't involve the concept of shorting is just trading a vehicle that makes money when the market goes down that vehicle make some money on the way up so\nIt's kinda cool ah UPN short the currency market the ... market as well when you're training for X. really what you're doing is you're training currencies how one currency relates to another it's what it comes down to\nA and then uh you can do the same thing when you're training futures you have the ability to make money as the market goes up or down so any three of those any one of those three asset classes\nAllow you to use the leverage to make above average returns like we talked about earlier\nAnd they allow you to the two of them futures and for X. allow you to trade maybe outside traditional market hours if you have a traditional job and you don't have the ability to be in front of a computer during regular market hours from nine to nine ... nine nine thirty until four o'clock\nA then you've got an opportunity in the forest in the futures market\nUm and then we talked about leverage\nOr we're talking about options have tend to want to leverage a futures have twenty to one leverage and for access fifty to want to leverage so let me put that in some real terms for people\nIf you had two thousand dollars and you were going to put on an option trade essentially you'd be working with twenty thousand dollars worth of stock when you're trading two thousand dollars worth of options\nAre when you're treating the futures market if you've got two thousand dollars into the trades you're actually trading forty thousand dollars worth futures contracts and if this is the big one in the world of for X. if you've got two thousand dollars in the market you're lifting a hundred thousand dollars worth of currencies\nAnd that's just incredible opportunity so there's a great opportunity across the board whether you're a traitor or an investor I Would hope that you would come out and spend some time with us at the workshop and just kind of explore a little bit and wants the what the opportunities are for you know\nThese are all the things they teach at the online trading academy and you will get exposed to some of it in the three hour workshop like Chris said why not go out a see some of the opportunity that is available in the world incredible amounts of opportunity\nA and start to ... you know start to learn about how you can take control of your financial future eight eight eight six one eight nine two four nine\nEight eight eight six one eight Ninety two forty nine is the phone number you can check out trading academy dot com\nGet in to this week's workshop if you go to lake marry your secrets you can I ask him what at any question that you want to hide that does it for us once again Christopher we'll see you back here next week on me oh TA or radio show\nIs news Ninety six point by your baby ... turns worse for breaking news\nBut none of them are called burn fat or Leno because our focus literally\nI was doing the things to burn the fat so\nEight five five eight eight nine eight four four six eight five five eighty nine eight for for six that\nIs the number to call and we got six officers now throughout central Florida we got offices in Claremont and and in the villages well so have a the Dr Phillip Syria we also have a pop go we also have Sanford and\nAnd the water for lakes we have six offices throughout the central Florida area and what I offer you know ... is gene 'cause I Know you see people around the studio and older they're losing weight you want to know how well they're all on burn fat Orlando\nAnd one of the reasons are that I Do this right at this time right at the beginning it because so many people miss out and I always hear about it you know a day later or sometimes even an hour later you know I'm going to give an initial visit a way that's a four hundred dollar value\nTo come in and to review the program is absolutely no charge you it's my nickel dime so keep your money in your pocket\nCome in and review the program and if that doesn't make sense to you then don't do the program it's just that simple but what you find what you'll learn on our program or things that you have it never really even thought of that many times are the programs don't even consider\nRight and then you begin to program\nAnd we'll make it a certainly affordable and easy for you to begin to program that's why we have tens of thousands of patients on a program\nAnd then you can see mark my words within the first two to four days you'll see that scale on that that digital read out or that needle on that scale to decrease to go down and you'll continue to do it\nFor forty days now here's the thing the other thing I make available as we do a body composition analysis of burn fat or ... dot com body composition analysis that regularly goes\nFor Ninety nine dollars when you come in because listening to the radio you can have it for twenty seven dollars ... the only thing you have the loses what well you have to lose the weight right\nBut a little bit of time to come in and review it but if you don't do something today what does your tomorrow's looked like what is your health look like tomorrow what does your you know medical bills looked like tomorrow\nAnd we have trained staff we have guided the staff I I've created the program so that it's customize individualize and that it works it works for you and it will work each and every single time one of the things that we do a gene is that we customize the program\nAnd we have technology we we generally call it burn fat Orlando technology what it is very simply is that we understand all the components that it takes for you to lose the weight\nThe data five what needs to happen we create the program for you so husbands wives spouses friends you know if they come together which most folks do\nYou know hey you know they come into your ... your program is different than my program Ah yes because you all have different health you all have different uh biomarkers you all have different weight to lose job different medical histories how in the world can a big bucks program be effective for you long term\nBecause anybody can lose weight just by stopped eating right I mean that makes sense but how can how can you heal your body so that your body does a few different things number one it tells you your your body to burn fat\nWhat else does it do it tells you to hydrate Thursday sells the other thing that does is that on the program you're going to detox\nThe cells the cells on the inside what I mean by that not just the guts detox but what would it be like if the internal cells inside the cells start to get clean\nAnd when you remove silent information all of a sudden your body starts to work better the hypothetical must works better the neurological system works better the hormone system works better it will guide you each and every step of the way\nThat I can see the phones lighting up right now but I'm going to give that number ... go by very very quick but I mean this sincerely
