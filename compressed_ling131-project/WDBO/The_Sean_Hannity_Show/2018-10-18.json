I think it will get worse before it gets better 'cause I ain't gonna keep losing and I think\nThat they they are so alienated from most Americans that all they have left is this kind of a meal is street violence\nA which in the end I think turns people off because it's it's it's it's also a little scary because it says Steve ... proved when he was shot um\nYou know if you're conservative and you're in public life there's a certain danger level now that is totally on American and that comes entirely from the left\nYou know the thing is that's missing and and you figure it out I mean I watch the whole process when you became speaker it didn't happen overnight it started with a series of\nVideotapes about running to transform America and it was called renewing American civilization when did you first put those tapes out\nWe first began working on it in uh Ninety two and did the first wave of tapes in Ninety three and then the second wave after I was ...\nAnd it was all based on ideas culminating in a contract with America and I I think people forget because\nYou know we've had waves of conservatives maybe if you want to start with Gary Barry Goldwater that's one it wasn't successful but it was the beginning Reagan's victory in Nineteen eighty and then subsequently in eighty four that was another big victory and and obviously the Republicans taken over Congress for the first time in forty years with your contract\nAnd I'd argue Donald Trump is the fourth leg and that is a I had everything he is doing in terms of governance is conservative even even threatened trade wars they're not\nThey're not materialized because that's never been as a pension its intention to for better trade deals freer fairer deals\nYou know I think like I I think he is the fourth a cycle if you will of moving back from a left wing America and we've been gaining momentum and gaining clarity\nAnd there's often tell people you know we didn't have Leonard Leo\nAnd the federalist society with so many good solid conservative lawyers that we could fill up all these judicial appointments and that that's just a huge advantage and they're all grows out of what is now\nIf you go back to Goldwater uh fifty four year movement um but I think it's also coming to a crisis because\nTrump so clearly articulate each a pro American pro work ethic pro patriotism policy that he drives the left crazy\nAnd I think as a result the left which has gotten more extreme they haven't modulated they haven't come back to the center they've decided that their job is to beat up and intimidate those of us who disagree with him and and they and I think that just further isolate some\nSo their agendas pretty clear they get back the house they won in peach men they want the crumbs back the largest tax cutting history which is obviously having a big impact on the economy we you know all the record unemployment numbers the varying demographic groups that are doing better than they've ever done\nUm they also want to open borders but John Podesta said don't talk about immigration\nThey want to eliminate ice they want to keep Obamacare\nI'm an endless investigation I Would add to that I don't hear one positive thing that's going to create one job or make this country one bit safer not nothing that they're running on just that and we hate Trump that's it\nWell I think that's right and that's partly because I tried to tell us honestly what they stand for there will be defeated so badly that they just they know that they can't afford to be honest but but I think I mentioned the send your TV show last night I think that we're about to be\nA magic moment in American history and I think the two words that captured in my mind are Kavanaugh and caravan I think Kevin all the way they treated him of the viciousness the smears the character assassination childish behavior by\nUS Senators in Senate meetings I think all that came together to really re galvanized conservatives and I think this caravan coming up from Guatemala should be a major focus of Republicans for the next couple of weeks because it makes clear\nThe argument about whether or not we have a right to be a sovereign country or whether in the\nFeinstein below sea San Francisco Democrat tradition we have an obligation to open up our border to anybody who can get finance and remember these three thousand people I I agree with Laura Ingraham is asking the question who's paying for this these three thousand people will probably cost\nTwenty one million dollars to move\nFrom Guatemala highly four thousand people now grown too amid a spike among a U.S border crossings but you know Nancy Pelosi actually said we are not funding the border wall\nAnd that just is it seems to be an appendage to Donald Trump's manhood I mean you know imagine anything similar said about any woman by any Republican or conservative\nI mean it's outrageous the double standard and then so flagrant but\nYou know we're we're already have paid between healthcare education criminal justice we've already paid trillions of dollars for people that didn't respect our laws and sovereign states costs the American people a fortune and by the way the people of California and now we're going to be paying for their health care for free no questions asked\nBy the way we have in Georgia a democratic nominee for governor Stacey Abrams or who are clearly favors allowing illegal immigrants to vote a says the show's on draw any distinction between the people who are American citizens and people who came here illegally\nUm and that's that's sort of typical Gavin Newsom candidate for governor of California who openly says he wants to have government run health care and make it available to every illegal immigrant who can get to California I mean\nThe Democratic party is becoming the party of illegality the party of breaking go all the point you made earlier and a party which believes that can't win was legal American votes and so it's kind of try to find some way to turn around the system and it's an amazing thing to watch develop\nOr we're going to get Newt Gingrich has predicted Nineteen days till election day I'll also his take
