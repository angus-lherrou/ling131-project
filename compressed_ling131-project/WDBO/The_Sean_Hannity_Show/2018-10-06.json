{"month": "10", "state": "FL", "station": "WDBO", "content": "Tax is looking at all these different issues healthcare costs and make sure that you have a plan you can feel confident and\nIf you've got questions about that you can visit guiding an Aztec dot com or you can speak to a team number right now off the air for zero seven to seven zero one out than most analysts are in agreement that we're going to see a market correction but they don't agree about when that might happen\nDon't invest or rate ... CNBC that we do still have some time\nWe're in I Would say the seventh inning of this cycle I think that we're at this stage in the cycle where interest rates are being raised where the later stage maybe we have two more years I Would say and so the cycle something like that\nDo you agree with that make you think we have another two years of the market doing really well\nWell here's the thing I Know of course in those things change right and they change all the time so if everything were to remain a basically like it is now for\nYou know for all the information that we have remains current I'm really really optimistic about the economy I like what's going on businesses are doing well I'm going to continue to do well\nAnd it could be two years we recommend that our clients a visit with us or at least to talk to us say every six months quarterly is even better but but but six months to a year 'cause things are changing over time\nIt could be two years Christian but at this point I'm what I'm most worried about is how good things are right so so things can be really really good and then they're almost too good and so to good is is a relative term we all want to make lots and lots of money in the market that would be great we all wanna not have to worry about market crashes that would be great\nBut when things get really really good and he mentioned the fed raising interest rates they're going to try to slow this economy down\nI think back to prior to every market crash things typically are really really good right I mean people are kind of high on live lots of jobs out there are lots of money being made lots of investing being made people are buying new houses are buying boats you know they're they're buying luxury items for like a better word\nAnd then things always seem to you know all of a sudden you know got real bad real quick and and and now those boats people bought got real cheap and the fancy cars people by got real cheap and the real estate people got got real cheap and\nAnd that's the market cycle so we we need to understand more about the cycles and how they work and we need to understand what does it mean when I'm the stock market's gets overbought right and how's it going to reflect us personally because that's\nYou know it is actually happening a little bit right now you need a little bit over ... how long can we sustain this so what I expected that the economy if nothing else pops up is that this this is good as things are as it gets a little overheated\nAnd when things get overheated you know people extend themselves for them they probably should for sure and then you know we wind up getting a a bad market and that could happen\nI don't know you know six months a year two years from now this is why we need to be flexible Christian people make comments like it's going to be two years\nAs it winds up being two years in the market crashes that guy is going to be out saying he called it yeah that's true you know what I mean I'm\nI'm the one that sort of in putting myself in the back if it winds up being\nA year or he'll come up with some excuse for why he was wrong yeah well I'm wrong because it's changed so it's always a moving target which is why I think it's important that you're working with an investment advisor that that has your best interests at heart you know work with somebody who's going to help you with this if you don't you don't feel like doing it by yourself\nOr you might not even feel capable of doing yourself but working in an advisor that has a vested interest in doing well to help you navigate these markets in somebody to be proactive not somebody who just that just says well\nI'm hanging in there right we hate hang in there a Christian because hang in there for people that are retired last time people hung in there the U.S and he was down fifty one percent so depending on your allocation equities you'd probably lost a lot of money hanging there didn't work out too good\nAgain whether it's six months from now a year from now two years from now we need to have a financial plan and I think working with an advisor that'll help navigate that for you is really really important\nIt is very important to make sure that you have someone on your side that can\nNavigate through the good times and the bad when it comes to your money and Wall Street and some of the other things that affect you and your fifty an older here in Florida and you're talking about retirement gotta guarding and dot com to find out more or just pick up the phone and\nSaid at the time to sit down with Mike and his chain and ask them questions about where you stand now with the market doing so well and where you stand if you don't make any changes and you don't have that active wealth management when the market does turn because we don't know when that's going to happen we just have to be prepared for the last half\nFour zero seven to seven zero one thousand that's force there were seven to seven zero one thousand back in Nineteen Ninety nine that was at least the late nineties when Netflix came up with this revolutionary idea of renting DVD movies through the mail\nAnd that's like a fake a list of the movies you want to see I don't know about one business day they'll get three ...\nHead of the most exciting thing when the male would conduct Netflix DVD and of course things have changed we get most of our movies digitally but there are all kinds of other subscription services out there that copied this Netflix not all the newest one and I haven't seen that it's available here in Florida yet\nBut its cars you pay a monthly fee that bundles the use of the car with the maintenance insurance and everything pretty genius idea\nRight Mike it reminds me that when we talk about the bundling African visor your services are kind of bundled in a similar way I mean yes you're helping people with their investments all straight but you're also helping them with tax planning and retirement healthcare costs and many other things\n... and there's a reason for that Christian we all of all those relationships so a relationship with an investment advisor or a relationship with an accountant or a relationship with an estate planning attorney and they all need\nTo work together seamlessly right and so we work with CPAs that you know say we have a client that comes to work with us and we're managing their money and then they have a CPA that they've been working with for a long time so they want to continue working with a CPA that's absolutely fine\nRight I just want to make sure I got a good relationship with their CPA or if they're working with a state planning attorney that they they really liked that's fine I just want to have a good to know your meeting with their estate planning attorney that that that we have a good relationship\nBut a lot of people that we work with they they don't necessarily have good relationships with CPAs are accountants they don't necessarily have good relationships with estate planning attorneys\nAnd a responsible financial plan is going to you know a\nB responsible when it comes to investing price is going to be efficient actively managed portfolios that's really really important\nBut Christian we also want to be really efficient when it comes to taxes we don't want our clients paying more in taxes than they need to pay less not efficient and we don't want to make decisions based on how they invest that hurt them tax wise so we're going to be careful there that's why we employees CPAs I'm here in town will management\nIn addition to that we want to make sure that we're being responsible from a um estate planning standpoint that's why we have attorneys that work with us to help our clients with state planning\nPerson went when the attorney has just down the hallway or when the CPAs just down the hallway and I'm putting together a comprehensive financial plan it's a lot easier rash walk down their question answered or if I have an a client that's working with us and we have an estate planning or tax question and I just you know need to walk down the hall and make that happen a lot easier\nSo it's more efficient in that way and again you can't I just don't believe it's a good idea to work with a financial advisor that's only interested in your money is not going to end because if they're only interested in your money and helping you with that there are all these other things\nIt was like health insurance and that goes with attorneys I mean it's just to know\nFall by the right side and in the end you're not going to be in a good position\nBut it is and they've got blinders to everything else so\nThat's why we do it that way and it's not so much this bundled you know we're not a cable company here but um you know or cell phone company but it is you know where we were the access to be easy and we don't want to complicated and we'll be all help our our clients so\nAgain as we live in today show Christian I Know we've we've got a lot of calls but for anybody who would like to come sit down and do that truly comprehensive financial plan where we'll take a look at all of this for you you walk out of our office with a financial planning your hands if you want to implement on your own will show you how to do that if you want to take it to your current financial advisor I'm absolutely fine with that\nIf you'd like to hire us to implement it for you that's okay too but it was called the next ten minutes and what is it for your complimentary\nIt's a Fifteen hundred dollar value so make sure you take advantage of this comprehensive financial plan by calling in the next ten minutes for zero seven to seven zero one thousand four zero seven to seven

it's not derived from crude oil bases or\nAnything that can sludge as a matter of fact it keeps the engine spotless inside and when it comes to where it doesn't just reduce where it lemonade and ...

Larry these calls are brought to us by Bennett auto supply auto parts in a whole lot more thirty five locations you just visit Bennett auto dot com leading us off in the first in line one first in line is\nJan from Orlando Jan you're on the air with Larry Perry here on magic mechanic Hi how are you worked great [noise]\nI have a two thousand twelve dodge caravan hundred and thirty thousand miles on it um undermining its rise fine we bought it was about eighty thousand so he bought it used to Albany let's transmission lent\nI guess no surprise we found that out kind of hindsight those transitions to last that long mechanic pleading he's been dealing with the shop for years older than ... years but low miles\nThat one didn't quite work Santa\n... put in a second one that one didn't quite work so I finally said you know what I listen to the magic mechanic long enough that attack there was a little more than we can afford to get it out that one last week\nMy husband tries Hoover so we put two thousand miles on it but last night and started to why and he would step on the gas would kick like you wanted to go into gear and it was sort of\nBut not quite in the morning nothing so we have to have it to get it so during the Cannick but could there be something else going on with the car that's making these ... you know the transmission issues\nYeah [laughter] a couple of things Jan um [noise]\nHave they all demonstrated this whining type of thing\nYou know the mechanics said that the first one they they put in Iran well and then they they took it out for a good heart test drive and it it wouldn't shift but they didn't eat there was any why I think that was the problem with the second one there was just some problems with it\nAll right and now you've got the new transmission in there and now you're putting it do you say you started off this morning and it wouldn't do nothing or\nHe he he was able to get it started but when you hit the gas\nAdjust it like chunks like it wants to grab a year but not really so you know he's not going anywhere with it I Can't take it out on the road get actually pushed it back up the road and do the ... you know it just wasn't going it ramps fine all week we've got it back\nLast Thursday not upon me I drove it as a baby behind when it was shipped them\nBut last night again he he dropped off a ride about midnight started the wine and then it started to not want to engage real well\nWe haven't even gotten the bachelor the five thousand miles plus yet and we were going to do that but I'm a\nGen when when you when you have a vehicle that has repetitive transmission failures one after another after another and one of the things that um is is kind of a hitting me here as you had the one that had the whining noise going on with it\nUsually when you have the the the whining noises made by the pump the the actual a flood pomp\nOr in the transmission and in my experience when we have a a whining noise take place\nIt's usually because there's a restriction in in the system either the filter is plugged up which in your case I'm gonna I'm gonna [noise] that's a nice ... exactly you understand what I'm saying so I have to eliminate that possibility the other thing is\nA restriction in one of your cooler lines for the transmission cooler itself\nAs separate from the transmission yes ma'am ma'am see ... ... when when you got this many repetitive issues you know to be honest we use the chances of having three bad transmissions that is just\nYou know yeah come on ... that's what they call you or something so yeah uh now\nThe cooler on this is located inside your radiator and okay you've a transmission starts to wear a lot of times these little small debris and stuff like that will actually get into a cooler\nAnd it'll it'll start collecting and it'll plug it it'll plug the cooler up\nNow on a lot of Dodgers and especially a lot of jeeps I'm In the line\nThe you've gotta you've got a a transmission cooler line that goes into the cooler then you've got one that comes back to the transmission is return so the flu can circulate after it gets cool you understand what I'm saying there aren't sure well in a lot of the Dodgers in employment us in a deep so that\nThey use a check valve in the cooler lines\nAnd sometimes the check well we'll get stuck and it will shut the abs ... will shut down the cooler flow altogether so what happens is that flood just starts generating heat and gets hotter and hotter and hotter and hotter ... literally starts boiling\nAnd when it does then of course you can have some transformation damage over and over and over if that is your case\nWhat I'm going to recommend this pull the cooler lines loose at the transmission\nAnd see if you can blow through them you're probably going to find that there is a major restriction in either a cooler line or the transmission cooler itself best bet get rid of the righty well get rid of the cooler that's in the radiator bypass it and put a nice to have been cooler in front of the radiator and call it a day\nAnd it probably and all of your problems but it's got to be a flow tested first to make sure that is the issue\nBut if the cooler and already you're plugged up that you can put an after market larger one on in front of the radiator or the ac can dancer and that'll get your capacity\nWhere it needs to be and then the Airflow keep your transmission fluid a lot cooler\nIt's because you got a chance to knocking debris loose\nIn your case do the pan drop a new filter you're going to probably put in our six seven courts a fluid just by getting a gallon a fluid of AM's all back in your\nTransmission will do more favors for that transmission than anything on this planet or if you'll you'll

benefit there ever was for an automotive engine even if the oil is not being pumped damsel runs including the heat and will not release until it gets cold\nAnd I'm like this is this is insane how do you make an oil work like that that's the reason\nIt is so superior Mike you've got a problem with your rear hatch won't open on a two thousand Thirteen Volkswagen take one\nYes sir I bumped in the rear and I'm able to get relief but nothing happens anymore so I'm assuming it's the actual live\nYet now let me let me tell you what I did not I've never had one in the shop with this particular problem so when I get a question like this the first thing I Do is go to the technical service bulletin supplied to me from both sweat\nAnd I'm sitting there and I'm going down through here and I'm looking in on your car and this is something I I think anyone with a tick one would want to know a ... they say that the third break like the center when\nIt has got to seal around it that will leak and when it leaks it allows water to travel down inside the door and get into the door locks actual whiter and there's an electronic control box back there as well they get water and um and that's where you wind up with your problem\nAnd the I don't see any recall on it or anything but it's basically telling you that it's most likely water intrusion it's actually caused and your problem if it does not electronically unlocking open\nSo and you're in your case I guess a person is going to have to get in there and and get that hatch opened a you know maybe you have to pull a panel down on the inside of the car or something\nUm that you know either there's a problem with the control hid 'em and I don't know I Would have to check to see if there was a re flash for that a lot of times when you get something that goofy it made it there believe it or not there may be a re flash for that to recalibrate it\nUh so that it's more in step you know what I'm saying so it actually gauges up and down\nA little more accurately than what it is there's also an evaporate or a temp sensor in the vehicle that could possibly cause you have a problem with temperature differential like get to where it's just not scaled correctly\nBut I'll tell you what if you want to email me at magic mechanic dot com let me check ts bees on that and see if there is a computer re flash for that it it sounds like

[noise]\nWe're back to Larry Perry the magic mechanical we only have a few minutes left so we're going to do a real rapid fire segment here get to as many calls as we can not even going to bother to say the number right now because if you get in calling yet it's a little too late down from winter haven you're on the air with Larry Perry\nHey Larry I got a two thousand seven Pontiac gee six when I told the gas tank it wants the diet doesn't want to run unless I give it gas if I drive a couple a half a mile or so it starts up and run find after that\nOkay uh what what's happening uh Dale real quick you have an evaporative fuel cell in the white and it sounds like that it's sticking open um it's supposed\nTo close and then you're supposed to allow the fuel to vent basically through a charcoal canister\nA if the if if and when the engines run it'll get venture fuel tank and gas vapors back into the intake system of the engine\nNow that evaporate if you'll sunlight is not closing when you shut the vehicle off what winds up happening is you fill the tank it's forcing gasoline Raul gas right straight into the intake system so when you go to start in the engine back up you've got wet sport gas spelled spark plugs\nAnd so therefore it's going to run a little rough and then\nYou'll be ... you know stall one out and stuff like that until you get it through that transition get the plugs drive back off and then everything will be fine\nSo what's your most likely have is ... fuel cell annoyed that's an operative it's probably not work and a lotta times or the vehicles will actually the turn of check engine light on if the computer actually sense is that that is an operative sometimes it won't set a code just because they're stuck\nYou know as long as it doesn't see an open or a short it won't set the code in the end but they still won't work but the evaporative the so annoyed is going to need to be checked\nAll right thanks so much for your call that was a that was that was Dale over there now we go to mark in lake hail and mark you're on the air with Larry Perry\nMarlene how are you today we're doing great bow\nOut at Ninety nine or ... on a straight through all wheel drive everything works great added about six months but ever since I've had it where that ship in a second air it makes\nIt you would think the transmission is coming up art but it works and then shipped in a third goes right away and it does respond based on and just ate so it back back back back back back back like that wow\nMark are really if you're only getting the noise out of a one year regardless of the load\nA you\nKnow it it it sounds like there's probably a something with a main or counter shift in the transmission and when those two years mesh they're not happy for some reason or other uh you know a piece of metal may have went between them and and and the you know they're they're kind of bonding up a little\nBut whenever they hit second gear 'em you know I I really I don't think we can really blame it on transfer case drive shaft or anything else it's almost going to have to be inside the transmission itself\nI'm you know ... ... I'll leave you with this thought though or if you're planning on having this transmission fixed\nI Would probably ah quit driving it until the transmission come apart so that way you can fix it when you have a standard transmission is making a noise like it if you keep driving that you're going to have a hunk of metal go through there and it's going to take the whole thing out\nAnd if that happens you know you wind up ruining all the chefs inside the transmission ... it's not hardly feasible to rebuild them or repair and because of the expense that goes along with it so sooner it's out and comes apart the less expensive it's probably going to be for the repair mark\nThanks for your call right over to Nick and to various what's up Nick\nHow're you doing a good mix it up I got\nIt oh nine dodge ram Fifteen hundred got about a hundred and forty nine thousand miles on it I'm gonna check engine light on a crank ... code uh-huh I'm burning coal is burned old about to coach a week\nUm got a little bit of a rough island style real bad um but I once a month all come up to a stop light stall out just dies off it starts right back up and drives fine for about another week now replaced the camp sensor and the very old Tommy so annoyed in it and I've even had is that a dealership and they tell me the engine sludge up\nI don't see how a slush up ended up going to college to go through that all that quick but I didn't know what ideas you might have on it\nYeah well ... it's like this um [noise] you know if if you get\nA sludge in a motor ... really create all kinds of havoc um you know I I don't know what the prior lubrication history has been with that engine but um\nYou know you have to consume oil you either have to have piston ring cylinder wall valve God's seal or some type of a problem like that\nI'm ... and if you have sludge in a motor and it gets underneath the in and around the the valve springs and the valve God's seals it'll literally and that that prevents the oil from returning a throughout the head and back down to the engine block\nIf that happens it'll builds up so much oil in the camp cover that it'll literally force oil down between the valve stem and the guide itself\nI'm you know if if they've mentioned [noise] you know I I tell you what I think\nYou should do is if we do a simple test is called a crank case pressure test\nAnd see if you have excessive crank case pressure if you have excessive crank case pressure to be honest we the party's over\nA year you're going to wind up you know fighting a losing battle if the crank case pressure is not excessive in that engine and that means the piston rings a and the cylinders are okay then you may have a crank case vet issue of some sort that may be worth investigating\nBut a crank case pressure test it it's not anything big elaborate her address drawn out it's actually pretty inexpensive and and we do those quite often and it may be if you're in town it may be worth your while to swing by and let us just take a look at it thanks for the call and I think that's going to do\nIt I Am a or a ... like a\nGene especially magic mechanic dot com Mike I've done a little research on

hosted by Mr Tony Caruso president of Orlando luxury pools\nHave you got to pull question you want to hop on board aid for for two two zero zero nine six five and you can tell Tony I I told you to go ahead and get in line how do you like that we'll see you next week [noise]\nEverything in life your body has a value to it we take all these values they come to a constant it\nAnd then same with a swimming pool comes to a concert up twelve point one and anything plus or minus let's talk about if I had a saturation index of mine is for so plus or minus trees in range but mine is for what's going to happen to my pool finish if I'm at a minus point for\nWell it's aggressive water chemistry and the finished can start to action interact a poorly with the water so I'm going to have you elaborate tells our listeners what an edge finish looks like\nIt looks like if it's on a golf course there you go [laughter] so and they kind of have a ... color to um yeah I Know that kind of have a yellowish\nIron is kind of look to it it's a foot hold for what what what's the what's it a foothold for well a metal deposit second second settling those as okay as long as the pool and then you're going can you fix it you know what I tell people I can make it look better so can you fix that Joe\nAbsolutely and you know there was something we say jacks magic is if you're not on a maintenance dose of sequestering and what's liquid sequestering do is they bunch up metals that are in solution in your pool\nAnd they bunch them up and get them out of the water so the filter can capture them otherwise the metals are too fine\nFor the filter to capture and there's always going to be metals getting into the water typically not through city water but there are small amounts of iron in ... in algae decides that get added to the water and what I like to say is like humidity on a summer day in Florida\n... you have the humidity builds up and builds up and eventually that is becomes rain\nWell that raining is standing in a pool when the metals build up and you're pull water and they hit a point of no return\nThat build up of metals become standing on your pool finish and sequestering ths will prevent standing up your poll finish and if you're not on maintenance dose of sequestering weekly it's not a matter of if the polls saying it's a matter of when and the most common thing we hear from people is\nMy pool is staying I Need to re finished my pool not necessarily what we do it jacks magic or in water pull treatments\nWith our products that basically it's a passive treatment against your finish its not aggressive against the finish its a passive treatment against the finish but aggressive against the metal that abstained the surface of your pool\nSo we look at a ... question age is kind of think of it as a metal magnet you know kind of like takes it combined it to a solid and catches it in the filter corral even at a filter will not filter out\nMy crimes that are so small because these are good for about four microns these mental risking get down into microscopic microns that's correct so what happens is is if you if you've got minerals in your water and you start to allow your ph go up or down ... and you had a sequestered agent and you let them the\nIt's come out of balance it comes out a solution right I guess where it goes\nOn you're finished okay so there you go I I'm a big proponent gene okay you go you've probably heard this before you had to pull by any chance I don't know so maybe your friends do and I got well I gotta I gotta drain and asked to wash my pool because it's all stained up mhm elaborate before I let you go on\nThis [laughter] grumbling already died while you know how\nI Would do this and tastefully as faithfully as I can never\nDrain your poll to acid wash it do you agree with me\nIt would be a last resort it'd be beyond and here's why I never ever because I'm a I noticed for sure I have had such wonderful success\nUsing your products\nThat there is no need to do it even if I get aggressive on a zero Akhil entity and a ... a low ph around six\nAnd I loved my pool up with a proper\nAren't cop or a ... a number two which will be copper and scale or aren't in cobalt or an oath to whatever my procedure is I can tell you today we have so much success Ninety percent of the polls that we can make them look I never guarantee somebody I never have a hundred percent return to make it look beautiful hundred percent\nI always tell people I'm Seventy nine percent anything better than\nThat I'm a I'm a hero right right so here's why I Will never during the swimming pool because one if you don't acid wash it correctly ... they're not just loose finishing my pool it's like a skin peel on your face K. and sometimes that skin peeled can burn absolutely okay so what happens when you do the acid wash\nOkay when you take action out of a container it's clear Mm Kay don't put your nose up to it because they don't need to know ... years out of your nose and you know really really put a lot of pressure on your lungs are not good for you but when they asked it turns yellow is pretty much done\nYou know you you're ... so if you pour it acted on concrete it's going to turn yellow it's it's pretty much done it you see it bubbling up and all that but it's pretty much the contacts pretty much dot\nThe problem is if you don't Rob Hurley distribute the acid on your pool finish you're going to eat up I'm a good ten to twenty percent depending on who's doing it now all of a sudden guess what I just did did I not spot it's my pool at your pool and you're short in a life or the finish by years\nOkay so ... what are the things I like to tell my customers is is one your pool finish whether it's a courts finishing don't go to court everybody has a brand name you drink gene that let's say you drink cola mhm do you drink\nPepsi Cola or do you drink Coca Cola right do you drink RC Cola like kind of like band aid is actually a brand new well what'd you clean it All right see coal haven't wow didn't think there are seeing your last year around [laughter]\nOkay but yeah ... is a brand name ... is a brand name right but we always refer to a tissue or Kleenex right right yeah we all referred to as an a cotton swabs in air swat which may be a Q tip right over that you were saying why there's so many of them out there is lots of different finishes out there\nBut I could tell you that there's not a manufacturer on the market today unless you tell me different you probably won't because we're on the air\nThat formulate to finish to fail correct\n... here's my opinion I I had to ask your opinion before I give you my how long should have courts finish last in a pool\nProperly taken care of five years\nNo ours I'd say Fifteen twenty maybe Twenty years maybe ... typically Fifteen Years is what I see\nOkay having a pebble finish about the same I say fifty
