asking um now that this is in the hands of the Senate comes down to five people and other Republican side well they got senator snowflake anybody want to predict what he's going to do I have no predictions I don't think he knows what he's going to do except that he's enjoying the notoriety the interviews\nHeaded to the northeast maybe thinking fantasizing in his\nIn his mind and his ego is telling them you should run for president he's the guy and so I don't know what he's going to do I don't know what Susan Collins of Maine is going to do I don't know what Lisa Murkowski is going to do\nI don't think any Democrats break\nUnless they know this is going down in defeat I'm Sorry unless it's going to pass\nIf ... if Joe Manchin if he sees Collins and Murkowski\nVoting for cabinet and he'll go vote for capital St properly with Heidi Heitkamp I'm Joe Donnelly already said no who knows if he changes his mind but he's on record saying he's not going to do it [noise]\nUm so we'll see and you know everyone's trying to make a big deal the president was laying out the case about what is you know what we now know fact should matter in this particular case and in the case of any obligation\nNow I Want to get into what this all means I'll get into that at the bottom of the hour a little bit but what we do know now is that obviously all the people that said we believe her long before we knew really anything about it\nThose that rush to judgment eliminated all due process all presumption of innocence that is the Democratic party today forgetting that of course they were against judge Kavanaugh before he ever got an ounce anyway and it didn't matter who Donald Trump\nNominated to the U.S Supreme Court they were going to be against but Democrats not caring about\nYour rights is fundamental rights that have made this a stronger country actually think the New York times by moving onto a Fifteen page a tax expos AA on Donald Trump's father and well he might have gifted son money years ago when he was eight and\nTherefore he got as well from his father I mean it's it's totally seems to me that they moved on from any chance of covering the cabin all case 'cause it probably already done\nWith the FBI investigation wrapped up wrapping up and now handing hand he goes over to the Senate I Want the American people to have a right to see this I think the American people now invested in this and I think the American people have a right to know for sure what the FBI came up with\nRemember they're not going to make conclusions they're not gonna make recommendations they're just going to say probably what the Senate investigative committee and found out already\nThat they in the case of professor Ford for example she didn't remember date a day of the week a location how she got to or from the location where the alleged crime took place she mentioned four witnesses for people that were at the event no corroborating evidence of any kind\nAnd no one backing up her story including the one person that she placed in the room during the alleged attack and Democrats you know they they thought this was enough to initiate yet another FBI background check and you know so that was wrapping up in the mainstream media they've already made up their minds in fact in\nYou know then we learned about this Ramirez in the New York times couldn't even print that story because when they called dozens of people they found out this Ramirez was actually\nNo she didn't know herself if it was\nProfessor I'm Sorry if it was judge Kavanaugh because she was asking former yell classmates I don't fully or what do you remember I'm not sure it was him\nKnow that kind of puts that case to rest and on top of the other things that she admitted that she had gaps in her memory and that she had been in ... rather quickly that that particular event\nAnd the third claim the most outrageous claim from this woman named Julie sweat Nick represented by the anti Trump to sell it Mike eleven Ninety alleging that capital was involved in the cereal trucking almost on a weekly basis so she says she went to ten of these parties but as you said almost on a weekend basis\nWhat happened where young boys and these prep schools would be drugging young girls teenage girls and lining up in the halls and raping them and then of course she gave for names to\nNBC News and well NBC News didn't find one person to back up a story one of the names was dead another name was somebody who said I have no idea who this person is and they still ran the story and then of course backtracking on a on a variety of issues significant issues\nOf the story that she just released a week a week prior\nHow does that become news\nAnd yet that is what the media now does they were perfectly happy airing that interview and now she's saying well well they weren't exactly wind up in the hall um well he was in ... capital I saw him near the punch bowl and he was given out red solo cups too people\nThat's not drug in girls on a nearly weekend basis and lining up in the halls to gang raped women\nYoung girls and you'd have to believe that if that happened that regularly and was that well known there would be some cooperation that somebody would have told at the time or a law enforcement official\nA teacher a parent that this was happening or this happened or their drug in kids and and then lining up to rape young girls\nAnd it's gotten so absurd now that you have the senator from Hawaii wanting to investigate the ice throwing incident Brett Kavanaugh apparently through ice in a bar when he was in college\nPolice documents that show that Brett Kavanaugh true ice in someone's face during a bar fight when he was in college do you feel that that is in any way to qualify for someone within a Supreme Court [noise]\nJuly we need and has the Haitian because there are a lot of allegations as far as really are about how he behaves finance truck\n[noise] All right so we're at the end of this process now it's interesting that the Senator Grassley in a written declaration released late last night that we got a hold of at the Fox news channel\nAn ex boyfriend of professor Ford's uh was the California professor accusing Brett Kavanaugh on that particular case anyway directly contradicting her testimony under oath last week that she had never help anyone prepare for a polygraph examination\nFormer boyfriend whose name was redacted in the declaration also said the forward\nNeither mentioned ... mentioned that she was a victim of sexual misconduct during the time that they were dating from around Ninety two to Ninety eight and he said that he saw for going to great lengths to help a woman that he believed was a lifelong best friend prepare for a potential polygraph test\nAnd he added that the woman I had been interviewing for jobs with the FBI and the U.S attorney's office in further claimed afford never voice any fear of flying even while aboard a propeller plane that they were on\nSeemingly having no problem living in a very small five hundred square foot apartment and services that look\nThese are the small details to me I and I some of you may think this was all significant and at the end of the day\nShe said there were four people that could corroborate her story none of them\nCan corroborate her story most don't remember any party like this and the one eye witness that she placed in the room at the time of the alleged assault said it didn't happen so at that point you've got to presume somebody's innocent\nYou don't know the place you don't know the time you have a date you don't have a location is nothing that the FBI can do except take your statement and assuming that the poor people that have already been interviewed again under penalty of a felony\nYou got to assume that they didn't commit perjury and commit a felony when the FBI came back to asked the same questions\nAnd if they did then okay that would be a pretty big deal there is no indication up to now\nBased on reporting that has come out on all the people that have been spoken to a lot of people are making a big deal over the fact well they haven't spoken to professor Ford but I mean professor Ford is now told their story multiple times and I've got to believe and assume that they're\nThey're thinking that well her story hasn't changed you just said it last week before the Senate Judiciary committee um oh it's just I I just there's there's so much at stake I Want to get into what this all means\nBecause what it means matters you know at the end of the day what this means for the country for the future of the country all of that matter\nLindsey Graham is saying Clinton sex accuses were treated a hell of a lot worse than professor forward and I I think the the Republicans held the actually did something well I think they handled it with the level of seriousness\nA topic like this deserves and we'll see what happens in the next couple of days and who's going to vote which way\nA democratic protesters by the way of solving a GOP congressmen in his Capitol office\nApparently congressman Andy Harris assaulted by protesters Tuesday Afternoon they they're going to have to start kicking people out of ... of these Senate buildings in ... congressional offices because I'm going to somebody's gonna get hurt 'em and I'm all for free speech\nBut you ought to be able to walk out your door and not get surrounded by groups of people screaming at you\nIf you represent in the country\nMitch McConnell firing back at it an army of out of control you know democratic protesters threatening and trying to intimidate him and other Republican senators and so we'll see what that means from his vantage point uh we also have

is in the next thirty four days what do we see happening you know five weeks from yesterday you're going to tune into TV and you're going to get results from a midterm election\nNow the left will either be happy because of the announcement Nancy Pelosi will be the next speaker of the house or Chuck Schumer is going to be the next Senate majority leader and Maxine Waters will share her committee impeach forty five reclaiming all the time she ever wanted\nAnd that's what's at stake in this election\nNow it looks like the Democrats Hail Mary pass with Kavanaugh's now backfiring and you look at\nYou know it's ... if you go back forty nine percent of voters back the Democratic party forty two percent Republicans by the way I Can't remember elections where Republicans Latin generic ballot just to give you some historical context\nBut in mid September it was fifty two thirty eight and I know Nancy Pelosi seems confident she's out there I'm going to be the next speaker\nWell you don't get to decide that it's actually in the hands of the American people\nNow we can't make you vote but we can only tell you what's gonna happen if in fact the Democrats win and what's gonna happen is very basic fundamental and simple\nIs they will have a list non stop investigations Kavanaugh gets through they want to impeach Kavanaugh they want to impeach the president they want to investigate all things president\nWhat do you think this Fifteen page expos they in the New York times is all about number one\nThey've they figure it out the Kavanaugh debate is over so now they're moving on to

o'clock a new study six point five W db oh we do have some breaking news this afternoon the White House says President Trump is coming to Orlando next\nThe reason I did what I did is because I wanted to let the country you know\nThat if this is the new normal got help the next person\nWho follows Brett Kavanaugh\nI that was Lindsey Graham has been very powerful all throughout these hearings\nAnd he had a moment last week during those hearings were bred cabin on Dick Durbin wanting is FBI investigate ... alright they've had the FBI investigation now we know that we can have an up or down vote in the Senate so who's going to vote yes and who's going to vote no because we have one party\nThat in every single case even though there is no cooperation\nEven though facts on the ground continue to shift didn't change where we don't know the data location people that are supposedly eyewitnesses to alleged\nActs of violence say it didn't happen and the stories change about well they're putting drugs in the in the punch and boys are lining up almost on a weekly weekend basis to rape girls winding up in the halls while he was around the punch bowl when he gave out some red solo cups\nThat's what that evolved into you know at what point is there no shame here at what point do we not understand how deeply dangerous this is for every American because we're throwing due process and the presumption of innocence literally out the window\nNewt Gingrich is with us a former speaker of the house with thirty four days away from an election best selling book Trump's America the truth about our nation's great comeback well I guess that's on the ballot and thirty four days how are you\nDoing well and I think you know you can't have shame if you're only interest is Rob power and that's what we've seen a Dianne Feinstein deliberately holding the letter was about raw power\nOf the fact that you have a democratic senator who says if you're for Kevin all your complicit with evil raw power or the kind of smearing dishonest questions and accusations that we've seen that raw power\nAnd that is what this election is about this election will decide what kind of country we are\nToo about how ... how many Americans are really comfortable with this kind of character assassination dishonesty an all out effort to destroy decent people and I think that's going to be in that that is truly on the ballot even if it's not on the ballot because all of us have now seen\nRight there on television and editing without distortion we've seen how bad these people are\nWell I just you know on a level that we've never seen before and I guess it really comes down there are five people but I think it really two of the Democrats would consider voting\nFor judge Kavanaugh they're lonely do it I Believe if in fact there's enough Republicans to get them over the finish line but it comes down to Susan Collins that comes down to Lisa Murkowski and\nSenator Jeff snowflake who is on his I Want to be president trip to New England as we get most of the week and his media tour which is second to none so how does this end up\nWell I mean I think in the short run that\nI I'm an optimist I think that the the basic decency\nA judge Kevin all of his family ah the sense that most Americans have that he has been a smeared and treated with a vicious personal attack\nAll those things I think means that the Susan Collins who what was going to vote yes and he's going to be confirmed probably by Monday or Tuesday Wednesday and he'll be on the court but the deeper underlying lesson that all of us should learn\nAbout who these people are how they operate how truly dishonest and vicious they are I Hope to that stage for very long time\nLet me ask you what thirty four days out of an election you were there as a strategist when Reagan became president but the first time in forty years you ran on something and you got the entire caucus of Republicans house and Senate to agree to nationalize an election and make\nPromises to America you called the contract with America\nAnd that you would you promised you would vote\nOn ten specific items in the first hundred days of which you did accomplish that pass and Republicans for the most part with a few bumps pickups in the road\nHave been in power since um how to Republicans now I think the anger of the bases beyond anything I've seen in recent years rightly so over what's going on with the Kavanaugh hearings and the Democrats\nDemocrats don't have a vision for the future we had I ate horrible years of Obama we've had two very successful years of President Trump what is the pitch what what should the Congress men and women and senators be saying\nWell first of all the president has done a great job he watches various trips such as Mississippi will be in Minnesota\nAnd he's laying out the case that if you want results you have a tune called Republicans\nAnd if you want resistance you've got a team called Democrats\nAnd he's been laying up and you see it in the numbers than people realize the lowest unemployment for African Americans in history lowest unemployment for Latinos a continuous economic growth many good things that are happening and I think the president has set the stage now to pit in spreading these last five weeks\nTelling us what's coming next\nWe've got this much damage you know ... I loved the vice President Pence sort of like you said America's coming back you know what I'm saying we're back yet because we're not\nPush a lot of work to do but we're coming back\nAnd now you have a chance for the president's leadership\nAnd I think this will actually be about which kind of America do you want us to be\nDo you want us to keep coming back keep creating jobs do you want us to control the border to save our children from image Thirteen gangs professional and promote people that are you prepared to be part of a team to one's\nConstitutional judges not radicals I think we got campaign could be stunningly successful and we can have as much fun when election night as we head into thousands of\nI mean I hear optimism in you that I look I'm going to be honest I don't quite share it I'm not there with you I think it can happen I Believe it's winnable I Believe the Republicans can keep the house I think that Rick Scott to win the Senate in Florida\nEyewitness news meteorologist Seventy Dionne tracking the warm and mainly dry conditions around central Florida Antoni\nMarino some sun eighty eight downtown Atlanta we have eighty seven exam\nContinuous coverage Senate majority leader Mitch McConnell this morning\nOnce again accusing Democrats of using the accusations against Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh as a delay tactic a literal\nMudslide lots lots of wild uncorroborated accusations has literally poured out\nEach more outlandish\nThan the law the FBI is expected to complete its background investigation into sexual into the sexual misconduct allegations against capital as early as today\nPrivate sector jobs are surging this morning's ATP jobs report shows the economy and a two hundred thirty thousand private payroll jobs last month that's the most in seven months of the big monthly jobs report from the Labor Department will be out on friday morning\nOn Wall street green numbers across the board the Dow at fifty four NASDAQ up twenty six and the five hundred up just two points on the session one of two murder trials were cop killer Markey Lloyd now set for may he'll be tried for the deaths of his ex girlfriend and their unborn child before being tried\nFor killing police lieutenants Debra Clayton for thirty two at news maybe six point five WTO\nUnlike other jewelry stores and international diamond center nobody paid on commission we don't believe in the commission structure that's how I D C owner Keith leclaire I don't want\nMy people go look at you when you walk in the door and they see a dollar sign and how much am I going to get this person for I don't want my customers to be gotten I Want my customers to be protected\nThat's why I Do you see the diamond experts will show you the insides secrets of the jewelry business and teach you how to buy like a dealer by it's not about selling gets about helping\nIf you give the consumer the quality product and you put it in front of 'em you explain that to him and you understand what they're looking for and you try to help them make the best position what are you at a so you don't have to solve anything dining we'll talk for ...\nInternational diamonds or transparency and honesty\nCome first I Want you to be protected I Want you to make sure you're getting what you pay for it it's a commitment from our family it's our blood it's our heart behind it is our trust it's our integrity is covered the difference that international diamond center with five convenient Orlando location you are going to get the best quality diamond for the best price period [noise]\nHello this is Joe ... here a few quick divorce tips we provide our clients sometimes email us the best way to communicate with your wife during the divorce it's efficient it creates a record and it avoids ugly scenes on the other hand because you're on the record your comments must be tactful unreasonable\nAssume your e mails we'll be exhibits at trial\nRemember your goal throughout the process is projecting the image of common sense in good faith\nThe judge should understand that your wife is the source of this needless litigation\nYou're the good guy the voice of reason a related point be cooperative where you can show flexibility regarding non essential issues judges noticed this besides save your attorney fees for what's important by the way unless you're in Missouri or Illinois I'm not licensed in your state but that's OK are attorneys in your state or\nContact Cordell in Cordell to schedule it a point where it was one of our firms Orlando area attorneys on line at Cornell Cornell dot com\nGo down in ...

I saw him getting rent solo cups quite a few girls during that time frame I saw him around the punch\nBowl or the punch container is I don't know why he did but I find by their friends who remember

people that know about that part of\nThis morning sweating it provided for names of friends she says went to the parties with her one of them said he does not recall a Julie sweating it another of the friends she named is deceased we've reached out to the other two it hasn't turned back\nSo if you cannot get a single person given to you named given to you that would corroborate their story\nTo actually corroborate the story and you don't have it and you see a pattern of of backtracking and shifting and changing not not in significant facts but the most significant facts\nRemember the story was about almost on a weekend basis and I'd been to ten of these parties myself where young girls were drugged and boys lying\nThe the hall so they could gang rape them\nWell um he gave out red solo cups and I saw him at a party I don't know if he did anything to the punch\nUm this is so reckless irresponsible NBC how they would ever dare run this is beyond any comprehension I have now if they had confirmation\nIf they had witnesses\nIf there wasn't a changing shifting\nStory if there wasn't traumatic backtracking they might then have some legitimate reason to air this\nBut because they want what the Democrats want which is the smearing of judge Kavanaugh to continue well they had to air it but even they airing of it made them look really really pathetic\nIt's not fair there are ... and I'll tell you the other thing\nThere are victims people I Know in my life\nOf sexual abuse I Know there's evil in the world I wrote a whole book about evil people that would ever drug rape or girl are evil these people are predators\nThey need to get off our streets but you've gotta have some collaboration to these things\nAnd it just comes out of Seventeen Days ago just on the eve of the confirmation vote for judge Kavanaugh and if you go issue by issue case by case you know it it comes down to do we believe in the presumption of innocence due process\nAnd simple common sense or do we believe in guilt by accusations\nBecause in each case there hasn't been any corroborating evidence at all in each case what you see is a lot of smearing a lot of smoke a lot of blood shunning\nBut no evidence you know in every single one of these cases they're shifting narratives and stories Kaylee Macedonia is with us author\nAir conditioning plumbing and electrical\n... is the right choice for

really good guy by the name of Lin wood uh he got after a lot of media companies I Know the Duke lacrosse kids oh they went after a lot of people after that smear job\nUh I Know what's happening to UBA rape case I guess that's that's following through every one of these cases though and then add to it a Ferguson, Missouri Trayvon George Zimmerman Cambridge police\nFreddie Gray Baltimore there's a collective left wing rush to judgment no presumption of innocence\nAnd they get proven wrong over and over again and media companies get suited lose over and over again and they keep making the same mistakes I guess the problem with the president he's the president he can't sue for slander\nWell it's right in and sadly neither can judge Kavanaugh I Believe the same reason we use the public figure uh so I don't believe it's going to be able to legally go down that road but this is what they do this is who they are in Sean I Want to see is the last couple of days you have done a fabulous job wanting out the hypocrisy here [noise]\nUm I mean if if we're going to have a serious conversation about breaking in high school and drugs in high school and adult conduct of a domestic violence on your have incumbent democratic\nMembers of the Senate with court records well out there well discuss uh and and and suddenly this is no longer part of the conversation or can't be discussed I mean this is crazy this is crazy I mean I think they've gone down the road here that they are going to regret long term\nBecause every Democrat I I don't I don't think so because it's sort of like when Harry Reid lied about Mitt Romney had to pay taxes in ten years\nAnd then he was asked after the election if he cared about lying about Mitt Romney the way there is no we won the election what's the difference and the ... the means providing the left so believes conservatives are evil that they feel justified in whatever it is that they say that's right you know but the problem is here this is so serious an allegation\nAnd you know I'm not the biggest fan of the Republican Party I'm not a Republican I've been very critical when they're weak in timid and stupid and I would say they have handled this what the appropriate amount of serious this\nThey have balance what is a fair system they've given every possibility shadow of a doubt\nAnd now it's time to vote\nNow the question is Kelly where Susan Collins where's Lisa Murkowski and we're just not going to vote\nEt cetera and it comes down to the three I mean Mitch McConnell I had been a real warrior and pushing for a look at Germany Grassley knock on the Internet and I think that in a crap\nYou're exactly right it would have been taken to a week ago if we would have had like ... or ... I think he can hear that we might not arrow in the end and I think that not because I had any faith and Democrat\nUp because they have political calculation didn't mind you have your mansion looking at a state or\nThirty percent margin that people are getting out what the ... confirmed by thirty margin that people have North Dakota once the Kavanaugh confirmed it would be political suicide\nOr hiking or mansion or Donnelly could not vote for that nominee them better get out and people get their humor lack God but they might do it out of their own political okay\nWell that's exactly right\nWell I mean yeah I mean high camp and and mentioned but I think\nI don't think they go that way a less Collins and Murkowski or a combination of of Collins an end flake or or Murkowski inflate once the Republicans have the vote then they'll have the freedom to go and I don't think the Democratic leadership because of of flying hoot about their\nConstituents in West Virginia Florida North Dakota Indiana Missouri because\nIf they did they would say vote your conscience I mean Jeff Flake the hero of the Democratic party why because he admits season on principle man that would never vote the way he really felt because he's only doing this because he's he's lifted up the burden of having to face the horrible voters they get\nI mean that was a horrible admission on sixty minutes\nYeah yeah and I I mean [laughter] don't\nGet real does wrong principle is a man that stands on values\nAnd it ... the man who wrote a book and the king Barry Goldwater the conscience of the conservative ... and it you know if he is then now we have a moment to stand up\nHe thinks he's going to be president let me just first to tell Jeff Flake Jeff\nDelusion that you are delusional you will never\nBe the president of the United states not in my lifetime All right I think you both for being with us he couldn't get their teen votes I mean he's like at nine percent of his own state race it off to the northeast\nNew Hampshire not interested in Jeff Flake and neither is Iowa\nI I mean so out of touch and nobody's interested in the guy that says no I'm only voting this way 'cause I don't have to face the voters again also every other vote was because you wanted to get reelected and you didn't care about what principles were involved in a particular vote\nRight quick a break we'll come back coming up we're Victoria Toensing and Joe diGenova as we continue from our nation's capital Washington D.

I was with the Senate intelligence committee and we got such far ranging\nBizarre accusations about Casey\nCasey met me in a park and held me up with a gun or do tasty took all my stocks and sold them kept the money for himself I mean they were just radically out of a wild and that happens all the time in these investigations and you know what we didn't make any of the public and even the Democrats back then\nDid not make them public and yet we have Kamala Harris I'm I'm told she's a lawyer she was the attorney general is that California is she supposed to know due process she released an anonymous Jane Doe\nAccusation that's how the person signed it about Brett Kavanaugh committing some lurid sex act\nIs there no decorum left in the U.S Senate anymore aren't going to get sanctioned her in any way oh Alan Dershowitz was saying that\nThe case of Julie sweating neck in particular that if in fact she you know she made the statements and they're probably falls that he would want a full complete investigation into perjury allegations um\nYou know Joe I I I don't know what the law enforcement should do I do know this I Know that we have now we examined every single case\nIn every case there is no corroboration in every case there is multiple inconsistencies in the last case Julie sweating like there are so many inconsistencies in his mind numbing that NBC would ever air that interview but they are there any way\nThe eyewitnesses are the witnesses she mentioned one is dead one doesn't even know who she is and they can't get an answer from the other two and now the last minute 'cause they're desperate now they want the FBI investigating ice throwing incidents in high school\nYeah well I think um what has happened with Julie sweating it is that the Senate committee after the confirmation vote occurs\nNeeds to make a criminal referral\nTo the Justice Department or the U.S attorney for the district of Columbia to investigate her for obstruction of a congressional proceedings by submitting false affidavits and for perjury is written testimony very easy to investigate and it has to be done in order to send a signal\nTo everybody out there that you cannot simply make false statements to a congressional committee in a confirmation process to get yourself publicity is very very important that Mitt sweating it\nBe investigated by a federal grand jury\nTo act as a deterrent against others from making false accusations there is no substantiate ... for her story there is no substantial issues permits Ramirez story and I just want to say something that I Know\nUh probably showing you don't agree with she has repeatedly lied him like her lawyers did not tell her that the committee was willing to come to California to interview her that is alive for lawyers did tell her that no good lawyer would never community\nShow I got I got to tell you I don't think they told her if you remember in that moment\nWhen professor Ford was asked when I forgot maybe it was Lindsey Graham who or whoever it was said we offered to go to maybe some of the grass I think Senator Grassley and then\nShe said oh I there was genuine surprise that remember Dianne Feinstein was working behind the scenes to get a radical left wing activist to resist there as a lawyer this is Deborah cats\nNever catch by the way who said well Paula Jones only spend ten or twelve minutes with with Bill Clinton it wasn't a big deal that wouldn't constitute sexual harassment in the workplace\nAnd also defended in in the case of Al Franken but I ... I saw genuine shocking surprise and she goes well ... I didn't know that but that was very nice do you if you offered that I didn't know why should\nThey should he referred to the D.C bar then for violation of the professional world\nI I may I may very well come to conclude that eventually and I'm perfectly happy to accept that I can buy that and I'll tell you something that really bothers me about her story and as an old prosecutor who tried sex crimes cases\nHere's the one thing about her story besides everything else we talked about that doesn't make any sense any victim in a situation like that goes to where people are for safety now why is her story not include her going to those people\nBecause if she had done that if she ... literally if if what she says the Kurds and if she had gone to those people get what they would have remembered that in order for her to have a story that holds up\nWithout anybody knowing about it she had to leave the house\nI don't know though and look maybe you know 'cause we're talking about we all know that there are real evil predators there are people that do murder\nAnd rape innocent people there are people that will drug and rape people I eat look at the bill Cosby case\nWe know that and and this is why I think to the Republicans credit they took these allegations in charges seriously\nThey handled it professionally they afford it every combination which was the right thing to do\nBut for the Democrats they just they just now have pushed this so far\nInto it it ... into any allegation no matter how many inconsistencies do matter no evidence no matter no cooperation whatsoever and we saw that they hated the guy from the beginning\nI I don't I don't know what I don't know what victims remember or don't remember Joe and I don't know what how they act to react I Would assume was probably ... people react differently like you go to a funeral some people are crying some ...\nI was I was perfectly happy to accept anything that she had to say and I listened to
