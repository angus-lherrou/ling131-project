here on the United states point five WD be a part of our asked the experts weekend we cruised right along and it had back right to the bowl mine's Richard calling in from palm may well come onto the show Richard what's your question front Andrea\nAndrea thank you um I have a question about by a computer a\nFinancial access to a cattle ... um I\nHave a my password file on a USB stick have a lot of different passwords all their mother she has a white one windows machine it's five plus years old I have remote access turned off I never had a dog um so when I'm going to say for example I Want to access my credit card file\nOr like credit card website and look at like ... or history or whatever I'll flip my speech they can open my password file 'em and that are removed\nThe USB stick so that the file as open on the computer but the USB stick has been removed battle opened up to us or Firefox or call fat I'll go to my credit card website or bank website or even Amazon or whatever it is that I go to ... user i._d. and passwords and the file and um\nI have the the website um [noise] a name for the for the credit card companies complain a feeling the strain of the credit card in the past were filed and back it's it's a\nPreview face equate and um after some random times something he brings the password file full so it can be seen all the strange um so it is clearly being done by someone or something so that you see my password file or see them maybe\nTo file or do you like a screen capture and then send it out to some buddy later\nI'm so you know I kind of stuff with it and if it's a lot of times I'll just chase password immediately after that I was just to how best there but is that some kind of viruses doing it what what's happening to me it's clearly clearly something is\nBringing the file forward so he said well it might not necessarily\nBe that the that the file itself as being brought over intentionally oftentimes what can happen is when programs take different focus from another like say you get a pop up for a job up there something that can take the focus their neck and learn to be in your case\nThat may be off as just trying to do a script or a task or even an update and that might be brained a process back forward as the active process a sneak as a some sort of input relate to the program itself\nI'm so one thing I Would probably recommend doing if you're concerned about the possibility of a security breach on your system I can always go and run a a an anti virus program ran full scam with it\nI'm like one scare that we uh ... that we use a quite a bit it's a free version of Mao whereby and that's usually pretty decent on demand scanner\nAnd it's usually recommend it to use a good solid secondary anti virus that doesn't run in real time uh that you can use to see if there's something on there that your primary anti virus might have missed\n... or you can also do is if you want to bring it by our store um again that's a refreshing peers at eight twenty each state route for three four in long would\nDefinitely be worth to take the drive and then on Tuesdays we do are free to know Tuesday so in addition to doing our diagnostics um if it turns out that a a might as well just need some down maintenance or we can also verify if there is indeed in fact some sort of virus on there or not and uh\nUm I one thing I Would probably suggest and because even if you take the flash drive stick out\nWhen that follows open that file is loaded into the computer's memory and so if you were to get a virus while that follows open that even with the flash and not plugged in that information still could potentially be compromised\nAnd I never usually recommend having passwords saved up on the computer and a plain text format\nUh one thing you can do is that you can have the password said in the browser where of fills in an encrypted manner or they're also plug ins like last past or other password manager software that you can do that saves the password in my um I can you can just automatically log into your accounts by using a master password Kee\nAh that indicates a\nUm but ah definitely ah keeping passwords in plain text format even if it's nice we stayed on the computer if the files opened it still out there so I Would recommend a possibly using it a different methodology when it comes to that type of information\nAnd it's not nearly as expensive as you would think\nAnd it but it does require some attention a little bit of a medical background and it takes a lot of self control so\nWe're going to beginning the first week of November have this stuff available fulltime so we're going to invite people in you know if you're afraid um if the doctor's office and heck knows I sure am you know I it's [laughter] you know it's hard for me to be really are overly critical of folks when they see the doctor were frequently than I Do\nBut what we're gonna do beginning the first week of November is open the office up and so if you want to come in and just look is over\nSo to speak of getting a level of comfort ... you'll see whether or not we are who we say we are all your human hearing right now\nIs the voice you don't really know okay I wouldn't really know okay and and what do you believe what do you believe it's a really good idea to come in and start to to to check things out\nAs the season starts to progress it's going to start getting busier okay this is not just true it with with our office but with all officers that starts to go nuts by mid December and then everybody leaves town between Christmas and New Years that is the way that it works here you are going to want to get on board with weight control\nBut for the holidays this was when you want to get the insulin levels down this is when you want to get the blood sugars down and you want to start the process why\nBecause when you're using a weight loss regimen it actually is a mild to moderate least strong uh interactive what does this mean that's an appetite suppressant\nSo why wait until you're a size or to bigger than you should be an inch or two larger and the waste before you take action it makes no sense if this were a roof we're talking about you wouldn't wait until the plaster comes down you wouldn't wait until black mold emerges through your electrical outlets before you do something about it\nSo this year we're going to try something different whether it's successful or not remains to be seen but at least I Will give it the girl fashion college try as they used to say\nThere you go and if you do want to stop by that often check it out but you can go Nineteen Seventeen boat circle that's location Longwood, Florida just stop by for Nineteen Seventeen\nBoots circle if you want to call in scheduled appointment for seven six seven nine and three three three seven four seven six seven nine three three three Seventy and open Monday Ruth or you know or you can just drop in yeah dropping well I I gave them the Israelis were\nYou know if you're if you're used to a former right next to the construction\nMess [laughter] right next to the construction that's with everything was direction lever the construction yeah it'll be right there [laughter] let's wait no more time and head of the phone lines here wealth is calling from enterprise multiple come out of the show what's your question for Dr David client\nConduct aligned ah I had a couple of bumps on my forearm and one just recently turned hard or turn blue alright and had a small red ... which is now getting bigger this week and a course their research it's\nLooking like melanoma and stuff so I I don't know how serious it is with the rain getting bigger\nParts of it could could be you could throw you off a little bit typically with melanoma you'll see a ridge okay so there's almost like an elevation doesn't have to happen but it frequently does and it's almost like if you're having a a a a brush burn\nYou know not not not a brush burden on your on your on your face or your arms butter butter out in the brush okay where things started to burn on the way out things tend to be the greatest actions on the edges\nBut a ring around it suggested maybe an insect type issue now did you have you been bitten already been out in a place where you could have been bitten by a spider take anything like that recently\nWho had been doing yard work but you know it just right on the spot and like scaly on top and it's like a perfect circle around it you know\nThings that that can happen here okay you can see the kind of thing although I rather doubt that you're going to have a brown recluse spider bite why 'cause you sound too good\nUsually when people come in with the with a brown recluse spider bite you know you'll see the blue areas actually that have gang green you know and it starts to expand okay and the red laying around ... or a theme of as what they call it\nAnd you would be seeking medical attention by now\nIf you have a little blue areas that's just essentially an area of the corrosive that's more consistent with certain wasps aunts and oddly enough other spiders can do it up with a different type of toxin that can cause this\nYou know on the other hand you bring up a good point melanoma can happen you'll see it in in some exposed areas that's not the general presentation for melanoma\nStill should be checked out you're you're exactly right it's a whole lot safer and have these things in a bottle and has to leave them on your arm the fact that you've got two of them\nOkay suggest more than it may be a bite\nOkay if that's the case you sometimes still have to treat these things because they're slow growing bacteria that can emerge and these things as well there's one that I've seen I think three cases in thirty some years called ... sports or ex shaky I is a is a fungus that can present like this you get hit by a rose Stuart\nOkay around here can be Monday via ... it could be any number of thorny type\nA brochure that matter ... type plants\nYou know they you know it's just one of those sorts of things these fungi exist on the thorns you get nailed by it and then pretty soon the fungus starts to grow so ... is a possibility as well so what I Would be inclined to do if you would be to get seen okay\nBut look for somebody that has a pretty uh let's let's just say I'm a fairly good feeling for infectious disease of the skin\nOkay who might that be a good dermatologist somebody with some experience should be able to pick this up but certainly somebody with infectious disease background why because again the folks that I've seen the three with sports wrecks and they made it through a number of dermatologist before you know it was like wait a second guys you guys for got to look at fungal infections\nTuberculosis infections can do it\nOkay it's kind of interesting there's there's something called aquarium keepers a hands recording paper saw some that can do this okay and it's a slow growing bacterium\nSo thinking in terms of infectious diseases very difficult to go wrong but the way that you're going to cost yourself big is by forgetting Millan ... or ... Milner sarcoma is actually what it should be called melanoma is what it is it's generally called that's your question well\nYes but the the bumps have been there for years\nThey've been there for years okay the likelihood of a bear hard bumps okay then ... or ... it'd\nBe a simple and I would have called inclusion says that can happen it could also be a foreign body you know I've seen decades later things like small stones come out of these things you know it's funny you mention that 'cause I was on bouncing down the street off my road bike and you'll end up pulling swell rode a debris out of their small piece of the glass\nSo even still it wouldn't be a bad idea to to remove him and see exactly what's going on but the likelihood of a big melanoma if it's been there for years is very very small you said you assemble lived me right now thank you\n[laughter] what do you have a good one\nFor you to shape that call Walter sounded lived as well ... clinically I clinically ill items

P. A. and another one called H. T. G.\nBecause auto immune thyroid disease can make delivered do this and said everything crazy so the patients that have had in the past rap scene triglycerides and cholesterol at these levels it's

twice a day you don't you don't take you don't need more than two per day of the Berger about a couple of reasons one burger much not cheap okay the bird brings a whole lot less expensive I prefer to let that carry the weight of a\nThird thing is a freebie public's called met foreman\nMet Forman they give it away for free okay five hundred milligrams ER capsules you start with one twice a day when you go to in the morning\nOne in the evening along a then you move it up to two twice a day what does that do it lowers the triglycerides and the insulin together as well as the blood sugar\nThat usually is the way these things go what else can you take the lower the cholesterol easy you take folic acid high dose five thousand micrograms daily because it protects the arteries from the cholesterol itself\nFish oil the appropriate does there's Fifteen hundred milligrams of the combined a PHD ha daily that is necessary as well to lower the cholesterol\nLast but not least of one called ... and they see will cause you to start ... the the cholesterol Esther ... in the in the bio and then it goes out through the GI tracked so with that you would take a non soluble or an insoluble fiber\nAnd then you'll start screening the cholesterol brings everything down fairly quickly it is a slick way to get it done okay when you have cholesterol triglycerides that high the Staten rarely touch it you know you can be taken those things at what is it there's a lot of levels down by by twenty percent maybe she needs to bring it down by about Ninety percent\nYou know because that's way way too high you want to see ... really matter that you have with her I Would be delighted if there are two fifty to two eighty okay once they start getting into three four hundred range I start to sweat is a little bit and then I get more aggressive in the seven hundreds you know you got to pull the stops there's another thing called ...\nAn old using ... if the blood sugars are high or if the insulin levels are higher the dose it's there's a grand twice a day but I Would give her started as I did above I Would not called the protocol okay 'cause when when you deviate from a protocol that's actually badly enough malpractice under a Florida State law so when you start writing protocols you'd better follow them\nWell guess what okay no no decent doctors can sit back and and and take a crayon and filled within the lines that doesn't work that way because no two people are the same so you don't want to put yourself put limits on your practice by calling any single protocol\nYou can call it seemed more you can go to Henry just don't call it a political answer your question\nAnd answer like clash and that's great I Will I heard that information then\nYou can write quickly get our God Bless you [laughter]\nWell in any event so but it but it brings up a brilliant question okay is what harm is it to have an elevated cholesterol okay and the answer is it really doesn't cause any harm at all okay under most circumstances if you protect the\nInner lining of the artery from the cholesterol itself and the way that you do that typically it was ... fish oil and gas and the combination is awesome try it's not it's not expensive but anybody can tolerate it put them ... you get a decent high quality product\nThey're having another hour of information wind by right here anything to lose the stages of life right here on these Ninety six point five WTO Dr Halloween back again\nNext Sunday the same time same place three to four pm right here on these Ninety six point five WD deal well get your latest news weather and traffic as are asked the experts weekend rolls right along on news then to point five WGLA [noise]\nThis is news Ninety six point five or ... ... and it turns first for breaking news\nFour o'clock here and he was Ninety six point five WD be oh we're going to update are breaking news now police in Jacksonville said at six people were shot and just about a half mile away from the jaguar stadium where the game against the Texans just wrapped up\nHe goes up ten dollars and comes down ten dollars goes up ten dollars and ten down ten dollars that's your opportunity right there\nBecause you buy at the Lowes and you sell at the highs and your shorted the highs shorting just means take advantage of stocks moving down and then you buy back at the Lowes so if you can find a stock that consistently moved at a pattern like that\nThat you're a ... not the goose that lay the golden egg what what what is that is your opportunity well yeah okay that's that's easier said I didn't use the golden goose knows that that's right so the opportunities are there but you don't necessarily have to be looking for us\nSock that's going to the moon if you're a traitor because all you once the opportunity to to have a new five bucks\nWell and for folks that don't know there's a big difference in trading and investing and that's something Chris we'll talk about throughout the course of the show but you're talking about you know stock that might go up ten dollars down ten dollars up ten dollars down ten dollars that's\nThe kind of volatility that we've seen in the market as you mentioned before the market's up three hundred points down three hundred points up two hundred down five hundred and that scares the heck out of a lot of people but traders like yourself\nAbsolutely love that and one thing that we haven't said yet on the show for someone who may be listening for the first time is volatility is not a bad thing volatility is a good thing\nIt's an opportunity right we have to the program ourselves from the fact that we we always think that up is good in down is bad\nAnd if you're a traitor you need to get past that idea if you're an investor I get it because your investments and we'll talk about investments in more detail perhaps a in a in a second part of the show\nBut if you're thinking about trading and actually making some money mhm um then the opportunity that you want to look for is just the market's moving as opposed to markets necessarily moving in one direction\nBecause you can take those ups and downs and turn them into great opportunity so this has been the ideal trading circumstance this past week for people because\nIt's really easy to catch some nice swings for you know five or ten dollars and the stock or in the markets in general and then get out and then take it back the other direction\nAnd that is a lot of fun you know if if you're\nIf you're looking at the markets right now and wondering ... ... I Wonder where it goes from here [noise]\nWell you're probably not thinking of it in a very calm and rational sense because you're an investor at that point you're in this for the long haul and the reason you're asking where it's going\nIs because you want it to go up and if it goes down that's going to kill your retirement portfolio right and I actually have a lot more people coming in as we we all you and I always talked about you know how you make money as the market goes down and watch shorting actually the term shorting actually means\nAnd when it comes down to it I have had a lot more people coming into classes recently saying yeah I heard on the radio and really the reason I'm here is to try to figure out how to make money when the market goes down 'cause I don't understand that at all\nWell and a couple of months ago people didn't think the market was ever going to go down so they weren't as interested as they are now you know go back\nA week and a half ago when the market went down seven or eight hundred bucks and want a seven or eight hundred bucks point seven or eight hundred points right in one day boy that really got everybody's attention right you know and if you don't know anything about shorting or trading and you are just an investor\nI mean that you know that's like a smack in the face that day was like a smack in the face where people and then we started hearing from folks that have been listening to the radio show and listening to you talk about shorting for a long time\nAnd then start to think like yeah maybe I should learn that\nThis guy's a genius I Am not a genius we've been talking about this for a long time and the potential for a move to the downside but the the it's all fun and\nGames when everything's growing up yeah or\nLike we talk about Mike Tyson's quote right ... everybody's got a plan until you get hit in the mouth right service got a great plan in the markets until it goes down\nAnd then they're not exactly sure what to do about it today are not today and this this past week I actually had a conversation with some folks and I said where do you think the market's going from here\nAnd there are three guys and they all went down oh really really fast down yeah and up to this point anytime I had that conversation with somebody it was always you know there is somebody that thought it was going up and somebody thought it was going down and we have a discussion there was no discussion all three of them thought down as quick as possible\nYeah the last couple of weeks have really you know shaken people up and have woke people up to two reality um because like you said a couple of months ago you would ask people and they just thought it was going to keep going up as long as Trump is the president's gonna keep going up right\nAnd that's not to say that the the economy is not in a good place and things are solid across the board everybody can get a job if they want to get a job but that doesn't necessarily mean that the market's going up as a matter of fact the reason the markets\nIt's kind of putting the brakes on his because interest rates are rising and that's an issue of the fed and you if you've been listening to the news at all you probably heard a President Trump\nBeat not so excited with the fed policies and raising their interest rates he thinks that is hampering what's going on in the markets but you know what if you think we're going to go up or if you're going to go down\nA you've got to have the skills to be able to make money going both ways and if you want to listen to Morgan Stanley there's a guy named Mike Wilson who is one of their chief strategist and he said the sell off is just beginning and it is going to get worse\nOh really yeah yeah and what he said and that's coming from one of the top due to Morgan Stanley that's not like just some guy at some bank it's like the biggest of the big\nRight and he's been pretty bearish for the last couple of weeks um and we've been talking about this but you just gotta keep in mind that healthy markets they go up\nAnd then they re traced back and then they go up and they ... the definition of a bullish trend is a series of higher higher and higher lows\nSo higher lows means that there are some little pulled back along the way right right so we have to understand that this is a natural part of the movement in the markets but we've been moving up basically for nine years almost ten years so we're way overdue the natural correction happens every Seventy years\nSo the fact that we're nine plus years into this without a major correction or shouldn't surprise anybody that we're looking at a down move coming up\nYou know you mentioned President Trump because that's the ... aside from complaining about the fed and over the years of doing various radio shows I've heard a lot of experts like yourself I always say\nI'm you know it's priced into the market or it's fixed into the market so everybody everybody is known for a long time that interest rates were going to start going up\nThis was no big surprise to anybody I mean we've known for a long time but interest rates were going to start going up but President Trump also said\nThat this was a correction that they were anticipating this was a correction there we we were waiting for a while I think there's some truth to that I mean because I don't know if he really meant it or not but but\nBut certainly all the experts or so called experts have been waiting for that correction\nRight and he is he has been talking about Mr Powell who's the head of the fed and saying that he's raising interest rates too fast and that's kind of putting the brakes on things and I've heard other\nPundits about the stock market say similar type things that this is moving too quickly and you get could stall\nThe nice bull market we've had for the last ten years or to a point where we actually have a pretty major move to the downside so for that if if you hear me say that and you'd think that that's a negative\nUnderstand that that can be a huge positive for you because if you learn how to make money as the market goes down and I would encourage you to come to a workshop if that's something that you're interested in\nA van then you will understand that you can make money a lot faster as the market goes down then as it is going up because people have a tendency to panic and do everything wrong\nSo when the market's going down a retail traders have a tendency to sell get out of the market when I say retail traders that's you and me that the individuals in the market\nAs opposed to the banks and institutions right and when the individuals are selling you know what the banks and institutions are doing\nA buying buying yeah that's right so you and you mentioned Mike Tyson cause another thing that you always say is you know the the the market is going to go up and the market's going to go down and if you only know how to make money\nWhen the market's going up you you have this uh this saying it's like being a boxer in the ring with one hand tied behind your back exactly right I mean\nIf you if you only know\nThey believe the shooter came from the passenger side to once again at least you could have been more people in ... in their food even be additional use I don't want to miss characterize that either so that's also being

we do really appreciate that and hopefully you're learning something I'm Tony Marino That's Chris serve and he is the senior instructor at the online training academy and before we get back in the things here Chris\nI just want to tell everybody as I did going into the break if you want to learn how to protect\nThe money that you already have if you want to grow your retirement account if you want to be prepared for the downturn in the market and learn how to make money\nI make more money I should say when the market goes down you need to call right now get registered for one of the seats that have been made available for this week's three hour comprehensive workshop\nChrist will be discussing some of the mistakes that traders and investors make on their own and how you can avoid those mistakes among all the other things we talked about eight eight eight six one eight Ninety two forty nine eight eight eight\nSix one eight Ninety two forty nine call before all of the free seats fill up getting to this week's workshop and Chris as always\nWe are already here in the final segment of the show and we talked about maybe thirty percent of all the stuff that we really want to talk about but that's because there's so much ground to cover so many opportunities so many different things to talk about it and all of the different asset classes no question\nThat's why we do a workshop that's three hours long a because there's a lot more to cover obviously I mean even three hours or just kind of scratching the surface of what the markets have to offer whether that's the stock market\nThe auctions marketer futures are for X. all of those are tradable opportunities you know and\nWe have a lot of people come in and some people I Know are sitting out there wondering you know who's who's this workshop for and we kind of try to give the impression that this is really for anybody and that's really the case\nOf you know people are a lot of different places in their lives and OJ is really in the business of solving are providing solutions for people that have financial issues\nNow those financial issues can be broad base and you might have somebody that's looking to start a whole new career in trading and that's fantastic we can help those folks\nAre there might be some folks out there that are they like their current job they just need some more income and they just don't make enough money and they need to create a secondary stream of income that doesn't take up all their time and uh you know we said this before some of the best traders I Know spend thirty or sixty minutes a day set up trades and that's about it\nSo that's a great opportunity for them as well there's other folks that are sitting looking at their retirement account thinking oh my gosh I'm not sure that I have enough money to be able to retire at the right place where I where I can live a life I Want to live\nAnd we help people with that aspect of their financial situation and then again kind of what we spent the last segment talking about is those people that actually do have a decent amount of money but they have to figure out how to protect it\nIf the market goes down and all of those types of people and I'm sure there's lots of others out there but those are probably the big for a of the groups of people that come to the academy and we spend time with them\nComing up with solutions so if you have yourself into any of those categories again my suggestion is just come in and spend some time with us at the academy a comfortable workshop explore a little bit see what we're about will figure out what you're about and see if there is a good match their you know it's\nLike you say everybody is it a different place in life you know a a financially speaking and as far as your age\nUm if you're twenty five years old you're probably not thinking the same way that somebody that's fifty five years old is or sixty five years old ... ah\nIf you need to generate more money right now you're going to be thinking differently than somebody that already has a million or two million or three million dollars or\nSo you know everybody's in a different place and everybody has a different goal or a different\nUh um why that is what we talked about why we talked about what your why right ruptured goal rhino everybody's got a ...\nBut the bottom line is wherever you are in life and whatever your financial situation is if you hope to someday retire comfortably if you are younger and you're hoping to put your kids through college like Chris and I are doing right now\nUh if you have a daughter that some day going to need to pay for her wedding ... you know whatever the case may be\nThis is something that you have to think seriously about\nK ... there there is a again there's so much opportunity out there and and and\nIt's almost frustrating that people don't know the opportunity that's out there this is this is a three hour comprehensive free workshop [noise]\nOkay um like Chris says you can you know give a little bit of time see if it's something that you'd be interested in the if it's something for you ah and then you can go from there but why not at least check it out you owe it to yourself and to your family to check it out eight eight eight six what eight nine two four nine\nEight eight eight six one eight nine to foreign I don't put it off any longer
