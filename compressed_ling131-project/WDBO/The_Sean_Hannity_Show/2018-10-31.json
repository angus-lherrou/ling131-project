end birthright citizenship for babies born to anyone here illegally Washington watched oj me to ... to point does get the latest\nPresident Trump vowed to wage a legal fight to deny citizenship to children of illegal immigrants the president publicly rebuked outgoing house Speaker Paul Ryan who said yesterday that Mr Trump has no legal authority to use an executive order to make such a change it's still not clear if the president will issue in order or not\nAnd we've seen it look let's look at this horrific anti Semitic bigoted racist attack on innocent people in the synagogue in in Pittsburgh let me play just the media blaming Trump now understand that the shooter hate Trump\nThe shooter hate Trump in large part because he's such a staunch supporter of Israel and yet that doesn't stop them\nFrom collectively losing their minds ramping up this hatred and rhetoric blaming Trump for the Pentagon shooting\nBut yet the guy involved in the shooting hate the president in large part because he is so closely aligned with our closest ally Israel\nThreats in this country is white man most of it\nRadicalized brought up to the right and we have to start doing something about them if you stop seeming things about me I'll stop and citing angry lunatics to kill you you know whether the\nPresident knew what he was saying the alleged gunman certainly heard something that resonated what Trump\nIs doing is stoking inciting for the purposes of political power so worst amongst us to take action in his name to anybody who sits there and says that there is not causality between these events\nAny instruments dishonest as they are\nBlind so I don't think you have to be rocket scientist to rule the lines between these people and the rhetoric that as being ... by the presence of the United\nStates or racism anytime I think that he's probably power an original violent than it used to ...\nIt is oh factually a lie because the guy hates Trump all the evidence is there why he hated Trump\nHated and because of his support for our closest ally Israel how many presidents promise to build the capital of Israel from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem where it belongs many none had the courage to do it except this president\nYou know it's amazing when you listen to the prime minister of Israel spanking the president no president has gone as far as to say we will destroy the enemies of Israel because there are closest ally just the opposite of what they are reporting and what they're trying to do\nIt would've been dishonest and I said at the time when Bernie Sanders supporters went out there and shot Steve skull east on the ball field and and shot up these other innocent people you know it it would have been it would have been wrong\nTo blame Bernie Sanders\nBernie is not responsible for what one of his crazy supporters tit he's just not isn't it's actually dishonest to suggest such a thing\nI said it at the time and I even had at the time this is not some accommodation or rational they would ever give if it's a conservative just the opposite in this case you don't even have a Trump supporter and they're still blaming him\nI mean you know it's it is it is what it is the biggest donors to the Democratic caused this election season is the media\nIs universal almost at this point they hate Donald Trump every second every minute every hour every day it is hate destroy Trump at all costs\nYou know the whole lie about Russia collusion it's just what I've been saying they don't care about Russia collusion unless the Trump\nHillary bought and paid for ... a full of Russian lives used to disseminate propaganda and influence the American people in the lead up to twenty six the it was it was used to get fined warrants on verified uncorroborated Russian lies that even the own\nEven the author of the\nOf the dusty doesn't even stand by let me tell you something let's remember when the media bashed Trump a lot of them were moving the embassy to Jerusalem\nAnd the president went against it in many ways what is a new alliance forming that could be maybe at some point God willing a path to peace in the middle east once and for all because of the threat of Iranian had Germany\nIn the region now caused an alliance was unsinkable maybe just a number of years back with Israel the Jordanians Egyptians\nThe Saudis the Emirates putting aside what Saudi Arabia recently did\nI mean if there was an emerging alliance here because of Donald Trump in large part and what he's done but I Will tell you you know let's play Joe Scarborough Joe Scarborough was lost his mind I honestly I don't I don't even it's inexplicable\nThat this guy has evolved into what I think he's just he's he's lost any sense of reality all of these people in the media they don't even see what blowing hypocrites they are how they are guilty of the very thing they accused Trump up\nTheir rhetoric that they fame moral outrage about what they are guilty of\nHe's been he's been playing the race card he said I'm a nationalist David ... comes out the next day say thank you thank you so much for\nFinally admitting that your wife ... list and then

countries talking about gypsy which is ... lines up historically\nExactly with what certain countries we're talking about when they were talking about gypsies and Jews [noise]\n\nYou know I mean I don't even know what to say anymore you know Don Lemon last night or the night before whenever I think it was last night listen to what he says\nWe have to stop demonizing people and not even I think biggest terror threats in the country to white man most have been radicalized ... up to the right and we have to start doing something about them there is no travel ban on them\nThere was no ban on you know they have a Muslim ban there is no white guy ban so what do we do about that\nI just I don't even know what to say you know and then their morning hosts suggesting the Trump and the synagogue shooter using the same language\nTerm messaging we'll start with the fact that so he seems to be going in\nOn the two pillars of the media continuing the trail and attacks against and migrant continuing to ratchet up the language about them just and and frankly I mean I have to thank you think on the same language that the mass murder at the synagogue used in terms of invaders and\nInvasion these tragedies work at cross purposes narrative ... so it's hard for him to celebrate his narrative of ... migrants when again the alleged mass murderer did the same thing\nAnd I don't I don't even know where to go with this it'll joyous pay heart not even on her show the view but on conspiracy to me and my somebody said you've also\nAt times got along with them as as cars out there

from today on this radio program and there is an unknown factor here anyone that tells you they know what's gonna happen doesn't\nThere is there's not one outcome to be very Frank with you that would surprise me one week from today when we gather here to talk about the results but I Do know this\nI Do see here at a level that is unprecedented they never saw Trump coming they never understood that\nThe election day twenty sixteen they were in a state of shock and it was not only shock it was obvious sadness depression you know CNN white lashed out against the country et cetera\nYeah that that's not a ... it is they in the back of their head really fear you know the American people and what you're going to decide\nEvery race matters is four hundred and thirty five house races you vote

Arizona Montana North Dakota Indiana New Jersey West Virginia\nThey're afraid of what the results are going to be I'm not afraid of any result we I can deal with whatever hand the American people people deal is\nWhat the couple of quick question are you better off than you or two years ago is the country better off if the economy better off maybe you don't like Donald Trump style are you happy with the results are you happy with for a million jobs created\nEight million fewer people on food stamps and in poverty are you happy with less government regulation the largest tax cuts in history

your being with us but they have people that gave us that they give us Obamacare keep your doctor keep your plan and save money\nWell that proved not to be true right and so they want to double down on health care Medicare for all sounds great but what does that do with the the deficit and debt and rationing health care it's risky for seniors because they should be the priority when the Medicare and so there's a lot of scare tactics out there Sean\nAnd what I'm hearing on the ground is we have to keep the prosperity going the economy going the way it is we have two point five percent unemployment rate in Iowa Sean\nAnd correcting the record with these lies and it's textbook cookie cutter messages\nFrom Nancy Pelosi across the country and that is scaring seniors regarding Social

Republican health care is going\nTo be a lot of people is in lying is just a part of the playbook of the Democrats as always the same I even think it's gotten worse and I look at this this horrible terrorist attack in the shooting took place in the Pittsburgh synagogue and\nWhat does the media but I don't they're blaming Donald Trump for it and meanwhile the the guy responsible for the shooting hated Trump in large part because of his strong support for Israel including moving the capital to\nJerusalem wearable along so well it's interesting I was so what is your take I mean how are people reacting I'm I assume you're getting a portion of negative ads thrown at you and how the people of Iowa reacting to\nOh yeah I'm getting out and about four to one for my opponent and Nancy Pelosi and the superPACs out there so it's message versus money my opponent all her money is coming from from the east and the left the in the west coast a message over money and results right results look what we have done with this economy\nWhat I have a feeling there's always this question Donald Trump is changed all the rules in politics I don't think a lot of Trump supporters are going to be telling

outside you got tester on the bubble even have Joe Manchin on a bubble in West Virginia and Bob Menendez on a bubble\nYeah and it's interesting I was looking at the different levels you have nine guys on a carry on state where the Democrats should be safe because his personal\nAnd kills a with the Senate Ethics committee on a bipartisan unanimous majority finding him guilty of a whole range of

was over one of the things stay home and then they run out and voted and if you end up not having voted by election day do not do anything else to a day to vote who said that serious\nLet me let me ask you this because it lets go with real clear politics than they have to wonder written for the number of house seats that they think are\nSafe for the Democrats and about one Ninety nine for the Republicans or where the way the Republicans have in the majority all of those toss ups put them on defense they needed a forty five retirements for the Republicans that's a big number in any election year um\nThe house is what I'm most worried about and you know the thought of Nancy Pelosi being speaker elect and then speaker of the house once again is a pretty frightening thought\nUm where do you see the house going\nWhy not functionally ah I I my personal range is returning a bottom of about ... ... which would mean below sea ... hiring them around to twenty to thirty which would mean that

say do you\nSee I didn't either when I really can't I mean and I think now and and look the conventional wisdom is Republicans will hold\nThe Senate pick up seats there and let them see below sea would win the house\nUm that's not a great case scenario but that would be sort of like a split decision by the American people also say one other thing is\nYou know some House Republicans have earned the wrath of their voters but it's really not about them it's about stopping an agenda that we know is going to be about impeachment endless investigation raising taxes they want their crumbs back a

says I'm tired of it all I don't like them or is it sort of a I'm not going to vote not voting is in effect a handful vote for Nancy closer to the next week um and I think that's good\nYeah I don't have to tell them if there were four hundred and thirty five members of Congress all of them are up for reelection and every race is important and the idea is no this is the either stay home\nOr you vote for the Democrat you're pretty much voting for policy at the same in the Senate races\nYou know you vote for John tester you vote for Claire McCaskill you vote for Christ in cinema you vote for

at exactly\nYeah so tell us about you know what are the issues there and do you think the people in your district the forty fifth district of California are paying attention and are being influenced by the money and the negative ads\n[noise] yeah it's a real clear choice in this race I mean you have\nUm a a district where do people want to continue to the America forward I mean we had the lowest unemployment in forty nine years that you know and in orange county it's the lowest unemployment it in Nineteen years people have more money in their paycheck uh people are able to get jobs\nConsumer confidence is that I mean we're really moving this country the right direction that the choices clear do you want to continue moving a America forward or do you want to go back to the Obama era too where are you at overregulation where you had high taxes where you had government in your life\nAnd I think it's a clear choice in what we're seeing right now on the early returns\nOr is that the Republicans are just as energized as the Democrats are and in fact in my district\nWe had over ... fourteen point advantage on the ... the return over the Democrats so we aren't seeing this so called blue wave that you hear about we see that our voters are just as an energized\nWell I think it look if you look at the Senate Republicans have decided advantage and a lot of these races where they're red states that support Trump by big margins\nBut the houses just harder to figure and I don't know if people fully completely understand that there are a lot of headwinds history runs against the party in power\nThey have forty five retirements that's the case for example Darrell ISIS seat\nUm and I you know I'm assuming with gerrymandering and and the legislature out there in California they do everything they could possibly do to maximize the number of democratic seats from the state\nAnd uh so it makes a particularly hard for people like yourself that have done a good job and want to do a good job but the people in your\nState and in your district but the you know you're fighting against the state that has a Thirteen and a half percent income tax with a democratic governor of that or democratic lieutenant governor running for governor who wants to free health care for anybody whether you're a California resident or not whether you're a citizen or not\nIt's a very challenging environment a to B from California and representing California either or for reasons why we need to make sure our voters get out the so that we don't lose any Republican seats we have fourteen members
