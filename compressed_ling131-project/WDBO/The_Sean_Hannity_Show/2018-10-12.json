James O'Keefe is going to join us and the Democrat British said it was running against Marsha Blackburn who's now began to pull away in the polls a little bit there\nHim and his campaign in his campaign staff caught on tape absolutely saying he's lying to the people of Tennessee\nBut the very purpose of getting elected and they say it not once but they say it over and over and over and over again I go to play for you later in the program today but I mean it is in his mind numbing that people have zero\nTruth or or ability or character that they can be honest with who they are and what they believe\nAnd the problem for Brett us in just like the problem for people like Claire McCaskill or Heidi Heitkamp or Joe Donnelly a or send them all oh where do we get to the table and send them out today or you know some of these other Democrats that are running Jon Tester\nIs they can't be honest\nWith who they are and be honest with their voters of what they're going to do when they get to Washington if they get to Washington\nBut when they get their here's what they're going to do even though they're in red states that overwhelmingly voted for Donald Trump\nThey're going to get to Washington and they're going to vote for Chuck Schumer that's sort of first boat and then they're going to vote with Chuck Schumer Ninety eight percent of the time because that's what Democrats do there is no voice of moderation in the modern Democratic Party\nI got to get one little tip for the hat to Joe Manchin of West Virginia frankly why he stays a Democrat in this day and age I have no idea\nWhat Republicans also offering\nSolutions and answers and solving problems and the numbers beret out all across the board which is why you know historically in mid term elections people don't like to show up but if you don't show up all of the progress that we've made in the next two years is in jeopardy\nAnd you're going to get endless investigation possible impeachment they would save stated publicly they want their crumbs back they have stated publicly in other words they want to raise taxes\nWell that's that's what created the last eight years of Obama\nWhich put Thirteen million more Americans on food stamps eight million more in poverty and he became the only president in history ever to never reach three percent GDP Growth in a single year and he gave up on manufacturing jobs of post jobs so never coming back\nWell in less than two years Trump brought back more than four hundred thousand of them\nHalf the time he brings in fact not only by ending burdensome regulation and asking businesses well what ... what can we do to help facilitate you working here and building here in grading factories manufacturing centers here and tell them well you know it's costing us\nYou know a thousand dollars for this regulation per unit and a thousand dollars per unit for that ... that because of that regulation or the president's wiping those regulations off the books\nAnd then on top of that is created a tax incentive for business to build in America and then when that doesn't work he just gets on the phone and just will humiliate publicly any company that is not building in America\nAnd then on top of that each challenges even allies of ours that have taken advantage of us economically on bad trade deals over the years and he's telling them hey ah you're treating us unfairly this was a one sided deal I'm pulling out\nAnd we now successfully navigated thread the needle negotiated better deals with for example most recently Canada and Mexico have you don't fight for a better deal you're never gonna get a better deal pretty amazing\nI Know everybody's been all hyped up about Kanye being in the White House listen very closely to accommodate was saying and I'm like\nI Do think we need some prison reform I'll give you an example when the president ... commuted the sentence of Alice marine Johnson remember the woman at a given like a life sentence one of ... a fence a grandmother apparently she's running a horrible economic difficulties with like ... there's no new on some times in our criminal justice system\nAnd we spent Twenty one twenty two years in jail I had an opportunity to interview or I absolutely fell in love with this woman she comes rushing out of prison if the President Trump does this for her right until the arms of her loving family I got to meet her sister and I got to meet somebody a lawyer that was working for her pro bono and helped make this happen\nAnd then she goes to the microphones and she says to America thank you\nThank you for giving me a second chance I'm not going to let you down well I Want to find all the Alice ... Johnson is in prison that or like car with that attitude\nThat deserve a second chance and you know that would that maybe a bit given heavy sentences for reasons but whatever the reason happens to be I agree with you we can find those people\nYou also talked about safe neighborhoods we need safe neighborhoods I disagree with him on stop and frisk only because the murder rate in New York while I've been hearing the Rudy Giuliani went from about twenty five hundred a year down to three hundred three or four hundred Bernie Carrick was a big part of the success of that program\nIt just works unfortunately got to go into the neighborhoods where the crime\nThey're being committed where the shots of being fired wherever it happens to be and you have a grasp of resources and policing of those areas so every man woman and child can go to sleep at night and not worry the bullets are going to be flying through their windows or the next hour it's unbelievable that nothing is ever been done at

do better we ought to do we owe it to people to do better and then he's talking about bringing jobs making things in America and creating jobs in America\nYou know they shouldn't be about conservative liberal Republican Democrat but liberalism fails socialism redistribution has failed and we see it we had eight years of it and with hasn't done a thing\nAs white as a any African American

sentence to life in prison\nA sentence for in the nineties for blowing up a plotting to blow up the UN and an FBI building but I think a cinema is going to see a dramatic drop in the polls there and I think things will look up for Martha McSally who was a rock star a person that has served our country with incredible distinction\nUm and here to go through all these latest numbers and what it means and\nWhether or not to this is going to be the blue wave or is it going to be a shock the world twenty sixteen Donald Trump all over\nRedux a we have our good friends John McLaughlin and dug shelters with us welcome both the back to the program thank you thank you I I don't think there's any doubt the cabinet overreach and the loss of due process and and even simple principles like the presumption of innocence\nHas now definitely hurt the Democratic party I think these tapes of bread a sin and in Tennessee and cinema in Arizona are going to hurt those candidacies and when you have thirty two house seats really going to tip the balance one way or the other which way does it go John McLaughlin\nFlight that I think without a doubt by the way one of the things you've got a notice this week you noticed a market went down its up a little today but went down in the past couple of days and it was triggered by interest rates stuff but in the meantime I had some analysts telling me\nThey're afraid of the Democrats taking the house of representatives and they would want to raise taxes again they would stop Trump from doing all the good things that he's done a regulation the businesses with the economy and they would want to raise taxes again\nAnd that would cost jobs that were slow down the American economy and you've got an economy now that's really growing at about four percent higher than any their expectations and what they're really afraid of is that Nancy Pelosi could become speaker again I agree with you showing that the Republicans are going to pick up Senate seats in the Senate seats looking really good because of what happened\nWith the backlash of about the whole cabinet are hearing it how unfair it was and you could see we had a poll this week where I'm\nMcCaskill was losing Hawley the Republican for the U.S Senate\nAnd the way that I don't know also Joe Donnelly is now down right in front and Heidi Heitkamp is finished she's down by double digits\nThere because of the the energy sector is so important to the state that you're seeing that you're seeing these these polls um you know people want shops\nAnd what's scary is in the last three weeks where you're going to decide is do you want the economy to keep growing or do you want do you want it to slow down your policy to raise taxes take what you got to take away the job to take away the pay raises\nAnd the vast majority of Americans don't want to go back to that I mean we had polls in September with Nancy Pelosi has a fifty five unfair will among all voters she has a she has the fifty three percent\nUnfavorable among independent women that the independent women are going to decide this election and and they don't want to go back to the way things work before Donald Trump took over and started to drain the swamp and get things moving again for the country to lead house races you're talking about\nOverwhelmingly most of the ones in play or Republicans those Republican incumbents or the or the Republican or a candidates in the in those open seats they're the ones who are going to vote to keep lowering taxes to keep the economy growing and basically to stop what you saw the last couple of days where\nYou know the smart money on Wall street saying hold it she's if she's going to be speaker\nAnd they're going to oppose the president's ah ah agenda they started selling off\nI mean it'd be a disaster for the country\nDoes shown 'em I honestly don't have a feel yet for the house but I think the Senate you have to have been looking very good for Republican pickups\nI think when you have thirty three races now that will that will actually tipped the balance one way or the other in the house of representatives a little too close for comfort because as somebody that knows Nancy Pelosi I think that would be a worst case scenario and we'd have endless investigations and impeachment and higher taxes and\nAnd you know it that they want to get rid of ice they won't put on the border wall et cetera it's gonna be the same nonsense all over again with them\nWell I my sense is that the house is still a in democratic hands where the election today so it's getting closer or the real clear average has gone from a thirty one or thirty two seats for the Democrats are twenty six or twenty seven so it's the same direction as the Senate races but not quite\nAs far and I would have to concede much as I Would like not to that the Senate races have moved decisively in that direction\nKavanaugh had a lot to do with it yeah I Do I think they're really to reality is there's the reality of the world that we live in on the east coast and west coast and the reality of the rest of the country who thought that a lot of what happened to him\nYeah I'm kind of like an island in the middle of that east coast I'm not the rest of the east coast I don't represent the value of New York I have noticed yeah which is a pretty hardcore left wing state even as a Governor Cuomo doesn't even want me in the state did you know that I could no but if I got I got ... no he actually said those conservative\nThat it does not me and they thought it was themselves are streaming but it was a right to life\nMay was so it is that they are because they are the extreme conservative send those that it's not as simple no one\nHas within a rifle no one can\nUs a I'm right to life I'm pro Second Amendment ah and ah although I don't I'm libertarian on people's personal lives I think we ought to lead people to hell alone\nI'm Sorry but there's no place for me in the state of New York and he said it himself when that happened I had a bunch of governors Florida Texas North Carolina South Carolina all calling and invited me to move to the states I Want to take them up on Mr shown that would be governor don't you love and vote for one's me out of town\nSo I speaking for myself and wanted you to run as an independent for president I think that you run an Alabama one of your old stomping grounds Doug Jones would not be a senator and I would be happy to be part of the bipartisan committee to keep identity in New York or to promote Hannity\nOffice would like to run for I think my friend John and I can\nSpot Johnny Weir disabuse our friend Doug of any notion that I can win any office I don't even think I could win dog catcher\nNow I I say look you're still the case for Franklin square you're still you're still in hand with your working class roots and Andrew Cuomo is trying to make you move out to join because\nNew York that's our biggest export is is the people and taxpayers of New York state we send them to places like Florida and Tennessee in fact that's where they have no no income tax and no state income tax and they have jobs but by the way it doubled than out on us because his client right Doug you still work for a a former mayor for New York Mike Bloomberg rent I heard it oh yeah yeah I don't I ...\nI tell you you know people are speculating he might run for president but Andrew Cuomo is clearly afraid of him because he's moving so far left\nChat it's unbelievable he's going to get whiplash but but I don't even think I don't think they'll make to get through Mayor Bloomberg could get through a Democrat primary these days because they're so radical and that's my point about what's going on right now the country's realizing and the next three weeks what's at stake is\nThis is the most as John says the most important midterms in our lifetime because you really have a clear choice for a country that's gotten back it's got its footing back\nWhere the economy is moving while we're stronger in the world are we we were basically the heartland is feeling that people are paying attention to them that the swamp as being a put back in its place that that the average person might have something to say about how their wives are going to be governed have control of their own healthcare\nBut but if Nancy Pelosi becomes the next speaker she won't be the most powerful elected Democrat in the country she'll be the national face and voice of the Democratic party and that is just frightening\nIs it let me tell you something we're not just friday is a frightening Republicans Doug shown does not want this do you do oh\nI Want democratic candidate at all levels in the house to say I will vote against her because that's the way to get votes in these marginal rights is absolutely going to should go period style absolutely\nAnd and does point about in previous times are have been on the radio is you know you know what the president's message was when he ran for president was making America great again what's the message of the house Republicans to get re elected this time\nWhat should it be better stop Nancy Pelosi from getting\nWell I think it's got to do that I I think look if you if you like the success\nOf the last two years if you want your tax cuts to go permanent if you if\nYou believe in secure our borders if you believe in energy independence if you believe in the health care plan and the free independent market health care plan that actually would work for the American people like the concierge care for blue collar workers\nThat we talk about all the time with our buddy Dr Josh I'm or all of those messages five and constitutional originalists on the fourth I think those are all winning issues\nYeah you can put all those issues and one vessel and personalize it because Nancy Pelosi will take away all those things show reverse it will have fewer jobs show raise taxes you'll have open borders you won't have security\nAnd you'll have an endless investigations and we know Maxine wants to impeach forty five page forty five and ... forty five\nAll right we'll take a break Doug shown John McLaughlin on the other side quick break right back\nWithout a lot more to get to in the course of the program Ken a California Republican win the governorship\nAnd we've been told that the person
