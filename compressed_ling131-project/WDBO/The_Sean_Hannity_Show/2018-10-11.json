for your afternoon we got some rain here in central Florida will take a full look at the interactive radar coming up first or top story this hour continues to be the clean up in a recovery from hurricane Michael absolute devastation we've seen in the panhandle where emergency rescues remain on their way\nIt was last night ran ten rescue missions to the night and they have already save lives\nFlorida governor Rick Scott says he expects four hundred thousand homes and businesses remained without power this time many roads were washed out or impassable so if you are evacuated he wants you to just stay out of the area this\nUh we have a tough race by the way it's going to be a tough race\nFor Scott Walker in Wisconsin who I think he's done a phenomenal job or as it relates\nTo you know the state\nOf Wisconsin and I hope the people who Wisconsin finally remember that but we now have Walker one poll finally up by one but it's very very close are we have a Georgia governor race that's also closer than I Would like for comfort\nOr with the Republican Kemp up by two and so a following that raised pretty closely um in some of the other races that were watching the president's approval rating now is doing very very well what fifty one percent and Rasmussen\nAnd so we'll watch that but I think if you look\nAt Heidi Heitkamp I think she's going to be and should be defeated in North Dakota I Hope the people of Montana will pay attention and understand that you basically have Chuck Schumer junior because John tester always goes with Chuck Schumer and the people in Montana I couldn't take back that state which is a red state\nThen you've got other states like Indiana I think Joe Donnelly can be defeated in Indiana\nI think definitely Claire McCaskill she ought to be sent packing and I think Marsha Blackburn is going to be a phenomenal senator from the great state of Tennessee should've been a longtime friend of this program and recent polls now have her up as well and then we get to the all important house races I'm not going to spend the time here it's more of a visual thing that we're doing on television\nAnd we're picking ten important house races at night and we're identifying those specific districts that are going to make\nA difference on election night in twenty six days and that will live or they these these districts were putting up hold the balance of power in the house of representatives I mean because of gerrymandering of a big portion and percentage of seats\nI end up being safe for both Republicans and Democrats\nSo we'll find out for voters by the way Trump more help now to these candidates in the president's that what he's out for days this week and he's going to be campaigning for everybody and these tight races in an attempt to help them all out and um\nI honestly think that the Republicans would adapt just a little bit they don't have to take the style of Donald Trump\nBut if they go out and and passionately support making the tax cuts permanent\nIf they passionately talk about ending the bureaucracy the way the president has been doing it\nIf they will sign on to building and fully funding the border wall if they will do the alternative healthcare solutions that we talk about all the time on this program like health savings accounts and health care cooperatives et cetera were just going to have a better country\nAnd and the more prosperous country you cannot deny the success\nOf this president and the fuel the pure force of personality\nI mean Donald Trump is a force of nature and I know that he breaks dishes I Know he's an icon of class I Know he's a disruptor\nWhat if he's not fighting then we're not winning and when he goes up even against their own allies and says you're not paying their fair share in NATO and we're paying the bulk of money for NATO and then you're stupid enough Chancellor Merkel to go make deals to help make Russia and Vladimir ... rich again well you're basically\nIt's on your counteracting everything that NATO's trying to do which is prevent a hospital regime from ever having the power to turn off the picket and turn off the white blood of western Europe's economy\nIs a simple basic things nobody ever thought that the president would get along with little rocket man fire and fury apparently Mike Pompeo the secretary of state at a phenomenal meeting I talked to two sources\nA phenomenal meeting with little rocket man and that little rocket man is dead he's serious about getting rid of any nuclear ambitions denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula the guy that everybody in the media said was going to start World War three that guy is bringing peace to the Korean Peninsula\nYou look at Seoul South Korea you know you look over the DMZ and what do you see thirty million people live there\nA nuclear armed North Korea is not something that the world needs if you care about human life\nAnd as a result I Would assume that you know markets would open up to North Korea that people of North Korea been suffering you might even see a reunification one day of north and South Korea Korea how great would that be for the world you know you got a president that's not dropping cargo planes full of cash and other currencies\nAnd on the on the tarmac for mullahs around that hate us and chant death to America death to Israel that's not happening either you

enough\nThe house and or the Senate\nThat twin civility can start again but until then the only thing that the Republican theme to\nRecognize and respect is Frank\nAnd you heard how the Republican numbers led by Mitch McConnell\nAnd the president [noise]\nReally demeaned the confirmation process\nYeah we we can't be civil of we disagree with them no give us power and then we'll be civil or you gotta be kidding when you when they go low you just pick up\nOn the show Obama said fears is not a proper motivator hope wins out and if you think about how you want your kids to be raised how you want them to think about life and their opportunities do you want them to be afraid to their neighbors and you want them angry do you want to mention all wondering Michelle Obama say anything when\nSarah Sanders was run out of a restaurant or Pam Bondi was run out of a restaurant or secretary Nielsen was run out of a restaurant by these angry liberal leftist mobs and they are moms\nAnd there's this is Rand Paul pointed out somebody's gonna get hurt\nSomebody might get killed and all of this if they allow this to continue bought the rhetoric is coming from the ... so called leadership and by the way Brock Obama himself was not exactly a saint when it came to the issue of being a well civil\nGo out and get your friends your neighbors to the weather in the Republican or you're with them and I'm not at the foot missile burgers on Fox News\nIs up against the enemy\nWhen someone is cooler act like a bully you don't do to their level\nNow our motto is\nWhen they go low we go high you\nKnow they're going lower than they've ever been and that's what we witnessed with judge Kavanaugh would know due process no presumption of innocence the most outrageous allegations that were thrown against this man and people still are I Believe that I Believe people when there's no corroborating evidence\nThat's a party that doesn't believe in fundamental basic fairness constitutional due process and the presumption of innocence that is said\nAnd we saw what happened to him but we see it every two and four years don't we and we're seeing it now and it's happening and you got people like let's see Maxine Waters Cory Booker Eric Holder yeah getting their face kick them when they're down you don't follow them in the gas stations and grocery stores\nYou cannot be civil with a political party that wants to destroy what you stand for what you care about that's why I Believe if we are fortunate enough to win back the house hand or the that twin civility can start again\nYour body cabinet [laughter]\nPlease don't just come here today and then go home go to the hill today [laughter]\n[noise] in the face of from Congress people\nShowing you know when they go low

and he's the president of the Stanford University college Republicans and is now saying that he was assaulted by one of these violent democratic a Democrat protesters during the pro Kavanaugh rally that they had last week\nAnd the Stanford Daily reports that rice Cameron who is the president of the Stanford college Republicans claims that a classmate Belinda Hernandez quote showed him in the chest with their hand during a verbal disagreement\nOther student news outlets citing a Stamford department of public safety spokesperson said Hernandez was placed under private person arrest at rice Cameron's request and issued a citation for battery\nAt the Stanford Daily quota law enforcement source saying there's no obvious physical injury to either party involved and\nRice camera refused
