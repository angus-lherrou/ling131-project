[noise]\nAll of them back into talk right here on these any six point five W db oh if you want to call we got this final segment about seven minutes before your latest news weather and traffic update to go ahead and get call line that we probably won't even to more callers then we love getting about the last minute aid for for\nTwo two zero zero nine six five eight four for ... to zero\nZero nine six five is the number and advertising that clunky exit into the big three things for news will finish up the big three that we haven't tech world this week with laundry what's the number one thing in the tech world this week\nWell actually this will be the number three thing I Would think the number one thing would probably be tied with Facebook in the spectrum saying well number one number three at the bottom line where I Am saying that this will be a big thing in tech for our local area ... it's involving a Amazon's facial recognition technology\nAnd or their partnership with the Orlando police department\nAnd the ... of course they have NDA said that really prohibit people from talking about uh\nInformation has been disclosed that uh they had been having a lot of trouble with this new technology I mean not only were the privacy concerns evident we've already talked about this on a previous show and where they the facial recognition technology actually mistakenly identified twenty eight\nMembers of Congress as wanted fugitives but um that um there have been a lot of reports that data streams have been going down that the technology has been very buggy\nAnd that uh there have been indications even that you're willing to police department has naive in that and several officers and now even received the proper appropriate training for the use of it\nSo we have a technology that's currently being employed a local area where the officers using it\nMight end up doing something where it could have a negative consequence another individual like they put the wrong button independently assigned a profile of the wrong person or they can miss identify a subject or inadvertently leak confidential information or something if you there's people using a brand new technology\nWhether it's already concerns about privacy\nAnd that said technology basically has is basically tied to personal sensitive identifying information\nThat concern is what other negative consequences could that potentially have on our local community\nSo that's why I wanted to bring that up is our third item today that uh hopefully that Amazon Orlando police work together get the kinks out and up but of course I'm it's are still pretty alarming when\nYou have a technology that's supposed to be identifying people and then it miss identifies people that obviously shouldn't be identified as being wanted people as\nPotential suspect I mean not mistaken identity situations have led to a lot of very bad happenings not just the urban nationwide and so that's why I wanted to bring up because there's a lot of concerns about there but speaking of technology let's uh let's get back to saving people money\nThey'll go and we do that yes yeah I think so\nAll right um well I'm\nKnow have are you familiar with winds up happening with a lot of technology when companies\nOr ... or government entities are done with it that they that ... outdated and know what to do with it and then just just steps saying around where else do you know what a lot of these companies end up doing instead these days\nThey tend to rely on a certified remarketing and ... an auction nearing company to be able to go through this equipment and vehicles and jewelry and then be able to re deploy them more remark at them\nAnd potentially make money back on these and that's really one of the fundamental ideas of surplus management how anyone assets got off the ground and uh we have a company called technologies surplus depot and what technology surplus depot does is that um it takes\nAssets like of vehicles machinery industrial equipment\nUm we've been having jewelry and other types of electrons and then we catalogue them and then we actually re market and resell them through online public Web portal\nThat anyone could potentially take advantage of a to a where we're able to ... to ... to a certified auction hearing process and anyone can bid you don't have to pay to bed now like those auction companies you see on TV that are flying he's\nReally good deals in your face I mean these are really really\nGood deals they can have like for example there is a a dodge ram right now with the current bit around say five hundred dollars for example and um so members of the public can bid on a whole sort of potential items for their own uses or their own needs\nAnd then uh from that then the original entity that are owned or operate these devices before are able to get money back into that and which they can potentially use for other investments or to get newer technology for the organization\nAnd so I'm for members of the public it provides a very valuable opportunity that uh there's because there's so many different types of things available that they can gain rather unique types of devices and equipment\nAnd save a whole lot of money compared to if they were going out to see these type of thing sometimes there's parts that you might have difficulty finding elsewhere like a\nRear axle differential for example I'm near like um there's a lot of really cool unique stuff there that website it's technology surplus depot dot com\nI mean there's so much yeah there's so many I mean you go to the website and on the left hand side of the website is pretty much\nYou know all of your the\nGroups or whatever different things that they got you know cameras bicycles furniture jewelry projectors telephones TVs vehicles he was just talking about the vehicles there I mean it's a little bit of everything\nYeah that's right so that's a website that anyone can access by just going to technology\nSurplus people dot com and of course if you want to save a lot of money on computers ready to go with the last one is ten operating system refreshing beers at eight to zero each day what for thirty four and long would visit our website refresh computers dot net or give us a call for oh seven four seven eight eight two hundred\nWhat is it a primary animal geez it can the answer's no the ... I mean there's not a painkiller what does that do change the way you think it changes the way your ear your brain is wired a little bit ... by themselves are not very\nUm potent to do much of anything yes there is that the receptors exist but they're really rather minor players so most people that use CBD don't find much effect at all they may be you know their wallet maybe shorten by two or three or four hundred dollars before they figure that out so that kinda money isn't important to use and I suggest that you give it\nSo ... has been legal for decades longer so there's nothing new about them they've been around forever if they didn't work ten years ago what makes you think they're going to work now you could have gone into health food store ten years ago and bought these things okay didn't make any difference then doesn't make any difference now\nBut there is a very big multi level marketing push for these things right now are there are a lot of people out there pushing them and I and the word pushing is exactly the right thing that is what it's all about\nNow what do I believe in my heart of hearts that crate on that very much the same thing okay there are people out there that are getting sick from it and it's probably going to be made illegal as a result\nWith regards to marijuana in general the reason why people are pushing them the Charlotte's Web you know it's a critical legalized which is really decriminalize marijuana in CBD Oil is is\nThat if if somebody is going to go ahead and use regular marijuana and get that bugs that they so desperately think is important to their lifestyle okay and they happened to be positive that could cost them their job\nBy claiming that they're using CBD season and some of these other things and and Charlotte's Web they may be able to keep their job that's what the deal is all about number two is a gateway to try to bring it in to make the other stuff legal which I think it's a huge mistake\nOkay one of the problems that we see in our culture right now especially if you're an employer now most of the people that are listening or not employers their employees you know they sign only one side of the paycheck and it's the one that has the printing on it okay when you're signed the opposite side of the ... a paycheck\nYou're looking for people that have levels of motivation\nMarijuana is notorious for ripping destroying diminishing initiatives inertia and so on and so forth that's what it's all about the old Cheech and Chong movies were not a joke\nYou know I grew up in the in the sixties and seventies that was the way that it was you could always tell this donors there were the ones that that that were born with brains and graduated without\nOkay they didn't amount to much then and they amounted to ... or even less as time went on\nSo is it true that you'll find people that smoke socially and so on and so forth a veteran that keep uh keep good jobs and so yeah I'm sure you'll find them there is that they're out there but the ... the folks that really got nailed with this stuff did not do well at all now they'll make claims well\nMarijuana is not addictive and I call a nonsense to that one it's highly addictive why don't you try taking away from somebody that's that's that smokes on a regular basis and see how well that works well I can I can stop smoking marijuana anytime really\nYou know anybody who smokes cigarettes 'cause they say the same thing I can ... I've stopped smoking many times\n[laughter] equally crazy thing so what do I think about it I think it's nuts now with regard to the use of opioids to treat pain that is a different question entirely if you've got somebody with chronic pain chronic pain can be done you can be a defined as pain\nThat's not doing too an ongoing or acute illness that last longer than six weeks opiates really don't work very well\nSo leaving people on opiates for greater than six weeks is a bad idea\nNow let's say that you have something like osteoporosis and small are issues let's say with chronic arthritis that is not the same thing as having a chronic pain you you do in fact have chronic acute pain\nWhat's that mean it means that you have this acute pain that's ongoing it continues to break it continues to rub it continues to cause you issues very much like get out\nYou know you're going to get out and not have pain any one particular moment but if it acts up there comes a all all over again you can have recurrent urinary tract infections that are very painful you can have recurrent migraine\nOkay that is a chronic pain condition but it really isn't chronic pain\nChronic recurrent acute pain those individuals do well with opiates if they're used intelligently\nAnd that is kind of an interesting subject a subject of clause if they're used intelligent yeah opiates are funny things now you know this was a a very important part of my medical training a very important part of my practice I opened the first offer space pain center in\nThe United States I've been doing this for over forty years and what I Will tell you is this and that that opiates work just fine when they're used in combination with true pain killers and opiate painkiller to paint dollar\nOkay so how do you how do you treat pain you'd go for the underlying cause so if you've got somebody that has chronic foot pain\nBeing caused by out and you don't know that it's ... I don't care what opium to take it's not going to make any difference but you give them a non opiate called our appearing on when you know it goes away so it does that make el appearing all\nA pain medication answers affirmative what if you have a sinus infection and you train scientists how do you do that you can use that to his demands except they're not a very good choice most of the time and to call in or jokes and they work somewhat\nBut let's say you go ahead and you drain the sinuses and the pain gets better does that make Fiennes appeal system does that make the ... and\nDoes it make them animal genomics and the answer is yes\nIt makes them painkillers but none opiates with opiates again it gets back to the old tuning of the radio dial now these days you push buttons and and and numbers pop up digital is very different from analog but back in the day\nBack in the day when you actually had a dial that you twisted okay that you could over twist or you could under twist that that uh um capacitors have variable ... that did this okay look like like a like a series of fans that that flipped it on each other on the inside of the radio or radio dial or television now for that matter\nAnd so what would happen is that if you over the overcompensate if you're over adjusted this thing you Mr signal too much or too little and the same thing is true with opiates\nOpiates themselves can cause pain something called opiate induced type ...\nOr in many cases rebound pain so if you if you give opiates to people for headache it's one of the worst things you can doodle you've just made an addict now you made the addict ... congratulations Dr you just couldn't do you created the problem\nWhy because as the opiate levels decreased what's the side effects headache more heading really it okay so the trick to a lot of the stuff is to as to use as little as you can get by doing now in my business right now my practice right now I Am stuck with lots and lots of patients\nWho had been over traded they've\nSeen other doctors they get a really trashed on this stuff and it's my job to try to keep them from getting worse so what do I think about it I don't think Clinton works worth a darn I don't think CBD works and the opioids need to be used with a ... was care\nBut most paying conditions are best treated with gather Agnes anti inflammatory most relaxing anti convulsions\nAnd then you use a little bit of the pain killers to take the edge off you do that you'll do okay\nHow do you treat the pain of osteoporosis you treat the osteoporosis how do you treat the pain for set arthritis you deal with the arthritis how do you treat the pain to the migraine you treat the migraine or is it ... or whatever the cause is\nIf you have a nail stuck in your

any questions medical questions you got doc is the answers for you wait for for\nTwo two zero zero nine six by now before we had to Mike in the villages doc talk a little about the aesthetics that you're working on that on your Halloween is coming up you're going to want to look good for Thanksgiving and all the other holidays you got some new stuff going on don't you know we have that but you ... you got to understand okay if you want to look\nBut for the holidays and if you want to look good for that class reunion homecoming or whatever the heck it is that you're going to be doing\nOr just saying you're you're ... you know you see your exit party I don't you don't want to ban of women to break up [laughter] well you you know you wanted to kind of make a mark on this sort of thing\nNow is the time to start planning this out because when you're looking at things like that except take some minimum six weeks for things that just start to show why is that because it takes about six weeks with the skin to turn over\nSo if you're looking at doing something for the holidays you are right up on on the time limit for this next several weeks are going to be very very important if you want to look good for that New Year's New Year's eve party or if you want to look good for 'em even the Christmas Party it's about time\nSo what do we do it stages of life we actually have a medically driven aesthetic center where does this mean something usual ... you know there's no spot about this to come in you get down to business you get your get one needs to be done and you leave [laughter]\nOkay so we're not interested in sticking cucumbers and your eyes nor are we going to beat on drums or play a weird music what we do we go in there and we look at the skin for what it is which is the largest organ system in your body you have more skin than anything else\nIs it a dermatology practice no you know we deal with diseases of the skin sure enough but the focus isn't in on dermatology we have good dermatologist in this town okay we refer to them all the time but when it comes to the aesthetic portion of it\nI don't think anybody does better than we do and why because we look at the skin again not just as a Kansas but as a piece of art a living piece of art\nSo you need to make sure your nutrition is measure properly set up that you're a neutral particles your ... and the hormone balance is done correctly because if you don't have appropriate hormone balance I don't care what you do to the skin it isn't going to make a lot of difference who are wasting your time and money\nSo doing Botox and somebody that is out of balance with regards to their thyroid is a huge waste if you're a good editor opens aren't set up properly you're wasting your money so what we do is we focus\nOn the whole picture was I mean you don't focus on anything you'd look at everything\nFrom the top to bottom so ... we do a pretty decent job it's not our our main line of business but it does make a big difference especially this time of the year\nSo if you're interested give us a holler you know you can combined look is over it's not going to cost anything to find out for happy to meet you anyway even if you don't do anything with us at least you can come by and learn something\nSo that's what that's what we're doing with regards to that extent thank you for asking\nAll right there we go ... anything at all what else do we want to talk about the effort he had been saying the age that sad 'cause this this ... you know we get a lot of calls on a on a ... we get calls on a regular basis not on the show so much but in the office people wondering about tax deducted ability\nOf their ... over the counter sorts of things stuff that's not the surgical not

again that's the phone number for upper stages of life for oh seven six seven nine three three three seven\nAlright credit because you're going to kick us off here right now welcome in the stages like what's your question for Dr David Kline\nOh thank you Dr ... for taking the call I'd listen to a long time and it's probably not your favorite color [laughter]\nOkay um however is are are really ... years or so I thought this\nWas I just started only nine and um I Want to do it or or to regional swimmer diver fisherman outdoors than I Am in the end of the doctors in Twenty years I've never had a blood test I like that but I really love it'd be patient cool\nUm can you just tell me what I should be doing first and and there's the ... while you're\nLike me [laughter] I Love business owner\nAnd I'd say my insurance for all my employees but you know I just had never done that so I I I'm not sure but I really would like to do what I Need to do and I know there's some things going on I could tell you about later but um well I really think I should\nEars to scoop okay and they get you know get there's no particular need in my life or in yours to necessarily go to the doctor's office just to ... to do it okay women a little bit different okay they need to have these pap smears done they should have ... uh you know the mammograms done periodically but men are a little bit different\nThere's things that you can expect to change as you start to get older you know you're close to fifty if you're otherwise healthy and you're taking care of yourself and you're using your brain in terms of what you eat and what you do you're probably going to do just fine\nYou know periodically it's not a bad idea to make sure that you're doing well just like in business you're a business owner okay how do you how do you improve your business and it's by measuring\nThat which you measure you have a chance to improve if you don't measure something you do not have a prayer to be able to get any better and that's just the way these things go so getting blood work done every so often it's not a bad thing but you've done well so far\nBut okay what you don't know necessarily is what your blood pressure's doing although I'd be willing to bet you that you stop in the public's never done for free periodically just out of curiosity so you know your blood pressure is doing okay it's not a bad idea to see how your hormones are doing it's not a bad idea to see how your cholesterol triglycerides and so on and so forth are doing\nBecause that's the sort of feedback you have to have in order to make appropriate course adjustments\n... it's like if you're a voter okay you're up there on the water if you don't check where you are periodically you're going to become part of the uh\nYou know part of the landscape you know it's just the way it's going to go you're going to either end up on the on the horizon or you're going to end up on the rocks so what does it take to become a a patient with is just a simple telephone call\nNow insofar as your your health insurance concern I didn't have health insurance personally until I was thirty five\nOkay why gives I took my you know I took my chances network that just fine for the other people didn't work out quite so well\nSo in business you do keep business owners insurance why because if you have business interruption it can cost you your entire career you do want to have premise insurance you do want to have certain things you have to attract your you know employees and so and so forth\nSo there are different reasons to have insurance but in the health care industry the most expensive way to get health care is to own health insurance\nSo what do I think you made a mistake the answer is no\nYou cannot get every bit of the benefit of insurance by paying cash for things and in fact then you're not paying those premiums for nothing\nSo what I Would suggest that you do frankly because at forty nine it's about time you did and that's to get um insurance for things like major medical major extra or access to medical that'd be a high deductible policy Fifteen thousand bucks or more why\nBecause you can sustain losses up to that point you know if you lost your roof cost you Fifteen grand you'd find a way to make it if you needed a new car Fifteen grand you find a way to make it seem things through their health\nBut you end up going in there and having a major battle reception because of some problem\nThat could be a hundred grand that's not so easily dealt with so get yourself some high a high deductible policy I mine's ten grand\nOkay have I ever used at the answer is no\nThank God for that you know I'd you know I don't feel like I've been cheated not a bit I feel like I've been lucky you know there's no scars on my adamant to to to a test otherwise so congratulations on remaining healthy but it wouldn't be such a bad idea to get a a a little bit of twist rather what ... what do we actually find a good number of people come in with that\nWhat's wrong with you nothing wire here 'cause I Want to keep it that way [laughter]\nOut of batteries and re route yeah highest use of my time is to prevent illness\nOkay is it is just a heck of lot smarter I'm not there to find things wrong I'm there to to to steer people in the right direction\nDr means teacher it does not mean healer okay so if I can teach people how to do things better and that's where I'm doing right now that is my calling it isn't just sit back and stick band aids on people or to take a high blood pressure and bring it down you can train a monkey to do that\nWhen I was at Duke one of the things they used the teachers in surgery was that you can ... it it takes years ten to twelve years to train a surgeon okay but to train a technician only takes five years four years okay do you want to be a technician or ... or do you want to be a scientist and that's just the way that it goes you had that choice there and that's the way it is in life\nOn it moving right along here weighing in Orlando will come out of the show what's your question for Dr David climbed briefly\nYes I was wondering while you're you lady magnesium they were used to be kept so but now they're hard tablet\n'cause there's a lot of people couldn't swallow that that the tablets okay real simple I tried to keep it as cheap as I could in the tablets are cheaper to make\nIt so we had to go to the capsules because I had more people telling me that they couldn't swallow the suckers than people who were able to take it so you know what happened was I I used I used the tablets until they personally until they disappeared so I had no problem swallowing it\nBut some of these folks have all manners are problems with it so I had to make that change it was just simply a matter of convenience for the patients and and uh you know that's but that's really what it was cost about three dollars more but more people were able to do it to not Deborah in Ormond Beach your question for the dock\nWelfare stock of the time I had surgery around five six months ago or ... and um [noise] 'cause I climbed a ladder for Thirty years and now I always feel like\nI'm like it'll fall like my brain is it clear that will know if I should be doing so different kind of supplement\nSaid how old are you know hey come on now so ... how old are they okay you don't even act like at the age thing 'cause how\nDoes it does it oh no no no it makes a huge difference okay because what happens with the anesthesia okay is it tends to shut down the adrenal glands and the older you are the more likely that is to occur and the treatment for this ... it depends very very greatly on this\nSo what I Would do would be to get a quarter so level a de ... level and what you can do to get your head back\nOkay is to treat the hormonal imbalance that happened\nNo for six months it's unlikely that you did this as a result of an embassy which can happen with hip surgery that can make you feel pretty funky but my guess is that we'll ... we'll bring you back as ... need alone\nOkay we have a product called memories ... called da da and then ... I but I wouldn't do any of those things that we've got some blood work because you need to know where you're starting it or know where you're finishing\nThis the second thing is called die mental glycine we'll give you focus back quickly but that doesn't fix the underlying problem\nA real quick we won't recall but I'll just tell you Jonathan is calling from Miami he says he's bleeding Everytime he ... and he's not sure why okay what will happen there smoking more times than not this has caused by an angel fish or or ... and this is like a little break in the mucosal you'll do okay you'll go to ... bared down\nAnd it breaks the skin kind of like having a split in your lip\nThat'll leave a blood on the outside of the stool usually in streaks the other thing that will happen um is that you can end up with a hammer woods that'll do this so you know kind of internal hemorrhage what you may or may not be able to feel external hemorrhage or really obvious when you go to clean yourself after you uh poop\nSo but that's generally what it's all about but would you have to be careful of that you don't have rectal or or a sequel Carson already felt rectal or a colon cancer so there's some things that you need to do to rule that out for more than likely it's going to be a ... a Fisher or ...\nAll right ... you're listening to stages life right here I knew them six point five W db award back with the ... next week same time same place thanks listening we're all day long on our asked the experts weekend you're listening to the news Ninety six point five WTO [noise]\nThis is news Ninety six point five happier baby\nTurns first for breaking news\nFour hours a day\nFour o'clock here and use Ninety six point five W DVR turning out to be a really good Sunday all update on how things are going to a little bit tough story across the country following the shooting at a Jewish synagogue in Pittsburgh people are coming together to condemn religious intolerance New York Mayor Bill de Blasio joining other leaders saying his city will never succumb to hate\nUh the way that that that President Trump\nSees a oh I Can't I'm done losing the word but the the way that they laid on the rules that you have to play by right and they're taking a lot of those restrictions off of companies which allow them to really prosper\nThe more restrictions you have on a a company or the less money they're going to be able to make and shareholders make less money because of revenues are lower and blah blah blah it just goes down this rabbit hole\nTo the point where companies aren't making as much money if you lift off those restrictions\nThen you're off to the races and if that goes away there's a lot of people that are concerned that the market takes a dive at that point and\nAnd the other thing about telling everybody the market you know just ride it out and it'll\nOkay and it always comes back and all that is not everybody is a long long term investor I mean we have other radio shows here on the radio station\nA yesterday and earlier today or you know they say um you know the market always comes back over the course of Thirty years you know you're going to have ups and downs and all that they are not every body is a young long term investor some people are getting ready to retire right now or some people are already retired\nYeah no that's absolutely true but let's think about it from this perspective if we're looking a back to two thousand and the market fell from say two thousand two thousand three\nWhat the heck did you do from two thousand three to two thousand seven he tried to make back what you lost in those three years right right so we're just running down the hill and running back up to the same place on the hill and then from two thousand Seventy thousand eight down to the bottom in two thousand nine\nIt took basically from two thousand nine of two thousand fourteen to get back up to the same levels so you spent two thousand\nSeven\nGoing down to two thousand nine and then you're just running back up the hill to try to get back to where you are so really I was fourteen years' worth a sideways move and if you don't have fourteen years trying to give it a ... place then you got a problem and you've got to try to deal with and when we think about\nHow the markets actually work and how long sometimes it takes I mean there have been times recently where the market went down in the end just booming went straight back up again we call that heavy bottom recovering a but it doesn't always work out that way and if we have a fifty percent correction you know we we went down ten percent\nWe hit the ten percent mark and bounce a little bit and then we went down again\nSo the question is are we going to hold it Fifteen Percent or we hold at twenty percent\nTo twenty percent so bear market and I think there's just a lot of folks out there that are concerned about those issues so if you have a four one K. like you were talking about and I are re whatever it is\nAnd your your perspective is that retirement account only makes money if the market goes up\nThere's a whole lot of things that you need to learn I the the the amount of people that are coming into the academy just recently and that is their primary concern you know we talk a lot about trading activity and making strings of income right but there are so many people out there there was a guy just recently this week he said to me\nWhile I heard on the radio show and I decided to go ahead and do what you told me to do and come to the workshop because I got a four one K. and it is I Can't I Can't sleep at night [laughter] around his earned that it's going to go down right so\nAnd that's what we hear from a lot of folks you know even just on the open Mike when the market has a really bad day like Wednesday people freaking out you know and that's why I called you on Thursday and said uh you know tell us a little bit about what's going on but [noise]\nUm so helping people sleep at night uh is one of the things you do through various strategies that you teach at the online training academy a and you mentioned you know not not every body as a traitor that is looking to make a stream of income but that is also something that you teach at the online training academy\nYeah so here's here's what it comes down to it at our at the crux of what we do at the Academy of how we are in a position where we teach people how to make money with the frequent buying and selling of items in the financial markets now sometimes that involves stock\nAnd sometimes that involves a futures are for acts are options there's a lot of different opportunities out there but we're just talking about the buying and selling of things now the frequency at which you actually buy and sell makes the determination as to whether or not you're trying to build income\nShorter time frames or you're trying to build wealth longer time frames and when we talk about you know most people when they're looking at their\nLong term wealth accounts they're looking at it from the perspective of stocks and mutual funds and you know those longer term type investments right but if you're interested in in generating strings of income\nThen maybe you pursue some of our leverage dasa classes that we talk about I wouldn't say our leverage asset classes delivered staff the classes that we teach so we teach options with teach for X we teach futures are all of those different levers gas at classes give traders the ability to take a small amount of money\nAnd do a lot of heavy lifting in the market is generating above average returns\nFor people that have listens to this radio show before for people that have been with us for a few weeks or you know I listen to a few times uh this is generally when you start talking about options for Exxon futures and leverage and all that that's this is always where I say\nIf you don't know anything about options or for extra futures you just have no idea of how much opportunity there is out there\nYou know you have no clue of how much you're missing out on how much potential and opportunity there is I mean this is you know where it all comes in what you're about to tell everybody\nYeah you don't know what you don't know right I mean we hear that all the time but when you're talking about trying to generate some some legitimate income or trying to generate a a wealth account that you maybe you got a late start on it then you got to have an opportunity to kind of ramp up or a super charge those types of returns\nSo that's where the the options the future's in the ... come in because uh you know there are some people out there that have great jobs and they they don't want to trade for a living\nAnd they just want to generate some additional income because they love what they do and they just need some extra money to make sure that they got all their bills covered and have a retirement account built right right\nSo you know I Know how this works because I was a youth pastor back in the day and I loved that work out like work when the kids like teaching I liked everything about it except for the fact that you just didn't make very much money and that's the reality if you are giving back to somebody in one way or another\nMost of the time whether it's a teacher or a pastor or whatever it is radio hosts radio [laughter] you just don't you don't make a lot of money and if you would like to find you know you want to keep doing what you're doing but you need an additional stream of income that doesn't take up all your time\nTraining is the thing to do\nBecause it ... I mean the best traitors I Know trade thirty minutes sixty minutes a day and then they let it go or if you want to trade really quick income you can trade the futures market if you want to spend a little bit more time in your trains or perhaps you know look at 'em every week or so at the most\nUh or learn to protect your long term wealth accounts that's where options come in so it just depends on what you want to do as to kind of the direction that we can steer you but if you're one of those people that look like and feeling like um you just really want to learn away to supplement your income\nRegardless of what your goal is a students at at the academy are overcoming whatever financial circumstance they got in front of them\nYeah well I mean we talk about that almost every week right every body is that a different place in life everybody has different goals but the one thing that we all can agree on\nRepublican or Democrat [laughter] I Know one thing we can all agree on a generally is we all want and need to make money there are very few people that would say they don't need to make any more money and even those people that don't necessarily need the money a lot of them would still like to make more money so\nUh again there's a you know there's a lot of ways to skin a cat and that's kind of the analogy we use it to the financial markets because\nA lot of the things you talked about people just don't realize people don't realize\nI'm how little money you can get involved in the markets within the for X market and the futures market people don't realize that you can trade all different hours a day they just think the stock market closes at four thirty when they're at work you know that's it right but again there's so much opportunity\nOr that if you go to the workshop uh which they have each and every week at the online trading academies if you go to one of the workshops on the light bulbs will start to go on for you as you go through the three hour course with Chris or a with one of the other instructors if you go to the St Petersburg location\nAnd when you start to see this opportunity it doesn't take long\nFor people to start kicking themselves into behind of why didn't I Do this sooner or oh my God I Can't believe that\nJust that one strategy is a strategy that people don't even realize like\nThere are people right now saying you can make money when the market goes down you know so again there's so much opportunity and you're talking about for X if you don't know that's the foreign currency market in fifty to one leverage twenty to one in futures ten to one in options\nAs we head to this break again if you want to learn more about trading for income learning how to invest to protect the wealth you already have picked up the phone right now\nEight eight eight six one eight nine two four nine eight eight eight six one eight nine two four nine a limited number of seats have been made available for free for radio show

T. A. has set aside a limited number of seats for radio show listeners\nDon't wait because by the time we get to the end of the show all the free seats be filled up eight eight eight six one eight nine two four nine\nI'm Tony Marino he as Chris urban and Chris you'll hear we are at that time of the show once again that time of the week once again you know what I wait\nFor this time of the show every week we just have to get through the first two segments to my favorite part\nTo you and our thousands of listeners\nAre waiting to see what Tony saw in the news this week [noise]\nThis week is comes from USA Today All right and that's you know something that almost everybody is familiar with some one of these obscure financial website\nThat whenever your financial website Go well they're not up to us but you know by All right so you know we've been talking a lot about the market's going down because that's what's been in the news a lot ... you know how people need to protect\nTheir their their their ah retirement funds and all of these\nSo I have an article here from USA Today stocks facing yet another scary October [noise] uh and I guess the subtitle on this one would be on track for the worst October since the two thousand a financial crisis that's what really got my attention because I ...\nIf an actual crisis I'm not I'm not so well versed in the fact that every October as bad um but I Do remember the two thousand a financial crisis so what do you think of is what we you know we had a conversation a while back I Can't remember how many months back\nAnd we're we're I asked the question what what is typically the worst month for stocks to remember this call right right that was just a like two or three shows ago yeah you you know do you remember what the worst month for stocks was\nI think it was September you're right you're right up to ... uh but\nYou would think it would probably be October because actually the majority of the crashes that have occurred have occurred in October\nSo October is a pretty scary month and if if you're looking for a roller coaster ride of a month in the financial markets October as when you should be looking for that\nYeah well this October certainly has been like I said I Can't recall specifically past October but this this October certainly has been a roller coaster ride and maybe of September is the worst month of the year on the markets\nAnd it's like it all starts in September and then you know you know what really hits the fan and October\nRight and we were talking earlier in the show about the mid term elections right right before elections usually has a pretty tough time on the markets and if the elections or in November then I Would make sense that October as a rough time\nBut you know I I really do have a lot of people I mentioned this in the in the first segment a lot of people coming into the academy I think even more so than we\nProbably have in the last five or six months just lately that are concerned about the fact that they've got their nest egg they've got whatever they've worked hard to build their wealth accounts and they are scared as heck\nThat we're going to have a repeat of two thousand or a repeat of two thousand seven and eight\nAs the market lost fifty percent of its value and I get it um I Can't say that that's not going to happen I Can't say that it is going to happen but I can tell you right now there's a lot of volatility in the markets and if you're an investor in the markets for the long term\n... there's a lot of concern out there are people work hard to save their money and when they see that you know one day the market's down eight hundred points are six hundred points in the next day it's up four hundred or five hundred points up and down up and down you don't know what to think about the market so you really have to\nIt's important that you actually learn how money works when it comes down to it you know we we can talk about trading and generating income but if you aren't even interested in that if you're just thinking about I got this chunk of money that I'm trying to retire within a couple of years and I want to make sure that I

two four nine so Chris I Know that we still have some ground that we want to cover before we wrap things up here and this is a short segment but there is one thing that we forgot to talk about\nWe forgot to talk about it yeah well yeah I forget the first\nOf all you and I are both here so we didn't win the the mega millions or the six hundred forty million dollar Powerball\nBut I told you I was out of town so\nNo no [laughter] well I'm pretty sure you would hear it in one but then again knowing you that's not truly how committed you are to helping people you might still be here I to working my two days a week like you always talk about but [laughter]\nRight but for everybody else that's listening and didn't win you know if that's your uh if if that's your financial plan for retirement if you're if you're hoping to win the lottery to retire if that's your financial plan that is probably not a good plan just like you sometimes say Chris\nUh uh ... hoping and praying is not a strategy\nWithout a strategy that's exactly right no you're you're right I think that it's important that people recognize the fact that if you're looking at the financial markets some people think of the financial markets as a big game or they they call it you know they think it's gambling\nI gotta tell ya lay in the market is the farthest thing from gambler if you have some knowledge and some experience if you don't know what you're doing then I Would say it is closer to gambling because you're just kind of thrown your money away\nUm but if you understand how the market actually works and what's really going on behind the scenes you know we come up the markets at the academy for a very different perspective than most\nWe don't use a lot of traditional technical analysis if you're familiar with seeing charts with all sorts of quickly lines on them that's what I'm referring to when I say traditional technical analysis everything that we do comes down to a very simple concept and that is supply and demand\nThe market is driven off supply and demand so what we're doing is we're trying to identify how the banks and institutions are doing their thing\nAs opposed to how most what we call retail traders the individuals out there are doing there's because most retail traders are losing money and most banks and institutions are making money and guess where the money comes from that the banks and institutions are making their it's coming from the retail traders right right right you'll ...\nYou'll lose all of your money to them right for everybody that went in there is a loser right\nOkay so we have to teach people at different methodology about how to get into the markets and really make money [noise] uh and I tell you it's not hard\nIt's just different you have to learn you have to be exposed to what's the proper way to do things but and I tell ya\nAnybody that is is tired these days is somebody that should come to the workshop and just spent some time with us and why say people are tired I'm not talking about necessarily sleepy tired I'm Talking about people that are tired of working long hours just to get by\nOr people that are tired of not getting the returns that they expect in their retirement accounts or or maybe not sleeping at night because they're concerned about another market crash or maybe you're just tired are relying on somebody else and you like to stand on your own two feet\nOr maybe you're concerned and you're tired about not being able to retire\nYeah you're older and you wish you a retired already but you're not and you're tired of not being retired\nOr yeah or maybe you're just tired of not being able to see your kids games because you're working so many hours you know if that's your situation I come to the workshop and just explore and sea of trading thing for you will recognize it's not for everybody but you know what it is a ... opportunity for most people if you just get the knowledge and the basic understanding how the markets work\nSo raise your hand if you fall in any one of those categories of you're tired of any of those things\nWow I see a lot I ended up on a hike for Chris people in the one hand on the alright eight eight six one eight nine two four nine call right now you owe it to yourself\nYou owe it to your family this literally could change your life a three hour free workshop you have nothing
