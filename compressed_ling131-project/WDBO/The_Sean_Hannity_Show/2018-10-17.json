Post\nIt managed after visiting the consulate you lived in Saudi Arabia is not an American citizen but he he wrote for the Washington Post for many years Saudi council it can be heard on the tape saying during the show these tortured do this outside you're going to get me in trouble or in another tape\nAnd unknown person again I Can't corroborate doesn't only telling you what the New York post and the British newspapers are reporting on one Turkish newspaper\nIf you want to live when you come to Saudi Arabia being quiet anyway returned to Riyadh on Tuesday ahead of uh\nIn search of his residence part of the official Turkish probe and took the show gave disappearance that is the the Saudi council he's back in Saudi Arabia\nMiddle East English language website holding a Turkish sources saying that there were no attempt to interrogate could show ... but that as Saudi hit team came to kill him\nSource told the site that his dad took seven minutes rented physician doctor Salah Mohammed al ... body listening to music as he began to cut to show these body while he was still alive\nIn New York Post Turkish authorities believe the show he was killed by a special team of Fifteen Saudi officials though the kingdom the crown prince of Saudi Arabia denying that says these claims are baseless this report comes as Mike Pompeo met Wednesday\nAfter being in in Saudi Arabia now meeting with the Turkish president aired to one and the Turkish foreign minister ... rubber arriving from reality where he said the Saudis promised a thorough investigation\nMight bump pay on Wednesday refusing to blame Riyadh said he didn't want to talk about any of the facts a day after the president said there's got to be a presumption of innocence but he wants\nAll the facts top us diplomat diplomat Wednesday\nRefusing to blame Riyadh blah blah blah blah several of the members of the alleged hit team were found to a close ties to the crown prince\nMohammed bin Salman Solomon\nAccording to a a photo by the New York times Turkish officials have shared an audio recording with the U.S in Saudi Arabia that they say ... was murdered by Saudi operatives upset the president saying they didn't get any tape but this time I\nAm a pro government newspaper reporting that could show geese apple watch recorded the interrogation torturing killing well I Would assume that watch exists in this happened and what we believe that he might have been taken out and body pieces not sure that they wouldn't take the watch at that point but\nBefore leaving Riyadh aid Pompeo told reporters that the Saudi leaders made no exception on who they would hold accountable\nAnyway so now according to the British newspaper the St circus official Turkish officials have a recording of blah blah blah and that had to pack up and down the apple watch and you have some of the other people saying it's highly unlikely the show he could have broadcast the signal from his apple watches it was too far for Bluetooth connection\nYou know I think what's happened clearly if the church and the Saudi constantly had the ... of wired they have transmitters and the Turks don't trust any diplomats and have been into most of the embassies most consulates in Turkey and they listen to what's\nGoing on and we'll find out in this case um might take I think it probably all happen but I don't think we should rush to judgment because the truth is going to come out probably sooner rather than later\nJoining us now Dr Sebastian Gorka former White House advisers brand new book is phenomenal by the way why we fight defending the feeding rather not defending the feeding America's enemies with no apologies\nDan hop but Fox News contributor thirty or CIA up operations officer a doctor Gorka I assume you agree with me that\nSigns point to the Saudis assassinating murdering this guy in a a far Paraguay that's what I'm thinking\nYou know there's a ruin in warfare or report from the battlefield must be question\nUh I think this man is that whether or not these audio tapes exist is another question but it's absolutely certain that this individual was caught between two nations that wants to dominate the Sunni Muslim world\nThe new optimum Edwin regime of turkey and the place of Islam Saudi Arabia and this man was caught in the middle\nHowever however this isn't the fake news we've got to be accurate this man was a journalist wasn't an American so what they're trying to spin\nIt was a foreign national read them and it was a common type ... you wrote commentary and he has a long decades long history of ... the Muslim Brotherhood and there's also related to the biggest\nArab um the ... of the twenty first century ... so all of these things are total statements with factual\nWhat do you think a missed the hop and it's been a while but uh my friend Dan is good to have your back I Know this has been your life and your business for so many years um my gut is pretty clear on this uh I think this man was murdered and the most evil Ruth ... brutal way possible\nAnd I think that the president is wise knowing that we're going to get to the truth now there's no doubt we'll go and we're going to have the truth rushing to that point is not smart in my opinion\nI I agree with you uh look there's a lot of evidence that we have already we nailed it Fifteen Saudi traveled on the Gulf Stream Arafat arrived at the cost of the day the show he entered and we know eat fish again never acted if it costs ...\nA week do the makeup of those of the fifteenth out for them apparently part amount of ... the one of them the forensic doctor you referred to as listening to music well\nAllegedly membrane ... body after he was killed\nOr what we don't know\nWhat was the orders that were given for these Fifteen Saudi and who gave them the orders and then to whom did they report posts for them those are all questions we need to answer\nThat President I think was a hundred percent right to dispatch and secretary of state to gather the fact emphasize that they were issue of grave concerns what\nWill get that fact with accuracy and a lack of the that's what matters I Will remind the listeners that when they're gay fifth fall with poison back in March\nBritish home secretary said they needed a void speculation while we allow the College of carry on their investigation I think that's what's going on here and the last thing I Would just highlight is that Well Secretary if I'm paying with meeting and doing it public diplomacy I'm quite sure that the FBI legalized ashamed Riyadh\nAnd the other in a central or in an uncle or probably eating with their Turkish and Saudi counterparts that's a collect the evidence but said to be a part of reviewing it shot\nYou know it's I Wish everything could fit in nicely neatly into a box assuming that I Believe that the Saudis are involved and whether it goes straight to the top I don't know the crown prince says denying it\nI'm kind of having a hard time buying that myself but knowing that there is a very different country but now it gets complicated because fall so the Saudis the Egyptians Jordanians the Israelis the United states the Emirates they're all fighting against the rainy and had you have any in the region\nAnd their quest for nuclear weapons and the instability that would cause the entire world um I Know everybody Dr Gorka would like to say that okay we're cutting off all ties with Saudi Arabia were done where this was that\nUm I think there's there will be consequences severe consequences the president said\nUm but it gets a little rougher what do you do if you're also trying to battle another enemy I mean the United states did partner with our arch enemy is the former Soviet Union to defeat\nOr not the Islam in World War two\nYeah absolutely I mean you you don't make perfect the enemy of the good\nGeopolitics as like politics itself domestically it as the the uh all the possible lumpy on over the perfect I'm On the truth fish or we have a lot of leverage over with Saudi Arabia or at the beginning of the Trump Administration we established very very\nGood times through a and B as the mom had been found but with ... those relationships are not going to be tested but this is a nation\nRevival depends upon our support militarily and I'm ... and trading so there's a lot but reachable average against Saudi Arabia but you're absolutely right this is part of a\n... I Wish we would've leverage did in the last eight years when Obama was president we don't knowing that gays and lesbians or killed were routinely and Christians and Jews are persecuted and women are treated like fourth class citizens I mean you know that never seems to come up when there's a Democratic president\nShould kind of give you one example of how bad it was so this guy who was a deep deep sympathize with the Muslim Brotherhood President Obama when he went on his global opponents tools and he started it in future who worked in the front row of that event\nTurkish officials indicating evidence of Saudis murdered just show ...

I mean I've talked to people on the left they you drive them nuts I mean you give them fit so fury that I thought only I could do\nIs try to see things just auditor disgusting\nAnd I think one of the things that they're ceding most about that what they're most hating right now is the fact that both Claire McCaskill and Phil Bredesen either Senate candidates one of them is the United states senator had been forced to respond to these videos all over the local media coverage I mean it's\nIt's it's critical mass in Tennessee in Missouri they're they're they're the local TV stations are calling me\nAnd the D.C journalists do not want to talk about this in fact I just got to have like all the Washington Post he's tweeting at me and he's and he's saying well you know she's been public about her somebody's position I said what about other things she's saying here but she hasn't been public about so they they very much hate mission for good reason well\nListen I when you expose fraud what this is now it's supposed to something that I'd been pointing out for a while we have Maxine Waters on tape saying they keep telling me not to say it and every time they tell me I'm going to say it anyway impeach forty five impeach forty five\nThen we see the center for American Progress warning every single Democrat running for office told talk about immigration we know\nWe know we won't open borders and eliminate ice\nBut don't tell the people the truth about what you're really gonna do don't tell them what you have\nIs a massive fraud propaganda lie campaigning being perpetrated by a party that has lost any sense of moderation that has no agenda that they're willing to talk about that ... that is a really scary\nScenario for the country and for people that ... that's the only way they can win is to lie to hide who they are\nThat's what the stories about these red state Democrats have been on your show no ah this is the fourth or third third video between Tennessee in Missouri\nAnd one of the staffers agrees that McCaskill quote essentially\nHas to lie to get elected and this is not just one staffer these are staffers throughout her office hiding hiding in masking the source of contributions one staffer says it's acting beautiful it's great when it works for us not against us\nTo take the money through ... indirect means in order to I guess appealed to moderate to the front page New York times story today about how these\nPro life pro gun Democrats are shrinking\nConstituency in Missouri the Democratic party have voted these people out but McCaskill still have to appear moderate so that she can get elected so it's it is a truism that in order to get elected in a state of Missouri or Tennessee you basically have to mislead voters to get elected as a Democrat and that's what these stories and cover\nYou know the thing is to me um I think we the American people had it when the Democratic party abandon any sense of\nDue process under the law equal application under our laws you know immediately I Believe her but they also said the minute the cabin all was announced we are going to oppose them any way by any means necessary\nAnd then when all the the the allegations are getting more severe more severe and everyone's saying well I Believe her not even want to hear from judge Kavanaugh presumption of innocence at all\nAnd when corroborating so-called corroborating stories fell apart they still didn't care\nAnd I think the American people are watching that we have a story out today where you got these ads are his middle class of vendors attacking to Minnesota GOP candidates are assaulted one is a woman\nA name as state representative Sarah Anderson punched by an anarchist EPA trying to stop him from kicking her campaigns on\nI mean this this is now the Democratic party and you're exposing it\nAnd the ... and yeah you're going to be hated but I think ... shining a light on truth I thought this was this stuff that's sixty minutes used to do\nWell undercover McCaskill's statement McCaskill Claire McCaskill issued a videotape state which is unbelievable and they play a little bit on your show last night and she said the number that quoted she says well start on the Josh Hawley us to her opponent would be part of ... billion betting someone in my campaign first of all I categorically unequivocally deny\nThat he does not work for me he does not work with me I've never spoken to any of these candidates I stay away from candidates I investigate candidates but she just went on TV Sean Claire McCaskill just passively stated that Josh was involved in is the attorney general Missouri was involved in this and then she says three times I committed fraud\nWill will go by what recording the people being honest that's brought\nIn their own were there over there on our side\nMy words I'm not the one who said quote get over it this is a direct quote for him for staffers nixed a roast about how she's going to impeach Trump that you can tell the moderates to get over it after she gets elected that's their words and she's calling me a fraud stir for telling the truth to the American people it's the job of investigative reporting\nTo expose the truth and and I think she didn't have to respond to her response because it's filled with lies and then you wouldn't do an accusation\nI'm just glad that you were able to get all of this out and before the election um why do I suspect that there's probably going to be more tape other candidates well I have known you know what for a decade or more\n[laughter] that's right yeah I mean ... you know am I Am oh a pun intended Missouri now you know my ... next is to release a candidate a bit at a time we have to United States senators\nAnd their candidates opposing them responding to our investigative work we're lying in their responses were sort of using the ... tactics against the landscape stealing skew is to get the reaction and use
