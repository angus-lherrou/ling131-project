Ramirez the New York times wouldn't even public publish it because they discovered nobody that corroborate her story number one\nNumber two her own words that she was a ... to quickly had gaps in her memory and the fact that we now know that you know so many different things that we didn't know before\nAnd that this ... was actually out there soliciting information from her fellow yo classmates the New York times reported that because she quote couldn't remember\nThen in the case of Julie sweat Nick\nWe saw her backtrack dramatically from her original story and her claim that judge Kavanaugh

and haw that I'm asking a tough question give me any cooperation you have\nI don't hit the cooperation because I'm not do and I and I'm not the one who was investigating that's right and we talked about this last week wait a minute what everybody's talking hunted\nWith a full and fair investigation get married at twenty cooperating witnesses the FBI did not asking the FBI added\nNo excuse me every main person that was mentioned in the case of professor Ford and the case of miss for me or as the New York times tried to corroborated they spent an entire week interviewed dozens of people\nAnd then she herself was calling around to other yell classmate saying I don't I don't remember do you remember I'm not sure if it was him that exposed himself\nAnd then we all watched Julie sweat Nick\nShift and backtrack from her original allegation which was gang raping and systematic drug gang of women\nCould you have any crop rotation for any of these incidents at all\nI'm not during the negotiations that I don't expect that you would expect and I did\nBut I Know you're following you can't find any cooperation either can you as a matter of fact we're getting just the opposite of corroboration people are saying those they don't recall those stories at all that it or that to happen that way at all\nSo the charges are college roommate in the ... the last twenty four hours a talking about uh the judges drinking oughta honestly I I think this is horrendous for shy and the idea\nOf not answering my question I'm asking you if the people make serious claims allegations on a serious real topic because there are real evil horrible president predators in this world\nAnd they mentioned that there are specific people have you interview them that they're going to tell you my story is true and it turns out to be the opposite don't you believe in the presumption of innocence Danielle McLaughlin yes or no\nOf course I Do show they sound like it or something\nI of course I Believe in the ... and the and the presumption of innocence I also believe that the FBI should've been allowed to do a full and fair and they take action and that is why you're going to see on the left a huge ... and I understand that this is energizing the geology hey\nI Know I was not talking one what was on a second once you interview looking in the case of professor Ford before people she identified were at the party and none of the four have any recollection of the abandoned the one eye witness says it didn't happen\nWhat else are they supposed to do is we don't know where it happened we don't know when it happened we don't know the location she doesn't know how she got there I got home from their what else did the FBI to do they had already given sworn statements under the penalty of a felony\nAnd all they did is reiterate those statements that the FBI what else could they possibly do Danielle in that case\nAnd being on the opposite side of it ... at the FBI just\nJust not that was can they pass certainly do knowing the facts as we know that we don't know where we don't know when I don't know huh\nOK okay she thinks the fact that she doesn't run into wearing out where and

fellow they all said it didn't happen the way she said one witness or didn't happen\nAnd my question is what the FBI do if they don't know the location that can't be looking parenthetically for

vote Friday Saturday big votes big opportunity\nWe have Susan Collins and senator snowflake saying that they are satisfied that the comprehensive investigation or the FBI Lisa Murkowski saying that hasn't had time to read it Democrats in an uproar angry upset lashing out at the FBI\nWhat would they supposed to do except to interview the people that was supposed to corroborate the stories of this\nThat's what they did they got what they wanted and it never ever going to be enough All right back to our phones as we say Hi first Brandon is in Colorado Brandon Hi how are you glad you called and welcome to the Sean Hannity show\nHey thanks Sean I grew up in spent most of my life in Arizona where my family's still it\nI'm actually a distant relative of Jeff Flake and I do think he is a decent man and I think he has a a good heart but I really feel like he's getting played here by the Democrats and the left and I just really really hope that uh but you'll make the right decision tomorrow or Saturday it sounds\nSounds like after his comments today that that's more likely but uh it just you know I Know there's a reason he's not running for reelection and it's just hard to see a secret people leave to Washington and come back a few years later and not be able to really recognize them they feel like that happened with McCain I feel like it's kind of happening with Jeff as well\nI think the most shocking statement that he made was on sixty minutes when he when he actually admitted when asked if he would be voting this way you had to face the voters yet Oh absolutely not\n[laughter] I'm and I'm like oh so you're you're only stand on your principles when when you have to face the voters but that's not how you really feel it really sums up how I view a lot of politicians you know I I just look at a guy that can't doesn't know his own mind the times and doesn't right\nYou know a guy that wanted to be on the survivor show and you know ... you know look at him and uh you'll find that funny Sean but we're we're actually related I think it's our three or four generations back our great great something grandfather it was actually the founder of snowflake Arizona which I thought you would really love\nSomebody told me that yesterday I'm like but really no there is a snowflake Arizona senator Snowe for like\nUm our because the right thing if any Republican senator now especially Murkowski Collins flake after they they got what they wanted they got their delight they got the FBI weighing in\nA Joe Biden said it would that not going to offer recommendations and they're not going to offer opinions here and all they're going to do is give you a straight data and that's what was given and everybody seems pleased by that his comments Susan Collins comments seem to satisfy that no cooperation of any of these claims as we've been claiming\nAnd as we've been telling you and so the allegations have been problematic from the start you know assuming assuming for a second here judge Kavanaugh were to get confirmed we we have got to have a deep analysis\nIn this country over where we want to go forward in terms of going forward because if we allow this to happen to good people it it's it is so it's so dark I'm having a conversation with a friend of mine does religious\nAnd we were discussing you know look at the ten commandments why is one of the ten commandments that shall not there\nWitness against the neighbor because it's devastating for the rest of Brett Kavanaugh's life\nPeople know that this is what he's been accused of and yet in spite of the fact there's been no corroboration shifting stories and a media hysteria that's ... that's why\nTo the extent that people can literally destroy other people within your window falls uncorroborated claims a shocking to me they did it to Robert Bork they did it to Clarence Thomas they've been doing it to Brett Kavanaugh they do it to Republicans conservatives every two and four years they're racist or sexist\nThey want grandma to die all these things that they've come out as a matter of of course because that's their play book I don't know I um I saw the house at some
