totally justifiable and necessary and back to preserve his position\nRound two they compare that to the twelve years on the bench when he had exemplary judicial temperament which is universally acclaimed I find their uh I find their analysis absurd on its face and shouldn't even be taken seriously this guy has grand judicial Deborah I Would have to have that kind of\nInfer that guy I had was somebody supposed how was somebody supposed to act if they're accused of being a serial gang rapists who drugs yet with drug young girls as a matter of course on weekends and high school how I mean what is the proper response you supposed to go there and the guys I just didn't do that\nYeah ... ...\nWho were falsely accused react exactly the way that Brett Kavanaugh did a when you're agreed you sleep wrong you're angry and he expressed the appropriate to righteous indignation of an innocent man\nUh but the most important thing he said was I don't question that ah Christine Blasey Ford was it some time and it some place sexually assaulted it just wasn't me\nSo he's he's not calling her a liar or what is essentially doing is saying she is mistaken\nFor a variety of reasons she may have conflated to different\nUh individuals or she may be projecting based on you know some uh for some reason that we don't understand a but this is a man who sounded like he was being falsely accused into can damn him for being angry he used to ignore human emotion\nWell ... good\nAt ... and contrast that with his response on the market in the column interview and I was watching that very concerned I thought he was a flat out that he was a very much to restrain and I said to myself\nAnd robotic if he doesn't quit holding himself that nobody's gonna blade and then I'm telling you nobody would've believed him if he had done that same thing but he finally somebody a coach them and by coaching somebody told him quit holding back\nOr he told himself and he was masterful because no matter how many people said why she was ... she was initially blamed when she was credible\nThey they believe that I can in multiples when he testified in he totally indicated itself it was a mashable report because I think it was thought that it [noise]\nBut what ... where does it go from here because um I have no I mean Jeff snowflake is Jeff snowflake who knows what he's running for president now and and headed up the Massachusetts New Hampshire I guess he thinks he's going to beat Donald Trump I I don't think this guy could get Fifteen votes at this point\nThen you have what Susan Collins we have no idea where she's coming down on this although she rightly said was Dianne Feinstein did is unfair to everybody in the process and then you've got Lisa Murkowski I mean she was a a no vote when she was needed on numerous occasions\nYou know I to me there's only one to answer the answer is thirty five days from now and that's when the American people have an opportunity to add more senators\nFrom West Virginia from Indiana from North Dakota from Missouri from Florida I'm from Arizona Nevada and but until then you know I don't know what happens I have no faith\nThat anybody really gives a rip that this man's life as been bludgeoned this family has been bludgeoned then there's there's no corroborating evidence for any of it\nBut I think we have to wait to see what happens or in the FBI's report if the investigation finds nope plausible evidence against Kavanaugh this will not only helped to restore his reputation and solidify the integrity of the United States Supreme court at large\nBut it will also give\nA valid reason to senators like Murkowski and Collins a and\nAt the White House today Trump called Kevin are great federal judge in it outstanding man Kevin O's

don't know why can't get fat I saw him by them or their financial remember these parties to remember how I think everybody in the county remembers that\nAnd we have we haven't heard from his friends and so I'm asking is are there people alive today I had a party so yes there are people that tell about that part I have\nThis morning sweating it provided for names of friends she says went to the parties with her one of them said he does not recall a Julie sweating it another friend she named is deceased we've reached out to the other two it hasn't turned back\nRight twenty five now so the top of the hour there's NBC News going forward with\nNothing at all this was was absolute ... how does this passport news story when on top of everything they even admit there's massive inconsistencies from the statement she released just a week ago you would think she can stay consistent in a week\nAnd the people that she says what corroborate remember she's charging here\nThat there was a a a systemic\nParty culture where almost every weekend that women girls young girls\nWere being drugged with ... and and ... forced to be an ... and young boys would then line up outside the rule waiting to gang rape\nWomen and girls and that does happen thirty six years ago and nobody ever ever ever told a parent told a teacher told law enforcement\nAnd she gives the names just like in the case of professor Ford of individuals that would quote corroborate this story and it's not corroborated just the opposite well this guy is dead and on top of that then we've got oh this one doesn't even know who you are\nHow does that how do you where we're at the news standard in any capacity here to put this on the air\nByron York is joining us he's been running a lotta columns about there's not the least of which is how high the bar has risen in the gold posed we've come a long way from\nOh it's going to be very limited in terms of the FBI investigation it's only going to be maximum a week and they'll get the job done and will move forward with a vote now you see that a Camille Harris she is now coming out with another allegation just today\nByron hey Shaun McCutcheon owner under can be anything I think everybody's got to be your mind\nA war on on the basis of the lack of evidence and all of a there's no way the story should ever had been reported publicly just shouldn't have bad but it was given in part a but due to the news networks um thing about Michael ... her lawyer\nSo once it was all out there the fact that if you see that was recorded this is probably a good corrective or at least we can see what I think what it was a parent to a lot of people\nThere was nothing to this story um and when she offered a witnesses who could corroborate the stories you just played a one had no idea who she was\nOn the other was deceased and to others didn't answer the phone so I'm since the story is already out there and has already done the damage it is a good thing to knock it out\nAll right so let's go through all three cases that the the Democrats now want to expand the investigation they they never wanted a limited investigation they wanted to know fledged investigation is now being the seventh\nFrom every indication at all I'm reading though that the FBI is moving expeditiously and it seems like they're very close to probably completing their work\nBut if we start with professor Ford professor Ford claimed that these four people were at the party nobody remembers any such party that she describes and the one person that was supposedly was an eye witness to the alleged abuse in her case\nWas mark judge and he said absolutely it didn't happen and then if you look at the ... if you look at the ... case this was in the New Yorker\nAll the New York times couldn't print the story and and they actually brought up the fact that after calling dozens and dozens of people to corroborate they discovered that Mr Ramirez\nWas calling former yell classmates and asking them if they remembered and that she wasn't short short herself that bill is Brett Kavanaugh so that should go away and this one I think it was the worst of all and I I guess there's no standards at NBC News anymore if they're going to put on somebody that they can't corroborate\nTheory was quite a mess with our traffic's back to normal around the turkey legs service plazas of the

and she's not part of the agreement she voted and she's the one that said the goal was to lay\nA the hearing long enough to get into the midterms and and I have a Democrat replace a Justice Kennedy and twenty twenty she said that not one media outlet fed ask her what did you mean but they're agreement I just outlined it was the three witnesses that Dr Ford named\nMess for ... that there are any a credible leads within that world or the FBI will follow them and that's it and we're going to vote this week\nOkay let's talk a little bit about your on the program last night on on Hannity and I thought you dropped a huge bomb shell and I was asking you look I have no idea how Jeff Flake gonna end up voting in this I have no idea what Lisa Murkowski is going to do I have no idea what Susan Collins is going to do yeah\nThey are your colleagues maybe you up some more insight than I have but\nTo me they're the ones that met privately with Joe Manchin and they decided on this course now that it's an FBI investigation but right close to be limited in scope is now expanded out into other allegations but if you fall one vote short you came up with a pretty\nInteresting and thoughtful idea that I kind of like [noise]\nWell I think we've got the votes and then from but here's the question\nThe Republican Party abandon Brett Kavanaugh delete legitimize\nThe way he was treated at the Senate is it forty nine what I Would like to see happen is to appeal the verdict of the Senate and the November election and take it to some of the states and see if the people in those states agree with senator about Brett Kavanaugh the swap\nWould abandon Kevin ... the traditional way of doing business is if he fell one vote short just pull the plug he's never quit I don't want to quit on him so I think Trump might be different I think Trump would say\nListen this man's been abused on not given up on hand less have an election to see if the vote in the Senate really represented the Trump states were Democrats a rain\nWell I mean this is the thing I mean we have people like Joe Donnelly ... he's a no he said already Claire McCaskill's know already has a matter of fact yes most Democrats will know no matter who Donald\nTrump s ride they've already against score sick\nYeah All right so now what's going to happen to Bill Nelson of Florida and Joe Manchin and Heidi Heitkamp and Joe Donnelly and well a smart question Martin makes Sally is a great candidate for the Republicans in Arizona most served their country with honor and distinction I Hope she wins\nUm we certainly could use a win out in Nevada or do you think this impacts the race and do you do you actually think you're going to get the votes and why do you think you'd get the votes\nWell number one I think we're going to get the votes because Jeff voted in committee\nYes I don't believe the FBI is going to find anything\nA relevant to this limited investigation that would show that\nThat are ... towards claims are more credible and that there's anything new about Brett Kavanaugh in terms of the investigation I Would hope they would stay consistent with this vote I think the other two Collins and Murkowski or friends they're wanting to FBI to check the committee's homework I get that\nThat will be done here shortly but you're asking me a hypothetical\nI Can't imagine how we would explain to the Republican Party that we gave up on Brett Kavanaugh because for one vote short when a lot of the states that led to that vote being short Trump won I Do not believe North Dakota wants a Heidi Heitkamp to vote no\nI agree with you\nI Am so this is why you have an election appeal the verdict of the Senate if we have to to the people of of the country in November\nLet me ask you if you've spoken to these red state Trump state Democrats that are up for reelection if you talk to any of\nThem doing it right now uh\nSo you mean you're you're communicating hand I don't I'm not sure if they're all Hannity lifted those ... view as a ...\nI doubt if they're lifting I think we're fine but here's the dilemma that you that this process has put us in this is about the teacher the judiciary\nThe states couldn't be higher this about the reputation of one of the finest man I Know it's about who would come forward after this debacle is about setting the tone and the standard that will destroy the ...\nAnd eat the Senate alive\nSo I Know President Trump pretty well I think we've got the votes and then some but I think he's a different kind of politician that he wouldn't let the system get off the hook that if we had to as a last resort where one vote short list they have ... we would take this issue to the ballot box and about thirty something days\nThirty five we can find yeah find that extra vote that way we would have a good nominee or have a light salvaged have a process uh saved and the people finally get to speak up here I think we're fine but you asked me a question and I thought about this yesterday\nAnd said if Brett Kavanaugh is on the ballot in some of the states I think it changes the election you see in North Dakota there's a poll out today the number one issue in North Dakota is I'm Brett Kavanaugh's nomination as far ahead of anything else sixty to twenty eight people in North Dakota North Dakota support Brett Kavanaugh\nWell it's fascinating to me that the Democratic leadership is showing no support or comprehension or understanding of what their colleagues from states that are not New York and California have to go through in terms of reelection but the reality is\nThat I Would even argue that if they do vote for cabinet oh it's only an election year conversion and they're only doing it but there was a big don't the people in their state will throw him out but they'll probably go right back to to be in a party line vote would Schumer at the end of the\nDay [laughter] well you know I'm I'm not a psychologist or political scientist I don't care is like you know I'm a bad this I don't care how you find Jesus as long as you do you know if you can figure out that Brett Kavanaugh was highly qualified and these accusations have crumbled\nA bit for you and now here's the point this has become the most despicable thing I've seen in Washington and as saying a lot it would change the face of the judiciary forever if we condone it so it's not a complicated issue for me if we follow vote short\nA less take this to the ballot box and see what happens let\nMe ask you about this whole process now we've gone through and and I do think the Republicans and you know I'm pretty honest broker I'm pretty critical of Republicans when they're wrong I Do think that they they have handled this with the seriousness the charge deserves I think ...\n[noise] yes no I think they handled it properly because these are serious allegations but she identified and and look I won't go through the ... the entire\nWe don't need to we don't need to reach try this case I made I don't mind you've made up your mind there five accusations that have are are are not verified or just made up not true outrageous so it's not about
