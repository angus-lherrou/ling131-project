this weekend Carter says Kaepernick is it better for ... years at some of our listeners say about Catherine\nSo it's not the issue they care about it's always about the power and the politics behind it you know Republican bad let's go after them throw the book that lets no due process but them no presumption of innocence for them and then you've got a case that allegation made about Cory Booker now over the weekend on top of statements that his own words that he had made some years ago when he was Fifteen\nApparently some people are taking that seriously Claire McCaskill's husband being accused of some type of meat to issue out there in Missouri and you notice the double standard it's everywhere\nI'm here's what is anecdotally something that I think should give you a lot of hope um and I don't make predictions I can only tell you this\nHave you on a prediction it's simple Rick Scott is in a very very close tight race in Florida with\nBen Nelson you know but Rick Scott has done a great job for the economy down in Florida is a great job as a senator but he's also run is you know notoriously close races down in Florida\nFlorida's important Florida I think he won his race is by one percentage point each time and and each time he keeps proven the people of Florida that maybe not the best politician with the best gift of gab or ... or but boy when it comes to getting the job done with\nPeople will Florida need Rick Scott he's there for you\nAnd the same with ah we've got it for whatever reason the media is falling in love with Andrew Gillum down in Florida\nAnd in Iran dissent that's the bottom of the great debate last night and he's now fighting to to prevent Florida from getting a forty percent business tax the Gillum would support\nElements use some of the most harsh rhetoric against police that I've ever heard before he's fairly radical in his views is trying to hide it just like every other Democrat is hiding who they really are they can't be elected by being honest with their constituents in who they are what they believe in what they really want to fight for\nWe saw that with Brett is said and the project berets as tape and the great state of Tennessee anyway you know run dissent the season to fight for his life down in Florida we got Marsha Blackburn who's going to be a fantastic senator from Tennessee but\nYou know for whatever reason Bredesen is out there trying to convince the people of Tennessee that is something that he is not that he's a moderate liberal and these tapes flu that out of the water as they're calling the people of Tennessee ignorant people in his office and\nSaying that his public position I'm Brett Kavanaugh is just for show and we saw the same thing in the tapes in Missouri with Claire McCaskill and we've already found out she was a phony but now we really know she's a phony she goes on a an RV tour of Missouri except she's taking private jets what's so Harvey tour with with wings unbelievable\nBut some anecdotal evidence now there I think the Kavanaugh hearings\nI think this caravan is now becoming a massive campaign issue\nAnd just the fact that there's seven thousand people that are marching towards our southern border to create some type of confrontation oughta tell Americans what the party of sanctuary cities sanctuary states the party that wants to eliminate eyes open borders means\nWhen you look at the amount of money illegal immigration has cost the American taxpayers it is in the billions and billions and billions of dollars because if you're in this country illegally and you're arrested for something we paid the criminal justice cause\nIf you go to a hospital hospitals not going to not take care of you we pay the healthcare cause we pay the educational costs when your kids are in school nobody is against illegal immigration\n... nobody's against immigration everyone's against illegal immigration we're saying we have a process that we have sovereignty and we have borders and they deserve to be respected and what does it say about the people that do go through the process legally improperly that's now coming to the forefront\nAt the president's call for a wall is right\nSanctuary cities and states are wrong there's been so look at the crimes committed in Texas was\nFor security [laughter]\n... has a ... west down shut down ... tried to crashes after ... put all traffic forced off at that point you're delays now all the way back towards for thirty six you can take colonial drive as an alternate even curry Ford road I'm at Torrance in Ninety six twenty five WVU just keep\nDoctor keep your plan pay less millions of Americans lost their doctors plans and are paying in some cases one hundred two hundred and three hundred percent more than they ever paid before for in theory of coverage we have many states where you only have one option one the health care option that's it\nSo it has not worked out well for the American people it was from the beginning it redistribution scam where you're forcing the young and healthy to buy plans they never want needed or desires and forcing them by threat of a fine\nTo literally subsidize the sick the elderly and and the disabled uh Americans when all they really need is a catastrophic plan and one office visit a year or and they catastrophic plan would be like fifty bucks a month and that's for God Forbid you have a bad accident get cancer and heart attack\nBut the anecdotal hope that I'm Talking about is political even says looks like Chuck Schumer his dreams of becoming the Senate majority leader or a evaporating before his eyes\nEven his Democratic colleagues don't think it's going to happen anymore democratic hopes of winning the Senate have faded in the final weeks of the twenty eight to an election with a party now needing to win every one of the more than half a dozen\nCompetitive races to capture control the chamber it's a far cry from pretty much the last year and a half oh we're gonna we're gonna take control of the house and the Senate\nHeidi Heitkamp seat has slipped away it looks like it's going to be a Republican pickup Martha ... going to join us later I mean every day gets worse for Christ in cinema\nI mean there's just an unmitigated disaster for her I mean you know she thinks it's okay for Americans to join up and support it skipped Mitt treason against their country and support the Taliban we've got that\nWe've got her on tape saying that her state of Arizona the people are crazy and\nIt's the ... lab of democracy and then of course you know attacking border patrol people inviting radicals like the lawyer for the blind shake into town and meanwhile Martha ... Sally twenty eight years of service serving our country six tours of duty in Iraq and Afghanistan what a comparison\nSo now we have ... Democrats are urging caution on the blue wave to temper expectations new Fox\nA poll has come out top Democrats now they're spending their time managing expectations about ... the blue wave\nAnd sweeping the party into power on Capitol Hill urging caution about those predictions mid fresh signs at the midterms are much closer than anticipated Democratic National committee chair Tom for as it was still hasn't condemn Keith Ellison\nSaid today that he doesn't use the term blue wave to talk about a possible victory for the party even though house minority leader Nancy Pelosi who has her eyes on the speaker's gavel said just days earlier that we're looking at a democratic tsunami\nLook I Can't look I don't have a crystal ball I all I Know is winning everything is possible\nI can see a scenario where Rick Scott wins in Florida Ron dissenters becomes the governor Marsha Blackburn wins in Tennessee Martha Black um ... Marshall mixed Martha ... Sally wins in Arizona\nWhere we have Dean Heller hold this seat in Nevada which is tough that's a tough state tough race a lot of money being poured against him\nWhere I can see Claire McCaskill getting the exit sign Jon Tester getting the exit sign and Heidi Heitkamp saying goodbye and even Joe Donnelly the problem for the Republican Braun in the state of Indiana is well in his particular case he's got a libertarian in the race\nAnd that means that the libertarian siphoning votes away from the Republican broad\nMike Braun is now claiming that\nYou know a Brett Kavanaugh surge citing internal polling is now as a leading will see in Fifteen days\nYou know if you look at all of this and add to all of this this is an opportunity one bit of anecdotal evidence we have you know they say voter enthusiasm for the Democrats is at an all time high but you know crazy uncle Joe Biden was at a rally in Vegas on Saturday and an attempt to boost\nDemocratic Senate candidates according to the a P he drew a pathetic five hundred people\nA hundred and thirty thousand people have signed up they want to go see the Trump cruise rally tonight\nI mean amazing I was down in Houston in Beaumont, Texas this weekend and and doing a a town hall with Ted Cruz and then we had four thousand people around there a moment at a huge crowd in Houston as well\nWe're doing better than crazy uncle Joe Bernie Sanders is warning his party that there's no blue wave coming and he also says that you can't win elections by alienating half the population and I hate to say it but I agree with Bernie you're absolutely right\nAnd you've got to force the hypocrisy so we've got\nThe cabin on your shoe you got the caravan coming you got more mobs over the weekend in front of me and and showing nothing but mean spirited hostility to people that are trying to serve their country you've got now two years of magnificent success record breaking jobs and opportunities for Americans\nWhere you have more safety and security are stronger president versus eight years of failure so we have a choice in this election\nAnd I like choice elections you want to go back to the failed policies of Obama below sea and Schumer do you want to continue the progress we've made argue better off than you were two years ago it by the way I Want to remind you are\nYou need a job or somebody you know does express employment professionals they connect great companies with top talent job seekers never pay a penny just go to express pros dot com also want to remind you about the vulnerability of your good name your reputation your finances that's where life lot comes in\nBy the president just spoke out about this will play it when we come back with a lot to get to more than ... much more straight ahead\n[noise] [noise]\nThis is news Ninety six point five or ... or ... and do it turns first for breaking news\nThirty news on twenty five W de Vito and uh we got red alert at this point in Torrance checking out a big traffic problems\nYeah this is a major problem for your afternoon rush to crash on the ... west bound just after ... drive that's got to all westbound traffic now forced to exit at crystal a drive with delays all the way back to for thirty six and you can't get onto the floor like west bound\nFor him for thirty six because you're not going to go anywhere ... will drive as an alternate as well as Cory Ford road I'm at towards new Ninety six\nPoint five W.

like in ... and people who believe in addition to their ideas and their their policy that's the way it's supposed to be but what is happening now is so dangerous for this country and so so wrong\nAnd just wait and it's nice when this great nation off or how does the\nPresident would be my goal the president obviously is going to pull back aid to some of these countries that are allowing this this

anybody I mean you could have people that are mixed in with the crowd that want to bring harm to our country but I Would assume most people come here because they want a better life\n... if they're hell bent on disobeying our laws and our sovereignty and the president then has to protect our borders how do we do it in the way that is safest for the people that are there\nBecause I don't want to see people getting hurt at the border you don't see people the president does want to see that but on the other hand I Can't you can't allow them to come in either\nNo I write and this is why we've had legislation that's been introduced the Democrats won support it because I think deep down they want the politics of this you see they don't want to solve the problem we need more judges on the

they're really fleeing something or or are they coming here to do harm are they part of the same game what's their background each it takes some time to do that but it takes resources it takes

destroy him\nGoing back to Nineteen eighty one in Nineteen eighty two and so again right into the Trump Twitter insect vaporized or so so for me I'm enjoying this the polls are tightening of the end of the president's base is actually going to turn out in much higher percentages and people predicted in so\nOnce again he's going to defy logic here I think we are very good chance to possibly ah keep the house we're certainly going to gain seats in the Senate and it couldn't happen without the energy and the for tutors for a President Trump\nWell if they do it when I'll say this he's carrying a lot of these people on his back but you know what I feel like Nancy Pelosi the dangers are what we're going to have endless investigation higher taxes keep Obamacare open borders\nAnd the president is is battling back on all these fronts in Guatemala Honduras El Salvador he says there or not we're not able to do the job of\nStopping people from leaving their country and coming illegally to the U.S now we will begin cutting off substantially reducing the massive foreign aid we routinely give them an Trump tweeted out every time you see a caravan of people illegally coming are attempting to come into our country illegally\nSink and blamed the Democrats were\nNot giving us the votes to change our pathetic immigration laws\nRemember the midterms it's so unfair to those who come in legally and he's right um well and and we don't know anything about the people that are coming here we don't know when when one thing about them and I know the media can be a sympathetic because they want but you know who might mix it with the people that maybe just want a job is a big problem for us\nBut but it's but you but here's the other thing okay the American people intuitively notion that it's not just all it is is he or she is recognizing with the legendary built for even one set about any country\nIf you have a welfare state in the United states does have one you need to protect your Puerto Rico's free market forces dictate that people will cross over that border\nTo participate in your welfare state and so\nEvery country has a strong border and so should the United states so I don't get a you know ... on on on promoting my my uh my book that today in the last couple of days mom a lot a left leaning shows and they go they go nuts so crazy on the president's response all\nYou want to illegal immigration you have democratic and Republican presidents and democratic elected officials that of voters it was I don't understand why just enforcing those laws\nHave everybody saw ... ... ... well could there answered by so\nWhy don't they well it's a lot of things are we better off economically than we were two years ago by every single objective measure the answer is yes the growth of the economy consumer confidence jobs created\nThe number of people leaving food stamps or out of poverty eight million Americans so you know by every measure and more\nBottom the bottom ten percent of the society showing the wages of five and a half percent according to the wall Street Journal over the last Eighteen months but as a direct result of the president's policies but\nAlso the fact that he cut the slack at the border and so he made it tightened up the labor supply and it's giving lower middle class families shot you know to have real living wages\nWell that's the story that you actually tell in the book by the way Anthony Scaramucci is with us author of the brand new book it's out today we put it up on Hannity dot comments on Amazon dot com and bookstores everywhere it's called Trump the blue collar president I first heard that term from one of his sons of his either Erica Don I don't remember those Donnie\n... get on each call them the blue collar billionaire yeah and I said ... Don if you don't mind going to hijack the nickname and just switch out billionaire and put in President he's at the end of the day he resonates with these people for a reason\nYeah look I I I think it is and you talk a lot about his background you you talk a little bit about your family background it's similar to my background and and it's amazing because the only thing that I really care about what motivates me it's not politics itself it's not a game to me\nBecause the policies that we have in our country as we do now greatly impact whether or not people are on food stamps or whether or not there are jobs we now in two years have us a scenario that is not\nUnfolded in this country since Nineteen sixty nine and that is we have a million more jobs than we have people on unemployment you know that I identify with that that's what you identify with you you did not have any kids that are in your mouth\nAnd you know I saw it as a dishwasher at twelve and and look where you started died you know\nSean short list that I mean I think that's the message and I think that's the reason why you're so clearly popular at the end of the gay America is about aspiration\nIn America is about passing the ... to the baton to a next generation of Americans that can do better than ourselves and that's what our grandparents did for our parents and our parents did for you and I and and the cat that the right policy shift of white free market based motivating market incentive policies\nBecause what we both know is that you cannot system the ties\nOr through a political system created equal outcomes it never happens black markets crop up and then there's a thin layer at the tippy top that are living better than everybody else and everyone else has devastated whether it's Cuba or Venezuela place like that\nYou know the real danger so I don't know how this is all going to play out but we we see all weekend long these mobs you know really making ... an unsafe environment for anybody to even go get a bite to eat if you're a public figure which was really sad I mean when you're doing it in front of people's wives it's\nNot only sad it's pathetic when you're going after Pam Bondi Sarah Sanders and our kids and\nSecretary Nielsen and all she do all they're doing is trying to sit in a restaurant and have something to eat telling you know one group of Americans they're not wanted here in any way what are you doing here get out of this\nYou know they're going after an a Ninety year old guy Henry Kissinger now who served his country with honor and distinction is that it seems like there's no limits here but there's no moderation left\nEither mulch and the Democratic party it used to be I I used to think Democrats at least they on paper they said they cared about the American working men and women but apparently they don't\nHave to losing the argument then you have\nTo suppress the other side's argument in other words if you're wrong on the facts and your ideology is going to create\nUnequal outcome so you know bad society uh even though it sounds great on paper all of your ideas when they meet contact with reality or disaster for a country a person a citizen then you've got to suppress the voices of the other people it's happened to me it's happened to me on a\nCollege campuses it's happened to me I'm Around the country when I'm traveling\nI'm cool with it I'm up for the fight of it or what the you know when you know what's great about the people just want you to think about Ninety five percent\nOf these professor Sean or liberal but about forty five fifty percent of the kids are conservative so they're not buying into the Malone\nAll right stay right there by the way the books phenomenal I read it cover to cover Anthony Scaramucci is whether Trump the blue collar president\nUh you know it's interesting you look at the jobs created who's benefitting when we create manufacturing jobs in factory jobs\nAre and we bring an industry back to America and we incentivize businesses to invest here well that's the forgotten men and women the Thirteen million under Obama\nThe additional Thirteen million that were on food stamps and after eight years of his presidency and the eight million more Americans that were in poverty after eight years of his presidency well now we have for a million new jobs and eight million fewer people in poverty and on food stamps and so dramatic turn around\nAnd they're back happily working and some are getting career jobs and opportunities that we were told was never coming back\nAnd listen we're all big

border has become well a big big issue we have a couple of things that have literally taking the people of Arizona back come\nFirst instead of a once calling Arizona the meth lab of democracy and the people of Arizona crazy a inviting Arizona State university the radical attorney for the blind shake you know that blind shake involved in the what the bombings that America um she's had no problem with Americans joining the Taliban\nMartha McSally confronted her in the recent debate and said well you apologize you would not apologize\nAnd accusing troops of torture and that's only part of it and then on top of that we have the latest development cinema once attacked BS stay at home moms for ... off their husbands\nThese women who lack like staying at home ... their husbands or boyfriends and just cashing checks to some sort of feminism because they're choosing to live that life was fairly judgmental you would think\nMartha McSally is with us so Martha how are you\nHey John I'm doing great thanks for having me on\nWell I think I'm happy with the last two polls one had you up by seven want to do it by two ah but ah I frankly after these latest revelations in the last two weeks of Christ and send them I Would imagine that your polls are going to go higher\nShon well it it's unbelievable every single day a new part of her radical passed and her mocking Arizona and extremism and so many issues as being on earth\nBut the Arizona local media is protecting her a and making excuses for her and so the only way to filter down his shows like yours are us turning it into a TV ad\nOr the fact that she's still hanging in there is really ridiculous\nSo out of step with Arizona values and American values you rattled off a number of uh a number of things that would have a Senate committee disqualifying in the past\nBut here we are way down to the wire over eighty percent or around eighty percent of people will vote early over half have already voted and so we need to make sure that the messages out about her radical out of step past this qualifying statement you know compared to nice to have been twenty six years in the military and defending our freedoms and our way
