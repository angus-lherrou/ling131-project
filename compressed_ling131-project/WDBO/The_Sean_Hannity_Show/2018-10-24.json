a dog fight for governor and I have no idea why Gillum you know the media is turned him into you know\nA God down there and they're not doing any vetting of their record sounds you know like what they do with Elizabeth Warren is what they do with Bernie Sanders of Iraq Obama they don't they don't let these people\nUm our top story of the day should scare everybody\nThat has a heart and soul believes in goodness humanity and part of the story should anger a lot of you because of the media and who they are and what they do and how they want to blame people that are not responsible for what we've been watching unfold today\nI'm On almost every broadcast especially we have been covering it heavily\nI haven't been warning almost daily repeatedly someone is gonna get hurt or worse if these mobs don't stop what they're doing\nNow the moms in the case as I was talking about you know let's through the prism of what we know today suspicious packages pipe bombs\nThat had been sent to Obama and the Clintons apparently and and CNN and\nOthers um how many times yesterday on this program there was a story about George Soros apparently some divisive but putting his mailbox and\nI listen what did I say about George Soros yesterday my statement on tape let me say what I said yesterday when it broke when the store story broke apparently an explosive device was found near at George Soros his home in his mailbox the New York times reported\nIn a billionaire left this global list or George Soros doesn't like Sean Hannity any fun is a lot of groups that we love the show to go away\nI Want to be clear with everybody this crap has got to stop\nThis crap has got to stop this is you know we we have an election and Thirteen Days and on\nAlmost ... you could see this building and building and building and building Rand Paul was very outspoken somebody is going to get killed I was the person saying during the Kavanaugh hearings\nHey we we got to clear the halls this ... one of these senators is going to end up getting assaulted or worse\nYou got to clear the halls you can't let these activists you know getting in the faces spinning it Lindsey Graham holding up elevators screaming at Sanders ... when\nYou can't let this continue but there's it's obvious what's gonna happen to somebody\nAnd and I haven't heard any of my colleagues on the left warning that this was a bad thing I didn't hear a lot of people on the left all that upset that Sarah Sanders and her children were run out of a restaurant and then they go to another restaurant and they were followed over there for crying out loud\nOr the video of secretary Nielsen ... sitting in eating a meal\nAnd these left wing lunatics screaming at secretary Nielsen till she has to get up and walk out of the restaurant we have the video of Pam Bondi who's going to a movie for crying out loud and what she had to go through with a left wing mob\nAnd then of course Senator Ted Cruz and his his wife\nHeidi they go to sit down at a restaurant there run out right and they get right in your grill right in your face\nYou know it's an amazing thing that they keep doing this to women or guys that are with their wives it culminated this weekend this is now the fourth time that Senator McConnell has now had to deal with this he's just sitting in a restaurant with his wife Elaine Chao there just eating that's all they're doing\nHe's not working is on his off time some guy comes literally right up to the table to bang on the table\nAnd then ... rips off some of the food from the table opens the restaurant door which is adjacent to the scene where Mitch McConnell is and throws the guy's food out in the street\nAnd then starts screaming at the top of his lungs\nAnd then of course Kevin McCarthy's office gets hit with a Boulder busting his office window\nAnd I didn't hear anybody condemning any of this certainly during the Kavanaugh hearings nobody on the left said a word about their\nLeftist activists they love the pressure that they were putting on Jeff Flake and and other people there they didn't say paying Feinstein wasn't speaking out Lindsey Graham getting spit on nobody speaking out\nThese incidents that have happened to these conservative women's I don't see the coverage hour by hour second by second\nYou know but if Donald Trump calls the news media fake news and they do give you fake news there is some truth to fake news\nAnd they just hate Trump twenty four seven you should have seen the yesterday the graphics because he said I'm not a global list I'm I'm an American first nationalist well does that mean that he's a racist it you know is he a white nationalist no he said he's a national list\nAnd his policies are the irony is all of the failure and the disproportionate failure under Obama's policies towards African Americans Hispanic Americans Asian Americans and women in the workplace they weren't just disproportionately impacted by the horrific\nPolicies bronco balmy sat there for eight years did nothing to curb the violence even at his own home city where people are dying now you have a few famous people\nThat have had these suspicious packages that have been sent and let me be very clear you know leading up to this I have been saying this is not going to end well\nSomebody's gonna get hurt I don't want anybody hurt I don't want any Democrat hurt I don't want any Republican hurt I don't want any American her I don't want anyone in the caravan hurt\nIt ought not be crisis precipitated at the border because Mexico allows people to march you know three thousand miles up to the United states you want to avoid confrontations like this if you can so we had a pipe bomb suspicious packages\nSent to the Clintons home in chapter ... similar package to Obama's home one to CNN New York headquarters and ... and apparently the one yesterday George Soros is home in Westchester New York suspicious package center Debbie Wasserman Schultz is officer investigating one that might have gone to Maxine Waters office\nYou know with all the rhetoric from Spartacus get in their face holder kick them they go low we kick them\nHillary Clinton we can't be civil with them unless of course we win\nYou know Maxine what did she say get a crowd if you see them you get a crowd you follow them in a restaurant sing department stores in gas stations and you tell them they're not wanted anywhere anymore and watch it had happened to all these Republican does any of this\nYou know we don't know what the intentions are a lot of people are speculating what the intentions are um you know let me be very clear I Know I Know first hand what all of this is like\nMy thoughts and prayers go out to anybody that has to deal with this today\nI've had similar incidences of security\nIn my life you know Linda ... you know somebody that we both care for very very dearly a girl at work for us for years she's been on the radio occasionally you know remember when we had the white powder scent the Fox news\nAnd she literally had to spend an entire eight nine hours in isolation because we thought at the time it was anthrax that was sent I don't get packages anymore my life\nUh and and far worse in terms of threats it's sad but if you're in the public eye this happens more than I Will disclose here it's not about me today\nBut I Know many other conservatives that have had the same thing happen if you go back just three weeks ago maybe people born is alarms that\nBut there was from the minute the news broke this morning the media's dawn wall to wall with report suspicious packages and you know that were sent to the Clintons Obama Eric Holder is another one and you know I think it's a huge story I Do it's a scary story\nBut if you go back just three weeks ago how many ... do you even know that race in letters deadly rice and letters were actually sent to President Trump defense secretary James Mattis or FBI Director Christopher Wray or CIA director Gina Haspel and other top officials in fact\nThat story got so little coverage that I barely remembered it until I saw a report on one of the Web sites earlier today that it was only

frankly don't really remember any of the coverage in that particular case\nUm there is an assumption here because it is CNN and it is\nIs Obama and holder and Debbie Wasserman Schultz and the Clintons the assumption is that this is political which by the way is\nProbably you know some fringe person out there somewhere\nOr it could very well be and and obviously the temperatures been hot as we've

FBI Director race CIA director Gina Haspel\nThat we know anyway former NYPD Commissioner a Bernie carrying his where there's a book by the way it's phenomenal\nThe grave above the grave commissioner of the police department of New York I call on commission a dam bond Gino former Secret Service agent\nHis best selling book is out now is called Spygate welcome both of you to the program today president condemning whoever is responsible for sending these items and even then he's getting criticized\nYou know you would think listening to the media that it was him who sent them\nAnd meanwhile they been silent with all these public confrontations Bernie look\nI've lived in New York a long time um it's been a while I don't get mail anymore but I've had the white powder scare and how to an assistant a mind quarantine for about nine hours while they were testing out whether\nAnthrax spores were in the package it turned out thankfully that was not the case we saw that a lot after nine eleven [noise]\nYou know what's on it this kind of reminds me of that because the after nine eleven I think it was the first month anniversary after nine eleven we actually got anthrax or at city hall\nWe got a a a V. C. N. D. C. I remember getting a call from Tom Brokaw cause producers I'm ... and this is what that reminds me of however uh people have to keep in mind right now we don't know if these packages these devices are real\nUm you don't know who sent them look purpose was\nUm we're going to hear about a lot of false alarms and the next two days perhaps um but I Would and and I think Dan may agree with me here [noise] I Would predict given that they found these devices says and they knock them without that they that\nUh I predict they're going to have somebody they're going to have a target suspect with the next two or three days what\nMakes you think that Bernie [noise] [noise] well ... when you're detonate stuff or you know you blow to pieces it's harder\nTo collect the evidence that you could send to a ... a machine right so now you have a package itself or the mail or the the stamps were writing the device ... side they're going to break this stuff down\nWhere and how long it took to find the Unabomber remember that case\nYeah but you know what Sean tons of different times of different technologies get for no mailing list of those different dinners and there are so many packages lose a this is a benefit to law enforcement right now\nIn other words they have more packages and and look on the surface it would look like ... okay it's going to Democrats it's going to a liberal CNN that might people might think well this might be\nRight off the top of their head they're first suspect would be well might be some radical conservative but we don't know that we don't know anything right now\nYou know and and there's\nA lot of the way I wouldn't even call them they wouldn't be a conservative they'd be an anarchist if they were\nYeah I mean this is going to be condemned as it should be by everybody I mean no one insect devices are no don't when with a straight face acceptable in polite conversation and\nSent the vices violence on public officials and anyone who does um is a moron and Savage I think there's a period hole stop there but with regard to the Unabomber thing Sean you're right it it it takes them a long time but remember what the Unabomber\nHe was a little more tactically a strategically devious he would send those bombs and it'd be an extended period of time between each one where he actually develop a new kind of a ... the same way to put those in construct those bombs together is very difficult with this\nThey're basically you know ... ... nations whoever this was you may have done this so it's got to be really hard for them not to have left behind in any of these multiple devices any clues but there's a part of me that police shown that\nThis person or persons I'm wanting to be caught I mean some of the stuff is amateurish Sean I'll give you a quick example I mean one of these devices sent to CNN was addressed to John Brennan\nWho does that work at the end I mean it's hard to figure out you just go to the Internet and you could figure out to John Brennan and you know it'd be the comet he's not a CNN\nCountry of this is just basic stuff I mean think about it if you were a enough of the Savage in an animal to want to hurt someone or hurt someone in the mail processing facility you think you'd do like basic homework like that so it's very amateurish the construction of it from my experience and this is amateurish as well and\nYou know I agree with the a former commissioner that I I think it'll be a matter of a few days before someone or or a group of people are caught I Hope they are but\nEverybody hopes they are um and you know usually these things come in rapid succession a commissioner and I would expect that that might be the case here although it seems to slow down so down at least for today\nWell listen you started on Monday was Soros right when you out a number of these things come in today we'll see what happens to borrow a like I said we're also going to hear a lot of false alarms in the aftermath of the anthrax attacks in New York City\nWhen you've got hundreds just in New York city\nThere were hundreds and hundreds of false alarms of the next two weeks so we'll hear about that but um you know I I agree with that I think within a couple of days\nUm they're going to have a target or at least you know somebody they're looking at because there's just way too much here um that's been captured\nWhat are you first be looking for some radical fringe we\nOften after these for example school shootings find that people telegraph what they're going to do ahead of time and I've got to assume here that maybe that would be the case as well that this was some type of radical extremists that that maybe doesn't like certain politicians or could it be and were Harris I mean you just don't know right\nNow given the right one your your analysis of the school shooting is absolutely correct the secret service did an exhaustive study on that show on and that is exactly what they discovered that a lot of these people engaged in this targeted violence even political violence political assassination that's why the secret service ironically\nGot into analyzing school shootings through the national threat assessment center they found very similar patterns of behavior that telegraphing which you just described directly so\nSo it wouldn't surprise me again given what I see based I going to have an obviously have an adult size these devices but having seen what the press is put out and what's in the media they seem to be a very amateurish devices that they've almost somewhat either\nYou know what they were doing in March sophisticated enough thankfully I'm to successfully pull this off again thank God or they somehow wanted to get caught like we saw on that bombing in in in Austin where did you seem to be so ridiculously amateurish\nThat they that they almost weren't even trying to hide it and it's just a very bizarre uh this whole case is very bizarre even look John even look at something like the packaging\nI notice the oversized typing and the pictures the media is put out about these devices\nI mean you're basically telegraphing to anyone who's done this kind of stuff like me and the commissioner who has some experience in the space book this package is suspicious here's this big oversized hype it there's something about this\nWhere in orange commissioner where where would you where would you start\nWell listen there's one other thing that that we haven't mentioned and that is or what if it's a hoax when it's not one of these devices will what if they're not real at all in this person lunatic whoever it is I'm just wondering Mr commotion and intimidate\nA lot as a good possibility given uh what what Dan saying the the amateur hour a look of the packages I Would uh you know I'd be skeptical and uh I'd wait on the uh the outcome of the forensics\nAnd the ah the the people to see what they find in the devices themselves\nSo we really saying is what we\nCommissioner John Miller said the devices all appear to be related\nIt appears that an individual or individual sent out multiple similar package without\nUsing the phrase the FBI described it as domestic terrorism\nAt our Washington watchdog Jimmy to pre telling me the former presidents and first ladies do not ever handle any mail before just inspected by the secret\nTo point by ...

the red state Democrats have to do in these battleground states to get elected\nWhat's so amazing is that consistency here is that is that they are telling their staff\nOne thing they're saying things privately that they'll never said publicly\nIn the hopes that they can basically lie to bamboozled whatever term you want to use the voters in their state in the case of brothers and even calling the people at Tennessee ignorant in the hopes that they'll get that seat and then they'll they'll be a a basically a Chuck Schumer senator for the state\nYeah just so that your listeners if you haven't seen every video\nA there's a video in Missouri we did where were they were talking about Obama's using Claire McCaskill's views and the staffer says Obama and the ... will have the same using everything but quote people just can't know that well in this video this video released last night on your show Sean there's this another guy Gordon is his name he's the staffer\nIn and Heidi Heitkamp Fargo North Dakota campaign office and we and we see an Obama poster in the office there's a big one of those are the Obama looks like the messiah on the wall this big poster but then they took it down right before the press came so we asked why did you take the Obama poster down and the staffer says well\nBecause the presses here and and we take it down when the press comes is what Heidi Heitkamp staff the same so it's more it's basically the same thing in each of these red states\nThey have to mislead they have to do the moderate voters and play the progressive base well we just have them on tape saying it and we all know that Heidi is is liberal but\nShe's going to be so liberal when she gets elected staffers are emphasizing it here and they also say that she's not going to run again so because this what Jesse overturned says in this video quote she doesn't want to run again so she'll just do good work while she can which means that she'll do the things that she can't talk about right now\nIt's just so revealing but I I think this is really this is not an accident that you're getting very similar responses and every place you have now gone\nI mean these are three big huge massive Senate races and you have caught three major Senate candidates all admitting that they've got their line to the people in their state to get elected\nBut I Would argue that it ... represents the entirety of the Democratic party we now know what goes Maxine Waters told us that are parties told or they don't want me to say it they want me to stop saying it but I'm not going to stop saying it impeach forty five\n... well that's it yeah but\nIt's ... it's particularly true in these red states there's a there's a kind of a story here that we found that were confirming suspicion is that if we do it very costly confirms suspicions\nAnd we've always known this to be true but my point is just have integrity\nDoes it it's not really a left or right thing\nI was at the first amendment conference with all these big hon chosen media\nWho were ... you know very cheering and and hearing it may I suggest have integrity this is about just doing what you say you're going to I think it's more pronounced in the red states with these Democrats running because they have to lie to the moderates they have to move the moderates and that and they can only make one choice\nOne but he did not take a choice it's lying is this a purposeful misinformation and propaganda campaign 'cause they have no intention of doing what they say they're going to do\nThey have a very different agenda the people working for them know that they have a very different agenda and so they're really just lying manipulating I mean it is the worst of the worst in terms of politics\nBecause there's an open contempt hatred and a feeling of superiority that Claire McCaskill has that bill Brett isn't hasn't Heidi Heitkamp as towards the people of their state Penn Web Dave's\nOh it's so hateful showing that Claire McCaskill has asked for a special prosecutor to look into me he asked her opponent Josh Hawley who's the attorney general I'd never met Josh I yeah I don't I don't he doesn't work for me I never talk to anybody and his staff but McCaskill asked should be a special prosecutor to investigate project Vera tossed\nTo investigate hair on camera speaking her own words or are there any restrictions in the state of Missouri about filming people\nNone no and it it it it comes to the attorney general asking for me to be investigated his like someone telling you not to go on the radio and talk it's it's it's it's it's perfectly legal for me to do what I Do\nIn Missouri they're just Pennsylvania I Can't do it Illinois I Can't do it\nBut thirty eight states I can record people as long as I'm In the room with them and I'm reporting and it and let me say something else Sean if it's wrong for me to go Under Cover and record these folks then how wrong is it for them to mislead the voters if it's ... it's not fraud for me to record people\nBut it's certainly approaches fraud for her to misrepresent in such an awful way\nAnd and thank you Claire McCaskill for doing that an asking for me to be prosecuted because now every TV station and misery every single one has covered these videos and I think the same things that happen in North Dakota this week\nI think well that should've happened in North Dakota I mean if she's planning to be a super liberal I think the people in North Dakota and fairness to them they need to know 'em why can't you do it in\nAnd twelve other
