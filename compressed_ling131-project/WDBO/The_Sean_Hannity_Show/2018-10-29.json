all new President Trump for the first lady are headed to Pittsburgh tomorrow following the synagogue shooting over the weekend\nJust among the congregants killed at a shooting sent so slowly and we've just seen too much of it and I think also we always get the predictable\nYou know well gun issues I listen to me we've had too many shootings at schools at churches and this particular case this is the largest anti Semitic shooting in the history of the United states\nAnd you know when the president says that you know having armed guards at school or I've been advocating for a long time now retired police retired military\nOn the perimeter in the property on every in every hall of every school and that's one way to protect our children and I always ask a simple question and it's not to me about a gun debate if you find yourself in a building with an active shooter\nWould you prefer that there are ... you know that there are trained professionals in that building with firearms as a first line of defense especially knowing that most of these shootings are over ... seconds and even when you get the best response times from the greatest police departments\nIt's usually by the time they get there it's it's they're just counting the casualties and and trying to protect in in an orderly fashion those who either are injured or weren't injured\nSo it's a thought um it's been used before but that's not a big story of the day the saddest thing I watched all week I watch very closely\nAnd even hearing my named brought up a number of times and you know just shaking my head because people obviously know nothing about me they do nothing about you know they don't take the time to either bother to watch\nOr listen to this program if you've been listening to this program\nYou know we have been decrying going back to Kavanaugh the angry mobs\nIn Washington confronting spinning at senators not letting them closed doors there we've been talking about how dangerous the left wing mob mentality has gotten we've talked about the incidences of Sarah Sanders in her family or kids trying to get something to eat secretary Nielsen trying to get something to eat\nYou know we've talked about Pam Bondi trying to go see a movie Mitch McConnell walk into an airplane numerous times and Mitch McConnell have it as his table slammed on food ripped off his table just last weekend Kevin McCarthy's office having a Boulder sent through it\nYou know and I've been saying it it's we've got these everybody's got to stop\nNow we've been talking about the rhetoric we heard Hillary you can't be civil kick them Eric Holder and talking about Maxine Waters a lot\nYou know if you see these cabinet members you get a crowd well what does she thinks is going to happen when the crowd is formed and you follow the into restaurants and department stores and gas stations and you tell them they don't want it any anywhere anymore\nWell how is that going to end well\nTold the story when I met senator what's that guy's name from Connecticut again ... lumens ball when I was coming out there who was in the middle of the capital hearings you know I don't I don't understand being rude to somebody just because you have a political disagreement\nWe had a very pleasant conversation I invited them on my show I don't know what came of it but nothing obviously but I don't know where he's thinking about it what is the point of being rude to people are getting in people's faces says Cory Booker Spartacus says why is there this anger out there that we have you\nKnow all these bombs that are sent out\nThe first one went to George Soros and I said that day I said this this has got to stop and George Soros is no fan of Sean Hannity's funds groups that wants me to be silenced and go away but that's not what we do in this country we protect people you're allowed to have political views and spend your money the way you you see fit in life\nAnd even if it's being spent to silence made you know what I still believe in free to\nOr the ... you know I don't want to see any politician hurt\nAnd I have consistent consistently over the years said that\nWhen President Obama and people you know threatening him and people race how do we let how does somebody get into the White House has that happened we've got to protect our elected officials we have one president at the time we got it that represents the United states and that represents all of us\nAnd at the end of the day the powers in the ballot box but you know you watch something like what happened this weekend and you watch the Democratic party their lap dogs in the media wasted no time you know try to politicize this terrible shooting over the weekend pin blame the massacre\nOn President Trump look if the president says fake news is not serving the people of this country you can chronicle it you can watch it they don't see it which is sad their abuse and their bias and they're abusive a platform\nBut the reality is they live and they have an agenda and it's constantly on display at is not in any way shape or form of calls for violence\nSocial media Pittsburgh shooter this guy Rodney ... hours by the way he hated President Trump which has barely getting any play they're making you assume that he was must have been a Trump supporter\nNot only attacking people of the Jewish faith but President Trump for his closeness he hid this shooter hated the fact that President Trump and I think he could make an argument after so many presidents had promised to make Jerusalem the capital of Israel\nThat this president has has a line with Israel more than any other president in modern times in a Trump surrounded by a slur for Jewish people and then he ... this killer lamenting there's there's no maggot as long as there's a you know\nBad word of a quote ... infestation but\nDespite those facts you have people you know pretty close to blaming the president conservatives for the shooting Joe Biden widely expected to run for the presidency seemed to do so when he tweeted to the president's words matter silences complicity what is he talking about\nPaul Krugman New York times suggesting that Trump was to blame at least in part\nSpeaking sarcastically Krugman tweeting all linked to the story with the caption but no but none of the white supremacist terrorism has anything to do with Trump\nOh no it's unbelievable how they now have you know believe their own lives Alan Dershowitz had a powerful column and the Daily Caller today and he's been a a\nPassionate defender over the years a staunch defender and rightly so of Israel\nAnd Jewish civil rights anyway drew a link this morning and pointed out something the very few are willing to say and he said a day after a man killed eleven people in Pittsburgh synagogue he criticized presidents Obama and Clinton as well as Keith Ellison\nThis is Alan Dershowitz\nAnd then went on Fox and friends this morning there can't be any tolerance for anti Semitism we have to have zero tolerance President Obama meets with Eric ... they hit the picture for eight years\nShame on him but now we have the picture President Clinton sits on the same platform with Farrakhan shame on him\nKeith Ellison joins with ferret conference con one of the greatest purveyor of anti medicate just because he's black doesn't give him a pass on anti Semitism and any liberals who has any positive association with Farrakhan as part of the problem not the solution\nThe Pittsburgh massacre comes just two weeks after ... you know called Jewish Americans termites

making contacts with voters all around the country key races\nNow in the Senate will watch in Florida it's a dead heat and that's both a Senate with Rick Scott and that's for governor and Rhonda sent this was a couple of points behind and that's not looking good I'm also worried about panhandle of people showing up in the panhandle you got a very tight race for governor in the great state of Georgia although I think that's moving back towards camping back towards the Republican\nIn Tennessee it's ... if you want to keep the Senate it's a must win seats in Tennessee with Marsha Blackburn against bill Brett is it and the British ... team on tape saying that he was lying about cabin on that he's going to govern as a liberal\nAnd I think that really is taking people back also on tape staffers progressing calling the people Tennessee ignorant I don't think that's helpful so I think Marshall holds but people have got to get out the vote 'em we see Josh Hawley is doing very well and he's up by a couple of percentage points in Missouri against that phony Claire McCaskill\nAnd she's bragging about how she really politically it's just like Obama but she too like British citizen hiding who she really is\nHeidi Heitkamp in North Dakota is down by double digits she also was exposed by project beret toss a we now have\nIn a Braun in Indiana he's up by a couple of points against

libertarian roles that's like a half a boat for Donnelly we've got to hold the seat Heller seat in Nevada right now he's currently up in the polls but it's always tightened Nevada and then\nIt was on

cinema calling the people of Arizona crazy and saying Arizona's the\nMeth lab of democracy and inviting the attorneys for the blind shake the Arizona State university and saying right after nine eleven was perfectly fine of Americans want to join the enemy and joined the Taliban I don't have a problem with it anyway he believes that he can help get out the vote Ralph Reed is with us that's the Senate do you agree with my assessment\nIdeas Sean we're uh we're currently are contacting twenty six million\nEvangelical and pro life and pro family Catholic voters and Nineteen states we knocked on ... million nine hundred seven thousand two hundred twenty eight doors a through this weekend Sean not that we're counting and\nAs of this weekend five point eight million of the voters that we've contacted have already voted we expect that number to exceed ten million by election day we think we're going to have the biggest turnout of Christian voters we've ever had an internal actually\nWell I Hope so I'm I'm a little worried about the house uh I look at ras muses number the president has not had a higher approval rating than he does now which is perfect timing\nThe president literally has been going state by state and out doing everything within his power to make people aware that this is really hard mid term election history is going against the tide ear\nIf we are to hold the house and hold the Senate and pick up seats in the Senate but I think will definitely pick up seats in the Senate I'm worried about the house real clear politics average has the Democrats the two oh five Republicans a two hundred and you know basically you've got these dirty toss up seats or or thereabouts that are in play and that's going to make all the difference\nYeah that's right and and Sean what our advice to people right now certainly the thousands of volunteers that are out there and knock on doors and distributing voter education literature through our organization is ignore the polls ignore the press ignore the pundits do your job get the\n... and everybody tells me you know I make a living for people not ignoring\nYour except it okay but I think you're right though\nBecause the polls are so often so wrong I mean let's go back two years Donald Trump lost every state according to the exit polls five Fifteen on election day\nWell that's exactly right and I mean look when I was state party chairman in Georgia when we elected the first Republican governor and that stayed in a hundred and thirty four years\nThe last published poll in a midterm election\nShowed him trailing by Thirteen he won by five they were only off by a team points and particularly in mid term election where turnout is everything it's all a matter of who does a better job of getting their voters to the polls and Sean\nAnd it's been a wild day for Wall Street traders the Dow gained the hundreds of points and then lost hundreds more all in one day [noise]\nWay the

side we have some real bullets used over the weekend shooting up a Republican headquarters in Florida we saw the terrible voting in the Pittsburgh synagogue this weekend you have a Florida Man arrested for threatening to kill a Republican Congress but\nYeah I have an angry leftist mob disrupting Marsha Blackburn campaign rally would Lindsey Graham um we've seen two Republicans punched in

number one show and if you want to be a part of the programs amazing the criticism that has been out there or what should be good coverage of the president President now sending up to five thousand troops to the border\nOr a significant display of solidarity for our sovereignty our borders the rule of law as he should we saw about a week ago when at the Guatemala and Mexican border that\nLet people got to the border not download fence charged over the police and walk right through Mexico and we now have estimates as high as fourteen thousand people maybe less somewhere in there in around that area that are trying\nTo make it to the southern border the United states and the president and the secretary of homeland security of made it perfectly clear the vice president made it perfectly clear\nThat that's not going to be allowed to happen and we're a nation of laws to turn around\nThat to do with the right way to do with the legal way and in spite of that the marchers keep coming although the president of Mexico did make an offer for some of the migrants if they wanted would be given special consideration to work in southern Mexico um but not many takers apparently\nTo what I read this weekend you know a lot of people have been asking well okay how did they get so organized to organize them and who's financing all of this um there's been a lot of conspiracy theories that I've never believed the the only one that made any and it's not a conspiracy I'd I'd when the vice president said last week\nThat he felt that some of the leadership\nAnd Honduras was responsible for promoting the caravan and some countries from South America Venezuela particular we're we're helping to finance some of this that's the only\nBit of information that I found that was somewhat viable as a potential truth um anyway Sam Faddis is with us Sam Faddis sees a senior partner uh and former CIA operative with Thirty years of experience in conducting intelligence operations in the middle east South Asia Europe\nAnd he's worked against the most dangerous of terrorist organizations the planet has ever seen has extensive first hand experience with their methodology and tactics and a welcome to the program sir glad you're with us thanks for serving your\nCountry thank you for having me pleasure\nWhat so you're you wrote a column midnight I haven't read the whole column ... my read a bit is is you think that the vice president was probably right on the mark\nWithout question what on the mark I mean there's actually there's actually a great mystery here I mean the guys that organized this are folks from my party called ... which is a Honduran Marxist Party\nA number of years ago supportive of of of the president's elected who basically tried to ah overthrow the constitutional make himself all presidents for life here in bed with the Venezuelans\nAnd the leave out in front of God and everybody all over the Internet there will and organize them that are posted videos and pictures from the marks\nSo again no great great mystery this is the work of guys allied with Venezuela Marxist and it is in effect a giant covert action campaign designed to make the American\nGovernment or bad in our allies look that\nWell I mean look the America doesn't have much of a of a choice and and this has to be obvious to people ... and I'm listening and watching the comments and some people sort of\nAssociating this with ... with anti immigrant sentiment or is he in a phobia or whatever the the charges it's not true all conservatives are saying we don't care where immigrants come from the president talked about a border wall\nWith a big door and that people should respect our laws are constitutional republic\nAmerican sovereignty and come in and if you want to come in we just need to check out make sure that you don't come here with radical ideas and that you have the ability\nTo sustain yourself and don't need our help and then we can let you in and you could become a part of our family to the extent that you want to go through the process and maybe become a citizen I don't think that's too much to ask that is called the legal wet\nIt without question this doesn't have anything to do with a Smith ethnicity because mommy seem to do with race\nThis is yeah we're a nation of immigrants were also with nation of laws come in according to legal immigration procedures period which don't simply get to walk across the border I have always wondered\nBy the way those folks that are actively don't want to control the border why is it the only people who can walk here should be allowed to getting just added stuff if that's the principal\nWell what I'm married I'm as I don't want anybody to get hurt because America the president means what he ...\nPeople rush across our border beat at a port of entry or along the border that has not fence and that our military is on the border the military is going to be given the order to stop them now we don't want anybody hurt I don't want and I'm assuming Ninety nine point eight percent of the people coming here\nAre coming here because they come from impoverished countries and they want a better life for themselves and their family that's my guess but\nNobody can vouch for every single person in that caravan\nAnd for the sake and safety of the American people we can't let that number of people rush across the border have no vetting of the people and sadly maybe amongst the fourteen thousand there's one or five people that come here with intentions to bring us harm\nBut I agree with you on a ... percent we don't want to vote for and also it it was undoubtedly true that most of these people are simply on being utilized by folks hostile to the U.S stuff probably been lied to on the gun I'm told that when they get to the border will be allowed to cross\nOn so they are being put in the in the middle of this I'm simply lose HUD ugly as human shields on Conan harder on the behalf of folks hostile to the United states that is a horrible tragedy because these are mostly just average people will be used\nNow look I Will tell you that you know what I really feel sorry for people I've

Congress in common sense conservative is\nI'm already know Steinman dismiss [noise]\nGlad you're with us twenty five now till the top of the hour a there are about thirty races now we have identified actually if you look real clear politics they have they ever narrow this down to five races that they believe will be the tipping point it's actually thirty racist kind of like what we have but\nThey they have a five seat race they've got the Republicans locked in a two hundred seats they got the Democrats locked in a two hundred and five seats\nAnd the remaining seats are up for grabs in other words they are toss ups in other words if we win the seats and that means that Republicans will retain the house control of the house of representatives now that would be the super when you want to go for the Senate is looking better but don't take anything for granted I think will have pick ups\nI think will hold Tennessee with Marsha Blackburn I think we can beat Claire McCaskill Heidi Heitkamp I think Joe Donnelly can be beaten these down in the polls I Believe that Christians cinema can be beaten as well how she was up at three in the late\nSuppose beyond any imagination I have a poll has a dead heat exact even tie forty six all Nelson versus Rick Scott who's been a phenomenal governor for the great state of Florida\nRun the sentence was coming back interesting John James and Michigan is cut his\nThe leaders stabbing out in half\nAnd it's only a six point race in Michigan where it was once twenty and so he's doing very well a lot of eyes are paying attention to the latest poll of West Virginia where mentioned is down by two\nIn New Jersey Menendez is only up by three and seeing as very weak and could be the big surprise of the night both West Virginia and New Jersey to states to watch for potential surprise and not likely but potential uh one of the house races that are on our top\nThirty is Marty a no Stein is a gold medal is currently serves as the chairman of the board of commissioners for Lehigh County Pennsylvania you're running for\nCongress there in the Pennsylvania seventh district of filled Charlie dense empty seat and a big Trump supporter but it it's a tight race where you are you're one of the thirty that will tip the balance of power how's it going there\nAnd I'll say that Sean first of all thank you for having me on the show you know out campaigning hard every single day eating every corner of this district and I got to tell you there's a lot of motivation out there right now I think people are starting to pay attention they understand what's at stake and they went to the Democrats in November six\nWell look the issue to me are simple but we have is we know what the Democrats agenda is to impeach trumpet don't say it open borders sanctuary cities sanctuary states but don't say it keep Obamacare but don't say that either just say work for great health care for all of making some wonderful just like you know keep your doctor your plan and pay less that's their agenda and they want their crumbs back beyond\nThat it's let's hide and not tell people what we really stand for because when we do we know we lose which is why all these we have now another Senate candidate will be exposing tonight we've got reticent in Tennessee with Claire McCaskill we got Heidi Heitkamp will unveil another senator tonight all caught on tape all three campaigns\nSaying that they purposely running as moderates but they plan to govern as liberals and their offices are laughing\nAnd the case of Tennessee you got reticence that calling the people in Tennessee ignorant so is your opponent out there saying what they're really going to run on what they believe in\nGod I absolutely not you know she's running as somebody she's not at the end of the day are Democrats they everybody hates Trump like they do [noise] you know and to me they're completely out of touch they can't see past are angry at least Sean and let's not forget don't forget election night two thousand sixteen when the media ... to ... out there\nOne of the best the best case of Hillary won in the worst case of Trump won and yet Donald Trump still wants\nNow we have a president wherever the president is has a record Hillary's true colors have come out contrast after two thousand eight where it was best case Obama look what happened in two thousand tend to mid term stink about that the voters corrected their mistake Obama last sixty three house seats and what's there to correct now what part of the Trump success story to the voters want to change\nGive the crumbs back increase the regulator watched jobs go back overseas seeing and that's that's the difference my opponent has talked about that they're hiding behind a bunch of smoke and mirrors and not running for really are but I think the ... the voters are a lot smarter than that right now and we're going to some people in November six", "show_name": "The Sean Hannity Show", "year": "2018",
