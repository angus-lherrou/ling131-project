hurricane to hit coming in at this angle was a hurricane ... back in Nineteen Ninety five hurricane cake\nIf they're in November believe it or not um Nineteen eighty five that was a major hurricane in

to\nNational Hurricane center is forecasting storm surge\nRight uh you you don't have a car insurance for gasoline you don't have home owners insurance for lawn care insurance just for the big things and we've tried to ensure everything top down and that's led to the last you know really a ten years of\nInsurance premiums that have doubled or tripled we need to do is insured less which is how every other insurance product works they keep it that is means doctors have to make more of the services they provide affordable\nAnd they can if they cut out the middleman and streamline than a simple\nAnd how big is your practice how many patients do you have in your facility the atlas MD and Wichita\nIn Wichita we have five doctors and over thirty two hundred patients\nUnbelievable and your age and you give concierge care at all I could pick up a phone and I'm getting a doctor at three in the morning that it's going to answer my call\nYou do you have and I could go down and see somebody at three AM in the morning\nIf you need stitches or emergency you know a lot of history and phone calls or chest pain which we might send the yard but a lot of times the kid who's sick and a mom who's worried and\nUm you of if you can avoid the ER you can avoid a thousand or two thousand dollar bill that's how you get health care health insurance is a card in your wallet healthcare is access to your doctor yeah\nAll right and then how many other practices around the country have you been able to to provide your model that they have duplicated how you you've been out and about and a champion of this for a long time\nYet we've helped over five hundred and fifty doctors convert to this model in the last few years but there's about a thousand total there forty eight states every state except north and South Dakota right now but we have one about to launch in North Dakota and then it's even gotten a little bit international so um this is a a sound tried and true model\nNow and what do you do Dr growth in terms of your president of duck ah docks where a patient care foundation you know now that we have alternatives that are working real life experiences seems to me that we ought to be able to duplicate it a lot more than we are\nAbsolutely a so doctor patient care foundation was a physician on health policy because doctors never seem to be a tape of one of her having conversations about health care\nSo we put traditions are back in ... Congress social personally I I also have a primary care practice much like that with some ... here in southwest Florida a practice health are plus when you was why are we using insurance to pay for health are for basic primary care services\nSolid does is create obstacles to access some tour where ... ... ... ... says Dr Josh and we're seeing patients come to us from all over the state of Florida and even from outside of the country where ... medical tourism or ... what we're finding is that\nYou know not not the same thing about health insurance we're using it and you know when somebody is you know pay twice the amount of money for a service because ... ...\nAnd if you don't trust drives up the cost of the product so an MRI cash course Ross is two hundred and twenty dollars while using her commercial insurance you know we go through all the the hoops ticket it authorized\nCo pays five hundred dollars or so we we see this time and again on the more people are coming out of pocket to pay for health health or\nI'll let you signed up to ... more insurance seems to be becoming an optical I'm an ... solution so but I'm pleased to see the worst shifting the conversational from a coverage for everyone who I'm Talking about what could\nName was this red alert hey major problem on the roadway and he's got a disabled vehicle I for these kind of lead this is the second one today in the right lane road ranger in there and say you're gonna have to move left\nAnd you do have a backup from came in some of the least a half hour you might want to consider you know be two years Seventeen Ninety ... downtown ... traffic to two to three two I'm Jackie O'Brian has been in Ninety six point five red alert traffic advisory what's\nInteresting to me is that a Republican is within striking distance and that gubernatorial race out in California because instinctively people no we can't afford to pay\nFor every illegal immigrant in the country but the reality is is that if I Lived in Wichita, Kansas I Would be a part of atlas empty and I would be your patient\nDr ... because I I think it's the best deal I liked the idea of being able to call my doctor whenever I'm sick or if I have a kid that sick every parent wants the ability to do that and your preserved for service provides it for fifty bucks a month now how much does the average in Wichita, Kansas catastrophic planet if for the big things heart attack\nA accident or cancer how much with one of those plans cost\nAbout five hundred dollars to family five hundred dollars for a year or a month a month\nOr so and the current rates closer to you know a thousand twelve hundred a across the nation people are paying more for health insurance each month and they're paying for their mortgage if the Trump tax cuts only put a hundred dollars\nPer household per month in and they're being credited with the economic boom of your four point two percent GDP\nIf we fix health insurance we could put five hundred dollars back in the pocket of every household a the the real ... and the the politician their heads in California is to send them on a ridge analogy this throwing more money at the problem has never fixed it\nWhat we're doing is Dr Lee and ourselves and and a thousand other physicians is is innovating and saying how do we get much cheaper how do we make it so patients don't have co pays how do we provide stitches for no cost because they're so affordable\nI'm actually looking at ways it fundamentally fixing the system that's what we need not just promises of more spending\nWay and if I could add add to that just a a you know as far as the cost of care you know the biggest thing that people ask us his flow how can I just get major medical you know we\nWe can afford what what services but direct karma care practices are providing but we just need something catastrophic well mama care made that illegal\nAh so little stretching just brought by ... get access to these major medical plans called ... short term medical plans and you know some would argue that these are actually true insurance they don't cover anything except the major medical expenses Seventy five dollars a month a\nLot but what it is this can be implemented easily city by city town by town we can duplicate the model it already does take care of individuals with preexisting conditions if somebody wants to sign up for outlets MD and they have a preexisting condition or Dr ... denied them service\nEverybody's welcome and everybody's price the same just based on age um we know we're going to work harder for some patients but will not have to work as hard for other patients and we don't want to know judged by their illness\nHow did you get to who directly negotiate these prices with these pharmaceutical companies\nBoy I Wish I could say was because we are so darn good at it um the the truth is it's so much more simple than that I\nHave a doctor's in forty four states are allowed to work directly with pharmaceutical wholesalers so just like you can go to Costco and get something for much cheaper because you pay a membership\nWe do the same thing and we're able to\nGet the you know the actual cost of medicine might be a ten dollars for a thousand pills and because we don't have a staff of seven people per physician fighting insurance\nWe can lower the cost and and pass the savings on directly to the patient that this is a win for everybody we we don't take care of of Republicans or Democrats we take care of people\nSo how does somebody had to a group of doctors in New York say implement those cars are going to look at this and say fifty bucks a month I Can't make ten cents off of that\nWhere they're going to have to move to New York because they don't make it easy but um they could work with a pharmacist in New York state's one of the few states that make it a very difficult but then a pharmacist could say um if you do a five dollar a month membership with them then you get the
