W DDR gene likely here with Andre classes you want to see a picture of us in the news studio we just posted it on our Facebook pages and you could see it on\nTwitter as well ah the news Ninety six point five WD via Facebook page I'll work on getting up there enjoying the new studios Andre\nOh absolutely absolutely gene well time is dwindling down we've got a couple actually we've got like four things to do here so let's finish the big three things that you need to know in tech with uh are talked about windows tens\nOr you've got gene so uh last week we talked about the October update for windows ten and why Microsoft had to pull it back after cases of people gang or information delete it off their computers\nIt turned out the bug was related to a feature that was introduced in windows called known folders um where window sets up default containers for documents pictures in certain type of files and they can actually be redirected to a select groups have different folders or another location\nOn the system and I'm In this new update Microsoft decides hey we can optimize the fastest I'm a little bit if we if there was a redirect and uh then we can just delete a clear up the old direct to raise the\nProblem is is that when you have multiple had multiple files in multiple different places like if you had the default container and other folders people that had their files in the default location or just getting they were just being wiped out the system wasn't checking to see whether there was actually anything in there\nSo Microsoft is fixed above supposedly as and uh they've released it for their insider testing\nAnd then subsequently um the windows ten October update or should be back out within the next couple of weeks a good thing is that for people that didn't style the update\nWho didn't necessarily modify the default location for their documents or pictures on which most people usually have to take an extra technical step or two to do that then they would have been completely unaffected by this bug a so fortunately ah\nI'm under the situation of considerably small amount of people were affecting compared to how it was originally reported and how has a ritual and believed to have occurred but\nNonetheless uh it's definitely a big slip up especially since this had actually been to report it to Microsoft before they did the official release\nSo definitely a bit of a Boo Boo by Microsoft and hopefully this updated little out we'll go we'll go without a hitch again another big big up they come in for windows and pretty soon which will be the windows and build Eighteen oh nine\nAnd now I'm just a few minutes left in today or do I want to go ahead and go into our business spotlights like new it or they talked about earlier we got a lot of

massive refreshed computers he'll be back here next Sunday at two o'clock for another hour of tech talk I'm Jean whatsoever I get a break for\nSo what I Want to do first ... the top of the hour sure okay is to kind of discussion those sorts of things that we should be doing right here and right now to take care of ourselves during this season coming up and what have we got going on where we have weather changes waves of blame a flu\nYou know on the weather you know well it's getting cold and now we have people closer together and blah blah blah blah blah therefore the the new becomes endemic I already know two people who have gotten it so far yeah well I'll tell you what I haven't put a sweater on and five years\nOkay so I really don't think it's the weather on all night Warren close they're just sitting in store it yeah yeah they'll sit there and then you know I've got some beautiful sweaters that my mom that\nAre for me and the other and they're just\nThey just sit there I I I keep them as a Memorial Day at least ... you're not put much wear\nAnd tear nowhere in Canada on the other just the same they weren't when I was sixteen [laughter] in any of that okay so what we need to do is to look at influenza and look at it a little bit differently than we might have in the past you know we do need to go out and consider the fact that there are certain influences strains that are known to kill\nOkay that was some finality you know you're dead you know it's not like Mary or where you put another token and then you've got another life back\nNo you can type pretty darn dead okay from influenza where the infections that follow it you know we have anti viral array of anti bacterial but we can't we we don't have anti resurrect of medications are just doesn't Eric Hi resurrect bringing back the dead oh you know you can't do it once you're gone you're gone and so\nWhat can you do to improve your risks well one thing is to use your seatbelt and those that can help you the flu and not so much is it can help you to wash your hands when you're in the grocery stores it may will do that especially for things like in parrot bugs\nI mean who knows you have some diaper ... you know a diaper kids sitting on that little tray that you put your meat and you don't think that's going to make a difference you put your salad on their head and you're going to be eating somebody's eat coal I before it's all said and done but what about influenza\nOkay so there's some things that you need to do and you should do now one of which is to get the influenza inoculation\nWhy is that because millions of people have died over the decades due to flu prevent a plea for the most part you know the ... you couldn't do too much for the ones during the Nineteen Eighteen epidemic but you sure as heck can do for the ones that are going to go on\nThis year or next year your body cannot maintain isn't that immunity\nReally longer than one season that's the reason why you need to be knock you leave the time after time you know you can get the ... you know just going to common cold ... your body will not remain immunity to that will not have an immune system reaction that's sufficient after six weeks recovery\nThere are certain infections that the body does not do well in terms of cellular or a inherent immunity it does not work\nSo there are some things I'm going to ask you to do and if you do it great if you don't ah that sucks to be you and and and here so the the ... the flu vaccine is something you should do and don't be a worse go get it done take the ten minutes it takes to get it done at public school to go to CBS go to if you have to go when you were going to Walgreens\nBut go and get it done to ever happen well you need to okay if it can it can care gotten the flu oh never such a very very long time okay [laughter] and it can cost you a couple of weeks worth of your life or longer\nOkay my hotel I don't have time for a couple of we know you don't okay and if and if it hit your paycheck 'cause you didn't have that that the sick time saved up becomes costly\nOkay so your job is important okay so that's just the way the thing goes you are not necessarily it you know indispensable but if you're down for a couple of weeks or longer okay you might find yourself being dispensed this new dispensable it happens that wage employers don't necessarily really care whether or not you get sick\nThat's that's a fact of life you don't really care if your employer necessarily get sick so here's what I'd like to do I'd like to go get something called collapse drum that spelled C O L O S T R U M\nThe dosages between two hundred and fifty five hundred milligrams daily you want to do it once a day and what this does is every bit as effective in preventing influenza as is the ... self\nHere's the combination of the two and you've got the world by the going spell it one more time C O L O S T E R U M ... you want the capsules not the liquid\nThe one that I found was the best one is made by a company called Douglas and we buy maybe four or five hundred bottles of this stuff for the clip is is comparable to [noise] I have one guy tried to get me to buy Congo ... no ... is cheap it's not multi level marketing\nOkay none of that you know gee we're going to add fourteen layers of of of profitability on top of it you know we buy trip manufacture\nYou know we buy added in volume so we get the price down okay than we pass it ride along but you can get it pretty much wherever you think you can get it you might go on Amazon you'll just pay a list price for it and then what do you do okay you're getting ... which is a healthy slug it ... along with something called ... elect of pheromones\nKick out um something old growth hormone you're getting to bang for your buck with it it works helps you sleep at all to do lots of cool things but go out get it because you're going to need it the second thing you're going to want to have me do that every day just do one or two capitals every day\nYou come down with shingles or somebody in your household come settled shingles you do the same thing except you take three or four per day OK okay it'll keep you from from getting infected given that you recommend getting this stuff from a world where there's a store locally called stages of life you can come and get it from us or you can go look for it yourself it doesn't really matter\nOkay you know it's like it's like anything else you know there there if you go on line you can find ... you know brand name Douglas you'll find it hard to find okay but that's the stuff that you want\nThe second thing you want to get his licorice route extract\nWe have it's cheap you can get anywhere okay liquor shrewd extract has something called ... acid groceries gas citizen anti viral extra kick on the on the on the top and then the third piece of the puzzle is an ... an ac and you don't take the NFC until you start to cough\nAnd what it does it clears the secretion it allows you to um to basically keeps you from getting pneumonia stuff let's get\nInteresting [laughter] so ah and then so you're saying combined that stuff with\nThe flu shots you bet yeah and and if you do the two together you're good to go into the classroom was kind of interesting okay because it has other benefits that go along with the one that it can help people um sleep a little bit you know ... very very helpful if you have other types of infections it's pretty interesting but it does work alright\nComing up to our first

prescription for that but it's I'm trying to keep myself from getting sick\nIs called preventive health yeah and then tremendously and he's with the exception of those things that they're told to do like flu shots okay they just they pay for as little as they can that's that's their business model you pay them they do nothing\nMarvels model but at the stage of life we brought in a new program like this week okay where if you buy your products from us on our website okay whether it's done auto ship or one shot deal doesn't make a lot of difference although the ownership I think makes more sense\nWhen it when you're done with and you pay for it with your credit card it generates a PDF\nThat gives you a just say an essay documentation what does that mean it makes it a tax deductible\nOr it makes it reimbursed civil under your age your essay accounts if you have an essay or a just a credit card frequently it will accept that as payment and then you have your documentation and you're done\nSo if you're an existing patient divorce and you're listening to this and you're starting to go my God I should have waited a year it actually went back a year so if you go on to your account\nOkay and you hit a each of the different times you've bought it okay whatever you bought up you can see all of your orders for the past year you click on the order you go all the way of writing you're gonna see a little PBS thing it says the PDF receipt\nAnd it actually gives you an explanation for why you're taking it what it's for and so on and so forth which you know is sufficient to make it tax deductible and or reimbursed under essay and they just they account now there are no guarantees that they're going to do anything with it because that's the way life is right\nBut at least you have the option to try you have you\nHave that what you need to have a tax deductible if you're I just say doesn't cover it\nRight there it is okay it is done okay it's got every element that you need to make a tax deductible\nSo the F the atrazine makes the greatest sense why because it's your money you put it in you pretty well can tell them how to how to handle it if I say that's an insurance product they also like to take your money and give you back for we did this in response to request that we have from a really large company\nThat does um recalled healthy they do insurance benefits for employers and employees that came and said well we'd like to do this for for for employees have exactly what you're asking for can what can you do to make it at first they and they just take a ... a ... pliable\nSo I spent God Knows maybe forty or fifty hours over the past two weeks trying to do this to give up and running and darn near we got it\nAnd I just happened to be asked you have you asked the question\nI fully intend to dimension that on the air today and forgot\nWell I'm Glad I thank you [laughter] do some rapid fire calls before time runs out literary alright user down there in Miami wow Caesar you're on the air but time is short\nConflict ... close to you know why the king was the political if I go to the ground so but it's not working what you do\nOkay contact contact Herman Titus is a histamine released type of a deal okay sometimes your best bet is just to kind of let it run its course sometimes if you go out and you use a topical bend the drill it'll actually get worse\nWhen you're using a topical cortisone just get worse because frequently ah what's the word I'm looking for is it it's also allergenic too many individuals usually what I Do under these circumstances used a topical castor oil\nYou can buy this a very very inexpensively put on a piece of cloth wipe it over the area and it settles down works quickly stuff was described in the Bible for God's sakes it's been around since the late bronze age and it works just fine so before you joined sing goofy especially in Miami\nTribe the Castro oil trick was on the cutting cloth and wipe it over the area do it a couple of times a day that should squared away\nThanks Caesar appreciate the call let's go to Amy Amy you're on the area of the question about asthma\nUm for the last two years I've been coughing up quite a bit ... okay and then he'll pull the knowledge it and they keep saying okay but I'm getting\nWe're having a hard time breathing because it gets it so much\nOf a couple of things you want to check yourself for one of which and this is gonna sound kind of goofy you need to make sure that you don't have one of these uh incomplete penetration cystic fibrosis type pictures might have uh several patients were this happened\nWhereas a pair pair sister's actually come quickly to mind where they had a similar issue what I did was I started a month and as a deal system or in a city you take five hundred milligrams one or two of these capsules three to four times a day at a generic Musa next to it and drink lots of water\nWhat does this do it thins the secretion she can call them up and out the second thing you want to do and this is your prescription is get something called sucrose said\nAnd you want to take a grandma sucrose waited bedtime and the reason is is if you have a little bit of reflects itself it dry this attends to exacerbate despite irritating vocal cords so you can use I don't Tom's it just doesn't work as well as the ... All right that brings us right\nTo the end stages of life with Dr David Clyde thanks so much for being a part of the program Dr Klein is back next Sunday at three o'clock news Ninety six point five WBFO Daniel Vargas has your news at four o'clock [noise]\nYeah but but the markets you're exactly right you know the funny thing is when the markets start to fall a I think what happens for most people if they start to to think less about being involved in the markets I think there's a lot of folks out there that I think\nSometimes you know they like to get involved in the markets they'd like to start trading perhaps they want to start learning some things and then the market goes down and they say see and that's why I'm not in the market\nRight a lot of people that don't know much about the markets or trading\nUh you know they're kind of scared of it to begin with right 'cause they don't know about it so it's like the unknown and then when the market really tanks like\nWhoa so so here's what I Want you to do I play a little game and I want you to be the temperament of every man okay or every woman everyday hers that's who I Am that only Marino here for the listeners every person outright okay when I read this statement\nI Want you to tell me how you how it makes you feel okay a\nLast Wednesday the market dropped or the Dow dropped eight hundred and thirty one points has it make you feel\n[noise] not very good\nNot very good okay next one um I wouldn't be surprised to see another correction long time bowl Jeremy Jeremy Siegel warns\nAs the average Joe or Mary [laughter] that doesn't make me feel too good either\nThat doesn't make you feel too good to know how 'bout Nobel Prize winner Robert Shiller warns this is a risky time in the markets\n[noise] well if I've been listening to the radio show and I'm thinking about getting in the markets and then they say this could be a risky time to get in the markets then I'm going to say oh maybe I should wait\nAll right the next one Morgan Stanley the stock market is at a tipping point how's it makes you feel\nThat that one doesn't really bother me that much um I Know Morgan Stanley and you know some of the other big banks they've been saying that for a while but that's kind of a chance at a tipping point but you know when you see it's a risky time it is a correction and all those those terms of ... yeah yeah very wary\nAbout there's more pain to come for stocks according to handle is watching the charts\nWell again as a regular Joe uh after\nThis week I may be in pain already so I'm thinking that's not good either more pay there's more pain that come\nHere here's the thing and and I get\nThat I mean Amazons down you know two hundred and fifty points\nYeah yeah I don't want any more pain yeah I hear ya yeah I hear ya\nAh here's the thing though a particular someone not meet somebody I Know that works here at the radio station a has a large position in a in net flicks yeah and I know based upon a conversation I had with him yesterday he's not that happy either\n[noise] yeah I can understand that but you know what here's here's the thing if if your if your first thought about these big moves and the the volatility conversations and the fact of the market could go down significantly and those kinds of things\nIf you're really concerned about that or if they teach in the stomach a little bit ... than the reality is I'm not sure that you're comfortable with the idea of trading\nThe reason I say that is because the market goes up and down right right consistently now the we've had this conversation for a really long time on the show that the higher the market goes the greater the potential of the downside move is going to be but let me tell you\nThat downside move\nCreates a huge opportunity in the markets if you have the skill set to be able to take advantage of it and I'm telling ya again and again I really have to get real people now\nThat people that are have been listening to us for a week in and week out and they're thinking\nYeah he's been talking about you know the market coming down and we've been talking about making money as the market goes down well here's the reality\nWhen the market falls eight hundred points you don't have to be scared of it you can actually make money as the market goes down and I know if you're an investor it's it's not always that cut and dry ... if you understand how to trade the financial markets\nYou look at all of these these comments that I just read and said how's that make you feel each one of those comments as an opportunity you really don't care which direction the market is going as long as you can make some money well\nFor the people that have been listening to the radio show for any length of time or even if you just listen you know last week\nEverything that you just said you have said before and I bet you the people that I've heard you say it time and time again we're thinking about you this week and they're thinking they should be thinking man\nIf I wouldn't have 'em procrastinated and if I wouldn't\nHave put off going to the workshop TA I might know already how to trade or short stocks or take advantage of the down move in the market and this is exactly what the guy on the radio has been talking about oh yeah ... exactly\nWhat Chris has been talking about holy cow the market tanked and uh you know uh if I knew how to trade I could be making some money now I'm seeing maybe maybe people were thinking about you this week now they're seeing you know what you've been saying\nSeeing what I've been saying yeah and I think for hearing it you know what we talk about this in the workshop a couple of times a week\nAnd it is important to understand that at financial plan um your ability to to be involved in the financial markets has to have the ability to make money as the market goes up and as the market goes down because if you're just standing on one side of the market I use the filtration all the time you're like a box or in a ring standing with one arm tied behind their back\nAnd you're never going to win a battle like that so here's what I Want you to do I want you to keep in mind two things I Would not not you necessarily Tony ... you are listening to us on the radio that one thing is that a healthy market moves up and down\nSo the definition of a bullish trend going into instructor mode here the definition of a bullish trend is a series of higher highs and higher lows okay\nPartly cloudy and when this afternoon with the highest Ninety will run about five

again thank you so\nMuch for sharing part of your precious weekend with us\nI really really do that because we all know how fast the weekends go by how much we cherish them how much you may have to do\nAnd we appreciate you tune in and spending part of it with us as I mentioned before the news if you would like to learn ways to generate better returns as you build wealth or learn to create an additional stream of income\nThat doesn't require a whole lotta time by trading\nPick up the phone call eight eight eight six one eight nine two four nine eight eight eight six one eight nine two four nine tell them you heard it on the radio\nAnd you want to reserve your seat in this week's upcoming workshop at the on line to training academy to central Florida locations one in like Mary one in St Petersburg\nHigh Christopher Hill welcome back to the show thank you so you got a fresh cut but Joe there that's good before we get into the most popular part of the show which we always do right here at this time of the show let's talk about the asset class as quickly as I mentioned the right before we went into the news there\nAre the different asset classes that they teach you teach people to trade at the online trading ketamine futures for X options and of course stocks\nYeah I think that's that's a good idea because I when we are in last segments we were talking about the stock market in general and how it's been moving to the downsides and that creates a little fear and folks maybe maybe if they do think about the fact that you can't treat things other than the stock market\nOr in these volatile times maybe that helps people to think that uh to realize that you know sometimes down is good enough as bad because you're not always thinking about stocks\nLike when we when we teach people at at the academy we are teaching leveraged asset classes for the most part we we do teach a little bit about stocks but we also teach as you said options futures and for acts and the reason that we do that is that leverage component and\nIf you're not familiar with the term leverage leverage just really means that you're able to use a little bit of money in the markets to do a lot of heavy lifting so for those folks that I always think that the trading is a very expensive\nUh endeavor you might find out if you come to a workshop that it doesn't take quite as much money as you wouldn't ... because the leverage factor that goes along with\nA futures for X and options uh works like this let's let's say that um I was going to put two thousand dollars into a trade or in the options market if I was going to do that delivers factor is tend to one\nSo tend to want leverage means that my two thousand dollars is actually lifting twenty thousand dollars worth of stocks okay so I'm trading twenty thousand dollars worth of stocks with a two thousand dollar investment\nIf I'm In the futures market my or the leverage factor in the futures market is actually\nTwenty to one so if I had a two thousand dollar investment I Would be lifting forty thousand dollars worth of futures come on yeah and then the big one is for acts and thats treating currencies\nAre and that is a fifty to one leverage factor so your two thousand dollars is actually allowing you to trade a hundred thousand\nThe dollars and currency so you can actually generate some incredible returns when you're using leverage asset classes and that helps people to actually make decent amount of money at a decent amount of money that makes a difference in their life\nOr rather than trying to generate one two three percent returns on their trades they can actually generate some returns that are more like twenty five fifty Seventy five a hundred percent\nAnd it makes a substantial difference in some people's lives\nSo and again you that that eliminates one of the many misconceptions that we hear from people that you know I'd like to get into the markets where I'd like to learn how to trade but I don't have a whole lot of money 'cause again when when you said the markets are you talking about trading people generally think about the stock markets and then they\nThink of all these really popular really expensive stocks and think well I don't have enough money for that so you don't need a whole lot of money to get started you could open a for X account with what a thousand bucks even less five hundred bucks right yeah so\nYou can you don't need a whole lot of money to get started a and using the power of leverage you can generate some really good returns and I know uh what happens a lot is people come to the workshops they get educated\nAnd when they start trading after a while they don't even care about the stock market anymore people trade futures they trade options whatever they don't even bother with stocks really that's true and I\nAnd for X world as well uh that's really the big ones so yeah there's lots of opportunity out there and if you don't know very much about the markets and you'd like to figure out a little bit about it I Would encourage you to come to the workshop and spent some time with us figure it out see for three of\nTons of opportunity and again that some of those markets trade a way way beyond four thirty in the afternoon when the stock market closest so if you are interested eight eight eight six one eight nine two four nine\nThat would be

B. B. Oh thank you again for tuning in and spending part of your weekend with us we really do appreciate that I'm Tony Marino along with\nChris serving if you missed it before the break eight eight eight six one eight nine two four nine that is the number to call and reserve your seat in this week's upcoming workshop it's a three hundred dollar value\nComprehensive three hour workshop you can go absolutely for free and meet Chris urban and ask any questions that you might want to ask eight eight eight six one eight nine two four nine Chris as always\nThe the time has gone by quickly uh we talk a little bit about a lot of things I'm most importantly\nPeople need to make more money people need to protect whatever investments they already\nHave a and and hopefully they made money and the massive run up that we've had to this point and we also started talking a little bit about self directing in the last segment before we went to the break what exactly does that mean\nWhether you're talking about income or whether you're talking about wealth building\nYou know the need to make some money maybe you want to generate a secondary stream of income whether you want to you know start a whole new trading career and have that replace your current income whether you're looking at all a long term retirement account that you're not exactly where you want to be or maybe you've got plenty of money\nAnd you just need to figure out how to protect it a self directing really just means that you're going to be in control of your future your financial future\nSo rather than handing your money off to somebody else who well I mean most people feel like they can trust the person they're working with right um but that's not always justified because the reality is everybody that out\nThere is is doing something to make a buck most of the time okay if they have a business or if they're at a mutual fund manager or if they're a money manager or whatever it is everybody's trying to make a dollar or so that they can live right well the question is you know are they taking advantage of you\nIn order to make their income and nobody wants that the only person that really cares about their own money\nIs you maybe I could say that differently you're the person that cares most about your own money\nUh now that the person that you may be working with\nMay have some good insight or but if regardless of who it is if you can keep the money that you are giving them to manage your money it will make a dramatic impact on your income or your retirement account or how much you keep at the end of the day and let's\nBe clear this is not because some people listening now I think you're just talking about people that have a lot of money and have you know investment gurus handling their money this is a this is for anyone that even has an IRA or four oh one K. which almost everybody does\nI mean there's somebody that's managing that IRA or managing that four O. one K. and you're paying fees whether you know it or not and as you mentioned before the fees really really add up over the years of of time\nYeah and what if you're I mean if you think about it if if if it is\nA volatility in the markets right now a state of volatility continues to the downside here and if you're looking at a retirement account that you spent a lot of time trying to build up over the past ten years the market's up three hundred percent well if you're trying to figure out how to keep that money\nTypically when you're working with a money manager no fence the money managers but their objective is not to show you how to make money as the market's going down and if you could figure out that skill where you know maybe you're making\nI don't know somewhere between eight and a Fifteen Percent as the market goes up or\nIf you could figure out how to make between eight and Fifteen Percent as the market goes down that's really the issue to be able to learn how to make money as the market goes either direction whether it's a short term trading count that you're trying to generate income from or a long term\nA wealth account that you're going to try to retire on you've got to figure out how to make money and protect money and you need to learn how to do it rather than let somebody else show you what to do\nYeah and for folks that don't know what to do or how to do it the one thing we know is the market goes down a lot faster than it goes up and if you've been building up a four one K. and IRA or a trading account or anything like that are going to one side you know going up or it's going to go down fast\nSo you need to get to the phone right now reserve one of the limited number of seats that have been made available to radio listeners at this week's upcoming
