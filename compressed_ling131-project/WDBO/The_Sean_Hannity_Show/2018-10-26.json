investigation is still ongoing I may not be able to answer questions about his background or or about his motive\nWhat I can say is that this was a nationwide investigation of enormous scope of the greatest importance our investigation ranged from New York\nTo Delaware to Maryland to the district of Columbia to Florida to California and as it always\nThat was the FBI responded with every resource we've got including our joint terrorism task forces are counterterrorism division in our world renowned experts at the FBI lab in Quantico\nBut by then I I really can't underscore this enough we did not act alone as you can see from the agencies and departments represented up here today\nA threat of this scope of this magnitude requires all of us working shoulder to shoulder at today's arrest is a testament\nTo the strength of our partnerships and what we can do when we all work together\nI Want to acknowledge the many partners who helped in recovering and transporting these IDs to our lab in Quantico this is dangerous and highly skilled specialized work\nThat requires great care and were incredibly grateful to all those who helped us in that effort in getting those devices to our lab\nFrom around the country and we can confirm\nThat Thirteen IDs for Santa various individuals across the country each device consisted of roughly six inches of PVC pipe\nA small clock a battery some wiring and what is known as energetic material which is essentially potential explosives and material they give off sheet an energy through a reaction to heat shock or friction\nThough we're still analyzing the devices in our laboratory these are not hoax devices\nI Want to focus for a moment on the amazing work a lot of folks at the FBI lab based on their initial analysis they uncovered relating fingerprints from one of the envelopes containing an ID that had been sent to congresswoman Maxine Waters\nWe have confirmed this fingerprint is that ... or say\nThere is also a possible DNA connection between samples collected from pieces of two different varieties mailed in separate envelopes and a sample previously collected from say Iraq in connection with an earlier arrest down in Florida\nThis is phenomenal work with the greatest pressure\nUnder an incredibly tight timeframe\nWe see unbelievable work like this on TV and in Hollywood but to see it up close in reality is something to behold and we are so proud of our team as a lab for their work and keeping people safe and helping us to find the individual responsible\nLate last night we also turns to our partners in the Florida department of law enforcement for confirmation of this DNA connection and we want to thank them in particular for they're very quick work\nI also want to thank the men and women of the FBI's counterterrorism division who remain on high alert\nEvery day to try to keep the American people safe from harm\nAnd who move quickly and efficiently into action every single time today's arrest doesn't mean we're all out of the woods there may be other packages in transit now and other packages on\nSo we need the help of everyone out there every citizen everyone in law enforcement everyone we've got\nTo help with this investigation in the days to come if you got any information please call us our tip line at one eight hundred call FBI or our email line tips dot FBI dot Gov\nNo piece of information is too small every tip could be the one that leads to something very important and of course if you see something suspicious suspicious activity please call your local authorities we need all hands on deck we need to stay vigilant\nFinally I Want to thank our partners too many to name from across the country because we cannot do this work alone everyone up here today understands that and we take that to heart every single day as we do the hard work together\nOf protecting three hundred and twenty five million Americans like to turn the podium over the commissioner O'Neill from the

frustrating\nFor example some providers say they offer fast Internet and voice but they mean they offer a slow Internet that can't keep up with your business\nAnd one other providers say they have low prices they really mean may add extra taxes and hidden fees to your bill every month plus other providers lock you went to a contract and nobody wants that\nIt's still painful but it's difficult because uh you have you have just over a week to go\nAnd we have a national poll it's up on our website or McLaughlin online dot com where the Republicans are within range of the Democrats where the Democrats on the generic folks have a forty six percent of the vote for the Republicans have forty four percent and you've got ten percent undecided and just like\nTwo years ago we always said there was a hidden vote for Trump because we knew we were bringing in millions of new voters and we knew those voters that were undecided didn't like Hillary Clinton they say they want to change and they didn't like her corruption well now the ones who are undecided our latest national poll forty nine to twenty seven they say the countries on the wrong track\nTheir opinion their job ratings for the Republican majority in Congress has only Thirteen percent approved forty seven disapprove and and now they say the economy's getting better forty percent twenty nine percent of but they really you know they're tilting\nAgainst us right now and if they come up against us to the one we would lose the house fifty two to forty eight and the last time that happened was in two thousand six during the Iraq War and the Democrats gain thirty one seat for the house if they gain thirty one seats we've lost a majority employers use a speaker\nAnd that's like a a Speaker Gingrich has got those odds and those are scary us\nBecause of policy takes over the house you know she's going to have open borders you know she's going to want to raise taxes you know she'll want to kill jobs she'll put back in regulations and guess what they're going to try to impeach president so\nYou've really got just over a week to try to stop policy and the Democrats from winning and the Republicans really need to have a laser focus on that and run a very very hard contrast campaign and the worst thing is right now in Ninety percent there's a story I think Ninety percent of the congressional districts that are competitive\nThe Democrats are raising the Republicans and it's not by little amounts it's by big amounts so you have to rush in a race where the Democrats are spending a other Republican two million to one million in in Virginia ten were Barbara concepts running for reelection people were saying all your polls were wrong because you have a point that had\nAll the Democrats last friday put in for a million dollars in the last two weeks versus are two million\nBetween the Republican or groups in the center of town I mean congresswoman concept so the Democrats are playing for keeps and the Republicans need to have that\nLooks like the Democrats have just seeded the Senate than in other words they're putting all their money into the house races just to get the one chamber absolutely so let's say that that that what you're saying is true if the Democrats it flows have become speaker and the Republicans hold on to the Senate and they picked up seats in the Senate so that would sort of be a split decision by it I guess any measure right\nIt's a split decision except that the Democrats will have a focused they will control the house think of the committees that are going to change [laughter] think of think of the intelligence committee and set of newness running it\nYou'll have Adam Schiff gets what's gonna happen with the with the with all these investigations et cetera guess what's going to happen with the Judiciary Committee and their their there'll be relentless investigations of President Trump\nThat he won't get anything done in the last two years and you know that talk about they'll go they'll\nGo check his taxes the link all this stuff and it'll drive economy down one of the things that that you know us pollsters we\nGet calls before the elections from hedge fund guys for major Wall Street guys what are you seeing in the in the election well you want to know why the market's been going down the last month because they're seen that the Democrats could take the house and they know what that means the economy the economy will stall out\nWhat do you think Doug shown to you in the same marry you said is getting very tight also\nI think John's analysis is exactly right I think the Democrats I actually wouldn't might even be a little bit more cautious I see between twenty five and thirty see I think that um\nAnd if they get twenty three seats that means they win the house that that is correct time could jak thing they are saying that Democrats could win by little as two seats\nI Am saying that I sit on your air or the other night it would be two to four I'm In the same range I think John's analysis is very very rare and I think he's right to say that the Democrats\nAre mobilized and focus on the um on the house to the exclusion of the Senate but the amount of money that's being spent on really the thirty races I think Sean butter on your website cannot be underestimated and you\nKnow mid term elections tend to be referenda on the president and the incumbent party and there's one little dirty secret it's hot so much Donald Trump that is at risk it's the Republicans in the house and Senate were much lower ratings than the president and it is that is the soft underbelly of the Republican Party\nAt one of the weaknesses as it relates to also to the Republican House is there's so many retirements what are their forty by a separate retirement\nWere breaking the rattler tape and a couple of major problems on the red ways to get a crash on the turnpike north found\nThe thing is right around the whether it be overpass just pass them for Seventeen purportedly in the right lane has tainted the lap of your coming in from cocoa\nYou want to avoid any sign westbound it shut down right before five twenty that's due to a vehicle fire you can exhibit a you can use five twenty off of Ninety five or he's colonial try to head west parental attention and phone traffic to do when the dream team I'm Jackie O'Brian it's been Ninety six point five ... Catholic advisory\nThe Democrats really dug understands it they they\nThey're very smart they really understand how to how to win races and how to take power\nAnd the Republicans need to wake up I mean those of us who are older I remembered\nDelivering a survey that Haley Barbour helped pay for Nineteen Ninety four and September that had we have the generic Republicans up seven and that was to house leadership and there was a soon to be Speaker Gingrich with Bob Michael I was presenting the numbers to him saying you're going to be the next speaker and\nWe just need to not compromise on Clinton care well Haley Barbour\nBorrowed ten million dollars to help when more seats and win that election the Republicans are raising record some say the orange she has out raised a has out raise the uh uh Democrats their National Committee tutor once the ... that money needs to find his way into the into\nThese top thirty races that you've outlined where the Democrats are outspending us virtually two to one and all those races this week and you've got to be able to put money into those races where there's digital LEDs a\nTV ads even nationally and saying stop below sea we've got to have an equal voice with the Democrats and uh uh ... they really they really are focused in on trying to take over the house and it's and it's their their shot at power\nWell fish out of power but remember you know those that have been saying the investigations into the deep state in I don't believe that's true because we have Senate committees that are just as capable of doing that as well and similarly if the Republicans were able to build their majority in the Senate any legislation that Nancy Pelosi and company want to pass\nThat is going to be against what the Republicans want in the Senate is never going to get through it'll die there and we'll have divided government but I think you're most right and the fact that it's going to be\nBasically two more years like we've had and that is endless you know ridiculous absurd obscene investigations show trials by Adam Schiff Maxine Waters Gerald Gerald Nadler and company and\nIn other words the progress will will slow down dramatically a there is also the hope that Republicans in the lame duck session could actually get in there and pass the funding for the border wall and maybe repeal and replace Obamacare in the meantime\nBuck I I think Sean that if that is John and I think both are suggesting that more likely than not the Democrats win the house what we are looking at with almost great certainty is ... ... good luck for two years\nI make a slightly different on a book on the way to work before I'm a Democrat I Know John is certainly knew Shaun I piss help we stop demonizing of doing what Maxine Waters that say\nPrompts responsible for ... for a set of uh uh sending that the ten or twelve bombs around or vice versa playing the Democrats can we focus on our national or it our borders and our future\nIf we had that I Know you've got to admit that we had the wall we didn't have to worry about the the migrant caravan worry\nBuilt building the wall and having a pathway to citizenship\nOkay so there was a little old Trump offered that deal to the Democrats have dreamed it\nIn a heartbeat why didn't I was ... because he was pulled off the table pretty quickly when some of the Democrats said yes but goodness gracious I Would do that no heartbeat I think it makes sense ah ... in Indiana is saying that and I think he's right\nOr Donnelly is now down by four to broaden the libertarian candidate thankfully is falling off a little bit in Indiana anyone votes for the libertarian in Indiana you're just basically a giving a have a vote to Joe Donnelly but Joe Donnelly is in trouble\nI think the biggest polling surprise that we saw in the last week was Joe Manchin down by two Patrick Morrisey was on this program yesterday that seems like a potentially winnable race or class or the onion\nA mansion where when that will win the radio I felt\nThe same thing or two but I Will tell you mentioned didn't vote for the tax cuts mentioned didn't vote for Gorsuch it appears that mansion had an election year can conversion by voting for Kavanaugh because he knows his career would be over and more importantly the economy was saved in West Virginia coal mining industry by Donald Trump not by mention\nAnd I think mentioned did have an election near a conversion and that's all of the good\nYear can hires you mean lets be a phony for for a couple of months\nIt's all of them beating Donald Trump's so this race November six it's not just about control the Congress it's really about\nThe what the Democrats are doing to get rid of Donald Trump what the establishment is doing to get rid of Donald Trump and the sixty three million Trump voters that are out there need to get motivated to vote on November such in fact\nThey should go to your website for Hannity dot com and see the

any Republican oh they'd blame everybody\nWe know what I mean I'm not going to do what the left does here\nBernie Sanders is not responsible for what one of his stupid supporters have to say but this
