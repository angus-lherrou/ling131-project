{"month": "10", "state": "FL", "station": "WDBO", "content": "And we hear this all the time but if we had a crystal ball we would know exactly how to position it chances of them doing that right and ... five million at risk and really really aggressive portfolio is to get to a hundred million is really really unrealistic right we don't know exactly what's going to happen moving forward\nAll of the Clinton is definitely a wealthy family because they struggle al ... that's not real life but realizing that you work with all types of people over the age of fifty here in Florida with their investments and you have some pretty wealthy clients so what are some types of planning strategies the ways of going about this that you use with clients who have\nA rather larger nest egg\nSure all what we're working on and and what we've been doing for years is active management of portfolios and people hear me talk about that but but and unless you actually see it as hard to understand exactly what that involves a most investors are dealing with portfolios that are very static and what that means is\nThey aren't actively manage somebody has sat down and and hopefully done a good job of putting together a diversified portfolio but there is no real tactical strategy for moving in and out of stocks are moving in and out of bonds from moving in and out of real estate based on certain indicators that are going on\nAnd we want to follow that because it helps us be smarter investors as easy to easiest example I can give is if markets are doing horribly in the stock market is crashing and I mean we could use two thousand eight as an example\nHow many of our listeners we're\nIn a situation where nobody gave them any advice on what to do about that and they had to decide for themselves whether to hang in there and just write it down and then ride it back up or did they feel kind of alone and having to go in and liquidate portfolios and maybe doing it the wrong time\nAnd then maybe potentially never even getting back in I mean we do need people who had that situation it's hard to do and you have to be careful and that sort of guidance is is really where we come in and not because you know we're a bunch of rocket scientist over here or anything but because we literally work with this every single day\nAnd it's our job to not only protect or ... or ... portfolios\nAnd then help our clients be successful and retirement\nSo you know strategies to helping clients with larger portfolios for smaller portfolios are the same right\nTraditionally individuals who had more money\nTens of millions of dollars would have access to actively managed portfolios and very very strategic per fully utilizing algorithms and that sort of a thing what we've done is we want to bring that to everyone and we want to make sure that individuals who maybe not the and maybe they don't have tens of millions of dollars can still benefit\nFrom actively managed portfolios\nAnd if we're able to do that and just how people not only be more comfortable in retirement help them participate in market gains help them not have to worry as much about market losses help them no you know they have an advisor that has a vested interest them doing well\nAnd putting all that together is really where we're at\nAnd that's what we're showing individuals when they come sit down and if you feel like we're providing value\nWhat happens risen as individuals decide to work with us if they don't feel like we're providing enough value the doors are those right and we don't have an expectation that everybody out there should should work with is right I mean everybody's got their own thing but\nYou know coming in and sit down and letting us helping with the analysis show you how to make your ... more efficient at least you're going to walk out of our office with a you know some ideas on how to make the ... more efficient um letting us put together that financial plan for you will show you how to implement that on your own iffy honestly want to do that I don't have any problem with that\nBut a lot of people don't want to so we'll implemented forum at any rate if you give us a call the next ten minutes we can do that for your complimentary\nFours they're seven seven zero one thousand that's four zero seven to seven zero one thousand it's all about active wealth management and you can find out more by having Mike and the team put together that comprehensive financial plan at the Fifteen hundred dollar value\nComplimentary if you'd call within the next ten minutes is it has to guarding your nest egg dot com and\nIt is officially fall one of my favorite times they've probably absolutely my favorite time of year now that I sang it out loud\nAnd it's all the time of year that most of us are making enrollment decisions about health care including Medicare might get a nicer people lifting here in Florida who may be going through this right now because talking to some friends of mine that their phone is ringing off the hook if they are in this demographic of age\nBringing us up because yes fall is a time when you are going to get bombarded because as what's referred to as open enrollment when it comes to these plans that cover expenses Medicare doesn't cover All right\nAnd so for a lot of people that's going to be a Medicare supplement or they're also Medicare Advantage plans I don't want to get too far into the\nWeeds on exactly the differences because there are a lot of differences between them and the different plans that they offer\nBut if your age sixty five are older and you're eligible for Medicare you were in the crosshairs you know for this marketing\nAnd I think what is going to build down to for individuals is making sure that they have the best plan that they can get right for the amount of money that they're spending\nChristian it you got to be careful of things here or there are representatives who\nWill come to you every single year and try to switch you from one plant to another\nThat's not a good thing is not even technically legal if it's not in your best interest but the reason they do that is the commissions that they get first year out are more than the commission as they get if you just stay a client sort of feel like you're in that position\nTo be careful and then also the marketing in general there are a lot of regulations around it but I hate that individuals have to talk to maybe you know three or four or five different sales people just to get the information that they need to try to make a good decision which is why\nYou know I tell them all management and throw a radio program we have individuals that work with all of the different Medicare Advantage and Medicare cellphone plans out there and in that way so for our our clients when the when they sit down and they have questions you know they don't have to go see five or ten people they can add on with us we can look at all the plans that are available\nNow whether they've had a change in their life or whether they just want to\nYou know maintain what they currently have we can do that for them of course and we can also do that for our listeners if you don't want to sit down and talk to again three or four or five different individuals or have to go to a whole bunch of different meanings find out what health care plan is right for you you can sit down with our Medicare specialist\nAnd they can walk you through all the options will be making an informed decision Christmas part of the overall financial planning process I mean yes we help people invest money and yes we want to help you get the highest rate of return you can get none of any fee\nBut at the same time if we're saving money on things like health care or\nWe're getting you better coverage for the same price that's a big benefit we have CPAs that we work with Christian that are employed by us and the point there is we don't want our clients to pay more taxes and they have to\n'em and that's part of the financial planning process right it's not just about the investments we want to help you save money in taxes we also have attorneys that we work with because the state planes are really really big part of any financial plan and\nWe have to understand our money works for us now but also eventually Christian as I say what's guaranteed death and taxes right you know eventually we're going to pass away so how do we make sure that our assets transition as as efficiently as possible to our beneficiaries we want to keep on call Sam right\nOut of our state we don't try to keep the our state out of our state and uh so stay plans are really really big deal so as we wrap up today's program we want to make sure we're providing\nHow to be efficient when it comes to investing great financial plan of successful retirement so give us a call the next ten minutes if you'd like to come sit down for that comprehensive

we've got some time here because our phone lines are kind of out of whack\nNot to mention my computer just decided to restart itself Larry so I'm without ... yeah\nThis is going to be a lot is probably going to be a very interesting program by the time we're done today\nBut you folks hang in there if you got a car question we'll let you know when it looks like we're up and running you know I was told last week and a little story and this could hit kind of close to home\nA chase our producer was was explaining his issues trying to buy a car now your mind you and he's a young guy you know hasn't really got any credit\nIs president car well it just really isn't worth spending any money on and it's got so many problems that would need more of a restoration and repair\nAnd as we all know repairing what you've already got or paying cash for a good use vehicle is usually your best bet if you can afford it in his case he found a a used vehicle\nAt a local dealer and the uh dealer wanted twelve thousand dollars for it it was a a used to Toyota a I guess a nice clean car he planned on putting four thousand dollars down in financing eight thousand dollars\nWell you know he's worried about his payment and stuff so well they told him said well we can get you a payment of about a hundred and sixty dollars a month\nFor Seventy two months\nAnd I remember this was a toss up work that would've been seven thousand eight hundred and forty dollars in interest on an eight thousand dollar loan [noise]\nBy the way that was that eight team percent interest\nNow I Know it's hard for you young folks with little or no credit but don't let these folks make you think they're doing you a favor sending out the door paying Eighteen percent interest on a car alone\nIf this is what you're hearing try another dealer or listen there's tons of lenders that you can probably go through you just have to do some shopping\nWith this being said before you decided to give up on any vehicle always have it checked first if you can make an investment in your president car and get a few more years out of it and that's usually your best option and of course no car payments\nAnd remember operate a vehicle down into three categories you got the mechanical you got interior and painting body I typically ... tell folks you know you want to of these the systems\nAre out of the three in the vehicles favor example if the paint in the body and the interior on vehicles in pretty good shape\nWho cares if you spend a little money on a mechanical aspect of it you know if you can get a few more good dependable years out of it that usually just makes a whole lot more sense I'm\nWell if you got questions like is your car worth keeping as it were spending any money on or any automotive information even estimates you can check us out at magic mechanic dot com or my free auto estimate dot com\nFolks we are having some phone you're doing great so far like Oh thank you very much a gene that you're you're carrying\nA show like you might not I mean I Wish there was something I could do to help although\nI Do have a a car story when you need to go to me for that one but just just wanted to get the L okay so you've got to cars from last\nNight last night I was on the side of eye for up in Sanford a pulled over on the side of the road with my with my friend Kevin so yeah I've got I've got that story on deck if if we need it\nOK yeah but just in case we do get some phone system up and running and that phone number will be eight for for two two zero zero nine six five\nNow you know there is a a a few things that um I get questions and a lot of emails during the week on\nAnd a lot of them are uh you know one of the things we get asked quite frequently is how often should you a change of battery and folks batteries are not like they used to be you know used to we be in a situation where you\nKnow you buy a new car while you just you drive it until the battery goes bad and you get a jumpstart the public's parking lot and you go ahead and you take it on home and her to the park place and you get you another battery and throw in there well\nThese things have kind of changed um batteries now days some of\nAnd actually have to be programmed to your vehicle before your vehicle will recognize the battery\nUm and and so what winds up happening is is if a battery is not check to find out the condition of the battery\nYou know on a periodic basis or if you just don't have a replacement date in mind like every three years or something along those lines what will happen is you'll you'll get a bad battery or a battery offshore it out on you\nAnd what will wind up happening is you'll be in a situation where you won't be able to jumpstart the car\nI mean it's literally that type of situation and you know even if you were to go and buy a new battery and put it in the vehicle chances are in the car and you want to start until the batteries are actually registered or with your computer system\nAnd if it's banned completely the away without any voltage chances are you may even have to have the cars computer system re flashed you know in order for the vehicle to have all of its functions back\nYou know so now days or even a battery which used to be one of the most basic a do it yourself replacement items has become extremely extremely high tech and I'll tell anybody that is going to replace their own battery it is extremely important\nThat you keep voltage supplied to the vehicle if you are going to venture into replacing your own battery\nA you know either a jump box to where you can keep a power supply to the battery cables\nOr either a a you know some sort of a battery tender to keep the vehicle alive with voltage while the battery is being replaced is extremely important or if you go to\nJust disconnecting a battery there is a real good outside chance\nAs soon as you get the battery replaced the second thing you're going to do is be calling a tow truck they either take it to a shop like magic mechanic or a dealer you have any last night is that just because you know his just these batteries nowadays\nWho would've ever thought that you know you would have to register a battery with your cars computer for hit to recognize that\nIt is absolutely just gone off the crazy deep in that's the reason I say as complex has these vehicles has become and especially with the battery systems that we are dealing with now days\nYou got to you got to have a replacement interval on the batteries as opposed to waiting until they actually a fail and leave you on the side of the road so you know we just want to make people aware that this is something that you are going to have to start dealing with what was your situation\nSo okay so I I don't want to go and get too much detail only because I haven't cleared or with my buddy Kevin that you know he wants some of the shared out on the radio but there are few things that I'm sure well we already know Kevin was involved [laughter] the cat I bet I know so so I'm so last night when Kevin was leaving work\nHe had to uh jumped his car and it worked\nAnd he drove home and uh when I when I saw in there he he said you know I it wasn't running so well\nUh well when I was driving back here you know the it wasn't accelerating as much in ... it seemed off to him and then he he he went out last night to try and make it to Jacksonville and the cars started giving out on him so he ended up pulling over on the side of a I for up there in Sanford\nUh and and I I went up there and\nAnd we waited for the tow truck right on the side of my four which is is is an absolutely scary experience you know there's there's nobody wants to be stranded on the side of a war that is that is that is the worst [laughter] you just you know now days with this I for project going on yeah\nIf you all had a place just to pull off the side of the road consider yourself lucky but you don't have any lane\nYou know an emergency lane on all of our for now that's right and he said when he knew the car was starting to give out each he made sure to\nGet to one of those areas and try to avoid the construction lanes so it was a little bit more safer for him but he was still a dangerous situation still um but yeah and they ended up getting getting into it and I think it's more than just the battery to a break\nWe're up to I think is the three big thing oh yeah yeah yeah so we'll we'll toss it at three big things you need to know a day of all over they're kicking the tires on our new

problem\nThat that day by\nJumping and adding more voltage to your system is curing whatever the problem is the only thing is going to do that is either of your ... either you got to lose connection on the battery early the battery itself is most likely either not being charged correctly from the Alternator\nOr either there's a problem with the battery I mean it is what it is I mean there's a lot\nAnd I agree with you bought my problem is that I've taken it to a guy I bought the battery so I mean he was a good guys you know they sell a lot of batteries which fires fan but I was telling me

it does it get it makes it I mean if you're holding moisture your problem where do you why do you get the mold moisture right you know how many people actually drive the shower to tell about when they get out of it\nProbably zero to not but I Do we don't we don't we have squeegee is you know we squeegee everything down and get the water on the floor so doesn't mode and bill do in the walls and by the way it seriously helps\nIt's really no different than taking care of your swimming pool you got to do the you've got to have the right procedures are right things to do ... are good for Larry Perry just had a pool resurfaced he's in the store that procedure\nTry to get him all the way through it and one of the good things that are telling them to do was make sure you bring your pool good ... good criminal ... new finished you want to get that thing is sparkly clean as you can but he asked me a question earlier he's starting to bring the chemistry back up on line right and he says my poems cloudy\nAnd he's got suspended solids in his pool that's what he's got so filtration filtration filtration\nWill take that suspended solid out so when this all clears up and now he's he's he's and and and I do there's a lot where I have people I've actually I'm doing a pool rotted Cheryl thank you down in palm bay or we're getting ready to finish their pull up got the decks all down screeners measured what was going to going next\nWe hope he finishes pull up in a couple of weeks so one of the things that um\nThat we need to make sure we talk about is ... is is keeping the poor get where it needs to be filtration filtration filtration water quality he said he puts a mom I'm phosphate remover that an automatic a cloud you pull up but on a new poll finish\nFollow the procedures it'll clean up so a run the show are asking the other day um about tiger feeling a pool while in Orlando\nIs nothing wrong with tanker filling a pool if you are well water tankers well us big you know the tanker trucks that bring gas or the gas station does hold about seven thousand gallons of fuel\nUsually about forty five hundred gallons of unleaded and make it a thousand or so gallons of super premium that's what those trucks usually hold\n'em about seven thousand gallons a name and they become water tanker trucks to you might see a construction site where you see the big yellow one that says a ring how ring power that would be a water tanker trucks OK\nOkay so say you have residual fool sometimes if you have really really bad water now filling a pool up on well water K got you got different types of well water here in central Florida that people that live across we have a well down two hundred and eighty feet which is about a hundred\nIt's all about two hundred and six feet below sea level because I'm at Seventy four feet right across from me so they get our water hard hard hard on everything his rusted rusted rush to show some wells have sulfur some wells are pretty doggone clean I'm right at about eighty feet underground for my well I'm In the aquifer\nI'm six feet below sea level I'm Down in the good limestone semi water don't smell don't steak and it tastes pretty good\nIt does have a filtration system on it I have an oxygen system treats my water\nSo auction is an amazing oxidized and believe it away and it really does a great job disinfectant chatter question was do I feel my pool with a checkered up here in Orlando seven thousand gallons of water costs seven hundred dollars\nI see that look on your face little Spencer yeah\nTo type a truck so I don't know it's all based on how bad the water is you know they uh if you have low water pressure year I don't think your wells going to run out of water to day by the way I think we've had enough rain last couple of years to start soaking back into the ... for we have a couple lakes here in Atlanta that go right down to aquifer\nJust lick menial to go down there I don't know if like

overflowed they go down in the aquifer when it gets too so those bodies of water stay pretty consistent year round so if you have a lake that goes up and down it's not controlled like\nI tell you many older probably doesn't do because that's a huge today and it was the water levels are high today\nYeah it's huge it's a huge body of water you know I mean you've lived all all everything out on the west side huge lots of bodies of water big big big volume so\nAnyhow I don't know what the quality of their water is they do have low water pressure so maybe it's consideration but what I don't know
