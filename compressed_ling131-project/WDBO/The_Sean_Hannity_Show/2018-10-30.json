turns worse for breaking\nThat result number one would be the best and that is that the Republicans picked up three to four Senate seats which would be very powerful\nMaybe more I mean anything can happen and that Republicans even if it's by one vote hang onto the house that would be a win win win win scenario that would be a knockout blow so you\nCan shock the world but it all depends on you or you know this is a Democratic Republic it counts on we the people we've identified on Hannity dot com especially in the house the most important races there that are going to tip the balance of power in the house we've been putting on some some key\nA congressional candidates and very important districts it's interesting all up there are four hundred and thirty five so they're all important\nEvery ... every one of you listening to my vote I don't care if you think your congressman and safe or not you better get out and vote because otherwise\nIs if you don't vote that's pretty much a vote for Nancy Pelosi and if you have a Senate race going on in your state that's vote for Chuck Schumer\nThe second potential outcome is a split decision\nSplit decision would be Republicans hang on to the Senate gate a couple of seats and Nancy Pelosi them become speaker and Maxine Waters is a chairwoman Adam Schiff has a chairwoman and let's say Gerald ... chairman\nAnd allies are coming so chairman and it's endless investigations\nAnd one of the most unbelievable things that we're watching unfold here\nIs what we have this desperation factor of the Democrats I mean even when I think anyone I warn you of what they do every two and four years racist or sexist besides you know just seeing a phobic Islamic phobic homophobic you know dirty air dirty water kill children pro granny over the cliff\nJust when you think it can't get worse it gets worse\nAnd the echo chamber if you've ever doubted ever doubted who the media in this country of pulling for just just watch any so called cable news channel besides Fox\nFor thirty seconds because it's every second every minute of every day hates Trump destroy Trump help the Democrats and if it means falsely accusing the president of being responsible\nFor the synagogue shooting over the weekend and not even tell the people there viewers that well the shooter this got mad man power hated Trump because of Trump being so allied and good partners with our closest ally Israel\nAnd the same people you know St Trump cause this Trump's responsible for this you know it's a it's it's a sense of madness but it also does show\nA desperation that has now kicked in for the Democratic party they are desperate\nYou know one thing I I think I'm going to talk about pose a little bit in the course of the program today but I'm also on the other hand seems like I'm Talking to both sides of my face I'm really not\nI'm I'm gonna tell you to just ignore the polls at this point doesn't matter you still have a job to do and if you want to keep the progress that we've had you want to prevent hearing the night of one week from tonight\nAnd one day after one week from tomorrow when we talk about the results if you don't want to hear the words speaker elect Pelosi Senate majority elects sure then you're going to have to do something about it the worst case scenario is they can win at all and the only way that's going to happen is if you stay home\nThat the reason I Will tell you not to pay attention to the polls is because they get it wrong so often\nJust two years ago the exit polls showed that Trump lost Florida he won it last North Carolina he won it that he had lost Ohio he won Ohio that he lost Pennsylvania He won Pennsylvania that he lost Michigan Wisconsin anyone both of them\nAnd the media nobody there weren't candy because they read these results as I was on the air at five Fifteen I had it before everybody else\nI remember my first break at at the about twenty after the hour I called then candidate Donald Trump and I said somebody's going to come in in about a minute with bad news and tell you that you lost everything don't believe it\nI said I don't believe these polls I said there's no way these polls are accurate and he goes why do you believe that and I told them the story about two thousand and four\nWhere the media again the polls came back and George Bush and Dick Cheney and lost Florida Ohio Pennsylvania and it was over\nAnd Dick Cheney called the radio program this radio program at you know on election day two thousand and four or five thirty five and reminded people they still have time to vote because he read the same information that I just read that John Kerry was going to be the next president\nYou know you go back and you know other polls where they've been wrong twenty fourteen you know let's go back with the election one week away it's coming down to the wire conventional wisdom is Republicans will pick up a few seats in the house and the Senate but lose the house by a painfully slim orange it\nOne of the reasons is look if you look real clear politics that's based on polling polling is not totally inaccurate information there's some things you can glean from polling that are\nAnecdotal maybe the way to put it helpful in other ways right now real clear politics has the Democrats are two hundred and five seats locked solid\nOr leaning Democrat it has leaning Republican lock solid Republican two hundred that's a five seat difference but because Republicans have the majority\nOf ah right now that means that they have more seats they have to defend is like thirty seats that they called toss ups that could swing one way or the other we've identified these we put them up on Hannity dot com you can check it out for yourself\nAnd the only thing that can make a difference as if you want the progress of the last two years to continue\nYou get to decide how you're going to feel a week from tonight I mean when you watch go back to the media and twenty sixteen this five Fifteen they were guinea\nWell it's pretty clear Hillary I think there's going to bring on our presidents Frank Luntz was reporting from Times Square at six Fifteen and I'm watching him it's over Trump lost it ain't happening turned out not to be true turned out the polls wrong I'm not criticizing Frank he was reading in the polling data\nI read the same data\nSo if you don't have the sense of urgency I don't know what I can say or do to give it to you but the media is all in on helping the Democrats get back the house and the Senate they're doing everything within their power to make that happen because they've hated Trump since the day walk down the escalator with millennia\nI think it's worth noting now that conventional wisdom does not exactly have a stellar track record this is where I urge you to be cautious about the polls and don't let the polls influence your motivation here\nBut it's not only were they wrong and twenty sixteen they also wrong in two thousand and four they were way off in the last midterm election member Republicans were even saying oh because Ted Cruz's fellow buster oh we're going to get cleaned out in the Senate that didn't happen\nOne year before the twenty fourteen midterms of media insisted the GOP hopes to recapture the Senate were dead on arrival because in October Ted Cruz had filibustered Obamacare and shut the government down for sixteen days good for him makes me like Ted Cruz more\nThe expert such a short us a hundred percent certainty in twenty four team Republicans are going to pay huge price when the twenty four team midterms rolled around Thirteen months later the geo ... not only won back the Senate they did it with a nine the Senate landslide\nHow remembers the night went on in twenty sixteen media was kinda Getty but then that getting this began to\nGive away to a little bit of a little bit of nervousness I think we got it still but ah yeah to get a little tighter than we thought isn't it\nAnd then I turned into what all out melt down depression collectively by the media and they couldn't believe it because you we the people shocked the world\nAll that but an old for it's happened and fourteen and it happened in sixteen no reason it can happen in a tea\nYou shouldn't do it for no other reason because you want to keep America on the great growth growth trajectory we're on and maybe for another reason to watch these idiots in the mainstream media these sanctimonious\nA self righteous they're not news people advocates that they are the extension of the Democratic party they're going to lose it\nIf the house remains in Republican hands on Republicans pick up a number of Senate seats they will lose it just like they did in twenty six the this is a this is all white latch CNN was reporting that night\nAnyway the so called experts saw the Republican landslide coming that\nNone of them thought in twenty fourteen no very few of us saw that we could wait I'll give you a deep let's go to twenty fourteen final Wall Street journal NBC News survey before balloting and twenty fourteen\nForty six percent of likely voters favor Congress led by Republicans forty five prefer democratic control kind of similar where they are now the GOP claim they similar one point advantage lead in ten states where Senate races where the most competitive with a balance of power in the chamber would be decided\nThose results suggested narrower advantage for Republicans in in the latest mid term and you know still they claimed oh Republicans pick up nine seats that's a hell of a field goal\nIt'd be vote for reticent McCaskill Nelson\nJoe Donnelly cinema you vote for any of the pastor you're voting for Schumer\n[noise] [noise]\nThis is news Ninety six point five in the window

proud to sneak food to dream defender activists during a thirty days sleeping protested the Florida State Capitol\nReferring to the twenty Thirteen month long anti gun protest or after the Trayvon Martin George Zimmerman case and I hope you keep at it and he supported them but you're saying that there are radical groups\nWithout question I mean they they are in the law enforcement there in the free enterprise there and the military um they're anti Israel uh I don't know I mean like that may be a group you would want to be aligned with if you are running for the mayor of the Gaza Strip but not for governor of Florida\nWow well let's go over a little bit of his his background and the proposals that he's making but he's I think it's fairly extreme a number one he was endorsed\nBy Bernie Sanders that speaks volumes to me there's a lot of outside money uh reports that he's getting money from the left wing billionaires like George Soros the George Soros really spend one point two million in this race in Florida to help him\nOh yeah I probably much more than that at this point yeah\nHe says that he supports Medicare for all I Am a champion of treating health care and as a right not a privilege so he wants what nationalized healthcare\n... and the bill he supports what abolish Medicare and Medicare Advantage for seniors enforce them on a single payer\nGovernment plan it would eliminate everybody's employer based coverage and force them on a government single plan so it really up in the arrangements have millions and millions of ... that he thinks it's appropriate for government to take away health benefits that people were burned and to force them to be on the single payer plan I think that'd be a disaster\nHe wants to raise the corporate tax rate forty percent of forty percent increase ... what's that going to\nThe impact that's going to have on Florida businesses and Florida workers if the businesses pack up and leave\nWe will lose jobs we will lose business says and we're also I mean you know shock because everyone who works in high tech they\nThey're always thinking about relocating to Florida and we have a historic opportunity to really capitalize on that went on governor buddy Andrew has his way they'll stop the flow of investment coming in to Florida because people are going to invest if you have the highest tax rate in the south east and actually he would raise it to be higher than New York\nYeah and he also was the first democratic candidate Nash nationwide I read to call for the abolish men a vice is that true\nHe supports abolishing ice and impeaching President Trump\nAnd he wants to eliminate Florida's Stand your ground law\nYes he wants to impose on law abiding Floridians a duty to retreat so somebody for criminal is attacking you you have to run and try to hide rather than fight back\nYou also support legalizing drugs in Florida like marijuana and others yes he does\nWell I mean you're just looks like he is Bernie Sanders on steroids down there I mean I've got to believe with this controversial background like it looks like a almost a phenomenon that the media's just pushing for him and pushing for him\nAnd his record I only spent about a half hour and I was able to dig it up it wasn't that hard to find and it seems like most of the media is ignoring who he really is\nOh without question I mean the day he won the primary particularly the national media you know they've tried to elevate him and tried to make him into this great candidate a they do not like the scrutinize his record uh the fact that those documents that release after he lied and the debate last Sunday\nOr the media kind of had to cover that but at the end of the day\nHe has been given very kid glove treatment so really falls to me and other folks to go out and make the case and let people know and the good news is just run Floridians figure that out or they definitely don't want him as their governor and so we're going to keep making the case for the next week\nI'm worried about our friends not only the recovery uh thoughts and prayers go to all our friends in the panhandle um but but the panhandle to so many people whose lives have been up ended and disrupted and some people losing pretty much everything they own\nAnd they now moved out the panhandle happens to be one of the most conservative areas of

Know a lot of them do want to vote and so they'll have the opportunity to do it\nYeah um I Know the devastation once again to the people there how long do you look at rebuilding not part of Florida
