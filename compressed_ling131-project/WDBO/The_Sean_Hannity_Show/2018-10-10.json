Andrew Gillum his told everyone just to stay home there is no reason to be outside and as you can see but\nThese roads which is normally this time of day or in Tallahassee would be bustling this downtown uh this is a business district so they would normally be very busy right now everyone staying home heating those warnings because the worst is still yet to come here in Tallahassee John\nAll right Ryan you and your team be careful in Tallahassee a as this storm heads your way thanks so much for being with us again\nAs the wind has died down a little bit here I can look around to see some of the damage here and there are a lot of things that are falling over a lot of trees a lot of leaves a lot of debris here ought to go to Brian Todd also in Panama City beach a different part here Brian I assume you're getting a chance to look around as well [noise]\nGetting a chance to look around your job but it's still really powerful just a you know a few couple of hundred yards from the beach here these palm trees being violently shaking here but look at this this is a real danger here the power lines here\nCould be about to stop these power lines or in some danger right here we've got an oath of course keep an eye out we're getting another heavy burst of wind right here [noise]\nYou can see how violent the windows I go down the street and the way these trees here are shaking and just swing and the wind preserve snapped in half that we've seen\nPower lines have gone down transformers up blown all over the place here and we're not even talking about storm surge because storm surge could still be a factor here for in a low lying area we're right off the beach on Panama City beach\nAnd this could get up to maybe they say maybe eleven to Thirteen feet of storm surge we'll see if it gets to that point here in Panama City beach they are please with their level of elevation but again we've been talking about all day this area has not seen a storm like this in over a hundred years I've recorded memory so\nWhat what the storm surge is going to do here is unclear already starting to kind of get violent\nBeach area there those waves were really violently cracking earlier on the water levels started Rising John ah we've got some some of these trees here just step that had this house has been in some danger for a while now there's a large tree that they're that just stopped and\nWhat's interesting is the ah\nThe share of walls and county Michael Atkins and tweeted a little bit ago he said you just had a pure frustration he said some people are we'd have people here or not exercising good sense you have a constitutional right to be an idiot but you do not have a constitutional right to put others in danger of it was pure frustration from the sheriff\nLook at it it's literally a category for making landfall and maybe even a cat five borderline cat five hurricane hundred and Seventy five mile gusty winds at the time and uh I got to tell you this was as bad as it could have possibly worked out as it comes in the governor of Florida\nIs telling everybody that we everything is pre positioned food water medicine or supplies cots blankets and pillows baby formula everything that everybody's going to need and literally some of the wind gusting now in in and around the whole pan handle is very very dangerous\nIf you didn't get out if you didn't listen and you're hearing my voice make sure your bunker down these are wins that cannot buildings down\nSo it is a worst case scenario of boy with our friends in the pan handle you know that's Pensacola destined Panama City beach uh and and all throughout the panhandle hurricane Michael now with these are amazing category force\nA wins cat for making landfall as we speak National Weather services but by things stay inside and survive\nA when it passes help will be on his way the president the governor Rick Scott\nYou know everything's been pre position is not much anybody can do right now so hunkered down getting the safest place you can and uh hopefully ride this thing out and ah and survive this I Know a lot of you are going to be experiencing a lot of property damage loss when you get back to your homes those of you that heated the warnings to evacuate\nThe rainfall situation itself is gonna be a lot of flooding that it's going to be occurring now and through tomorrow and rising waters and tied that cetera which is all part of it um this hurricane also is taking on an enormous amount of power it came in most hurricanes usually slow down before they actually hit land\nThis one came in full force or as was predicted by our own job of started he was going to join us at the bottom of this half hour\nAnd actually is going to sustain a lot of its power it's going to make a\nA north easterly turn\nA it'll be a little south of Atlanta Atlanta is not going to get the brunt of this at some point tomorrow but Gus the is going to be hit really really hard so draw a line from Panama City Beach Florida straight to Augusta, Georgia and if you're in any of those surrounding areas you are right in line of of the path of hurricane Michael\nAnd it's moving at a pretty rapid pace which means that will be there sometime tomorrow and then make its way up the coast through Columbia South Carolina into North Carolina\nAnd then we expect at that point is probably going to go out to see a little bit but the bottom line is a this is a cat for borderline ... five hurricane and the strongest one ever to reach the Gulf Coast area there in the panhandle area and on top of it we got catastrophic storm surge\nThese destructive wind gust hundred and Seventy five miles per hour and even higher um over a million power outages we expect to the current\nHost but also inland after now this is hitting as we speak\nFlooding is going to be a significant threat\nInto the Carolinas so everybody if if you're in\nIf you're in Georgia if you're in South Carolina of you're in North Carolina\nYou know you can make your preparation now and I would listen to local authorities if they're telling you to get out get out and uh you can come back take whatever important pictures valuables you need to take with your pack the car move inland and protect your family and\nUh you know thoughts and prayers with everybody in harm's way today this was this is the real deal this is you know Florida governor scared to death for those who said\nThis is why you know at times they make predictions they tell you they're leaving it it's not as bad as they say it's going to be this was one of those times it's as bad or worse than they predict that it's going to be\nThe worst the worst hurricane ever for the panhandle in Florida that's how dangerous this as as it goes it when we're talking about in Augusta, Georgia you're gonna be having eighty to a hundred mile an hour winds tomorrow same thing as you head up to Columbia South Carolina into the\nInto North Carolina so a lot of bad stuff happening our thoughts and prayers with everybody and just no help will be on the way we live in the greatest country on earth with the most generous people on earth and whatever our friends and Florida Georgia\nThe Carolinas they're going to need I Know that people will be there to to help in any way imaginable a we have some breaking news on the deep state as it relates to Rod Rosenstein oh this is really outrageous\nRod Rosenstein I'll think of everything that he was involved and think of how conflicted he has been as it relates to all things deep state that we have been telling you about now for a year and a half he is the person\nIn May of twenty Seventeen recommending the firing of Jim told me he is the guy that appointed special counsel Robert Mueller he is the guy that signed the third ... knew all the fourth ... application to spy on the Trump campaign associate Carter Page\nUh the bulk of the information in the ... of warrants as we all know now or the Hillary Clinton bought and paid for phony Russia dossier that even its author Christopher Steele doesn't stand by and of course that was funneled money it was made to look like a legal expense when in fact it was anything but a legally expense\nNow he was now are supposed to testify but those three people now Lisa Page Andrew McCabe the former\nDeputy FBI Director and James Baker again we just learned this you know this week\nJames Baker now the third person are all saying that Rod Rosenstein talked at length about surreptitiously going into the oval office taping the president of the United states by the way that would be without a warrant and then hoping he can get some information something from the president\nThat could then ignite or ... or start the process of invoking the twenty Fifth Amendment to remove the president from office\nHe's denying it said he was being sarcastic said it was he was joking about it but the testimony of Lisa Page Andrew McCabe and James Baker all contradict what Rod Rosenstein is now saying\nWell Rod Rosenstein was scheduled to testify tomorrow to the house Judiciary Committee but unfortunately this hour there at an impasse and the impasse is over the terms of the testimony\nBut those lawmakers are calling for what is the standard congressional task force interview and insisting that Rod Rosenstein give a transcribed interview and that the interview be under oath\nHe's refusing to do so and those close to Rosenstein say they prefer a meeting and I'm sure they do or a briefing with the house Judiciary Committee chairman and other lawmakers they don't want any paper trail they don't want to be under oath at all\nNow the house Judiciary Committee aides said on Wednesday they left the door open for a possible resolution there should be no resolution the resolution is to subpoena Rod Rosenstein and have him testify under oath did he or did he not\nAs Lisa Page as McKay Andrew McCabe is James Baker all saying did he did he not talk about wearing a wire against the president and the hope of getting something he says to help and both the twenty Fifth Amendment\nEither he did it or he didn't do it and then it we can also talked about why he signed the the fourth and final buys a warrant application as it relates to Carter Page why why did he sign off on a\nDocument himself talked about what with regards to Pfizer warrants you know that it was an affidavit in career law enforcement swears to the validity the truthfulness\nAnd if they're wrong there's consequences what we all know the bulk of the size of applications including the last one\nAnd there's one that shouldn't have been signed by that point they knew Hillary paid for it they know the DNC paid for it they knew it was full of uncorroborated on verified information when I was nine months in two surveilling Carter Page by then you think they would have figured out that the dot CA was phony and made up and even its own author\nOr couldn't prove any of its contents and when questioned in in in Iraq a tour in Great Britain said I don't know if any of this is true it's just raw intelligence and people just say and things like to hookers urinating in a bad in front of Donald Trump or in rock Moscow and the Ritz Carlton\nWell nobody ever verified that or corroborated that and it is if you're going to get an affidavit it as a law especially advise application Pfizer warrant\nAnd protocol that you verify the contents and the information here presenting to a court\nAnd you don't purposely withhold information pertinent information like the fact that Hillary Clinton bought and paid for that pony ... that you didn't take the time to verify or corroborate but there's obviously they all have to Donald Trump because remember struck was the one that said well first they get to smell the Trump voters in a Walmart but also said that Hillary should win them\nA hundred million is zero and then you can add to that the insurance policy comment that he made and what you really have here is I think now the validation or the cooperation of what the insurance policy was insurance policy is that your people conspiring not only remember Lisa Page testified\nAs we head into may nine months into the investigation into so called Trump Russia collusion by the very same people that gave Hillary Clinton a pass on the biggest obstruction of justice case in history\nThen they go into the Trump Russia so called investigation\nLisa Page confirms that they had no information Peters trucks text confirmed that there is no there there but anyway then they started ... media elite strategy all coming from the same source which is Hillary's bought and paid for dot CA\nThey get their willing accomplices in the media to spread their lives and propaganda from the CIA and it creates an atmosphere where an impression is being created that world there really is something going on here\nAnd then it's used by the very same people the phony information that they spread to whip up hysteria so that they can go forward after the firing of called me on the ninth of may in twenty Seventeen\nThen they appoint rod Rod Rosenstein goes out in a points his buddy Robert Mueller\nIn other words make it worse and on top of all of that eliminating ice and open borders says a lot at stake\nRight when we come back a

grenade right onto the field usually some kind of a you go through the list every night or on your Fox show you a racist massage and just you know the the phobic sober folks kind of stuff these identity politics when he's the Republicans would scatter\nWell they tried a new one with Kavanaugh they tried to really disgusting one this rapist line which is one of the most important things I've ever seen in politics\nAnd for the first time showing it a long time\nWe had a president the White House who said we're not going to back down a cabinet we're not going to let you back then we're going to back you up and we won one\nAnd that when I Believe is really just and this is not a scientific sample I don't want to oversell it\nBut based on me just driving around in my town which is a fifty fifty Republican Democrat county weren't County Florida Republicans could not be more ecstatic that we finally have a warrior in a fight or in the White House who is not going to leave the battlefield when that identity politics or disgusting label or comes in from the Democratic party and I think it's really\nA spiced up the Republican base I think we may have a we may have a a a decent the election day well\nI'm not sure I Can't read the tea leaves um I think it all comes down in these midterm elections always comes down to turn out and people are motivated the Rasmussen poll says uh than it would happen them and looking at the numbers that Republicans are more mad about the cabinet controversy than Democrats\nAre in a more determined to vote in the upcoming elections this is a dramatic twenty five points shift in just the last six weeks Greg Garrett so that would give hope to me and hopefully the American people that\nSomehow the Republicans can bucked the trend in and maintain power in the house and maybe pick up some Senate seats which I think are a distinct possibility\nWell I think you're right the only question is with twenty seven days remaining or does this trend that Republicans are motivated and energized devote\nHave legs will it last over the course of the next four weeks\nI'm you know we just don't know that but you're right the polling data does show that and I you know I think that there is a general anger among both men and women across America that this was a process\nOf the confirmation hearing that was a massive amount of fairness and the presumption of innocence and due process and that abduction some corroborating evidence from a thirty six year old claim\nYou really can't ruin somebody's career and their lives and you know the reputation or ... that they built up the good will and their families reputation sure I mean I Do think that there is a feeling across America that a lot of issues on fear now\nThere are liberals and the media which is redundant uh who are show rabbit that they don't care about furnace today just care about their own political agenda however misplaced in wrong it may be\nAnd so you're never going to change their minds there is no reasoning with on reasonable people so we'll just have to wait and see it's up to the Republican Party I think and and the candidates and indeed President Trump to maintain the momentum going forward over the next twenty seven days\nLook the hell out of great article today about what their agenda is and they the Democrats have big plans none of which will help the country\nOr they want to shore up Obamacare which has been nothing short of a disaster for the American people\nThey want more Dodd Frank financial rules to protect quote dreamers and the
