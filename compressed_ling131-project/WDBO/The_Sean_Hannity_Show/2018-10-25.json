east founded shut down right now at four thirty six an update but that Torrance and the Trump presenter\nComing up for you in a moment first as you heard here moments ago the FBI trying to determine who send ten pipe bombs to high profile people who are Democrats or critics of President Trump\nThe White House says don't blame the president White House press\nSecretary Sarah Sanders says the idea that this is at the hands of the president is absolutely ridiculous\nFuck we don't know who did that we don't know what their motive was burned but it's a very obvious thread and maybe it's meant as a ... but there's an obvious threat the Obamas the Clintons John Brennan's CNN um George Soros these are people and organizations that President Trump continually attack will demonize is\nCannot be civil with a political party that wants to try to stand for what you care about the only thing that the Republican whom to recognize and respect strength\nAnd it's an time a deep divisions\nAnd we have to do everything we can to bring our country together\nIt was not me stumped streaming\nI was so that they are conservative city of course\nAt the end of the day we may have political differences but this is one country we're all Americans ... out of many one and keeping the faith and the dialogue civil\nLaw is very very important and for elective leaders\nIn many ways set the tone\nSpecially important\nAre joining us now a a real New Yorker in his own right a former I'm white pd police commissioner a Bernie Carrick is with us a call commissioner a commission thank you for being with us Dr Sebastian Gorka is when I was struck by the way his new book is out why we fight\nA defeating America's enemies with no apologies thank you both for being here you know Bernie ... you know I listen to Hillary yesterday\nCompared to what you said a week ago I listen to you know Andrew Cuomo worse governor of New York history say conservative said they're not New Yorkers they don't belong here I'd every other governor in the country inviting me to move there which would be the smartest thing I could do because I wouldn't pay as much in taxes\nAnd and now yes they said no e pluribus owned them and I'm like you're so full of crap\nThey listen to what I saw yesterday you know them trying to put the blame on the president than making these\nChoices are as you know showing last night I walked off the CNN uh they they stuck bright in the middle of a broad cash they said that he was going to talk about the device that was ... which I thought it was a good idea the general public some insight as to profiling\nPackaging whatever the case may be a and then he got on for it had been a blast of the president I just think it's bizarre I'd say ... way over the top I said\nThey're going to get what happened in Bernie you are sitting on a set of CNN explaining and detailed and you left and they send cameras following him for ten minutes\nI ... what happened I was on the ... we were already introduced to do a segment on on the devices and the investigation and then they interrupted and said that was going to speak about the specific device being sent the sets of CNN and his name um but then he got on\nAnd he went on this ten minute tirade against the president you know I didn't have any objection they had been on I thought this was a guy that has credibility in the agency that could talk about profiling could talk about targeting could talk about packaging could talk about what to look for it give the general public some real insight as well but\nRenting is referred to the president as a traitor and Britain is up to his eyeballs and all the corruption involved in the deep state\nThat he went on a tirade against the president so I took the ear piece off I took the bike off and I walked off and the producers chase me down the block trying to get me to come back to ...\nBut you know what a doctor's enough already we listen this is a time you need to unify the country like Giuliani and I did in the aftermath of September eleventh this\nIs not a time for division and CNN and granted we're at the max dividing uh the the ... that was watching the show\nThere is no conservative out their Sebastian Gorka ... nobody ever\nIt's not being conservatives that have been you know saying things I Dream an awful lot of blowing up the White House um it's been Hollywood wants to punch the president in the face and showing separate heads of the president\nAnd those that talked about a killing the president et cetera um that's been the rhetoric of the left the media's been virtually silent it's ... it's Republicans and conservatives and\nYou know secretary Nielsen Pam Bondi and Sarah Sanders now Henry Kissinger Kevin McCarthy's office a Boulder is thrown through it\nUm and Ted Cruz and his wife and Mitch McConnell and his wife ... you know we've been saying that we better be really careful here I've been saying for weeks now going back to the Capitol hearing so I was saying we better clear the halls of Congress somebody's going to get hurt somebody's going to get killed and lo and behold you know the rhetoric gets ratcheted up and\nThen those people that were silent when it's a Republican now or oh this is outrageous we can't have those kind of rhetoric this is this is horrible he can't say fake news they aren't fake news\nThough they are and we need to keep using that phrase and I'd also like to congratulate the commission looked at doing what he did yesterday that was a capital moment what'd you stood up the truth I I just like one person on the list of who it is CNN anybody tell me which Republican which member abide a media\nOr the political leadership made political profit\nFrom a Bernie saw this woman ... which Republican member of the the ... the old media profit to personally profited from his side of the rice it off the white powder was mailed to the Trump family members of the cabinet off the individuals where\nThat happened three weeks ago President Trump FBI Director re a defense secretary Mattis and and the CIA director hat all all had rice and mailed to them by\nThe way I've had white powder mailed to me a\n... over the years I mean it's a horrible thing that anybody has to go through we all want to catch him several responsible here are but whoever it is is not somebody that would be that we would know as a quote conservative and it's just some nut job or some lunatic on what it doesn't matter what their politics are\nWhy why is it OK why is it okay for CNN to Ron tyrants today blaming\nDonald Trump for not taking responsibility for these tempted letter bombs why is that okay when the ... republic your profit from congressmen actually getting shot at a baseball field very close to where I Am spending about by left wing activist this is this is the double standards\nThat the average American see through and this is why we're going to vote down to get Republicans on November to six because they
