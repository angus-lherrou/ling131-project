riots over the weekend in New York City and in Portland and it's getting ugly\nAnd I don't think it should surprise anybody in light of the rhetoric that we've been hearing about getting people's faces and create a crowd and when you create a crowd followed them into department stores and restaurants and\nGas stations what do you think it's going to happen when those types of things are set\nAnd I looked at the end of the day people responsible for their own behavior but when you're when you see this well they'll look back here and Rand Paul's right and I'm right somebody's going to get severely hurt or killed and all of this\nAnd we'll get a look at the signs and symptoms were all there and we'll think about Pam Bondi and what happened I heard secretary Nielsen and what happened to her and we'll think about oh other things like uh oh Sarah Sanders in our family and Ted Cruz and his wife and Mitch McConnell and his wife\nI mean at some point someplace somewhere something's gonna happen if you didn't see it this weekend I mean you had a demonstration billed as a\nMarch for law and order in the streets of Portland descending into\nChaos as you have a rival political factions now breaking into a bloody brawls downtown Portland on Saturday Night you had members of some group called the Patriot prayer\nI've never heard of them and their their black clad adversaries known as antifa using bear spray ... each other outside what's known as Kelly's Olympia that's a popular bar in southwest Washington street\nThat may lead which lasted you know fairly long period of time ... riot cops rushed in firing pepper sprays up the street fighters Portland police bureau reported seeing the protests\nAnd counter protests participants outfitted in with hard a knuckle gloves knives firearms earlier in the evening why didn't they do something about it\nWell he said to make one arrest Saturday Night not one but they are investigating this scene is unfolding in mid tensions among both groups are fueled by impart uh some national news stories you had the marching in Portland against the police were brutality last week drew headlines after law enforcement's\nYou know they had a hands off approach to the event was blamed for an encounter between protesters and an elderly driver which was caught on tape that outrage many including\nUs some leader of this group out there patriot prayer and anyway a viral video surfaced showing in New York City members of the group which I also never heard of Proud Boys some type of male chauvinist\nOrganization a beating two or three protesters in New York City after an event at a Republican headquarters\nSo what you have is you know I Know the media has been reporting that they were a group of white supremacist I don't I don't know anything about them\nBut there was a a hate rally at Republican headquarters in New York City anyway where you know the way the media is portraying it I just have no idea 'cause I don't have it but if we're getting to the Daily Caller and people members actually banned allies the metropolitan Republican club in New York ahead of an appearance of\nThis group Proud Boys prompting an outbreak of violence they're fascinating that ... Andrew Cuomo the governor up for re election in New York is not going to have any trouble my opinion sadly he's blaming you know Donald Trump he blamed the president ... attacked the Republican headquarters in New York City\nUm the Southern Poverty Law Center has a history of swearing Republican organizations as white supremacists neo Nazis they labeled this group I hate group what did they call an ...\nMember if you go back in twenty six team that same so called watchdog group put housing and urban development secretary Ben Carson on its extremist watch was Ben Carson\nBecause he supports traditional marriage\nUm anyway Sarah quarter reported that the night before\nThe leader I guess it's Gavin McGinnis as the head of this thing and ... had threatened to attack his group leaving a note that read our attack is merely a beginnings romantic ... we're not pass it we're not civil we won't apologize\nThose have good conscience that a clear mind no the state of oppression cannot remain the U.

could very well go back you know we're talking about that in the news they say that we had hurricane that was far worse than what we just said was Michael says that they say they say that and what about the scientists say it's worse than after a\nShow me the scientist because they have a very big political agenda mostly cancelling them and just also have a political agenda\nWhere was that angle

Simpson is now saying Victoria that\nWas going to plead the fifth and can get away with that and make them come in and plead the fifth you know the idea that they can just threatened to plead the fifth and not have to actually go through with it I think it's important\n[noise] they should make him show up and do it in front of the TV cameras plead the fifth it's ridiculous to accept a letter from the lawyers and I hope they send you were talking to your former French and telling them to get them a get him in to the Congress to take this it and\nI don't care if they're not going to\nI'm In ... because I think there are other ways to to figure out how to do it you've got is the ... usa peanut first and then you negotiate later\nYou don't say oh mind he didn't show up talking trying to work it out now you have to think of that scene and he said Pina and then you say you can't make it went state and you make it Thursday that I Can't believe there's no ... well\nI mean I'm trying to understand I mean the president said that there would be de classification and all the materials the Jim Jordan was just talking about would be an redacted and we'd have a chance to see the ... of warrants the gang of eight information that three oh two between\nA Bruce or and Christopher Steele and how they wanted a funnel that information straight into Robert Mueller's office or Joe diGenova but you know the idea of why do I think even with you and Victoria's my attorneys\nThat I wouldn't get away with just saying I'm going to plead the fifth leave me alone now or or not handing over subpoenaed materials to Congress\nWell I don't think there's any question that Congress has dropped the ball on course to get some subpoenas but let me just say this 'cause this is really important all the names that you heard Michael with us Mr liar Simpson\nOr all those people they are ... to everything that was done in the United states\nWhat's fascinating is what happened in the United kingdom between the Congress has an important issue a subpoena his court we now know that the FBI or am I sick and that you have to\nConduct electronic surveillance of American city citizens on foreign soil without legal authority to do so and that information what in fact the conversations George Papadopoulos were intercepted and in the course of the intercepting those compensation\nThey found out that that was not interested in Hillary email or anything else and they never ... information because by the court\nYou know it seems Congressman Chaffetz that every piece of the puzzle now is falling in place I think we now understand what the insurance policy was Lisa Page testified that in the the nine months of the investigation\nLeading up to the appointment of special counsel Robert Mueller that they had no evidence of Trump Russia collusion at all um and by the way even her lover Peter Struck said the same thing he said well I'd be all end if there was something there there's no there there\nAnd then all of a sudden we find the media elite strategy that they discussed this with Andrew McCabe comes in James Baker comes in and other people come in and what we see is again it goes back to the Clinton bought and paid ... that dossier information has leaked out to the media creating the impression\nThat in fact there was Russia Trump collusion but they did it themselves they took the again it's it's all they were doing the leaky so that they can appoint the special counsel so that in the which one could be good begin\nI is there any part of the puzzle that isn't clear to you because it's getting very clear to me\nDo it is becoming a crystal clear\nAnd that's why Jim Jordan is exactly right\nThe people that were in that meeting and river the timing of this evening this meeting happens directly after a district Colombia's relieved of his duties but just before a Mr Mueller is put into place and you have to understand who's in that meeting what was discussed it sounds like bakers being the most candid about what was going on there\nBut each of the people in that meeting should be brought in for its own their own deposition uh transcribe under oath\nOr before Congress you don't have these five minute little ... you know asked\nThis is news Ninety six point by your baby oh we'll turn first for breaking news\nFor thirty a new study six point five W.
