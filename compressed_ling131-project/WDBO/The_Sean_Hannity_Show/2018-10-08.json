getting out of work and tuning in hurricane Michael currently a category one sustained winds of Seventy five miles per hour but it is expected to make landfall as a category three story could be the most powerful storm ever to hit the panhandle with massive storm surge we spoke with the national Hurricane Center like\nA we have been very very concerned about the lack of production of some doctors we've gotten a lot of documents access to more than a million documents for the department of justice from but some key key documents including the so called McCabe memos which couldn't very directly bear upon this question of\nA ... with Rod Rosenstein doing in that meeting\nA immediately prior to the point when Robert Mueller as special counsel and are these allegations that are in the New York times actually true ah I think that can be a lot of like if you shut on that if the documents we'd been requesting\nFor quite some time are made public so as a result of that this week by if they're not produced by tomorrow or to say this week\nWe're going to issue a subpoena to the Justice Department that expands upon the subpoena we issued earlier this year and include McKay memos and some other documents that have been requested by us but that's far not produce including Peters trucks personnel file of some of the struck page tax ah\nThe ah the the Bruce or three oh one and some other things All right so joining us now in Studio we welcome back to the man that's in the middle of all of this\nAnd I said do you know what the news is tomorrow you getting bits and pieces of information about what's happened\nThere there there we have people that know that were there that understand that in fact I'm a lot of this was a plan in the scheme of not only of media strategy league strategy but uh to take out a duly elected president I'm hearing a lot\nOf big hints coming Sean but similar to the situation where the DNC paid for a lot of lives about me I'm careful to not jump to any conclusions until the real facts are on the table so but I I agree what I'm hearing is can be really big\nYou know when all of this I mean to get for Pfizer warrants against you you would think that you must be a really bad guy and now that you've discovered how they obtain this information obtained these warrants against you um you've never been indicted so I guess you're not a threat to the country\nUm I've since learned through previous interviews that when you would go to Russia where your work brought you that you often would be the brief by our intelligence community and you had a good relationship with them correct absolutely Sean yup yup bitten by intelligence I mean CIA FBI gosh absolutely and other intel\nCommunity people for decades yes for decades and I assume they like you and trusted you\nAbsolutely you know and we would sometimes disagree on things in terms of our various assessments you know similar to any um international relations or security discussions that I Would have back in the Pentagon et cetera but that's you know an honest debate\nRight but okay but they wanted it was never a time where you you met with anybody that wanted you to spy on your country that you love no but I again I'm happy\nTo share insights and ideas just like I Do you know used to at New York university when my students yeah that's what we're pretty open guy\nBut All right so anybody I guess that would regularly go to Russia because they are a hospital regime at and they've been hostile to the United states um we do know that in fact that who does have a network of\nOf their own deep stayed operatives that are trying to create chaos in America by using social media and et cetera right that you don't doubt that well\nIn terms of creating chaos in America if you compare everything that the Russians did\nVersus what the what the DNC did with their lives and millions of dollars they spent on that you talk about election interference particularly their conspiracy with the deep state you know the OJ FBI CIA now that we're learning all these details much much worse than anything Russia did how did the DNC\nEver get away with never handing over their computers to the FBI [noise] um I don't think I'd get that consideration an option and no one's going to hire a room people won't\nIs it like when when did you first know that you were being spied on\nWell I started ah I had some hints about it you know people I Know in Washington mentioned it in September of twenty sixteen right around the same time when I started getting phone calls from the New York times CNN Washington Post about these DNC funded lies and they mentioned to me that there were a\nDemocrat hired operatives working in Washington who we're paying for these ah these operations and you know soon thereafter dies I found out about the you know the hacking of my emails and wiretapping of my uh\nAnd listen first happened in August so you found out pretty early\nYeah and actually I ...
