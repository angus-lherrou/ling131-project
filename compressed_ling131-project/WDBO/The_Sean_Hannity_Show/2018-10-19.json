can be the twenty twenty nominate\nA try and get through Ted Cruz first good luck with that but we're following all these races let me tell you where I think we are right now I think the Republicans\nI think between the caravan that we now have coming towards us four thousand people strong that want to get to the southern border with the United states from Central America I Know that the secretary of homeland security secretary Nielsen\nI I had an opportunity to call her office earlier today because I actually do real reporting on this show and get an update apparently as of now there's full cooperation with the Mexican government that that's not gonna happen\nBut four thousand people still four thousand people and what did Democrats what did they were just they they don't want a solution\nFor the border problem we have with the opioids crossover human trafficking is occurring you know would they now are using these drug cartels you can't say they're stupid they're evil but they're not stupid they've been using\nThis I Can't even believe this district you know these drones that they fly with cameras above him so they'll fly from Mexico into the United states along our southern border they fly droves with cameras on them and what they do is they map\nOut where the border patrol\nWhere agents aren't so then they get like the perfect entry way where they're most likely to succeed in bringing in their heroin and their Fenton all and drugs that are really being targeted towards your kids your town your cities\nAt so evil these drug cartels are and how desperate they are to be successful now the president\nWhile he offered now we spent three and a half billion dollars so far that's the only amount of money that had been allocated towards the all these pens every penny but we need twenty five billion dollars total to get the whole job done that in part is what this election is about it's also about a party that has given up any sense of honor\nAnd any sense of constitutional uh authority let the rule of law that is based on our constitution that would mean due process\nThat would mean equal or access on there are laws equal application of our laws\nAnd we know that they gave that up any sense of due process with judge Kavanaugh it wouldn't even give him the honor of the presumption of innocence even after an FBI investigation the eighth

Texas drawing tens and tens of millions of dollars at a radical Schumer ... you know cold as if the people at Texas share those values they do not and then of course we have better themselves there's enough to go forward with the impeachment of Trump\nIt's over but I still will be in Houston tomorrow Rick Perry's going to be with us or we're doing a town hall\nTed Cruz is going to be with us details on Hannity dot com that is what eleven o'clock tomorrow morning and used and there will be in Beaumont, Texas at three thirty tomorrow\nLooking forward to that and uh I'll be interviewing Ted Cruz and we'll be hearing a lot of this on a Monday obviously CNN as they made their decision as they're supporting which is pretty fascinating anyway we'll just Eighteen days away from these all important midterm elections\nAnd what do we see we see that Brett is and has now been exposed this week in Tennessee is somebody that is purposely lying to the people the ... the the same with Claire McCaskill we say that Christ in cinema is falling apart I mean literally\n... you know she she says oh it's fine to be a sign that join you know radicals um and the Taliban actually said oh and by the way this is the meth capital of the world Arizona oh by the way you're crazy and she has anti war rallies while her opponent Republican Martha McSally\nIs that we're fighting for a country that's not playing well very very well right now in the state of Arizona and you see that Heidi Heitkamp totally out of touch with the people of North Dakota so it seems a lot of pick ups are in the making there for the Senate for the Republicans\nTight race though in Florida vote for governor in for Rick Scott who always does an amazing job with the people of Florida are anyway joining us to analyze where we are Eighteen days out is our good friends welcome back to the program John McLaughlin Doug shown pollsters both of them John Eighteen days out what do you see happening\nOr well the the house is still in play and the Republicans are a without a doubt are fighting back to have gotten more aggressive but still it needs to do a lot more and and what's really amazing to me is the focus of\nYou know you're exposing the Democrats and what's your agenda is all the time but the focus of the Republicans really needs to be to expose Nancy Pelosi wants she intends to do I think you played a clip earlier about humor in the Senate\nAnd he wasn't very specific about whether they're going up in the polls because the Republicans post Kevin ... uh have have really done a lot better in a in a in the Senate polls that have come up I mean when you're talking about uh Arizona mix salaries now hit by a little in Tennessee the Republicans leading now decisively a ... so the\n... the Democrat opportunities to pick on the Senate look like they're going off the table and on the other hand it looks like the Republicans are ahead in Missouri they're they're\nThey're running close races in in Montana Indiana\nA West Virginia I mean even in New Jersey uh it's it's turning into a competitor\nOr to really look at like New Jersey might be a dog fight for Bob Menendez and the people in New Jersey of had it with him and you know now that his association with this Chilean Epstein guy uh that has now become an absolute verbal war between Menendez and his Republican opponent of opponent and now showing up at the polls\nAre dug show where do you stand Eighteen days out\nWell hey where America stands in St John and you are right\nOn fortunately I might add is that the standing has moved pretty decisively Republican I don't think that New Jersey will go all the way because it is a operationally democratic state but the other states you cite showing I think are moving in but I think are the wrong direction I\nStill have a chance to pull out in Nevada and Arizona but both of those at the carrier rated above it from my perspective at all last\nWeek and I think Arizona in particular but Dean Heller was in a very tight race for reelection the Republican he was ... it was a to point race so we could go Donald Trump goes in and now he's up by seven and I saw the crowds when I was out there was massive but the crowd outside was even bigger than the one inside\nWell look at it yeah I was gonna say I I've seen the same numbers John please go ahead\nAnd absolutely I mean the president is motivating his base and and the Republicans need to embrace that because a nationally when he won he had sixty three million voters and when the the uh uh\nUh when the midterms occur we only get Ninety million people usually out might be a little more this time but it won't be as big as the hundred and thirty nine million who showed up in a twenty sixteen so\nIf you can get the sixty three million Trump voters motivated after coming out again which the Kavanaugh hearings did and it appears to have backfired particularly on Senator Schumer and the and the Democrats in the Senate or if you can motivate those Republicans to come out those Trump voters those independents and Democrats that supported them\nFrom the security\nStill got discretion I for a west bound approaching the turnpike we're right lane is blocked and you've got some heavy delays all the way back to Fairbanks that's going to take about Fifteen minutes of whether you if you stick with high for west bound you can always take Lee road to ... park with a for weight to ... to avoid those delays on edge orange there's Ninety six twenty five WDC radio\nIn the Senate if you're going to vote for tester and McCaskill\nAnd send them on against Dean Heller and Donnelly and you're going to vote for you know Brett us and it was just a phony fraud to the people of\nGetting caught on tape the being it uh and and not put more Marsha Blackburn and you know you'll get the government you deserve but you're really electing and voting for Schumer because they're gonna they're gonna tow the line with below sea in the house into the line which were in the Senate that's\nYou know and what do we know that they want they want to impeach the president they want endless investigations\nThey want to raise taxes they're actually saying that they're hiding the impeachment begging Maxine Waters not to say it any more John Podesta Center for American Progress and said all Democrats should not talk about immigration for say one open borders sanctuary cities\nSanctuary states that elimination of ice and they want to keep Obamacare that's not that that didn't work for eight years dug and why\nWhy do we we sold him to a bit of a leading Indiana is saying a heat by you saying build the wall and he's saying no impeachment which\nWhen he was the only reason he surviving and not down by five or six now is because you've got a libertarian in that race that is polling at nine percent you take a libertarian outta Donnelly is history in Indiana\nWell I wouldn't be so sure on but he is running where Democrats need to be in the center and if we were a centrist party rather than a leftist party\nNew leadership from top to bottom I think we can go in a lot better I think you're probably agree with that Sean\nHow is it possible that Democrats hold on to polo sea and Schumer how is it that it is a phenomenon to me ...\nAll one word answers on Snowden's money so you know raising enough money yeah\n... that's what it's all about\n... and and and he's absolutely right because showing that when we asked in September and a national poll that they were packed into when we ask voters if the Democrats took over Congress do you want if you close your speaker didn't only twenty three percent of all voters said yes fifty six percent said now\nBut then when we asked him about the fact that you know if you know that they're chapter that these candidates are accepting millions of dollars to raise them for their campaigns from Nancy Pelosi or or will they all their votes to her fifty percent agreed with that statement only twenty nine percent disagreed of all voters so think\nNancy Pelosi and Chuck Schumer hold the mortgage on these candidates\nAnd let me tell you for for ... for someone who's involved in congressional races right now trying to defend Republicans the Democrats are\nPouring millions of dollars to the races right now\nWhat ... Republicans\nI mean project very toss released to tapes and they are stunningly\nYou know revealing in terms of the willingness of campaigns to purposely organized a campaign to lie to the people at Tennessee in the case of Brett us and to lie to the people of Missouri in the in the case of\nMcCaskill to say one thing privately another thing publicly it tells me Democrats too when they have to they can expose who they are if they can't talk about impeachment which they want they can't talk about immigration and being told not to talk about that\nThey can't talk about raising taxes even though they want that they can't talk about Obamacare even though they want that\nI mean what kind of people are they if they have zero sense of honor honesty character and integrity hope\nYou are exempt me from the uh person\nWhat am I I like them to you but you know nobody but listening to you because they were listening to you have a whole entirely different slate of candidates and frankly the Republicans wouldn't have a shot this year\nWell thank you I take that as a real well it's a fact\nGood afternoon for thirty of news about a six point five W db oh all ready very busy I for the
