miles uh Ninety minutes south of of Nashville for a couple of years of my life used to go up there all the time I Love music city usa\nBut I'm thinking Marsha Blackburn is going to hold that seat I'm pretty confident that the people of Missouri or a little sick and tired of\nOf Claire Schumer McCaskill because she's a reliable hundred percent vote for sure every time\nAnd they're probably sick and tired of the fact that she too in her office to got caught on tape they're lying to the people in Missouri bragging behind the scenes how she's just like Obama I'm pretty sure that Heidi Heitkamp I mean is done in North Dakota I mean did you see that she recently released\nYou know the name of a sexual assault victims trying to\nYou know in an ad that she was running anyway we've never seen a mid term race like that before and I'm pretty sure listen I think if the people in Nevada get out you can save Dean Heller he's up a little bit in the polls but that's always a tight state for

it's basically Joe Schumer Donnelly\nListen I'm going to tell you and all these races Southern California believe it or not it's going to play a big role in the in the balance of power in the house Minnesota's going to play a big role in the balance of power in the house Michigan's going to play a big role Ohio is going to play a big role Florida is going to play a big role\nEvery state in the union I mean there's listen\nIf Nate Silver saying eighty six percent and he looks so bad after the last election now part of this I always believe is to deflate enthusiasm on our side you don't have to listen to the pollsters I don't listen to the pollsters last uh last November or twenty sixteen in November of five Fifteen I got the exit polls\nThose exit poll showed that Donald Trump didn't win

foot they make it in what three weeks three and a half weeks but\nOne thing that I think we both agree on is that I don't want a crisis precipitated at the border but goes Mexico is allowing this caravan to march through their entire country\nAnd we have no choice but to guard our borders because it's our sovereign land I wear a nation of laws and I do and in the process\nThe people on that side of the border that are not respecting our laws could they could precipitate a crisis where innocent people get hurt and I don't want that to happen right is that better\nSo so now you understand\nPsychologically what Abraham Lincoln and went through between Eighteen fifty eight\nAnd a the spring of Eighteen sixty one and he says again and again you know we do not have to fight this ... this was you know you aren't going to choose and he said I'm not going to choose on I'm going to defend the constitution and do my duty but I'm not choosing to fight\nBut if you give me no choice I won't have no choice and I think this this is I think\nOne of the great chest that President Trump is going to face because\nHe he when he talks about a person the other day he doesn't want anyone hurt he feels this very deeply\nOn the other hand he has sworn to protect the United states he has sworn to uphold our borders are and and I tweeted this morning says it hit me this morning if if the president is serious\nThat Mexicans only have two choices then you can deal with the caravans now in southern Mexico for when the president blocks from entering the United states\nThey can deal with them in northern Mexico like if you ask yourself this simple question if they literally can't get across the border they're stuck in northern Mexico\nWell and I think our our position ought to be that that Mexico this decide whether I Want us to deal with them now he wants to deal with them when they returned back to the border but under no circumstances\nShould we accept them in Sydney powers done some brilliant legal work on the fact that the president has the authority\nTo block aliens that he deemed should the national threatened always got to say it doesn't have to defend his decision as to say I deemed this to be unacceptable for national security reasons and that block\nNow in all likelihood I don't think it's going to get to that point my guess is at some point because of the economic connection that Mexico needs with the United states\nThey're gonna have to step in here somehow in turn this caravan around how they do that I don't know but the reality is I by the way and I do have compassion I understand people in\nIn Central America El Salvador Guatemala Nicaragua or that they want a better life but this is not the way to do it we have a process by which we have an immigration system and we're a sovereign country you don't get to ... you know create a crowd and rush the border\nIn my fear is if they get to the border\nThat we could be a potential outcome that's not going to be good for the people if we had the wall Mr Speaker built this wouldn't be an option for them if we had the wall we would have that would be no risk of anybody getting hurt on either side\nCould be bringing number in the near future the next few weeks\nOur policy should be to hope for the best for planned for the worst I think the worst case is pretty simple the Mexicans end up with their own political reasons for doing nothing\nThey decide that they expect Donald Trump to cave and so there is going to let you know as many thousand people just want to enter the United states\nWhat if they haven't thought through is what does he doesn't have what if he does call out to the military what if we do in fact creator effect human wall and block people from entering the United states\nNow and then I have what what could be down as much as ten or Fifteen thousand people because of their ass keep growing\nWell there was one report yesterday from a newspaper in Mexico that said it's already ballooned up to fourteen thousand\nRight so so part of what I'm saying is at this at that point\nWe we have a real decision to make and this is this is what Lincoln as saying over and over again yeah uh you know\nIf you're going to preserve the union you're going to do whatever it takes to preserve the union he didn't say it happily he didn't say it excited Lee ... many of his key early speeches as this nostalgic sadness to\nThat we are bound together by the common core of mystique memory so we have no reason to fight each other\nA and he's almost pleading no don't do this well I Would say the same thing here this this is the perfect crossroads to make the decision are we prepared to defend our sovereignty and to defend America for in the end\nAnd people blocking U.S forces to cave\nIn guilt us into allowing them to invade our country because we don't have the nerve to stop to\nWe got to take a break or I Want you to weigh in when we get back on what the next fourteen days are going to look like what you think Nate Silver as predicted and much more of a former speaker of the house Newt Gingrich is our guest eight hundred million for one shown as a toll free telephone number later

unwittingly giving third party developers potential access to use his private profile information\nThat they expect that more than four hundred and Ninety six thousand users have shared private profile data with a friend and that could have been their data that is that access by these cyber criminals\nGoogle says no evidence that there's been any misuse of that data but in today's digital connected age you don't know you've got to protect yourself you're good\nI ask you can you can you stay for another five minutes I Want to really get into this more deeply out there because it's important where fourteen days out of an election\nTwo weeks from today you'll be boating and two weeks from tonight you'll be turning on your television sets and you're either going to have great news

you something I Will walk away I Will do everything I can do to walk like I Do part of martial arts all the arts that I practice\nWe ... we bow out if we're doing weapons training we show great respect if we're doing grappling or or\nOutright full contact we do it with respect we respect the tap we were you know we're not there to kill each other we're there to make each other better\nI'm so there's a certain discipline David associated with that and but most people don't know how to defend themselves and be they're going to react like that then they're going to get past and somebody's gonna get hurt\nI couldn't agree more and it is a danger for people in the public square and especially people who hold themselves out as Christians whether you're a pastor or you have a Christian themed blackout you really gotta be careful at it but we do anyway we need to be civil and and when some people on Twitter ... and our other interactions\nBut I don't think that means we don't fight I don't think it means we don't uh communicate our ideas as passionately and as intensely as the left that this is we don't have to get his dirty as they do\nWell I look I don't know why are we just had Newt Gingrich on and pastor when he was saying is between Cavanaugh I mean all these American\nValues that have have served us so well due process presumption of innocence and then you see that there was no core operation any of these charges\nIf the Democrats really cared about the issue they'd be going after Keith Ellison right now demanding an FBI investigations and Cory Booker would be having an FBI investigation and Claire McCaskill's husband would be having an FBI investigation and\nBill Clinton would be in jail for the rest of his life but they're obviously playing politics with with very important issue so the hypocrisy is there but between Kavanaugh the mobs the\nCaravan that's happening and the fact that we've had on\nParallel economic success\nFourteen state record for states record low unemployment record low unemployment for African Americans Hispanic Americans Asian Americans women in the workplace are vets record low unemployment youth unemployment lowest ever I I'm hoping that people factor that in in fourteen days when they vote or if they vote early\nI think the man on the street will factor then I don't think the people on the street are stupid Democrat or Republican\nThen that stupid the party leaders are stupid but the man on the street they're able to see this process that they know that Kavanaugh was that whole cabinet issue was a sham they see the hypocrisy of the left on full display\nThey know that this a caravan is not simply a random\nOccurrence that you know a a all these unconnected people just randomly deciding to all walk thousands of miles to America to look for better jobs they can see the orchestra now some people are going to vote the party regarding this but the others they say listen I'm tired of this because all of the nonsense seems to be coming from the left\nAnd the very behavior that they pretended to criticize they've put it on steroids and I gave me a lady so you know they said well we don't like that some of the behavior the president during the campaign but you\nSay they have it to another level and you're you're ...\nYou're you're out of Cleveland, Ohio okay you're a an African American conservative you took a lot of heat for supporting Donald Trump out at the results are in\nAnd we're seeing all of these jobs being created for the people look at that picture over there that's the forgotten men and women of America that's what that's what twenty six team was about for me the Thirteen million more Americans on food stamps the eight million more in poverty after Obama's eight years\nNow we've got four million jobs created eight million fewer people in poverty and on food stamps we have\nFour hundred thousand manufacturing jobs that Obama server never coming back\nWhile the president didn't get credit when you break down votes demographically with the black community because they're never doing better they've never done better\nThank God he's going to get the votes you know a ... in the Bible nicotine was came to Jesus button I and there are a lot of nicotine ms and they say listen we see what Trump is doing we embrace with Trump is doing is not what they told us that waking up and you know if they say is thirty six percent approval rating\nAt twenty or thirty percent of the fifty six sixty six percent believe me\nHis message is rent Kareem tell him his message was amazing the black community I come\nFrom a traditional democratic family years voted party forever blacked it in my family and our sphere are now so ... to it that they're either going to not vote at all which is which is really go for what we're doing with the conservative movement or\nThey're going to vote with us because just starting to see that this is a charade here you know the media constantly but right and President Trump for no reason they've been doing it all day today CNN blacks used to go and get their news from CNN their politics from CNN from him as soon as they're starting to see\nWe got to get in the trenches we got to figure this out so we're getting a bunch of calls from people saying hey what's going on houses going how's Trump doing this how can we help on this particular side he's going to get off the black vote than any other Republican president I'll throw those today\nBut if if we all believe in in ... the father Jesus is okay and I think all of us here do if we believe that we all believe one thing and that predicated on that he created every man woman and child on this earth we agree with that right okay yeah so in that sense where\nBrothers and sisters we're all Americans to right and if we really believe that in every human soul God put some talent some ability\nAnd our goal is to to create an environment where that that talent that natural talent flourishes the word education from the Latin is in ... to bring forth from within\nThat tells you the God put their our job is to put enough sunlight and water on something make it grow and help people and that's what I see Trump's doing and it's and it's now hitting the forgotten men and women David that's the great story of the two years of Trump so far\n[noise] yeah yes and and we want to get back what Trump is trying to do when he says I Want to make America great again it means to restore its founding principles is Judeo Christian founding principles which is based on the idea that we're all created in God's image and that's why we had an alien Abul lights it flows from that\nBut I think the left is authoritarian by nature their economic coercion can lead to political coercion and that's where they are and I I think the left is losing it because they don't have any ideas that worked and I don't have any proposal so they're frustrated and they resort\nTo identity politics
