Ninety six point by Wu ... a couple of spots starting to pop up all the interactive radar but mostly dry at this point we'll take a look at that coming up first so our job story this hour we've got a new updates from Orlando police on the bad killed by officers that ... the this morning when he claimed he had a gun\nTo be last week something that would be limited in scope they were just going to investigate professor Ford's allegations and they were going to do it expeditiously well now they never had any such intention any way shape manner but now it's\nWe've got a democratic US Senate has sent out a press release in it they say\nDemocratic senators FBI must\nInvestigate all three credible allegations of sexual assault\nAgainst judge Brett Kavanaugh\nAnd that would be by the way I read the FBI is already looking into allegation number two which was\nThe New Yorker piece this was by Mr Ramirez and remember even the New York times couldn't go with that story they had reported that\nThey interviewed several dozen people in an attempt to corroborate her story they couldn't find one person with first hand knowledge\nAnd then they reported that missed Ramirez herself was contacting former your classmates asking if they were called the incident and told them pull some of them that she could not be certain Mr Kavanaugh was the one who exposed himself and that's what they're saying\nAnd remember she admitted she quickly became a ... she had gaps in her memory foggy slurring of words\nSo that's what the Democrats are citizens are credible allegation well if it was so incredible why didn't they ask judge Kavanaugh when he sat in front of them\nLast week 'cause they they they all had the opportunity to delve into anything they wanted to delve into and they chose not to then we've got the the third incident which is the ... case\nWhere a woman claims that routinely almost on a weekend basis and she had been to ten of these parties herself personally\nThat there was Brett Kavanaugh and a bunch of prep the kids that were drug ...\nGirls and then lining up in the hall waiting their turn to rape innocent girls\nAnd a whole series of allegations he looked at as as Byron York said the gold polls have moved very very far away very very quickly and all the people but not just going to be a week limited scope no big deal just an FBI invest you want to clear your name right you'd want to clear your name right judge\nIt's not about clearing his name it's about giving them more time so they can come up with more allegations and it doesn't matter at the end of the day Democrats do not even want a vote on judge Kavanaugh\nAnd they want to continue the smears the slander the lies the mismanagement character assassination frankly the political blood joining of judge Kavanaugh in his family now as evidenced by now remember\nDianne Feinstein had this for six long week she had this back in July there was a California state or California congressman that had it early July and then they went to Dianne Feinstein Dianne Feinstein on two separate occasions was meeting with judge Kavanaugh\nThen of course we had the original hearings\nAnd not at one point that Dianne Feinstein ever mentioned professor Ford\nBut while she was meeting with him privately she was simultaneously recommending lawyers to professor Ford and one that was the bench was chosen was Deborah cats\nAnd she is a lawyer that represents professor poured but which is fine but she has a history of oh challenging Paula Jones and supporting Al Franken so in other words she's radical left political ... attorney is\nAnd so anyway they were emails sent out we just found out late last week of a friend of this attorney for professor for this Deborah cats woman and she was in the hearing she was sitting to the right up professor Ford or to the left on your screen if you were watching the hearings\nAnyway it goes on to say that friends emails were sent by a friend of Deborah cats the lawyer representing professor Ford recommended by Dianne Feinstein\nAnd they were soliciting women to accuse judge Brett Kavanaugh of impropriety and this is what they were sending out last week when we just need an FBI Barry expeditious very quick very limited in scope they were they have been and continue to be on a fishing expedition\nNow the emails were obtained by the Washington Free beacon\nSeeking corroboration from classmates of cabin all about your book and trees and gang rape and one emails sent\nA late last week delivered to roughly fifty alumni of stone rich school of the Sacred Heart an all girls school near Georgetown Prep with the subject line corroboration needed never cats need to find people who are familiar with what the slang terms were used by ... cabin on his ... page meant\nAnd the devil's triangle and the ...\nUh wording in there if you can speak to any of these are willing to sign an affidavit please contact us that's a fishing expedition and that is ... this was what the Democrats wanted the delay for now if it was truly limited in scope and we know that\nAnd the case of professor poured that there were four people she mentioned we're at this party some don't remember ever being even her best friend don't remember ever being at a party where Brett Kavanaugh was add onto the\nYou know that when the perjury I mean ... under the penalty of a felony here so they all signed these affidavits all agreed that the that they didn't have any recollection\nAnd the the most difficult part of it is is professor Ford identified an eye witness to the event\nThat eye witness has said under penalty of a felony that it never happened\nWhat professor Ford is claiming and this is professor Ford who put mark judge in the room at the time of the alleged incident so I'm not sure what the FBI really can do in this case beyond\nSee whether any of these people are going to admit that they committed perjury and gave false statements ... there's nothing else really left for them to do please use your voice you will not get a second chance this letter goes on to say I mean well this point you're you're pretty much just soliciting\nYou know randomly anybody took ... please please come forward and then the hope is that there will be delayed again and again and again and\nYou know on top of that than we've got you know what was supposed to be limited in scope what was supposed to be done expeditiously in a week\nNow is turning into because they can't get anything else at least not that we know of yeah who knows what Dianne Feinstein knows\nThen the only thing they've got is well did he committed perjury about the amount of alcohol that he drink you know could did he really black how would anybody know if he blacked out\nThat's only he would be able to tell you if he blacked out\nNow he admitted to drinking to liking beer liking beer a lot still liking beer drinking too much beer you know being intoxicated he admitted to all of that when he was in high school and college which not all that uncommon let's be honest about\nAnd so they're trying to say well he didn't he do we know we had to have blacked out as an I worked as a bartender for a number of years I Know a lot about alcohol\nI watched that up close and personal you know everybody's got a number for some people the numbers to and after two they lose that\nFor some people I there were people that every single night I work could sit there from six PM till four thirty when I close the doors and other throw him out and they'd be walking straight having been drinking all night\nI mean the caller is levels from individual individual is just it's an enormous\nYou know you see some people that go beyond their numbers they become aggressive or flirtation I saw it all I learned a life lesson and it wasn't good if you go beyond whatever your individual number is it's never going to be good for you or or anybody else for that matter\nUm anyway so we got that and so it's not about limited in scope there's a lot of news or no time many of which I don't know where the clock is I'm Mark Penn and wrote an interesting piece which I I found today\nAnd he said that he was a poster was the Clintons pollster and he noted today that in the immediate aftermath of last Thursday's testimony by professor Ford and Brett Kavanaugh slim majority of those surveyed sided with her but\nThey found he founded the support for professor Ford collapsed when voters were told that none of the three ... a witness to she cited to corroborate her allegation have any idea\nAs to what she's talking about and that fact was barely mentioned during Thursday's questioning and it was only mentioned if you remember at the end of the questioning uh one of the things that were saying that we see a new poll out by running to research group because the electorate is thirty six days away\nI Want you to think about thirty six days from now when you turn on your TV on election night and do you want to hear the words Nancy Pelosi has just been elected speaker of the house and Chuck Schumer is the new majority leader of the United States Senate because that's what the Democrats want now if this doesn't\nIf this does not show you this is not a party that wants to make America better that has a plan to help the working men and women forgotten men and women of America\nAs a matter of fact with every bit of success the president has it it it diminishes any chance they have but getting back their power and after two years of trying to destroy the president you know they want a Christian do their way back into power just forgetting the eight years of Obama which would disastrous\nAnyway so we've got this election you're going to tune in at night and you're going to flip the channels are going to be watching news channels and you're either going to be seeing happy anchors all over the country or you're gonna once again shocked the world and you're going to defy the odds and you're sick of their agenda\nWhy would anybody after Michael Flynn\nAfter what's that kid's name a Papadopoulos why would anybody talk to

M. C. this morning\nWe'll end up police now say was thirty three year old Brian Baker who made aggressive movements towards three officers this morning it started with Baker being taken an RMC with a medical condition he claimed to have a gun was going to shoot anyone who came near and chief ...\nJob security was able to paint him right away and what his officers approached Brian Baker he made\nA movements consistent with Boeing reaching for a firearm and he was shot and killed by free officers here\nPlease we get Mr President you said that they think correct to say you're limiting the scope of the FBI investigation\nWhat is it has to do is say I don't mind answering the question but you know I'd like to do the ... with the other headline in the habit and I know how that talking about trade and then we'll get to that will do that a little bit later think anybody ever had a great deal of hats\nOr Congress there are I think so but you know if it doesn't we have lots of other alternatives but I Do think so I think if they're fair which is a big question but if it's fair on both sides are Republicans love it\nIndustrial opposite our country loves it if it's fair it will pass I think it'll pass easily\nRight our to Sean Hannity show as we're back in the swamp were back in D.C a lot of breaking news eight hundred nine four one showing\nHas a toll free telephone number you want to be a part of the program well what was supposed to be last week a limited in scope and done very quickly is now evolved into Democratic senators\nOh the FBI must investigate all three credible allegations of sexual assault against\nJudge Brett Kavanaugh by the way why didn't they ask judge Kavanaugh when they had the opportunity last week if they don't want to expand the scope now the interesting thing about this email is hold their now putting out a list of we've got to interview this one and this one and this one and this one and this one including\nThat anonymous person in this anonymous person that they're literally trying to tell the FBI\nHad to do their job and we found out this weekend emails were sent late last week by a friend of this left wing attorney that's representing professor forward that's the one that didn't believe Paula Jones and\nSupported Al Franken anyway but a friend of hers last week a you remembered Dianne Feinstein recommended this attorney cats Deborah cats for professor forward\nAnd of course while she was meeting Dianne Feinstein with Brett Kavanaugh anyway it turns out that they are now soliciting members of the Georgetown Prep community for information and searching for additional women who accused\nSupreme Court nominee judge Brett Kavanaugh of impropriety this is what you would call a witch hunt this is now a we don't have enough so let's see let's let's go out and solicit people\nAnd see if we can find people that are willing to say something horrible about Brett Kavanaugh because maybe that's the way we'll be able to stop the nomination we got delayed like we wanted now we've got to be able to get everything that we want Newt Gingrich has a great question is there even one Democrat decent enough for disgusted enough to end this cabinet travesty\nAnd he joins us now sir how are you welcome back to the program\nI'm doing well but I was very struck this morning by Byron ... column in which he points out that the Democrats having decided that sex may not work are now looking at whether or not Kevin all might have been an accurate in describing how much he drank too they're spreading a wider and frankly in an age when\nJustice Ginsburg was very political\nAnd some attacks on President Trump\nDemocrats are trotting out judicial temperament of this whole thing is it is character assassination it is I think tremendously bad for the country and it is it tells us who they are I mean I think the key to election this fall is which America do you want to be\nDo you really want to be an America where somebody could live a decent life for thirty five years have two lovely daughter is a good marriage\nAnd then get smeared on ending late was totally uncorroborated assaults does that sound really the America we want to become\nYou know the judge was honest as could be said I like beer I drink beer I drink beers and sometimes I drink too much fear\nHe denied ever blacking out I mean the accusation that somebody could observe some well he had the blackout that night um I was a bartender when I was Seventeen and Eighteen years old and I've seen a lot of drunk people in my life\nAnd I couldn't tell you whether or not they remember the incident the next day and it wouldn't be me in the position of saying that\nBut what they're doing is they're moving the bar this is what you're saying the goalposts now are being literally moved every second every hour of every day and now that we have people working on behalf of the Dianne Feinstein\nRecommend the lord lawyer Deborah cats and sending out letters saying ah we we need more people um it sounds like they never want this to end and I don't think there is going to be a Democrat to answer your question that's going to be decent enough or disgusted enough to end it\nWell let me try to be very clear from it because I'm I'm frankly very disappointed in\nThe tradition Republicans are just denying reality fact is this has nothing to do with traditional government this has nothing to do with the Senate this has nothing to do frankly with Georgetown oh\nThis is about a militant left wing group willing to lie assassin H meaner cheat I mean when you when you have\nWhen you have a mob that goes into a restaurant to harass Sen Cruz when you have to women who break into a an elevator to arrest US Senator over and over and over again which you have on the left his willingness to break the rules\nTo get what they want\nAnd I think that it's a very serious problem\nYou know it does raise a lot of questions because at this point I don't think we're going to go back to high school years you\nKnow when people talk and I watched a lot of this this weekend you know two commentators actually saying this is Sean Hannity could have given the speech and I'm thinking okay um how is one supposed to act when they're falsely accused\nOf literally drugging women and boys lined up halls all over the course of course of many weekends\nAs the boys can then take their chance that gang raping women and being a participant in that I don't know what the significant or normal reaction would be for me if you're innocent it would be righteous anger and indignation that that to me would be the normal human response if you're innocent\nRight well let me let me in a plane historian from it because I spent the weekend thinking about what we're living through when you know Cory Booker says the your complicit with evil if you support Kavanaugh deceiving example\nYou're getting you know when one Blumenthal who as a person was pointing out is terrible record of overtly publicly lying about\nNear new point five guilty db Orlando\nTurns burst for severe weather I mean Iran just George Walden burger trying if you isolated

class is bringing America to the brink of revolution\nUm are we really getting to the brink of a revolution in this sense I mean look it's only happened three times in the last hundred years where a party wins the White House power in the White House and they don't have losses in the next midterm election year the last time was right after nine eleven two thousand and one George Bush was president\nUm but I got to imagine people are pretty pissed off at the\nAt is what's you know it was two weeks ago yesterday and nobody had heard one bad thing about Brecht capital\nUntil two weeks ago yesterday and look where we are talking about go to the show\nCabinet is being destroyed not because of anything he did or didn't do that because he's in the way\nOf the Democrats retaining power I mean it's not personal it's just the party wants what he's about to get and so they're crushing him and his family in order to get it are we moving to a revolution while I don't look at the people in charge look at the Congress look at our media they're pushing conflict in division on us they're pushing racial division endlessly\nThey're pushing gender division they're claiming that the cap not soccer is a reason that women should eight men and vice versa yeah I mean they're pushing this unity because this unified country it's easier for them\nTo control that divide and conquer it's the oldest strategy there it\nWell you don't look I I've I've chronicled this historically over the course of my career and that is it's pretty predictable every two and four years every election cycle Republicans racist sexist I won't give the whole list but is act like they want to throw granting over the cliff\nAnd now with Supreme Court justices or if they have an opening ... there seems to be no there there there's nothing they will say or do now I mean your friends of the attorney for professor cats\nYou know Dianne Feinstein recommended who herself was pretty radical left\nNow soliciting people from the Georgetown Prep community whatever that is and asking if if they have information or they want to come forward their soliciting people and the FBI now is being told by Democrats well

O. trafficking weather coming up for you in a moment and President Trump announcing a new trade agreement today first\nWe have an update from Orlando police this afternoon on the story we told you about when you went to work this morning a man killed by officers I don't want him see\nFor Leno police now say was thirty three year old Brian Baker who made aggressive movements towards three officers this morning it started with Baker being taken an RMC with a medical condition he claimed to have a gun and was going to shoot anyone who came near and chief John meaner\nAny of these allegations whatsoever member that\nAnyway well Deborah Katz is the one that well she didn't really believe Paula Jones and she did take al Franken's side\nAnd you know it is [noise] you you just give got to watch this\nIt there's no end to this now they are not going to stop until they get a no vote on Brecht capital that's just this should not surprise anybody and Jeff Flake is now in Massachusetts today trying to run for president thinking you've got to which by the way the way to do it you don't like Trump the Gobi to\nIn thirty six days Democrats they'll make their case and they're going to ask you to give the house of representatives to Nancy Pelosi and the Senate Democrats to Chuck Schumer if that's what you want on election night in thirty six days and you want to turn on the TV and find out the results\nIf you stay home well you'll get the government you deserve we always do you want all progress that we have now\nAchieved it two years to stop that will happen too but all the senators saying well no no no we got to limit the scope but it's got to be very quick expeditious and just have the FBI do this that's not what they ever intended they want this to drag on through the mid term elections in the hope that Donald Trump doesn't get to make as Supreme Court\nNomination anyway joining us now is Carrie Severino she's the chief counsel policy director\nFor the Judicial Crisis network a welcome back to the program well as predicted the bar has shifted\nAnd now the Democrats won an extensive FBI investigation but from my standpoint as it relates to professor poured there's really only for people that need to be interviewed and I would assume by now for the probably work\nI'd I'd sure they were within either find people because they already had been interviewed by the Senate Judiciary committee let the the the goalposts moving faster than the speed of light here it's it's very difficult [laughter] that could believe that any of these people and it it could take themselves seriously they said\nIt's going to be here for days a week and now they're going I it's artificial deadline you know they were saying the FBI the gold standard there impartial there you know she worked at that every Democrat that that now they're going up the Trump is evil puppet master controlling the FBI are actually going to be it's horrible partisan organization\nIt it it it it is and it would be laughable if it wasn't a man's life long reputation here on the line\nJoe ... two weeks ago as far as everybody else knew Brett Kavanaugh had an impeccable reputation that does now that's gone forever you know re Donovan famously once said after being investigated for a year and a half where do I go to get my good name back mhm well and this case\nI I don't think Brett Kavanaugh ever gets back in many many ways I mean Clarence Thomas will ever be remembered because of the ...\nSmith accusations of Anita Hill\nYeah it it it's very discouraging although I have to say I I Do get some on it if someone who clerked for Justice Thomas and knows the why he he you know there's certain ... ... people who are going to get simply use that as their excuse is counted but they were to discount them because they disagree with in any way\nOn and he is someone who it does ... incredible amount of respect on the bench judge Kavanaugh is a kind of person where even when he was on the DC circuit as the lower court judge\nThe Supreme Court said it saw him as someone to really take seriously you know more than a dozen times they fought to fourteen different times they found out they vindicate his opinion they had a huge amount of respect for him I don't think that's going to change I think\nUm they are not going to be watching this with the same knee jerk a part in response as I Hope that that that we're seeing them some of these people are ... but I but it\nUp you know the parents who bought her reputation now\nIf you read James Comey's New York times piece that he came out with the ... it to me it's absolutely stunning\nAnd the things that he's saying because while the FBI's packet in the middle of it when we handled the Hillary Clinton email investigation while he was writing an exoneration himself prior to the real investigation which didn't happen until three days before he publicly exonerated her um\nBut then he goes on to trash the president at length\nAnd then he talks about FBI agents are experts which they are interviewing people in quickly dispatching leads to their colleagues around the world to follow up with additional interviews\nAnd they will confront people with testimony and other accounts and you know yes the alleged incident occurred thirty six years ago but FBI agents no time has little to do with memory um which I found a little strange um and then you know for example everybody remembers if it rained on their wedding day\nUh I don't think that's the ... in that particular sense maybe to somebody who is traumatized by could see that but for somebody that's not traumatized maybe not\nUm once they start interviewing every witness knows the consequences he says\nIs one thing to have your lawyers have been a statement on your behalf it's very different thing to sit across from two FBI special agents and answer their relentless questions of course the bureau won't have subpoena power only the ability to knock on doors and ask questions most people will speak to them that there is what he says refusal to do so is its own kind of statement\nNow I Want to just address that because my FBI friends my friends in the in the bureau special agents have all said to me never ever talk to the FBI unless you have a lawyer ever and I'm like why I'm somebody who loves the FBI\nI don't love the upper brass under Khomeini and the cave and struck and page but the FBI is is the FBI people I Know the salt of the people and I sort of course I Want to help him he goes no\nAnd then they say look what happened to General Flynn General Flynn is accused of lying to the FBI and the up here I didn't think he was lying to them and you just it's dumb to ever talk to any law enforcement without a lawyer that's what all my law enforcement people friends say because it's a crime if you lie to the FBI let's say you said\nSomething in the Senate Judiciary investigation and it doesn't exactly match up you could be charged with a crime of lying to the FBI it's ridiculous\nAnd you know the the irony that says if you look it hit companies coming ammo right now is just to try to destroy Trump with everything he can and it's just another another section in that play book but the irony is the exact same federal law provision\nThat says it's a crime to to lie the FBI is the one that says it's a crime to lie to the Senate\nAnd they're with their investigative it's not just you know a similar penalty is exactly the same statutory violation so that's just not they've been kind of pretending there's that that I guess playing a little bit on people's images maybe from the movies of what the FBI does to say that this is somehow it's going to be a separate different thing\nWhat they're really doing here is there going down the same list to people the Senate Judiciary committee had already talks to\nThey're getting the same statement in some cases they might get exactly the same thing because the FBI can't ... can't force them to talk to them\nEspecially if all you know as\nI don't remember that I wasn't there they they could be dealing with taking the same\nExact statement from the same lawyers for the same the same individual ... that's ... that that is all we can know because because nature of this old investigation so the FBI isn't going to find anything new to hear that there there's my prediction\nOregon that they don't have any other thing\nThey've already moved on I guess the ... and and that's the one that came out in the New Yorker piece and you know ... that's the one we're even the New York times that said they attempted to interview over the course of a week several dozen people they couldn't find a single one to corroborate her story and then saying the mist Ramirez\nContacted a former yo classmates asking them if they were called the incident and told some of them that she could not be certain Mr cabinet was the one who exposed themselves which at that point tells me you know what are they investigating here if she's asking the other ... she's telling other people she doesn't\nKnow what are they investigated\nThe more shocking thing is even right and it's you know right before\nThis whole um ... most recent face exploded I think it was the morning on of the vote she actually her lawyer with telling people she's not even still share it with him she said why did he was in the room [laughter]\nI'm positive he adjusted his hands but everything that so but I but I Can't say for certain it hit it and so it's even after talking to her lawyers for six days to kind of work up\nA her memory that she didn't have when she initially talked to the to the New York New York or could they also said she couldn't say for sure he was there when they initially talked to her I mean ... they're even count as a credible allegation but you know what go for the FBI could talk to her\nAnd they'll they'll get their statement and I think if you look at the people out there\nThan I don't make any conclusions and they don't make any recommendations they'll just going to give very hand over the information\nThat's
