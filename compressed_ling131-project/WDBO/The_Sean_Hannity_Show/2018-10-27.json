{"month": "10", "state": "FL", "station": "WDBO", "content": "[noise] this is six point five ...\nWalking back to your nest egg with my collector of salmon wealth management I dug Harding and Phil Collins the song called sous to studio\n... more than a million Alva hundred million homes as a solo artist film Collins officially announced his retirement back\nIn two thousand and ten actually I'm going to tell more of a story here in a second but Mike that song is called sue sue studio and my joke is so do you know where that song was recorded\nI I Do not but night for like a guide to I just got set up by saying you totally got set up and it was All right I'm sue sue studios recorded in a studio studio studio oh God I'm terrible I Know see I mean I Love good terrible jokes and see\nGotta gotta put some laughter into into retirement and we uh we add the entertainment with you know music like Phil Collins and we transitioned that into retirement so Phil Collins recently told the host of Sunday night's\nThat he is back from retirements\nTime is it\nDo think about it you know\nI can be a good time to do this [noise] ... so does that\nWhat you're saying is a terrible or retirement I'm sad but it would silent\nI've changed on line [noise] I'm not as much\nI Would not want to retire either if I was a musician as successful has is you kind of miss the the glamour of the stage and\nYou know everybody know when you are and ah he so he is he's currently performing with is not dead yet to her so you know he's a different situation I mean it's not like somebody who's working in a factory that probably wants to retire and never on retired but do you have you know clients that have\nBeen retired like Phil Collins dead\nWell unfortunately Phil Collins is not my client\nAmazing I mean we're talking about I I I'm an as a child of the eighties you know I ... I was I'm right when he was doing all of his a lot of his best work you know it was like ten or twelve years old and you know I you you can remember\nThat time now in your life and that sort of music really started affecting you so he's fantastic and actually my wife and I have talked about ash if he ever is touring and we can just go see him we have to do that I ... I think it could change in the eighties I was an early enough\nFor shooting I wasn't old enough but at this point I Am so glad he's got a tour 'cause usually issues were only in England and you'd have to fly Ali over there and uh and they were sold out immediately but you know going back to just clients uh who on retiring like heat it ... it happens from time to time\nBut the great thing about retiring is you mentioned until ... when he gets to do what he wants to do and he loves it may be hard to walk away from it\nBut for most of our clients are individuals that I think retirement maybe just doesn't suit them and the sense that once you transition to retirement you got to figure out what to do with all of that time and not all of us have interests that are going to occupy a hundred percent over time I mean I I Know a lot of us like to go play golf laws like the fish was like to do\nX Y Z whatever your thing is you know it's your thing but but the flexibility to go do something you really want to do and you don't necessarily have to make a lot of money at it you just really like it I think those are the types of transitions that we see more than anything else he can go out and do exactly what he likes loves to do\nI Love putting together financial plans for individuals would they know hey listen\nI'm working because I Want to work in because I really really\nSo it's not because I have to and once you can show people that type of a a financial planning and that type of active management of their portfolio where they know hey okay I don't actually have to make money at this I'm just I get to have fun making money\nThat's great right and I enjoy it and our clients enjoy it and not everybody does it but I I I really like giving people that type of financial freedom\nFair enough if you want that to financial freedom and a ... come sit down with Mike and his team midtown wealth management they offer this Fifteen hundred dollar value it's a comprehensive\nFinancial plan and see if you want to retire or on retire and he deals with clients that are nearing retirement or already retired but maybe you need a little tweaking that plant or maybe you just need a a second opinion on your plan to comprehensive financial plan\nCalls for the next ten minutes and you can get involved in that the numbers for oh seven to seven zero one thousand four o seven to seven zero one thousand and always at guarding your nest egg dot com so we just talked about Phil Collins and are being ... retired getting back on the road making more music\nAnd there's something similar to this now that the NFL season is underway we noticed some lessons from the players that might also apply to those of us nearing retirement now former QB Danny Werfel says for him moving on from the game was a major transition\nMan well there's always uncertainty and that is so unnerving for all of us I think it's a\nIt's difficult it's risky I remember going off to college and when my parents drove away just that feeling there's this both us excitement this open this this freedom this newness and then there's this fear of of what might happen inside I say to the word that comes to my mind is to trust\nIs obviously you've got to do the things that you need to do\nBut you can't control things that we try to control so often or so I think to be open and receptive and trust any of that phase\nBut it also comes back to earlier principles that you think about is you know what you do today prepares you for tomorrow and I think making long term decisions investments in delayed gratification can put you in a position where when you make those transitions becoming a much better place\nWell you know in professional sports it's not if you're going to retire but it's when you're going to be retiring basically forced to retire and you kind of\nAnd before you really want to cause many players retire on their own in in professional sports not a whole lot of them do sir but unlike Phil Collins where he retired but he's not injured or anything like that and it can still do it he\nCan go back to whenever he wants but athletes don't have that luxury usually so\nThat's a huge transition for these athletes and a lot of them have issues with that to dealing with their new wife so how do you help people with that that can you know the biggest transition of their lives\nWhile the transition is really really good word for it because it's a huge change and what we find a week after week when we will meet with people and we'd go to this for a long time so I've known for a while but what\nPeople don't think about when they have to transition to retirement is is all the components that are required to transition into retirement so I talk about this too certainly when we're meeting with people in on the radio as individuals we can get pretty conditions to sort of our our normal way of life and what happens every day and\nYou know it's a simple is hey I wake up in the first thing I Want as a cup of coffee you know I mean that's just this conditioning we we we we need that we feel like we need that cup of coffee to get her day started or we need this or any of that to get her day started\nAnd what happens when we're working and and certainly there's there are things that happen in life we have families raise families we\nHave mortgages we have car payments we have health insurance we send kids to college and we we we do all of these things and all of those aspects cuts us really really busy for very long period of time\nAnd what I Know that people experience as they transition retirement is things change in its very quickly you know and it it's not overnight but it almost seems overnight and we all know life happens fast you know we try to figure out what he was on this whole year went by really really quickly will\nIt happens to when you're working your way to transition into retirement so people did all these things and they followed the rules\nAnd people that are that are retiring successfully today\nThey did that they pay down their mortgages they contributed to their four O. one K. is in there for three ... plans they were there were good stewards of their money and uh they they they did things right and they had um you know they they had diversified portfolios but\nBut suddenly the houses paid off or maybe almost paid off the kids are out of the house the\nThe four oh one K. or retirement plan you have through work is is up to a certain amount and now you're late fifties maybe sixties\nAnd you're going hey well now I'd like to stop going to work well if I stopped going to work the paycheck stop showing up right so the first question is\nWell where's that money and it come from do I have enough in my portfolio is it enough to last the rest of my life how long am I gonna live what's health insurance going to cost me what you know is the market going to crash all these questions and that that happened\nThat are all associate with transitioning from acid accumulation to asset preservation and distribution\nAnd so it's really dug up I mean that's where we come in we sit down with individuals to answer those questions and we help them with that transition from asset accumulation and getting things paid off\nTo ask for preservation distribution and if you want to come sit down with us and get that analysis and comprehensive financial plan those are the types of things that it's going to answer is going to answer those questions how do you make the transition and how do you do it successfully and if we define success as preserving your assets and living off of them for the rest of your life\nThan we can help you do that and if you're on a track we can get you on track so give us a call the next ten minutes if you'd like to come sit down and what does that comprehensive financial plan for you complimentary\nKnow I had a guy a stop at a shop this last week seems we'd had a new radiator installed at a local day or a car had thirty nine thousand miles on it uh but uh the correct radiator wasn't covered in his power train warranty\nSo he wound up spending over twelve hundred dollars on a new radiator that we could have actually replace for four hundred bucks now\nI asked him I said well why didn't you bring it to us his reply was he didn't want to avoid it just want to [laughter] like listen folks understand\nIf you buy a new vehicle and you never return to the dealer for anything they can not Voyager warranty\nWhether you or another shop has performed

her on the show today but we do have seven open lines and the sooner you call in like Larry said the sooner you will get on aid for for two two zero zero nine six five is that number again aid for for\nTwo two zero zero nine six five in the meantime we're going to talk with Gilbert Gilbert got a two thousand eight the three hundred Gilbert welcome to the show what's your question for Larry Perry\n[noise] tire quickly Lewis power seemed to be on about twenty five percent hour and then if I have to put aside their old turn off the engine least artist and everything is like to know the\nLast couple of weeks [noise]\nOkay now when you accelerate Gilbert does it feel like it that the engine is miss firing\n[noise] it's just it's just really five dollar circles as I can say that\nFast but if I if you have to overtake or you're trying to get out of trouble and you put your foot down very quickly and um it just seems to lose the power you have a car or less I managed to get its decided to turn off and it starts with a ... square one\nStudy of art and now have you okay have you had the systems scanned just to see what codes were stored in it\n[noise] Adler saying Israel could two or three times or a seat is under and they can't see any [noise]\nNow when when you accelerate now you're telling me that it just feel sluggish and it doesn't have all of its power you ... you know what I'm when I ask you does it feel like a miss fire it's nuts stuttering or anything it just feels like it has no power [noise]\nIt seems like you've just lost all our\nOur uh [noise] ... let me let me kind of throw something out there to you like this and this is you know we're talking about something that's intermittent here you know what I'm saying it's not doing it all the time um so when you got a situation like that one of the things that kind of comes to mind with me\nIs your throttle body on your vehicle is electronic and what will happen is is if you know it's just an electric motor that opens and closes the throttle that allows a year to come into the engine\nAnd if that electronic throttle body was to be in a situation to where\nYou know it's worn or something like that or if there is a situation where a it it's just not getting the correct signal when you accelerate it may not be opening correctly especially when you accelerate quickly\nUh you know something along those lines is is what I Would start looking at a first especially if you're in a situation where it doesn't do it all the time and you don't really have any coats the word it sounds like you've got an intermittent a electronic throttle body issue\nNow that could be from a couple of different things that could be a war and throw auto body you know it's just an electric motor over time it's going to wear out um there is also a a sensor on your accelerator pedal and\nWhat will wind up happening is if that censor gets wire on it or if it doesn't\nGet a good connection when you push them and the pedal\nA the electronic throttle body won't get the correct signal and what will happen is you'll either have a dead spot or a it'll kind of go into a limb mode situation where it won't accelerate fully\nUh so what I Would probably suggest ... in what I Would do I put a scan tool on it\nAnd then I Would sit there and I look at the throttle position sensor and I would with a key on I Would accelerate and these civil rights movement accelerator pedal up and down and then I Would you know celebrate real quickly uh a few times and watch and see what the voltage on the throttle position sensors doing\nAnd you can also look at the actual electronic throttle body to see what position it's at and see if we have a correlation issue there at that way you could find out whether it's the pedal censor or maybe the electronic throttle body itself has got a problem but\nSomething along those lines I Believe is what you're probably going to be dealing with because\n... and and this would be considered an intermittent it should have set a code for it as well but in a situation like this\nThat's what I Would go after and I would start checking the throttle body system there the the accelerator pedal a cause it's got like a potentially Ahmed are built into it and the electronic throttle body itself those are the two things that you need to start\nWith first All right does that answer your question their Gilbert\n[laughter] so I think they'll be getting used to that because the French to me\n[noise] type ...\nYou have a great weekend Gilbert\nGilbert when you do want to go and check out the shop is located at fourteen thirty to the road and where will gladly take your car in there and fix that problem for you won four three two Lee wrote a piano\nThrow off

you got ... got the answers for you let's go ahead and talk with Steven ... welcome onto the show what's your question\nAh thanks thanks for taking my call her a stay at home I've got a\nTwo thousand six Cadillac us our exit um we recently got\nAnd that's been running the recommended mobile ... W thirty of the week and I run everything on ... hours including and um I Want to switch to an oil and I'm Wondering if I could go up to a chance for you which is what I use that money on the civic Mm\n[noise] yeah I mean I don't [noise] you know that this is Steve this is where I have to be careful uh I\nSee I Will I Will fight and argue with the manufacturers and the dealers in the service riders all day long about you know taking a vehicle that let's say for an example that was a\n... to run like a zero twenty or a five twenty you know I I'll go head to head with 'em all day long and I'll say you know listen there's no reason in a world where they can't go to a zero thirty\nThere because what what it is they'll have the same cold low poor point\nThat was actually um that the manufacturer EPA or whoever wanted him to run you know these really low colds poor planning oils I don't have a problem with that but we got to have something to keep parts separated at normal operating temperature\nAnd that's the reason that like the zero thirty so much because I can replace just about any oil on the planet with animals zero W thirty\nNow when you start going up and ... Cole Porter point this is what happens when you start going from a zero to the fives in the ten W thirties and stuff like that you got to stick or coal poor point and those oils don't travel or exhaust as quickly\nAnd what will wind up happening is you can have unintended a variable camp timing get Vance during cold drive a build the cause problems\nUm and that's the reason that I don't really go up and Cole Porter points uh you know if you go from a zero twenty to his ear oh thirty your coat poor points are going to be the same you're going to have a very low drag well bumped drag when it's cold\nBut you're going to have a little more ... actually thirty three percent more injured protection and normal operating temperature\nIn your case is zero thirty is is really an ideal oil to accomplish everything that you want um can you go to attend thirty are at ten forty and and maybe not have any\nAdverse effects why probably\nBut as far as a recommendation from me I Know how these variable camp timing systems work they have selling the lights and you've got to basically exhaust oil through the systems and know picture this if there is a big difference in what you can get away with your in central Florida as opposed to\nYou know Anchorage, Alaska you're ... you know these oils will [noise] you know you could get by with you know higher ... uh ...\nUh you know when you're in Seventy to Ninety degree weather as opposed to minus forty so to speak so you know in these oils are all once one state fits all you know when they when they make these specifications or one country fits all which\nI think we got to take a little more precaution as far as anti protection goes emphasis gusts these when we're dealing with central Florida it's hot down here\nEven when it's not hot oil that's got a pretty good job ahead of it\nSo in your case you know as a zero thirty I don't think you really need to exceed that I don't think you really need to go any further with it can you run a ten forty I think you'd be fine with it you know considering it's Florida but if you go up north way that you could have some cold arrive ability problems also seen as you've got a trainee service on here's will\nDrop the pan changed the filter\nPut the a ... a ... in your case\nThat's probably going to use the uh eighty oh the ... a ... fluid and your transmission but\nThat'll get jams old and I think you'll be fine I just like I said me personally I'd go with the zero thirty if you go with a ten forty or whatever you're probably not going to have a problem but just because of the way my mechanical mind works\nZero thirty was probably what I'd go with\nTheir Hugo alright Dale in Mount Dora we've got about two minutes to spend with you here if we can get everything answered well hold you on over to the break wants to go ahead and ask a question for Larry Perry well come on to the show\nAnd portrayed show thank you\nI got a two thousand three Honda Odyssey ah two hundred and twenty thousand miles on it a about a week ago a boat coat on the way to work in the sluggish missed fiery so I\nRan the code after work and got an e G R A chain Gigi our code and also enormous fire on\nTwo four and five so I I took the um the a\nCover up the manifold that it has a nice little hatched there he can get the everything and it was pretty carbon now than I cleaned all that took the ... off a blew out the holes and you know made it so the air but I still got the once I put it back together still got the same code\nUm so I went ahead and change the G our vowels and got all brand new on there and I'm Still catching ...\nCode to four or five random\nDale what what you what you might be getting into and this has come and see this all the time you know we don't hardly none of these newer engines use e G are valves\nAnd there is a good reason for the reason for it being is is that\nYou get carbon in the tubes that run up from the exhaust up into the ... and once you get this carbon starting to deteriorate and break away what happens is a little particles will start getting into the newly ... valve and starts causing it to stick open\nUm so you know this this might be a situation where you had to pull at age ... valve off and actually do several you know try to blow that system outlook compressed air several times before you get the code actually go away it's just carbon floating around in there and that's causing you this repetitive problem\nOur number two on the way that you're listening to the magic mechanic show right here on news than a six point five WBFO [noise]\nThis is news Ninety six point five happening we turn first for breaking news\nNews Ninety six point five to ... our top story officials in Pittsburgh say it's a horrific crime scene after a mass shooting at a synagogue and there's no active threats\nWe've had a tragedy here but I worked for the first responders probably prevented from becoming much more fragile than what it is seen as very bad side of drama there are multiple fatalities during\nA Notre situation too is I had a gentleman that had sent me a handwritten letter his name is Ken is um he\nA kind of in dispose so to speak and he was asking about his mother's car\nA chemist I Hope you're listening I I Do want to mention\nA your mother had called us um and discussed the problem that she was having with her vehicle but she never brought it to magic mechanic you know I don't know where they're maybe she took it to another shop or something like that\nBut the the the question that you were asking me\nYeah uh no that does not apply we we never had her car in magic mechanic so uh if she would like she can still bring an end and we'd be more than glad to diagnose it and see what's going on and I do agree with what you've written a letter it does sound like that she may have a tune up problem I Hope that\nHope that put your mind at ease I Know you're not here to help her but we will if we can All right\nAll right good stuff there Larry back to the phone lines we go to ed in Melbourne welcome onto the show you're going to kick off the second hour what's your question for Larry Perry [noise]\nI actually got to if you have time for both of those at first it was about Nineteen Ninety six forward at fifty three\nCommercial trucks and the windshield wipers quit work in the windshield wipers circuit it's not a mechanical problem I've determined that uh but the windshield wiper a circuit as the windshield wiper motor\nThere instead of a series there's a a a automatically resettle a circuit breaker and let's use box and\nThen there's the switch you know that has all like a dozen different rates of a of a white they are going into the motor there's a four part pluck and one of them is definitely ... one of those problems\nBut I don't understand why it's got a four part plug and how I can determine whether lots of problems and the motor and the switch or a or in the er or in the I'm a circuit breaker\nYeah now ... is the motor coming on at all [noise] ah you know so the wipers aren't working at all but you do have ... votes going to the monitor\nOn one of those tens that's correct when the when it's turned on and when it stops you know it didn't just stop and made it stopped\nAnd it would cut a it would stop\nHalfway and then it would move some more and then it would stop again and then maybe it moves more but then it just ... you know after a few miles down the road and just quick completely\nOkay I'm I'm thinking it's probably the motor itself but now that Ted we know what it takes to make an electric motor Ron right we got to have the twelve votes and we got to have ground right\nCorrect\nThat you know how to check that plug it goes to the motor to see if you're getting ground there\nYeah I can do that you know I don't know which candidate should be if you have four\nCat Ted I Can't tell you either off the top of my head on under six van but let's look at it like this what we know that we've got to have power in ground to make that motor work so we're going to turn the ignition on turn to turn the wipers the high uh and then take your tests like instead of looking at to the ground hook it to the positive side of the battery\nAnd then with with that on just go in there and pro ball for a of your wires go into that mode or\nOne of them should be a ground you know and if you've got a ground that lights up that test flight\nUm and you and you've got one that's got twelve o power on it positive power\n... then you know what I don't you know we're we're talking about which position it should be at you know when the and the plug but I Would that would be enough for me if I if I've got power in ground at that\nA plug where it goes into the motor\nI I Would I Would go and put another a whopper motor on it at that point now and then another thing you can do to is if you're just trying to get a you know a good feel for this for you going to spend any money on it\nIf you've got power in ground there and the motors not work and maybe take a rubber mallet or something and just kind of tap on that wiper motor if it takes off and start work and then listen we know that's one war we've already one gives you a ... year old motor probably got some ... brushes that you know\nAre going back to Ninety six that's an old when they're so let's just check for ground let's make sure we got grown there too if we do we got power in ground there is probably a whopper motor I Would I'd feel comfortable and making that assessment\nOh I'm moving right along here we are going to go to Eunice in Kissimmee Eunice if by parents that are on I Apologize well come on to the show what's your question for Larry Perry\nThanks for taking my call I appreciate it thank you very much you're a\n... my question is I just got my wife and your car um exercise may change can Marie I'm eligible for asylum is of course um he comes when the ... the um like a regular\nYou know like a change oil change and stuff but something caught my eye and I'm kinda I'm skeptical\nZero ... is it the zero sixteen oil\nNo I think is the zero ...\nOkay I I think it's the zero six team yeah that's what that's what we'll just go on to 'em they're they're they're starting to use that sixty\nWay oil we were talking about that earlier on in the ... yeah I'm like\nYou know uh yeah this is the key to it and you're not the ... you're not the only one I have probably had three emails that magic mechanic dot com over the last week or so the same thing you know Toyotas go into these how low can you go on ... and and this is going to\nYou know oil limbo yeah its oil limbo how low can you go and you know what\nI I Know that they want to run the center of oils because it makes the engine get better fuel economy you know and in less exhausted missions during cold start\nBut at what cost you know we're talking about a Toyota were telling us of a ton of vehicles that's got just an incredible dependability a factor that goes along with him\nAnd what do we do when we get that kind of a reputation we're\nGoing to rule on it you know just by trying to use these ultra thin oils and and you know what the consumers eventually going to wind up paying for it you know a hundred thousand miles have engines consuming oil lower in extreme or where I\nWouldn't you know me you know me I Would go with zero\nBut I Would probably be a zero thirty there you go another good question\nThere a chance to kind of rekindle that talk earlier that we were having a remote oil Anchorage, Alaska Detroit Michigan Canada oh the island yeah you've got a different environment you know use those than oil up there but here in central Florida\nYou're just playing Russian roulette with your motor you know and and and then it can only survive with these than oils\nFor for just a so long and then eventually it's going to take a toll on him and you hate to see somebody ... ... well if you know better\nYou know better you know and I know that when people when I'm when a when a dealer\nManufactured tells you something you want to believe that people do they want they want to believe that they're getting the best advice there is\nYou know but when it comes to deliver occasion here in central Florida we're dealing with a different animal than they are in these colder climates where I got we got a given lubrication a lot more than they are going to take the word for whoever they go to whatever shop whatever ... they might not know why this is the guy's first day\nAt work in a Toyota but he knows enough to convince that Cohn simmer they're like well I Know he works there yeah mom you know we work like that unfortunately\nAid for for two two zero zero nine six five if you've got a question for Larry Stevie Ted build shake up an Adam hang on don't worry we are going to get us to show rolls on here you listen to the magic mechanic show right here and he was only six point five WTO time now for the three big things you need to know [noise]\nMass shooting in a synagogue and Pittsburgh it's a very\nHorrific crimes can run of the worst that I've said\nYesterday I taking over the investigation because it's being considered a hate crime\nPolice are not revealing the exact number of the Taliban but say six police officers were injured in a suspected\nThat you may not like when you took it back they may have actually fix the oil leak but there's so much residual oil all over the motor because they probably didn't take the time to clean it all up\nThat you've got drips and everything still taking place but it it the cars got to go either you take it to the dealer bring it to a magic mechanic or find you a good independent shop you know in your area\nBut one of the three you got to do and let and get it diagnosed to find out if you still have the oil leak number one\nNumber to get all this will mess cleaned up you're injured apartment everything under meat though there's got to be cleaned up or you're going to have drips going on from now on\nThat vehicle uses a an oil cart or a filter Carter each time the system and a lot of times they use these plastic caps that you know seal up the wall filter cartridge\nAnd what's most likely happen either they over tightening cracks the plastic cap or either they didn't get the o ring on correctly or something along those lines the first time they changed the oil when you took it back they probably\nFix the the the oil cap or whatever [noise] hopefully they did and then you left in of course\nYou still got an issue because of residual oil still dripping all over the place\nBut but you need to you need you got to get this thing fixed one hundred percent Walmart is not the place you taking it back to this town the only time you're gonna go back to Walmart is if you have a labor in parts claim\nA for whatever you've got to do to get this repaired and you know it's going to have to be a figure it out from a\n... I was ... [laughter] but you're going to need to take it to a professional services center there's no question about it\nGet it cleaned up make sure the oil leaks fixed and then whatever the cost is is what you're going to have to go back and Brazil Wal Mart with you get reimbursed that's just out what's going to work we wish you luck good luck\nWith that one aid for for two two zero zero nine six five just won't open line now they fill up quick aid for for two two zero zero nine to five reminder magic show brought to par fire Leno audio upholstery does the interior of your car looked like the mall by grizzly bear\nNot good you don't want to look like that you want to get that ... there were Leno auto poetry dot com that is really into auto upholstery dot com or your calls after the latest news weather and traffic here listen to the magic mechanic show on news Ninety six point five double ...

[noise]\nAre you there going once\nThat going twice All right we're going to move right along marks in Virginia well come on to the magic mechanic so what is your question for Larry Perry\nShow or in your area here in South central Virginia\nBrought all five eighty five about twelve miles north of North Carolina border you said you're from West Virginia I get water or were you born in West Virginia I was born in mango catty about Seventy miles north of Bluefield on us fifty to about the sixty seven years ago\nI was wondering what your for all of their uh well I'm actually from the Huntington\nArea uh where uh Huntington West Virginia Chesapeake, Ohio in Ashland, Kentucky kind of all joined together we're a little bit out in out in the country uh when Wang from Wayne County so yeah we've that's where that's where most stopping ground is is a Wayne County West Virginia\nNo right there you go I Love it when we get calls from out of state that's how far reach you got to hear Larry mark calling from Virginia all rights do in winter haven will come out of the show what's your question briefly\nI have a two thousand eleven GMC you could get a vibration upon acceleration get you off the solar goes away accelerate\nVibrates again kind of like a chatter committed to deal with the dealer recommended [noise] uh we close I'd ask if you know maybe a flush yourself an aunt that would help cure it will be no\nAh do you have the problem on light acceleration stew\nYes\nOkay so you got it on hard acceleration an allied acceleration\nNo it's it's more laws light acceleration hit it hard you don't feel it as much\nOkay uh [noise] on you know I I I'm not going to condemn the transmission there's there's there's too many other things there I ... you know has anybody pulled the draft shift out of this thing and physically checked the universal joints\nOr not to my knowledge no it's something that started about six months ago and it just as progressive we got course\nYeah I I you know most of the time the only thing in your transmission is going to causes issue is if there is a planetary unit that's going bad\nI ... and you know they usually hold up pretty good in those transmissions I think you've more got you know me when I got a customer bringing a problem like this it's usually you joined related um you know I I really hate to see you you know replace the transmission of because of\nAn issue like this I Would definitely recommend the draft shift come out of the thing in me I Would have to physically put my hand on all the huge joints\nA ... and the you know to condemn the ... before I Would condemn the transmission that's usually not the transmission is usually not what causes a drop line vibration it's usually in the drought shift\nAll right Matt in Deland with the two thousand sixteen closer to hundred what's your question from Larry Perry Hi Larry\nI get the point sixteen Chrysler two hundred the\nTwenty thousand miles just bought a used um between thirty and forty miles an hour or accelerate take my foot off the gap every once in a while there is a hard ... hard shift\nAnd at a Chrysler dealer told me it was a software issue I'm\n... and they updated software and they and it keeps going it doesn't happen often but it just\nDoesn't feel right [noise] um and I ... and it doesn't happen all the time it happens every once in awhile variance or mittens and um I used to be if they say is either I Know a car supposed to feel it just doesn't feel right and I thought maybe there's some history with that\nUh you know I cannot tell you that I have actually had the the problem um you know for this particular car brought to me um I I Will tell you this there is a a drive train\nA control module re flash for this vehicle uh it does not tell me exactly what for 'em but it is a drive line issue a vibration complains that sort of thing\nAh you know it it's it's one of those things Matt to wear\nA you know Chrysler stating that a reflex should take care of it um you know when it comes to this sometimes you know the one dealer may have dropped the ball never got it flashed correctly or something along those lines\nIf if they haven't been able to get the get it worked out you may want to try going to another day or a lot of times when it comes to these re flashes are these technical service building issues or if one dealer doesn't get the problem resolve it may be in your best interest to try another one\nAll right Charles in Orlando you are going to close out the show today what's your question briefly for Larry Perry\nUm I got up to those five ... and uh when I go to ... as far as the kicks it back out and then I got a call but then they're real slow and then it cuts off the tank for and I know it's not cool\nYeah Charles what you're dealing with there is a fuel and evaporative fuel venting issue the tanks not venting whenever you shut the key off\nThat tell you to use the crosswalk when crossing the street isn't that doesn't make sense doesn't it make sense it's pretty sad you know I'm you know I hate to say this but I think ... leads the country and running over people that know walking across walks and even if you're walking across walks doesn't guarantee that someone doesn't not pay attention\nAnd a hit you while you're in across you know so please people used to cross walks we have a public service dot commercials out today that talk about using the crosswalk\nThey're smart walk a couple of the thing is don't be lazy you know most people park up by the front of the store to get close to the store understood I park as far away from the stores no one has my truck\nAnd it works at my truck fourteen much not being in it but I'll probably leave here today and Larry might open a trucking his door might think much of you know he's got a guy that could fix that thing in my truck real easy without having to take it apart and repaying that so\nI'm just not become complacent we just didn't want more public service announcement that would go out as says drivers if you're not a keeping up with the pace move over to the right that left wing not yours and doesn't have your name in it so tropical move locks boats ... a lot smoother and we'd have a lot less accidents on the road and of course less\nRoute a road rage All right so we're back which is a poll showed think about what sort of the other kind of cool stuff but like I had a customer comedy albums yesterday my wife has worked in my office for about twenty six or twenty seven year she's ... routinely knowledgeable about swimming pools what\nI mean extremely knowledgeable about swimming pools I just gave her a little stick drawing in and she'll designer\nShe will figure the entire project out knowing what needs to be non pump sizes filter sizes where the returns go never dispute us on lighting because it's she has got this lighting down to a science especially these amazing hey word um color logic swimming pool lights\nCustomer calls yesterday and said I Want to I bought some stain\nSome stain for my pool deck okay and the lady goes well I don't know if I can use is on my pool deck and Tina says what kind of pulled back to you have she says I don't know she says take a picture of an tests to me I Can't ... flip phone\nAll right so go on and on and on and it gives her number she sent it to her and she ... in the meantime my wife is during the late ... with the ... she's looking online thirty minutes of my wife's time yesterday thirty minutes of my wife's time to figure out what this lady want to do what the stain what's come to find out it was it was concrete staying\nWhat kind of do I have well ask Tony Tony can't see your deck from where I'm at the only way I can tell you what it is is to look at the product itself so either you have a concrete back or you have a paper decorate ...\nYou're not going to stain or seal a with a color ceiling a brick paper you're not going to do that to ... but you can do that to what we call a spray acrylic deck\nThe reason we called her spray of ... that gets a concrete deck with the texture on top and we use and acrylic paint if that's the debt that you have\nYou can use that ... that's what it's called it's made for pulled back it it sounds like a stain like you're going to stay in the piece of wood yeah it's not quite like that it's actually paint what we call it again\nYou know acrylics Taylor and I'm so in the future when my wife talk to you about a product or she says you have a country that you believe her you don't need to ask Tony she's really good at what she does\nShe look the only thing she hasn't actually known as ... you know formed the pull up and dig the whole she knows exactly how to build a swimming pool after all these years collectively between her and I we have right about sixty five years sixty is that right sixty five years\nI heard I have about sixty five or sixty six years this trade pretty good at what we do so when Tina describes something to you or it tells you what you need to do do believe her yeah she's good at it so it might say be some time and I realized that if you have questions don't hesitate calling radio show I'll answer your question I have no issues\nAnswering the question is what is hard for me to do is to tell you what you have at your house if you can't kind of describe what I Need to know right if you describe what I Need to know I can pretty much animate thing what you do I I can spout heartless is far less stuff like that I can do that product manufacturers to I can do that\nNow we're talking to my service guy yesterday\nAnd I'm not trying to drilling but I said the more you um research by the way\nWhat you do on the air between you and Patrick and chase over there if you guys want to learn something about what you're currently doing today and the rate in the studio you could look it up yeah you can go back and check on someone's history see what they did how they did it or if you're not familiar with somebody you could look it up it's available on the Internet\nIs what someone's swimming pool yeah oh yeah it's available on the Internet and here's a fairly
