arm hanging off from an accident please don't take me to a chiropractor\nConfident investors of a much easier time staying committed to their plan if they know it's a good plan\nAnd this type of volatility doesn't bother them a lot but but I think it takes communication and I think you need it you need a written plan you need to actually be able to see visually\nWhat your portfolio does when markets are up but also what your portfolio does when markets her down and understand that you have a plan to to help navigate that so for all of our clients\nWe have very very specific strategies that we use we explain those strategies to our clients and for people who don't work with us who want to come in and sit down and and do some analysis in a comprehensive financial plan\nWe literally do that analysis for them showing them what their portfolio is likely to do you know markets are up this is what you're likely to do with markets for Dallas is what you're likely to do if markets crash\nThis is you know the amount you could expect to lose the markets rallied this is the amount you could expect to make me once you have that kind of data and you're in\nInvestor he can make better decisions moving forward the other piece of that is we work almost exclusively with individuals that are either retired or very close to retirement so they're going to think about things a little bit differently chances are you're not one hundred percent invested in equities if retirements around the corner for you right\nAnd you need to understand your portfolio from the equity exposure you had with stocks but also what about bombs right I mean I think we're moving into a bear market with bonds bonds I don't think are likely to do well for a while so\nYou know this idea of just holding bonds or bond funds could be problematic moving forward all these things go into financial planning\nAnd it's about understanding what you have understanding how to make your portfolio is efficient as it can be so how do you make sure you're getting the highest rate of return you can with the least amount of risk those are the types of questions that we answer every day when we sit down with individuals and do analysis and financial planning\nSo if you'd like that kind of information about your portfolio or you just don't feel really confident in what you're currently doing if you want to come sit down with us we'll put together a truly comprehensive financial plan for where we'll give you all that data and then also in analysis of your current portfolio\nWe'll put that plant in your hands complimentary if you give us a call and the next ten minutes\nAlready see comprehensive financial planning kind of see where you stand with your portfolio\nAnd you know give you that confidence in your portfolio as you're approaching retirement or even if you are in retirement as we speak they comprehensive financial planning a Fifteen hundred dollar value call within the next ten minutes the numbers for oh seven to seven zero one thousand\nOr oh seven to seven zero one thousand and it was always to add guarding your nest egg dot com Mike I watch a lot of TV because I Do that at night when I get home from work and after exercise and I just kind of want to relax and\nA number of times I've come across these commercials or they're kind of commercials what they're more like endorsements of celebrities who's are trying to give you financial advice and here's one I'm Alex for back Pat Boone hair on Henry\nAnd I'm here to tell homeowners that are fixing to an older about a great way to live a better time\nOkay I'm a I'm listening funds\nGive me financial advice and now it's true that can always say what is the number you know so I mean how do we deal with this and how do we get our clients get clients to ah you know kind of way through all this financial messages and that we see and hear every day\nEver shall I those commercials always made me kind of sad\nBecause it makes me worry about the Fonz like him in like ... but I also I Can't knock it because he probably got pay a lot of money do almost nothing right and he figured why not so here's the problem with it I don't blame those guys out for going out and and and making a buck when it's that easy to make\nBut the one that bothers me the most is gold rank are precious metals so the ones out there doing doing the gold commercials or the silver commercials\nThey're making statements and making comments and and obviously they they probably don't know I mean they're just the spokes person but there are a lot of people that see those commercials and take that stuff the heart and they honestly start to believe that physical gold is the only way that you can protect yourself against um market crashes and hyperinflation and all that\nAnd and the reality is well a that's not true you could just go out and and I'm\nOn I'm a gold ATF or something like that and avoid all of that but also what what's not being told to individuals and that commercial is there's not a lot of disclosure and what's interesting is there's a precious metals when it's in currency form\nBypasses a lot of regulation as far as disclosure goes\nAnd that's the reason we see all those commercials is a there is a very very old law and the books that says if its currency is not regulated in the same way that other security should be regulated just to summarize and so because it's not regulated we get a lot of these statements that aren't necessarily even true because it's not being regulated\nAnd then also they're not telling you that well if you call up and you buy that gold you're going to pay a premium for it to your paying way more than the actual cost of gold or silver is\nAnd then they're going to charge you a storage fees you got to put the stuff somewhere and then if you ever want to get your money back out of it well they're gonna charge you for you to buy back from you as well so the reality is I don't see it as a very good investment because it's going to cost you every step of the way you're paying something either to buy and sell it or store\nAnd you could honestly just go out into the market and buy an ATF that would do exactly the same thing\nSo that bothers me about that but it but again this just goes about understanding all of your investment options how they work with the advantages and disadvantages are and building at a at a diversified portfolio but I think also actively managed and we do actively managed portfolios\nWhat that means is we're not going to leave our clients and stocks structure likely to do horribly mean just doesn't make sense or going to make some changes on our clients behalf\nIf markets are likely to do really well we're going to help our clients my actively buying more equity positions getting more aggressive\nThe reality is understanding your portfolio and I also think work with a fiduciary ... advisor that has your best interests at heart will get a lot of people in every week Doug that just want to find out more about what we do and how we do it and what it means to work with a an advisor that uses active management and that is a fiduciary\nAnd I say if you're that person and you just want to know more about us and what we do just give us a call the next ten minutes and we'll sit down for that complimentary analysis in financial plan\nI think I'll take your advice over the funds is advice Mike so I don't know he\nBelieves those financial commercials as kind of just entertainment take it\nTake it a as you will at face value so the comprehensive financial plan a Fifteen hundred dollar value coming to sit down with making his team Italian wealth management call within the next ten minutes\nAnd that is

importance of considering that tax ramifications when building your retirement strategy and also going back to Nineteen Seventy seven for here from Paul Simon that is all happening next right here on

Georgia three around one eight nine four zero four eighty nine eight seven three we're\nNow\nLooking back to the guardian yesterday with Michael I sort of common wealth management I'm ... and\nHave to admit I used to love that show my three's company\nChristie she was the original on that one of the original three on the show she played a when I was Suzanne Somers and she turned Seventy two this week I Can't believe it that she's that old but there's something kind of interesting about what is\nGoing on or what went on behind that show is that she left the show\nBecause she wanted an increase in pay from thirty thousand dollars a year to a hundred and fifty thousand dollars per episode that was John Ritter salary that time as well as ten percent of their shows profits now ABC was only offering a five thousand dollar pay raise and I'm thinking\nYou know that show debuted one in the late seventies early eighties and thirty thousand bucks an episode that was some\nPretty good money way back then\nI'll listen to the difference between thirty thousand a hundred and fifty thousand that's a big deal right we talked about this little bit before the show I mean nothing against her and I get it I think if I was her I Would have asked for it as well\nBut John was the talent I mean on the show does that mean does that make sense I mean she was good I guess okay I mean I don't know what you do you think she made more money off of three's company refined master\nThat's what I was trying to think of it was it was going through my head of what was that can trash and she was I Would put money on my bed she made more off master\nI should have been more thigh master yeah I mean I you know her part was important but I mean he carried the show and he got paid for it so I don't know and uh they probably didn't I don't like Michigan thigh master it is what it is\nBut more people probably remember her from the thigh master than they actually do from three's company and I I see that in there is some movies that the master will come up and people will be using in kind of spoofing on that too so\nMore than uh the three's company does\nYeah for sure I still like the show even though it doesn't really hold up\nAs it once did way back then 'cause there was a lot more controversial way back then but we can go into TV shows all the time we are talking about retirement here that's what the show was all about guarding your nest egg with my class or get in touch with him and his team anytime at four O. seven to seven zero one thousand and as always add guarding your nest egg dot com [noise]\nAll right so Mike one reason that people put off talking to a financial advisor\nIs that they're not sure what questions to ask now advisor mark timber John I talk to parents and he gave a few suggestions why\nAsk the questions what will happen to me if something happens to you\nSo we need to be thinking about uh whether or not the advisors working within a team what's the continuity or a succession plan with that advisor to give me advice\nIf you're trying to make a connection with a trusted individual what are the elements that are important to you so one of the things for clients to be considering is whether they're working with a professional seller a broker\nOr professional buyer an advisor and that's a good filter to be thinking about what kind of relationship you want to have\nAll right there's another financial advisor but I'll I'll take your your word as a as as golden here so what do you think about that and what he said to do you have anything else to add about\nI mean first of all ... I mean there are lots of great financial advisors out there in a there are way more people that need help then there are financial advisors so I mean the first\nTrick to this uh being successful in retirement and uh I think being comfortable and confident retirement is is is finding your person finding the right financial advisor\nSo I'd be the first one to give credit where credit's due I I like the way that he frame that uh are you working with a professional seller or professional buyer I think that's that's pretty neat now I talked about it a little earlier when I when I mentioned um I said it differently but I said\nYou know are you working with an advisor that's a fiduciary or are you working with somebody that's a broker and broke her son to sell products and they'd sell products because they are they get commissions on products now I realize there's probably brokers listening right now they're like oh you know your ear\n[laughter] why are you bashing on us and I'm I'm not it's not that there is no place for that I mean there are certain investments out there\nThat are going to be appropriate for individuals and the only form that those investments come in is is brokerage form so I'm not hitting it that hard but if you're working with an advisor that's only going to promote those types of investments I think that's a problem so I I liked the way that he he framed that\nHe mentioned a couple of things like are are you working with a team or you're working with just one person that's a good point so again there are a lot of great financial advisors out there but\nWhen you were investing the money that you've accumulated right over a twenty\nThirty forty year period of time and that's your life savings\nYou have to make sure it's protected and you have to know God Forbid something happens to your financial advisor what happens then mhm it's a perfectly legitimate question and you should be asking if you have an asteroid advisor that ask them that question so our answer is we have a big team here at ... management\nI'm forty four years old I relatively healthy I have four kids at home and you know so my wife and I certainly hope that nothing ever happens to me\nBut that's not a guarantee and so for all of our clients are there is a plan for that right we have lots of advisors worker at town hall management and then there's also a succession plants are all of our clients are taking care of whether I'm here or not\nBut if you're working with an advisor that doesn't have that\nYou know maybe it's just just one person and a little bit smaller outfit\nDoesn't mean they don't have a plan dog but I Would ask them right and I would want to know what the plane that say if something happens to you clearly you don't have a whole team of people around you it's it's you and your sister or what have you and that's fine I like that sort of close personal warm relationship\nBut you need to know who you would contact God Forbid something happens the visor that's a big deal so you know what their succession plan is you know the\nTeam part of it you know Hey Mike ... that's interesting you brought that up because they'll last meeting I had with my advisor he and I were talking and he said I almost died\nOf like a month ago and I was like what what was going on and he's younger than I Am I'm In my forties and he's he's younger than I Am\nAnd he had some some blood caught issues and it was I couldn't believe it he 'cause he's so young\nAnd then right would you just said is what happens next what do I do too I I mean I trust this guy do I how am I going to find somebody else to trust so it really got me thinking and you kind of brought that back up in my mind of\nOf bringing that up yeah ... it's\nA big part of it I mean and it's a um it's a legitimate question and you need to get an answer it because\nIt's your money you spent a long time saving it you're either looking to transition to retirement or you're currently retired and regardless you need to know what the plant as an advisor to provide that you know they and then they also need to obviously provide great service than be accessible to you\nAnd again we believe in actively managed portfolios right so so active management of portfolios I think the key I don't like hang in there hanging there might work while you're accumulating assets I don't think it works when you transition into retirement\nNobody wants to hang in there for the next market crashed in like a good relationship on\nYou know I think a lot of people we get the opportunity to to talk to them here on the radio and the people just want to know more about what we do and how we do it which is why we extended an invitation on the show all the time just say hey listen if you want to know more about us what we do how we do it\nBut the great thing about retiring is you mentioned till ... he gets to do what he wants to do when he loves it may be hard to walk away from it\nBut for most of our clients are individuals that I think retirement maybe just doesn't suit them in a sense that once you transition to retirement you got to figure out what to do with all of that time and all of us have interests that are going to occupy a hundred percent over time I mean I I Know a lot of us like to go play golf laws like the fish laws like to do\nX Y Z whatever your thing is you know it's your thing but but the flexibility to go do something you really want to do\nAnd you don't necessarily have to make a lot of money at it you just really like it I think those are the types of transitions that we see more than anything else he can go out and do exactly what he likes and loves to do I love putting together financial plans for individuals would they know hey listen\nI'm working because I Want to work because I really really enjoy this not because I have to and once you can show people that type of a a financial planning and that type of active management of their portfolio where they know hey okay I don't actually have to make money at this I'm just I get to have fun making money\nThat is great right and I enjoy it and our clients enjoy it and not everybody does it but I I I really like giving people that type of financial freedom\nFair enough Mike if you want that to financial freedom and a ... come sit down with Mike and his team Italian wealth management they offer this Fifteen hundred dollar value it's a comprehensive financial\nPlan and see if you want to retire or on retire and he deals with clients at or nearing retirement or already retired but maybe you need a little tweaking that plant or maybe you just need a a second opinion on your plan to comprehensive financial planning\nCauses the next ten minutes and yet you can get involved in that the numbers for oh seven to seven zero one thousand four o seven to seven zero one thousand and always at guarding your nest egg dot com so we just talked about Phil Collins and being on retired getting back on the road making more music\nAnd there's something similar to this now that the NFL season is underway we noticed some lessons from the players that might also apply to those of us nearing retirement now former QB Danny Werfel says for him moving on from the game was a major transition\nMan well there's always uncertainty and that is so unnerving for all of us I think it's a\nIt's difficult it's risky I remember going off to college and when my parents drove away just that feeling there's this both us excitement this openness this freedom the newness and then there's this fear of of what might happen inside I say to the word that comes to my mind is to trust\nIs obviously you got to do the things that you need to do\nBut you can't control things that we try to control so often and so I think to be open and receptive and trust any of that phase\nBut it also comes back to earlier principles that you think about is you know what you do today prepares you for tomorrow and I think making long term decisions and investments in delayed gratification can put you in a position where when you make those transitions becoming a much better place\nWell you know in professional sports it's not if you're going to retire but it's when you're going to be retiring basically forced to retire and you kind of\nAnd before you really want to cause many players retire on their own in in professional sports not a whole lot of them do sir but unlike Phil Collins where he retired but he's not injured or anything like that and it can still do it he\nCan go back to whenever he wants but athletes don't have that luxury usually so\nThat's a huge transition for these athletes and a lot of them have issues with that to dealing with their new wife so how do you help people with that that can you know the biggest transition of their lives\nThe transition has really really good word for it because it's a huge change and what we find a week after week when we when we meet with people and we'd go to this for a long time so I've known for a while but\nWhat people don't think about when they have to transition to retirement is is all the components that are required to transition into retirement so I talk about this too certainly when we're meeting with people in on the radio as individuals we can get preconditions to sort of our our normal way of life\nWhat happens every day and you know it's a simple is\nHey I wake up in the first thing I Want is a cup of coffee you know I mean that's just this conditioning we we we we need that we feel like we need that cup of coffee to get her day started or we need this or any of that to get her day started\nAnd what happens when we're working and and certainly there's there are things that happen in life we have families raise families we\nHave mortgages we have car payments we have health insurance we send kids to college you we we we do all of these things and all of those aspects cut this really really busy for a very long period of time\nAnd what I Know that people experience as they transition to retirement is things change in its very quickly you know and it's not overnight but it

management do every single day especially when there's volatility find out more at guarding your nest egg dot com\nI was wondering the other day when we had this conversation each week here on the radio it's kind of mean different things to different people so here's the question Mike should we spend all of our retirement money or should we leave a financial legacy to our loved one which one is the right answer\nWill obviously there is no right answer it's depending on what it is you would like to do personally I I Would say it's a question that that I ask really I'm not every time but very very frequently when I'm sitting down with individuals and they're coming to sit down with us for the first time\nAnd we're putting together the planning for the mental asking the question listen is it a goal of yours to maximize the amount of money that you're beneficiaries receive when you're gone or do you feel like I just want to make sure that I can live the best retirement I can\nMake sure that I don't run of money in retirement and make sure that I have an income stream that helped me maintain my standard of living adjusted for inflation and taxes moving forward\nIf I could do all of that would you rather just have them get whatever's left over after you've accomplished your goals and retirement now I can tell you some people almost apologize to me like they'll say\nOh I'm Sorry but the way I feel is the kids can have what's left or the beneficiary can have what's ...\nWhat's interesting person is probably Ninety five percent of people feel that way\nAnd then for some for the other five percent that don't feel that when there's nothing wrong with it either should so there is no correct answer to the question which one should you do\nWhat you should do is what feels best to you and then make sure you have a financial plan that caters to that specific needs to you know if you're if you're trying to maximize what your beneficiaries are going to get you're probably going to spend less on retirement because trying to maximize which beneficiaries are going to get\nIf you're not trying to maximize what beneficiaries get and they're just going to get you know what's left\nThen that's very reasonable we want to put together a financial plan to make sure you don't run out of money but also make sure you don't leave in a whole bunch of money on the table that you can't take with you right I mean you've earned it enjoy the retirement\nAnd that's one of the best things about my job is helping people identify how to make those things happen and doing it through a

thousand dollar a month a year or whatever budget more drugs but how\nImportant is that dreaded words for a lot of people budgeting when it comes to retirement and then tried to bird I'm not trying to be awkward heritage you know it's something it's like taxes ... deal with that\nIs a dreaded word I so what I find is most of us by the time we're getting close to retirement are transitioning into it we we spent in our entire life kind of figuring out what our budget should be and and most of the people that we sit down with ... percent honestly\nBecause it's individuals who have that nest egg I mean it is the guarding your nest egg radio show frankly some people call us from week to week and they go hey listen\nNow I've come sit down and get an analysis of my current financial plan\nI'd like for you to do a financial plan for me and we have a little bit of an interview process that we go through just to make sure that it's the right fit and then when they say well hey listen I'm forty five years old I haven't actually saved any money for retirement yet but I'd really like to start right at this point [noise]\nUnfortunately I mean for them that that's not what we do and it's not that we couldn't\nHelp somebody or or put together a plan that shows them how to say but but because it's not our niche because it's not what we're really really good at what we do is we direct people to other companies that are very they're very very good at that there are companies that are really really good at low cost approach to saving towards retirement\nIf you're willing to you know set aside a certain amount every single month to make that happen\nNow people that that we're working with or or usually again looking to make that transition from massive accumulation to asset preservation distribution\nThey have their nest egg and part of the reason that they've done such a good job of building that nest egg is they've got a pretty good idea of what their budget is right they they know what their cost of living is on a monthly basis or what their expenses are they established that probably a long time ago because part of that\nBudget was set aside money for retirement and now I'm sitting with them and one of her offices and we're having a conversation about making a transition and so the big question is they know what their expenses are so we don't really have to put together a budget necessarily\nBut if you ask them for their budget because that's going to go into it\nAnd then we take a look at how much money they've set aside for retirement we take a look at how it's currently invested and we just compare will the way your money is currently invested help you maintain your current standard of living throughout retirement meaning\nWhat's the average rate of return likely to be moving forward for the next ten twenty thirty forty years on your current portfolio\nAnd then also how much risk are you taking to get that return because what we're looking to do this is how we help people is if we can help you be more efficient with the current portfolio and what I mean by that is\nWell for the level of risk you're willing to take could we get you a higher average rate of return to fees because if we can is going to make\nOr retirement or for the rate of return you need to maintain your standard of living\nAre you taking too much risk because if we can reduce the risk you're taking to get that rate of return you'll be more successful retirement\nAnd also what we find Christian is a lot of times people have a have a portfolio that will help them accomplish their goals and retirement meaning they set aside enough for retirement it's invested in a way currently that will help them maintain their income stream throughout retirement\nBut maybe it's not as efficient as it could be in by making it more efficient what happens again very very often is we're able to show people will actually you could be spending a lot more if you had a more efficient portfolio okay and still not run out of money right so the benefit isn't\nAlways whether you're going to be successful or not successful if we define success is not running out of money and retirement\nBut as you get more efficient authors more money to spend in retirement you're going to have a better retirement or if you don't wind up spending it it's just more that goes to beneficiaries and what's great Christian is with a lot of times we walk through this financial process and we get to the end of the planning process and and I'm showing people the numbers if they get more efficient\nAnd it goes so if we don't spend more now that so much our beneficiaries are going to get and I go yeah you know somewhere around that number is what they're going to get my whole that's too much we spend more like ... ...\nSo if going through the financial planning process and making your portfolio more efficient means you've got an extra couple of thousand dollars or five thousand dollars a month in income\nThat really makes a difference right to your quality of life yeah and people are going well I I budgeted for five thousand a month and income but you're telling me I can do ten thousand is still not run out of money if I get more efficient\nWhich are the answer's yes we'll are they really going to go and spend an extra five thousand dollars a month I don't know Christian but at least they know they could\nWrite well how are in that knowing that you've got that freedom\nAnd and that's where the efficiency really comes in and and the other side of it as an eventually there'll be another market crash actually in in their retirement there's going to be several of them right and there's also lots and lots of bull markets as well lots of rallies\nKnowing that they've got a partner in retirement unknown to get a partner in their portfolios who has a vested interest in them doing well\nTo protect them from crashes is also important that's that's a peace of mind component so they're not just using that hanging their approach so\nYou know for anybody who's listening if you'd like to come sit down learn more about what we do how we do it get that comprehensive financial plan where we'll see if we can get you more efficient\nAnd more efficient might mean more money to spend and retirement or am I just mean a more money that goes to beneficiaries our you choose to spend it it's still money in your pocket if we can get you more efficient give us a call in the next ten minutes and what does that for you complimentary\nFor seven to seven zero one doubting that for seven seven zero one thousand call within the next ten minutes Mike and the team will sit down with you at their offices in Orlando Jacksonville palm coast Melbourne or the villages and did not comprehensive financial plan which is a Fifteen hundred dollar value complementary\nI had a conversation or the other day with a very nice woman who\nHad some concerns about her current portfolio and our concern were wasn't necessarily based on on how it's been doing here recently marks have been doing well but um she had gone to her bank and her she'd gotten a buyout from her company took a lump sum distribution winter bank and they invested it for\nAnd um she had listened to a radio show when she was inquiring about having a financial planner\nAnd as the conversation went on what I learned from her was basically her feeling was while I went into the bank I told my I have this money and they invested for me and I liked the person very much there were very nice and they seem very professional and the market's been doing OK so she was All right with it\nBut the question was but they never gave me a financial plan like I don't have any sort of financial plan I don't really know\nHow things are likely to do I don't know how much risk I'm taking to get the return that I'm supposed to get they they literally just invested the money and that led no that was it Russia's really know what the next step is\nAnd for her that was that was pretty critical because she's in her sixties\nAnd she had a retired from one job and that lump sum payout and then how to invest and by the bank and then she went took another job and she's looking for you know very specific answers to questions like well if I were to retire\nNow what would happen if I were to retire a year from now what would happen if I were to retire five years from now what would happen\nWhat about Social Security when should I take it what about her husband what about you know how she actually set aside enough for retirement to maintain our current standard of living if it was invested the right way also isn't invested the right way or not I mean all those are very very legitimate questions and I think her big issue was\nThe none of them were actually answered right it was she certainly accomplished their goal is getting the money invested and in theory it's been invested towards retirement\nBut she doesn't have a potential outcome nobody has given a roadmap to what that looks like\nSo she has a lot of questions so what what's going to happen is I she she called and I told her we'd sit down and we'll we'll put together a a comprehensive financial plan to help you navigate you know where you want to be in retirement will also do an analysis of what they put together for you so that you'll understand not just the average rate of return you're likely to get moving forward but also how much risk\nAlso explain to her you know once we do all this planning for you\nYou're more than welcome to take it back to them you can show them what we did ask them they can implement it for you\nUm if you want us to show you how to put on your own we can do that if you'd like for us to do it for you that's fine too you know as you want her to do it but either way what's going to happen to she's going to come in and we're going to answer all those questions and she's going to walk out of her office with um I've written financial plan\nSo that she doesn't have as many questions as she currently has you know about what what's going to happen moving forward and and that's one of the greatest things about our job Christian is being able to sit with people throughout the state of Florida helped them with these ah retirement questions or concerns and just make sure they're on track for successful retirement\nThat's the big deal is make sure that you're on track for these types of things you want to have a successful retirement and it's not something that you can just do by investing and saving all these years yes that is important and we're so glad that you've done that\nUnder the age of fifty that's exactly what you need to be doing investing in saving and focusing on that now when you're over fifty you have to focus differently how can you create a retirement income plan you can feel confident in\nHow can active wealth management tactical

W ... great afternoon weather wise up to ... hour long that's going to last for cash just a couple of minutes wait top story\nWe know the identities of the people killed in that Pittsburgh synagogue shooting of the eleven one Ninety seven year old woman two brothers died a husband and wife were killed now we're learning of extra security ordered in Florida than Freeman with the Jewish community center in Maryland\nWhere we're sitting in right now\nMonday through friday in full of children [noise]\nThat we're able to have this conversation outside right now without that background noise the campus because it's a weekend on a Monday through friday we have hundreds of kids on campus and there are absolute top priority for safety and security\nI mean that's not necessarily something you want to do either because I mean they're shipping your laptop or your computer out somewhere to you know they're putting it who knows in a box just on a truck somewhere I mean you you it's just it's just something you don't want to have to deal with the extra more that you don't need to bring on yourself\nRight it's just like if you have a car you take it to repair shop you want the car somewhere other than to repair shop you dropped it off\nI I don't actually a great analogy let's say you go to a mechanic shop and you drop your car off and then you would expect it to say that mechanical shop for you know the duration of however long it takes to fix the car but in this instance it'd be like dropping the car off in them than\nDriving your car or telling your car bring it to a different repair shop and it's kind of like what what's the point of that I brought it to the shop to get fixed I don't need you to tell could have just gone to the other shop if that was the case so yeah\nI could go into the whole story about what happened love ours was love our company's trucks and the ongoing or deal we've been having was it was a gang repair properly after somebody who wasn't driving carefully ran off for thirty four and slammed into a parking lot\nSo uh and that was after hours too but I mean think about is that truck and been there will be talking about I don't know a car plowed into the tourists are right and that would have yeah crazy news story right there [noise] uh but uh indeed\nYou don't you want your computer fix because this has your information is how's your documents this has whole to pretty much your entire virtual life\nAnd you want it to be worked on at a place where you know a where the computer's going to be the words technicians are open up front and transparent what are you from the very beginning and see are gonna get the work done for you in a cost efficient and timely manner and so that's why I always say if you need your computer repaired\nBringing on into refresh computers and many times easy basic fixes we can get done so quickly and many times we don't even\nCharge and then ... yeah you wouldn't even charge because it's something that doesn't take a lot of effort on your part and I think a lot of time on your part and it's something that it's kind of like hey this is it's just going to be better for you if we just fix this little problem for you get it sorted out in your charging you would just it wouldn't make sense for us and it would just be you know a burden for you\nRight and then of course if we have the opportunity to look at because again big box stores will often charge for diagnostics were able to be wrapped around with you and say hey this is what's going on it's gonna cost as much to fix it but if it's another beer may not necessarily even be cost effective and we let you know that right up there and of course\nIf it's not cost effective to fix it or you decide not to fix it no problem you don't know if anything just take a time make your decision come back if you want to or\nOf course um if it's not worth fixing it might just be more cost effective just put the money into something new or more modern and we have hundreds of computers in our store to any given time to choose from and out pretty much all ready to go there just rape plug them in their way to work for you\nThen you've got some good deal will deals I mean just not even really deals but just your regular price is going on right now maybe give some examples of what you're selling in the store right now and what people could do if they need a replacement\nOf sure I'm a well look Chris I'm for a laptop so we have a pretty good selection of a double attitude HP ... books and when you save a lot of money compared to what you get at the big box store the same specification\nTo basically for for one or two or three hundred dollars you'd probably get a very very low in machine from a big box store\nThey a lot of times now only get it and make them with like cheap plastics or ... or very skimpy specifications are not going to have enough storage based are gonna be slow to slow the ass nail\nAnd uh whereas where refreshing abusing getting nice core I five or even a core I seven system for that same be four hundred dollars you get a lot higher specification\nFor your dollar compared to the big box stores in the same goes with our desktops to we have the ... H. P. ah elite desks I'm into also apple products we also have a\nWell I Know we're going to be getting a bunch more of the retina Mac books in soon or their ah ah with the latest mcelroy is a hobby and we also have a some a Thirteen inch Mac pros\nWith a quiet five processors and are there between the four to five hundred dollar price point if so we also have big savings on apple products as well\nUm whereas um whereas you can get a brand new Thirteen inch macro from the apple store for what Fifteen hundred Seventy a hundred\n... why spend that much money to get an computer that might be a couple of years older but has the same capability at the same mind software and of course that's backed by an inhouse warranty that's professionally tested\nI mean I personally get on my computers from refreshed and beers you guys I Know that of the one that's great savings to it's more cost effective three it's business grade so I Know it's going to last\nAnd I I think people probably out there thinking well you know you're offering these deal I can probably find the same deals online you know the same places and\nMaybe maybe they could however if you're buying a computer on line or laptop on line or anything on line problem is you don't know what you're getting until you actually get\nIn these computers and laptops are all built differently they're all modeled differently they all look different feel different in as soon as you get it you're stuck with it you could I mean you could return and mail it back and it's a hassle and everything like that but when you go to the store\nAnd get a deal like refresh has which is probably just as good as anything you could find on line and maybe better right maybe better you also get the test out the computer you have professionals there who will set everything up for you so you walk out of the store\nWith a computer or laptop set for your needs and you know exactly what to do with it how to use it I mean I bought a laptop on line one some years ago and I got it and then the guy in the mail is exciting everything and\nThe keyboard I just hate it I hated the keyboard and I like I never got over it I never got over it and it was so frustrating\nAnd I eventually went the next time I bought a laptop I wasn't here in Orlando so I couldn't go to refresh computer but I was back home and around I went to the store and bought one because I was like I Want to make sure I get something that I actually liking can use and it's something you don't really think of\nWhen you're buying a new you know the new piece of electronic equipment but I mean it it makes a world of difference when you have a comfort in just a a knowing that what you're walking out of the store with is what you want in something you can use and will love\nThat's right I mean granted we also have an e commerce site to say can take advantage of our great deals on line and uh we have complete comprehensive descriptions with high resolution stock image depicting the actual making miles computer\nThat of course indeed I'm the same exact way my mother the same exact way so many people I Know are the same way with technologies that they want to be able to feel that they want to experience that they want the opportunity to see it again back to automotive it's just like test driving a car you've got to buy a car without test\nDrive that's a good yeah exactly we can make these current allergies all day this is great on the alerts Harry in here and you guys going to attend them thing\nYeah perhaps ... indeed magic mechanic they get their computers from ... computers to act\nAnd in fact they just had one of our technicians out there last week um so even the professionals need other professionals to help them I mean just like um it's a nice reciprocal thing that we're able to do that or like take on this one then you can beers with them and we need our help for example\nThat just shows you how trusted that

zero zero nine six five joining us on the show right now John from Claremont calling in John ... don't you go ahead and restate your question for listeners out there are those who might have just jumped in and joined us and I'm sure we'll go ahead and field it\nCertainly uh yeah so uh I guess the problem is I've got a laptop that is um in her mid late coming in and off the Internet um it's not necessarily losing\nWireless connection to the router buddy ... that is intermittent on it I have several devices and that\n... that are uh you know a wife I labeled and they don't seem to have any problem with ... you know TV shows and Netflix and things like that but uh the laptop seems to be the only issue\nRe John So this is actually a problem that I have seen happen before with computers sometimes and it has to do with a oftentimes will have to do with a power saving function\nIn the operating system that's not that ... that so visible um windows has a function that law on medically turnoff for suspend different system components or hardware devices\nTo save power and oftentimes when it does that for the network controller\nThat can really uh be disruptive or when I worked at a flight simulation company or we have racks of computers and the computers would meet each other for the simulation\nAnd then sometimes the visual out see outside visual and Mr him a pound would just stop responding because the computer driving it decides to just to spend its network connection because without it was being inactive or to turn that off\nYour network controller you would have to go to the system device manager I you'd right click on start and then go to devise manager and then you would go to the section for network adapters you'll find your network controller on the list there\nUh when you write clicked that and go to property you can go to the power management tab\nAnd then on that have ya wanna unchecked the option for allow the computer to turn off this device to save power\nAnd then click okay um if you use the hardware connection you'll probably want to do that free that hardware connection as well um but uh then or if a ... that does not resolve the issue it could potentially be a symptom of a problem with the wife I card itself because I have seen why cards\nAlso go bad on laptops intermittently as well\nAh so hopefully go ahead and give or get that try try turning off that power saving function and hopefully that will resolve the issue and if you're still having difficulty of course will definitely do it we can to try to help get that troubleshooter for you\nOkay and um I guess a ... and it's all up to that would um it it it does continue after I go through those steps which that that makes perfect sense but you're set um\nWould uh just disabling there and getting like a some kind of us live by a with a laptop would that be probably a good next a step\nOr that could be another option to circumvent using the built in one if it is indeed going bad how we have USB adapters a for around thirty bucks in the store um and sometimes a\nEase rather simple workarounds can end up being a lot more cost effective than actually replacing the actual card inside the computer sometimes are they are relatively inexpensive and easy to replace but on others like ultra books or a lot of these newer designs that they're not really that serviceable\n... ended up being a that all we can do it it might be a little bit more price here than just simply using an external adapter\nSo um if you want to bring it by if you're still having trouble we can go and do a free diagnostic on it in the store\nOr we can check with our own wireless network and see how it's responding with it and then we can go from there with the appropriate recommendation for your system we can either try to source or replacement wife I card specific to your laptop or it can just go ahead and get your set up with an adapter you can plug into a\nVery good well I appreciate it thank you so much\nYou're very welcome John and thank you so much for joining us today\nAppreciate that called John let's go ahead and keep rolling with the phone calls Sheila is calling in from Claremont as well ... what's your question today protect talking Andre\nAndre um I've got a laptop and it's a latitude and every once in a while this thing will pop up on the screen and mount ... memory has changed and then it hangs up and well that is true that the debt and I have to manually shut it down\nAll right the only reason you should be getting that message is if you're either adding or removing a memory stick why the ramp sticks inside the machine\nSo if you're having this issue coming up a frequently it sounds like that either a one of the sticks inside the machine is not security ... all the way and it's a only being detected intermittently\nYou are listening to burn fat Orlando right here on news Ninety six point five WD be oh another hour of spectacular called duck\nI mean you've heard it here it's the program that fits your need made for you ate by five eight eight nine eight four four six eight five five eight eight nine eight or\nFor six six office locations a popular Waterford lakes Claremont Sanford Dr phil ups and the village is I mean learned the secrets the diet industry\nHas been shared with you know drugs no shots no pre packaged foods do nasty shakes you heard it from Kevin forty pounds in forty days is mile\nDown what he said thirty two pounds give or take right I mean he eats bowls guys very confident that they're going to get off blood pressure medicine that they've been on and that their doctors have told them they wouldn't get off I I mean we we can't make any of this stuff up that's why we had the callers call and to give you these testimonials because\nYou need to hear this and in the best part about this program is that\nMost times the people who make these appointments yeah a lot of them here in the show on the radio but ... most of these appointments are made from word of mouth is from people spreading the spreading the word hate\nThis works this actually works this is a program that if you haven't tried you need to try I mean\nWe've talked about it before people try all different kinds of things they tried the dieting they try the gym membership you know and in most of those things just fall by the wayside eventually they don't work this is a program that works in bits your needs I mean ... we've had a great show so far today some great calls in\nBut I tell you what you know some of the uh you know the the the patient you know when they first come into the office you know there are a little bit skeptical there just quite unsure they don't know what to expect\nOr they may expect food in a box they may expect a sub magic potion but it it it it isn't any of that it really is you know having our our patients understand what it takes to become healthier\nAnd once you figure out what you have been doing a you know you may create life you know you may you live another day so to speak but the question is are you at your optimal health\nYou know and when you're at your optimal house you know disease goes away you know energy you know a a comes back in you know you get a good quality of life in you know I I always say uh you know people when they walk into the office after a week on the program you know it's like they're walking on air when they come\nThe practice because either there or winter\nYou know and and you know a sinner winter in in a sense we used to say they do in our center winter because you know they're they finally have the confidence they finally have the tools or that they can implement themselves they're in control of their own destiny\nIn so many times I tell the patients you know at the moment of decision\nYou know your destiny is created so if you're not where you want to be looking at your decision you know and and you know you could have a piece of cake so to speak or you could have\nA another option that would be held to what do you choose you know at that moment of decision and you know people typically you know are addicted to the food itself they're addicted to the chemicals\nAnd when you read the articles of scientific articles that are out there and you know when these companies seafood companies whether it be fast food companies are manufactures they\nMake these foods in that particular way that have uh chemicals in them that creates a person to have a dependency on their food\nThan really much yours is soccer you know a sucker for that particular food that brand of food or that type of food or\nWhatever and you know you may think you're making the right decision independent of yourself because you have free will but really those chemicals always when those chemicals really control you know the decisions you make their great influence yours and you know the big ...\nOr many of those chemicals in obese Egyptians in because they really make you fat they inhibits your body's ability to lose weight your body's ability\nTo heal your body's ability to burn fat they they are disruptive physiological disruptor in when you're physiology is disrupted\nWhether it be you know from stresses of the environment of chemicals in prescriptions chemicals in the food you eat chemicals in the water drinks you drink\nYou know chemicals in your environment at work that new car smell that smell when you open up the dishwasher those are all chemicals and they're made that way you know to create an emotional response in for many food manufacturers it's all about getting another piece of\nWhatever that food is so you know I I hate to be a\nHate to be rude right but you really have a choice and you can go on ignoring it you know step on that scale right now put on pants enclosed today that maybe you haven't worn in a year and see if they're tighter through more snow\nAnd then you'll probably find that that number on that scale is where it needs to be\nIn those parents Annette waist size is where it needs to be\nAnd probably your blood pressure is it where it needs to be in your cholesterol is where it needs to be in your energy levels you know that weren't needs to be in your sugar levels aren't where they need to be and then just count the number of pills that you have in your you know you're you know by your bedside or on your kitchen counter in your bathroom wherever you keep your bills\nYou know your medications and count the ones that you have in your purse your briefcase or maybe at your desk\nAnd then you'll get the idea that what you have been doing hasn't really been working you can ignore it\nRight and you'll just be most likely taking more pills and meat and be susceptible to most more sickness or illness or disease in the future and if that's what you want\nYou know a by default if you don't do anything that's what you're going to get by default but you are in power to control your destiny and you get to me just come in and meet the people that are already burning fat\nYou know people in the reception room that are there that we follow up on you know you'll see a couple of

you're not down with this but there wasn't a big blame\nBernie when that not shot up the baseball field in DC right\nSo anyway so then White House press secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders was asked about it and she came out and said of of course we disavow all of this White House can\nA horrific indispensable acts and we'll work with law enforcement to make sure anybody response was punished to the full extent of all certainly it's okay to disagree in politics but it's never OK to take action against another individual and we certainly don't want to see that happen\nI mean that's stock it'll be interesting to see what Trump has to say about this ... ... a little bit later on I'm speaking of trumped completely switching gears here\nThis I don't think this is just accident this caravan that's coming up through Mexico and started in Honduras\nJust the timing of it right before the midterms and we are to believe that it's just thousands of people picking up and joining in right who's paying for everything\nWhile I was keeping people fed and all of that yeah I mean that's a question that's been asked Everytime you bring up that point you're called a racist or a big it you know that's just the way the world we live and I know\nI'm so yeah I mean now they're what seven thousand there's a second to caravan that's being formed as well yes and it does seem like this is a mass protests but I Know there have been you know\nCaravans in the form of protest in the past but this is a particularly large one and you do wonder who's the one organizing ... as soon as the activists behind it or the activist group behind it\nWell they've been talking that it's from the left of course from different\nCountries I don't know our eyebrows I if I Believe that the Republican Party had the wherewithal to do it I Would actually maybe believe a conspiracy theory that the Republicans organize it because it's an issue they went on [noise]\nYou know being floated out there with these pipe bombs as far as well\nAnd that and really orchestrated that it's an inside job I don't know just wait until the facts 'cause I Know I Know I've heard that too that it's an inside job I Know is it yeah okay\nI don't I that's what happens now as soon as the news breaks right because they are just like otherwise you on this now President Trump did some good old fashioned trolling last night with the big caravan news butting immigration back in the spotlight he tweeted out an old video of Rocco bomb and now this clip is from back when he was a senator\nAnd he says look at Obama's says oh I'm Sorry Trump wrote I agree with Obama one hundred percent on immigration\nVery generous and welcoming people here in the United states but those who federally perjury legally and those who employ them disrespect to the rule of law and they are showing disregard for those who are born into law\nWe simply cannot allow people to pour into the United states ... undocumented unchecked circumventing the line of people who are waiting patiently diligently unlawfully becomes immigrants in this country\nSee it wasn't that long ago that even guys like Obama would come out and say things like that you say that today in your racist and you're a bigot that's correct and you have people who want a better life\nWell and so if you tweet that out okay is that causing division no that's pointing out hypocrisy\nBeds pointing out the fact that it's not that long ago that Democrats seem to be somewhat on the same page\nRight until they thought they could use it as a political tool to benefit themselves right right\nYes and that's not hateful that is not not loving that's just the the that's what Obama said there is one hundred percent correct\nAnd meanwhile another story of course it's got to be in the open because all the way after the lottery you had the lottery to beat it was the open on the today show today\nI regret to inform you I did not win the lottery but single ticket was
