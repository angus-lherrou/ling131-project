they're in power\nWe can be civil when we were in power I mean that's what she said I'm not parsing her words I'm not spending anything out of contacts with the people who want to watch their butts instead of remove their heads and listen I'm specifically quoting what she said that is exactly what she was talking about\nShe was specifically stating that unless they're in power then there'll be civil I really honestly feel like a lot of people in the left I think there's a difference between liberals and progressive\nAnd I think they're both on the left but there's a difference between liberals and there's a difference between progressive kind of like there's a difference between Republicans and there's a difference between conservative but the right it's so United Right now because

over politics\nBecause apparently only crazy people meet with Trump that's what they're saying\nThat is what they're saying it is so ridiculous\nAnd these people are losing their mind I don't I don't really give a crap what a celebrity things\nI'm not going to sit here and and you know plan my day around of celebrities opinions and I have no idea I don't know if ... is a Republican I just don't know and you know what I don't care do you know why because I got\nThings to people so\nWe're going to go to the supermarket after work today how many have you all had\nThree baskets of unfolded close like me that you got to get to\nYeah we got things to do I don't care what I don't sit here and made my day around with a celebrity things that don't but here's the thing this awful crap that as being beautiful\nIs awful and they're doing it out of political spite\nThey're doing it because I have said he is a total threat to their narrative\nCompletely completely\nThat gives the as manager out there saying Kanye West as an enemy you have I mean I'm just looking at all of these\nAll of these that dish\nA blue checks out here\n\nUh he does it you know ... uh uh they're mocking\nHim they're saying oh this is Tania ... the guy who literally has an album titled my a double snakes I'm\nHe was saying oh this\nIs just he's just benefiting from white supremacy you have other people saying yeah well this is a guy is not okay this is a president who's you know he's the president wants to exploit that because he's not okay\nThey\nI mean it is awful I I'm looking at all these he's sick he's mentally ill you know this has caused people to ask US Economy is okay what what what has caused people\nTo ask if he's okay the fact that he's he's going there and he's he's developing common ground and he's being nice to have you noticed he has never actually endorsed Trump\nOr were they had it isn't the endorse him and he has never said I agree with everything that he said ever\nI see people out here are acting like he's done this\n\nAnd I see all of these people who are reaching for relevancy trying to attack\nHim as being mentally ill I don't I didn't see the same people attacking ... be mentally ill and he said George Bush aides black people\nThat you can yeah\nThe same people reaching for relevancy now whether ... bashing they had no problem with him saying George Bush aides black people not at all it's a threat\nTo the narrative is what it is because it shows that if you can mainstream independence thought particularly if you come from Hollywood then more people can do it the biggest threat to Democrats right now is for\nThe idea that to be anti Democrat is the new going against the grain people love to be counter culture and\nSorry but all the social justice war Arizona and all the things that you think are freaky baby Zane that it does not counter culture as culture as a mainstream\nCounter culture is finding common ground maybe being a little bit more modest maybe being a little bit more thoughtful that's counter culture you know limited government that kind of stuff I've said this I have a monologue that I did four or five years ago where I said that's the new punk rock\n\nCounter culture Democrats do not want to have anti Democrat be the new counter culture because then that comes to ... that becomes trendy\nAnd there are people out there who really don't have deep roots in principle they just want to go with what looks trendy because if it looks trendy it makes them look like they're smarter without having to do the work of actually improving their own intelligence\nAnd improving their knowledge and expanding what they know about an issue it just looks like oh why is that person doing that it's because they must know something we don't if all psychology it marketing\n\nAnd Democrat know this this is where when it comes down to end the culture war Democrats know that is\nSo instead of instead of challenging him on you know the the things that he's reaching out to on merit uh they're they want it diminishes humanity by St by mocking his mental health\nThat that's what they want to do\nThey want to diminish him as a human by mocking his mental health\nAnd I just find that disgusting\nI just think it's gross and it's such it's just gross and to see some of these fake as conservatives I'm not even watching it to see some of them out there doing this\nI Know you all and I know why you're doing it shame on you\nSo I guess what came in order to find common ground with Trump you've gotta be crazy\nRemember when the view when when Mike Pence talked about gods speaking to him and what did the view say oh that's a mental illness and then when you know ... comes out and says some things that happened to be what the media considered to be right leaning thought\nAll of a sudden it's mental illness again it's like when they don't agree with you there are only go to is to call you crazy or to frame you some sort of you know mentally ill person\nAnd it's disingenuous if there's nothing intelligent in regards to a rebuttal to the position that was actually said it's just simply to say you're crazy and it's the laziest argument ever yeah\n\nI mean it is I think that says more about them than it says about tiny I mean they're not have you heard anybody challenge any of the merits of anything that he is discussing\nI haven't\nI mean I'm I'm actively looking literally on social media right\nNow we're not going to find it because they have no argument against it I mean look at all the policies that President Trump has put in place and that are actually successful since his first day as president yet none of the media wants to talk about the successes of the Trump presidency\nBecause they don't have an argument against it they can only say race is big it was a gymnast homophobic\nThat can only labeling some negative way and hoping that the passive news consumers that lean left would just take it as gospel and this has been their game since twenty sixteen well it's been there since before that but they really ramped up since twenty sixty\nMhm yeah I mean at some saying\nI yeah I it's crazy I\nWe got a
