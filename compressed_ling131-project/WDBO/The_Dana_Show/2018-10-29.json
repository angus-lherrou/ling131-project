I mean I don't know how people can think like this the guy was consumed with hatred that's the one thing I think to take away from that he was just absolutely consumed with hatred\nAnd this uh\nI mean it was just it it it led him his the fact that he was so consumed with it has led led to this so um [noise] I I Know there's we got another with other developments is while they're going to too but\nThis uh\nHas also sparked a huge discussion on security at synagogues and churches than it further added fuel to the fire that we've had it on going in this nation about discussions with tone and et cetera et cetera let me let me\nLet me say this I've been thinking about how to put this because I don't believe that words themselves that are violent I Am a free\nSpeech purist I Do not believe that word themselves are violent\nI don't believe that speech is\nGoing to harm someone I don't believe that uh you know I I don't just like I didn't I didn't say this when when the\nWho was ...

I cannot stand when people\nSeize upon horrible tragedies and they use it like ... petty Little Women little mean girls and they use it as ways to get political jabs at people I don't buy I don't buy your protest Asian I don't buy that you care about what happened if you seize upon it and you're immediately using that as a weapon\n... completely out of place to go after someone simply because you hate that person politically\nThis dude was consumed with hate and there are a lot of people in politics that are absolutely consumed with hate and that is the problem\n[noise] these are people who are so consumed with hate they just hate the fact that there exists someone who thinks differently from them and the fact that someone exist to think differently that to them as a personal effect and so they believe that the existence of different thought is the same thing as the middle finger extended\nThey think that's how they look at it he was consumed with hate and I don't know I've always felt that big it should be absolutely shell and\nI don't like big it's I don't like anti Semite I don't like people who use people's beliefs and ethnicities as a mark against them I think it is the cheapest trashy asked most back way of thinking\nIt really is it is the laziest form of thought it is the laziest form of thought\n\nAnd that I have a always felt this way and this dude was consumed with\nHate absolutely consumed with hate\nThat's what that's the problem with this this is the fault of this now I saw and I'm going to get into some of the media stuff because the people out there who immediately went and were screaming at the president and talking about how much I have no idea how in the help people came to that conclusion quite frankly\nThey they were mad because they didn't like the the his expression of sympathy they were mad at you know something I mean it is it it it it's awful every everybody is walking you to comment section essentially and that's what Twitter and I think some social media has become\nPeople didn't like they don't like they didn't they didn't like the Trump tone on the Caribbean and they're trying to when he was saying that people just can't enter the country illegally and somehow they're saying that that was\nWhere that kind of fuel this which again the guy who did the uh didn't like the president at all and even said so and has verified social media accounts which apparently still exist on Twitter all of these people who were concerned about tone where the hell were these people when you have folks like Andrew\nCuomo who made the declaration that people who who were Second Amendment or who were pro life for people who you know that they had no place in New York or where\nI'm a a ... you had a bill de Blasio saying similar or or wrong Emanuel saying that these people who believe in in in a Christian faith or cetera et cetera that they have no place in New York or no place in Chicago or\nYou know they they don't belong here they where where where where people when when they were expressing\nThat sort of that sort of rhetoric and let me ask you this where the ever levine Haiti's where these people if they were so concerned about tone and they were so concerned and there are so upset at the administration if you're mad at the administration\nThen wouldn't you also it's just going down that same line wouldn't you also be infuriated over somebody like Louis Farrakhan calling the people who are Jewish calling them termites\nAnd that video is still available and Twitter wouldn't that also make you angry wouldn't it make you angry that this guy and his hatred has been mainstream\nWouldn't make you angry that he stood there on stage at a reader Franklin's funerals shoulder to shoulder with Bill Clinton or that the previous administration he was he was a buddy buddy with the previous president I mean if you're going to go after this administration my point is is where where's your ... protest Asian over this guy\nIf you cared so much about it why were you not up in arms that he had to verify to count and still does on certain platforms and he was sharing his hatred\nAnd that it was mainstream D did die rub shoulders with celebrity the people that you see on cable news or his friends he is the advisor Andy mentor of the people who founded the women's march who rushed to defend in protest him\nWhere are you up in arms over that\nIf you think that it was the administration's fault where is your consistency\nAnd furthermore when did you did anything remotely close to what this guy has pleased by all means change my mind\nI have to touch on some of the media headlines about this coming up as well I'm also some of the inconsistencies and how one platform is being targeted and others

Adam Schiff\nOh that was the ... the thing is I don't even want to hear so I'm so tired of here I don't believe all the only point I wanted to make was that it's coordinated when these type of talking points go out there goes oh of course it uh this is absolute coordinate it's it's not a coincidence that you have Max Boot Adam Schiff\nAnd several others on the Democratic side trying to equate\nWhat we don't like about sources actions with some sort of hatred of\nSpeaking of Max Boot this was a guy who was lamenting the Trump talking about again and miss quoting the enemy of the people and I've even seen some conservatives do this he was specifically saying fake news [noise] ah but\nAt the same time he called the uh\nEssentially a conservative media terrorists so he is guilty of the very thing that he\nYeah I'm\nJust I don't know it's just it's just crazy to me [noise]\nOh so this and some of the media responses to this and the way that I think 'cause I think it has been a largely irresponsible just what I have seen also what I think isn't highly irresponsible and this goes along with some of the media bias\nThat we have discussed is why in the world at NBC sit on the evidence that completely discredited\nA Michael ... and\nJulie sweat neck for weeks why did they do that\nAnd you guys remember all that ... remember when he came out and fortune was bragging about saying that while we were were ... um\n[noise] but apparently they had gotten this as\nEarly that they had this information as early as September thirtieth\nWhich is quite a long time when you consider they knew that he they had information showcasing to them that he was engaging in a conspiracy to defame Washington Examiner freebie again everybody reported on this and they said\nNothing even as\nPeople who are attacking ... Brett Kavanaugh were citing his discredited client\nAs proof of Kavanaugh's on worthiness to be placed on the Supreme Court now they've published last Thursday a report titled new questions raised about ... claims regarding cabinet and it went through all of these already identified discrepancies et cetera et cetera and sweating ... affidavit from September twenty six\nAnd everyone's like wait a minute we'll blah blah blah blah you had this how long have you had these conversations that these people how long ago\n\nHe he first uh\nTalked to NBC for a phone interview on September thirtieth\nAnd\nDuring that time apparently the woman says she never saw cabinet engaging the behavior\nUh he connected that to the so the so called witness to NBC she said that she never saw any of the behavior described by sweating it could cetera that was the woman who said I didn't even know this woman and what and NBC knew that that's how they talk to her they talk to this woman in September and she said I never\nEven heard of this one I didn't even know her\nWhat and they knew that that was on the ... they there was in September they knew that in September\nAnd\nWhat kind of after September October now keep in mind this was September thirtieth NBC knew that\nThey that this whole thing was entirely discredited but yet October second which is after September thirtieth that's when I have an id published this declaration\nTalking about this witnesses named saying that she had firsthand knowledge et cetera et cetera all of this stuff\nAnd then NBC\nAired a one on one interview were sweating it\nAnd sweat neck made all these statements that were incredibly inconsistent with the affidavit she gave him September twenty six uh examiner notes NBC's Kate Snow processed and concluded the interview by noting that couldn't verify anything in the story that should have killed it but they are did anyway stared at anyway even after they knew behind the scenes that had already been discredited\nBy one of the people sided as a way to uh as as proof that the woman story was true\n[noise] [noise]\n[noise]\nNBC reported that quote in an apparent effort to Fort the reporting process he added in a phone call a ... about this on background it's not the same woman what are you going to do with that I have an audio allegedly set in separate conversation with a network that he had confirmed with her yet again that everything the declaration of trend correction must have been confused by your question\n\nNBC reported five minutes later the woman sent a formally worded text back in ...\nSaying understand everything and the declaration of tree should not contact me anymore regarding this issue according to the tax but when reached by phone minutes later the woman insisted that she never stop having us they contract and appropriately et cetera et cetera and on October ... she wrote I Will definitely talk to you again to no longer have an idea I don't like that he twisted my word this is bad\nIs there there's no reason at this network should have set on information at the height of the battle\nAt the height of the Supreme Court fight I think they deliberately suppressed it they deliberately suppressed this information\nWe're going to talk more about this is huge and you want to know why people don't trust the media this is why this is exactly why we have a quick five are coming up uh in the meantime\nVeterans' day is coming up and in the veterans' day is always obviously a their special observant says that that go on everywhere and it's I mean honestly I think it should be more than just another date on the calendar\nAnd when you think about and you remember you on or what our veterans did\nA and still do every single day please think about helping support them and sending in the gap with a donation to the Purple Heart foundation this is a private organization it's not government funded and what you give actually goes to our veterans because these are volunteers on staff that are veterans themselves or volunteer veterans that help other veterans\nWho are in a different place or they're coming back into their acclimate him back to civilian life maybe they're struggling with PBS maybe there they they need help with a job training or educational scholarships that's what your money actually goes to support and find they take car in cash donations and every donation no matter what size helps to matter and his tax deductible\nSo I like to work with the Purple Heart foundation because they work hard to support in fact and their families they help veterans of all ages all wars and you don't and regardless of your combat when did find out more about the ways that you can pleasure support\nDoes it give the Purple Heart dot org ah that's

the cultural [noise] and they the uh uh we're going to get into the the Simpsons coming up at the bottom of the hour we're going to talk about how The Simpsons got rid of the only uh Indian that's in Springfield\nAnd Brazil and this\nIs what I think is interesting I was reading them uses Institute that has been a story about this but I was also ratings from some of my friends who are a Brazilian by birth and now American citizens or their parents are Brazilians the president elect\nThey everyone was freaking out they were saying he was like the Brazilian Trump or something like that and they they everyone was wringing their hands over populism and nationalism which I think anything in excess is bad I Hope people realize that's the only thing that is not bad in excess is faith\nAnd and kindness and honesty well I mean as long as their plight everything else and access can be bad\nAnd everyone was freaking out but as some of my friends who are telling me they were saying look this this guy and I have a friend who is her parents were Brazilian and she was all over Facebook she's done on whatever she was all over Facebook\nShe was livid at all the media accounts that she was saying oh no no no look look look look look she's like this this guy was talking about privatizing certain industries this guy is talking about defunding abortion 'em and having better relations with foreign entities and increasing gun rights\nI'm what and this is where I saw this with the they're actually consider it because ... obviously Brazil has a huge violence problem there is a citizens council for public secured in criminal justice they said uh they feature Brazil feature some of the most violent cities on the planet Nineteen of the most violent or in Brazil\nYou're looking at thirty homicides per hundred thousand people in twenty Seventeen\n\nIt's one of the most violent countries in Latin America and it's because of organized ... crime me says look in all the different rival gangs and the how they've contributed to the ... the really insane amounts of violence [noise] um but they also have seriously heavy handed security measures\nAnd so they had a Brazilian armed forces that took control public security like in Rio de Janeiro or et cetera but\nNow\nThis this they call them the Brazilian Donald Trump or this guy a bow and arrow is now he's considering the relaxation of Brazil strict gun control laws because the street violence is so bad and he does not think that more\nPolicing better police the not more policing better measures not more people there walking around\nIs the best way to go about it they had forty five thousand homicides due to illegally possess firearms and twenty fourteen alone\nStacked in Spain\nAnd so there's a lot of concern there and this is something that has you know and this is actually added to widespread crime epidemic because do you I mean if they have a ton I mean it's not easy to get a gun I mean they're basically banned\nSo this is something that this new president elect has been looking at an on and it's weird because so um many and the media been freaking out like oh this is bad look at this bad trend but everyone that I Know\nAnd I have about five or six people that I Know who are either from Brazil summer are are legal residents some are actual foreign citizens or their parents are from Brazil\nAnd they've said people who are seen as do not understand they think that any departure from any sort of leftist or progressive rural is bad news and I thought that's actually really a very

[noise]\nOfficial lash unsafe stuck so The Simpsons I've decided to get rid of\nA pool the ah\n... actually only railing a successful carrier character on The Simpsons\nBecause remember the big\nThing that happened where social justice lawyers were saying oh my gosh it's offensive because it's a stereotype and I'm like have you ever watch The Simpsons because literally every character on The Simpsons as a stereotype\nThe Italian people are mobsters all the Christians are like Ned Flanders all the stay at home moms are like Marge all the dads are like Homer all the kids or you know I mean it gets I mean that's literally what this than than\nIt is it is what that what the Simpsons\nIt is a giant staying of stereotypes\nThat is all that it is it's so horrible\nActually funny it's funny because it looked comedy's funny people can be funny sometimes has always been a very popular show [noise] and now people are upset over it and buy some ... by people I mean like a ... there was a social justice\nWarrior who did the uh ... what was it the problem with a pool so now The Simpsons came out and they said that they are going to just drop him like there's apparently not even going to be a big thing over there just going to drop drop the character\n[noise]\nSo I\nI don't know this is this this whole thing is I don't know\nDo you know that he was what was he was a doctor and a small business owner he was legit the only smart in six really successful character on the entire the entire show\nYou you would also the scientist there was really nobody\nYou know he was a nerd right there that we actually have like a family and I know exactly\nWhat I'm just talking about the smarts if we're just trying to compare the smarts but the character on the show was not demeaned in any way he was certainly a minority in Springfield he was a business owner as a minority who was successful um there were several episodes to where he was like\nApparently electric Casanova tied to butt up who was in no way to me and yeah sure you know if\nI was reading 'em over at National Review there was a couple of good pieces about it I'm proud of Shankar's one and he is an Indian American and he was saying that\nI feel like minded left wing Indians are trying to dictate how Indian Americans view American society and he was discussing this one um social justice where you're seeing piece that was too long didn't read just cetera um that\nIt was ludicrous that because he was trying to say that that I put it was voiced by someone who is white hangs area and dust ... the character cannot be taken seriously and\nIt's yeah it's a cartoon he the argument is that well what if Sri an Indian according to ... says what he was reading it and are outside an Indian had been chosen as the voice of output using using even my using my even worse interpretation of an Indian accent instead of his areas somehow would that have clean the slate\nThat says the ... the CIA credit the writers of The Simpsons they confronted with comedy a nuance and because remember there was the one I'm a little scene last season where Lisa was asked well Lisa was the one who had to address she they had they had they addressed it to that character\nAnd the end in a scene that or Mars was talking to Lisa and she hasn't rewritten an entire book in order to make it an offensive and then ... says quote it's hard to say something that started decades ago and was applauded and an offensive as not politically incorrect what can you do and afterwards she looked at a picture of a put it that don't have a cow it was an autographed photo\nAnd she goes some things will be dealt with at a later date that's what merge that I think it was great because the literally the entire show was built on his stereotype and if you don't understand\nThat then why and how are you talking about it that is literally what the show was it was a humorous celebration of\nAll of these stereotypes and when you look at every single one of these characters every single it wasn't done it wasn't demeaning\nI mean whether it's you know the the the ground ground keeper willy the Scots men weather or whatever it was I mean it was it was done as a way to mock American cultural perception that literally what\nThe entire basis of all of these characters is is mocking American it's a humorous mocking a celebration of American
