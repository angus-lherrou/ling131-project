little bit differently chances are you're not one hundred percent invested in equities if retirements around the corner for you right\nAnd you need to understand your portfolio from the equity exposure you have with stocks but also what about bombs right I mean I think we're moving into a bear market with bonds bonds I don't think are likely to do well for a while so\nYou know this idea of just holding bonds or bond funds could be problematic moving forward all these things go into financial planning and it's about understanding what you have\nUnderstanding how to make your portfolio as efficient as it can be so how do you make sure you're getting the highest rate of return you can with the least amount of risk those are the types of questions that we answer every day when we sit down with individuals and do analysis in financial planning\nSo if you'd like that kind of information about your portfolio or you just don't feel really confident in what you're currently doing if you want to come sit down with us we'll put together a truly comprehensive financial plan for where we'll give you all that data and then also in analysis of your current portfolio\nWe'll put that plant in your hands complimentary if you give us a call and the next ten minutes\nArtists the comprehensive financial plan kind of see where you stand with your portfolio and you know give you that counts\nSend your portfolio as you're approaching retirement or even if you are in retirement as we speak the comprehensive financial planning a Fifteen hundred dollar value call within the next ten minutes the numbers for oh seven to seven zero one thousand\nFour o seven to seven zero one thousand and as always to add guarding your nest egg dot com\nMike I watch a lot of TV because I Do that at night when I get home from work and after exercise and I just kind of want to relax\nAnd a number of times I've come across these commercials or they're kind of commercials what they're more like endorsements of celebrities who's are trying to give you financial advice and here's one I'm Alex for back Pat Boone here Henry\nAnd I'm here to tell homeowners that are sixty two in older about a great way to live on a veteran tiring\n[laughter] okay I'm a I'm listening funds\nGive me a financial advice and now it's a trip back and say what is the number you know so I mean how do we deal with this and how do we get our clients get clients to ah you know kind of way through all those financial messages and that we see and hear every day\nEver shall I those commercials always made me kind of sad\nBecause it makes me worried about the Fonz like man like give up but I also I Can't knock it because he probably got paid a lot of money do almost nothing right and he figured why not so here's the problem with it I don't blame those guys out for going out and and and making a buck when it's that easy to make\nBut the one that bothers me the most is gold rank are precious metals so the ones out there to do in the golden commercials or the silver commercials\nThey're making statements and making comments and and obviously they they probably don't know I mean they're just the spokes person but there are a lot of people that see those commercials and take that stuff to heart and they honestly start to believe that physical gold is the only way that you can protect yourself against um market crashes and hyperinflation and all that\nAnd and the reality is well hey that's not true you could just go out and and I'm\nOn I'm a gold ATF or something like that and avoid all of that but also what what's not being told to individuals and that commercial is there's not a lot of disclosure and what's interesting is there's a precious metals when it's in currency form\nBypasses a lot of regulation as far as disclosure goes\nAnd that's the reason we see all those commercials is a there is a very very old law and the books that says if its currency is not regulated in the same way that other security should be regulated just to summarize and so because it's not regulated we get a lot of these statements that aren't necessarily even true because it's not being regulated\nAnd also they're not telling you that well if you call up and you buy that gold you're going to pay a premium for it to your putting way more than the actual cost of gold or silver is\nAnd then they're gonna charge you a storage fees you got to put the stuff's somewhere and then if you ever want to get your money back out of it well they're gonna charge you for you to buy back from you as well so the reality is I don't see it as a very good investment because it's going to cost you every step of the way you're paying something either to buy and sell it or store\nAnd you could honestly just go out into the market and buy an ATF that would do exactly the same thing\nSo that bothers me about that but it but again this just goes about understanding all of your investment options how they work with the advantages and disadvantages are and building out a at a diversified portfolio but I think also actively managed than we do actively managed portfolios\nWhat that means is we're not gonna leave our clients in stocks if stocks are likely to do horribly I mean it just doesn't make sense or going to make some changes on our clients behalf\nIf markets are likely to do truly well we're going to help our clients my actively buying more equity positions get a more aggressive\nThe reality is understanding your portfolio and I also think work with a fiduciary a fee based advisor that has your best interests at heart will get a lot of people in every week dug but just want to find out more about what we do and how we do it and what it means to work with a\nAn advisor that uses active management and that is a fiduciary and I say if you're that person and you just want to know more about us and what we do just give us a call the next ten minutes and we'll sit you down for that complimentary analysis in financial plan\nI think I'll take your advice over the Fonz is advice Mike so I don't know he\nBelieves those financial commercials as kind of just entertainment take it\nTake it a as you will at face value so the comprehensive financial plan of Fifteen hundred dollar value coming to sit down with Mike and his team Italian wealth management call the next ten

John I talked to parents and he gave a few suggestions why\nAsk the questions what will happen to me if something happens to you\nSo we need to be thinking about uh whether or not the advisors working with a team what's the continuity or a succession plan with that advisor to give me advice\nIf you're trying to make a connection with a trusted individual what are the elements that are important to you so one of the things for clients to be considering is whether they're working with a professional seller a broker or professional buyer at advisor that's a good filter to be thinking about what kind of relationship you want to have\nAll right there's another financial advisor but I'll I'll take your your word as a as as golden here so what do you think about that and what he said to\nOf anything else to add about no I mean first of all ... I mean there are lots of great financial advisors out there and uh there are way more people that need help then there are financial advisor so I mean the first trick to this uh being successful in retirement\nAnd uh I think being comfortable and confident retirement is is is finding your person finding the right financial advisor\nSo I'd be the first one to give credit where credit's due I I liked the way that he framed that uh are you working with a professional seller or professional buyer I think that's that's pretty neat now I talked about it a little earlier when I when I mentioned um I said it differently but I said\nYou know are you working with an advisor that's a fiduciary or you're working with somebody that's a broker and ... products and they'd sell products because they are they get commissions on the products now I realize there's probably brokers listening right now they're like oh you know your ear\n[laughter] why are you bashing on us on it and I'm I'm not it's not that there's not a place for that I mean there are certain investments out there\nThat are going to be appropriate for individuals and the only form that those investments come in is is brokerage form so\nI'm not hitting it that hard but if you're working with an advisor that's only going to promote those types of investments I think that's a problem so I I I like the way that he he frame that\nHe mentioned a couple of things like are are you working with a team or you're working with just one person that's a good point so again there are a lot of gray financial advisors out there\nBut when you are investing the money that you've accumulated right over a twenty thirty forty year period of time and that's your life savings\nYou have to make sure it's protected and you have to know God Forbid something happens to your financial advisor what happens then mhm it's a perfectly legitimate question and you should be asking if he had an asteroid visor that ask them that question so our answer is we have a big team here and tell them look management\nI'm forty four years old I relatively healthy I have four kids at home and you know so my wife and I certainly hope that nothing ever happens to me\nBut that's not a guarantee and so for all of our clients are there's a plan for that right we have lots of advisors worker at telling wealth management and then there's also succession plan so all of our clients are taking care of whether I'm here or not\nBut if you're working with an advisor that doesn't have that\nYou know maybe it's just just one person and a little bit smaller outfit\nDoesn't mean they don't have a plan dog but I Would ask them right and I would want to know what the plane and say if something happens to you clearly you don't have a whole team of people around you it's it's you and your sister or what have you and that's fine I I like that sort of close personal warm relationship\nBut you need to know who you would contact God Forbid something happens that advisor that's a big deal so you know what their succession plan is you know the team part of it you know\nHey Mike ... that's interesting you brought that up because the last meeting I had with my advisor he and I were talking and he said I almost died\nI Would not want to retire either if I was a musician as successful has is you kind of miss the the glamour of the stage and\nYou know everybody know when you are and ah he so he is he's currently performing with is not dead yet to her so you know he's a different situation I mean it's not like somebody who's working in a factory that probably wants to retire and never ... retired but do you have you know clients that have\nOn retired like Phil Collins dead\nWell unfortunately Phil Collins is not my client\nAmazing I mean we're talking about I I I'm an as a child of the eighties you know I ... I was I'm right when he was doing all of his a lot of his best work you know I was like ten or twelve years old and you know I you you can remember\nThat time now in your life and that sort of music really started affecting you so he's fantastic actually my wife and I have talked about ash if he ever is touring and we can just go see him we have to do that I ... I think a good chance on the eighties I was an early enough\nFor shooting I wasn't old enough but at this point I Am so glad he's got a tour 'cause usually issues are only in England and you'd have to fly Ali over there and um and they're still out immediately but you know going back to just clients uh who on retiring like heated ... it happens from time to time\nBut the great thing about retiring is you mentioned Phil Collins when he gets to do what he wants to do any loves it may be hard to walk away from it\nBut for most of our clients are individual that I think retirement maybe just doesn't suit them and the sense that once you transition to retirement you got to figure out what to do with all of that time and all of us have interests that are going to occupy a hundred percent over time I mean I I Know a lot of us like to go play golf laws like the fish laws like to do\nX Y Z whatever your thing is you know it's your thing but but the flexibility to go do something you really want to do\nAnd you don't necessarily have to make a lot of money at it you just really like it I think those are the types of transitions that we see more than anything else he can go out and do exactly what he likes loves to do I love putting together financial plans for individuals would they know hey listen\nI'm working because I Want to work and because I really really enjoy this not because I have to\nAnd once you can show people that type of a a financial planning and that type of active management of their portfolio where they know hey okay I don't actually have to make money at this I'm just I get to have fun making money\nThat's great right and I enjoy it and our clients enjoy it and not everybody does it but I I I really like giving people that type of financial freedom\nFair enough Mike if you want that to financial freedom and a ... come sit down with Mike and his team midtown wealth management they offer this Fifteen hundred dollar value it's a comprehensive financial\nPlan and see if you want to retire or on retire and he deals with clients that are nearing retirement or already retired but maybe you need a little tweaking that plan or maybe you just need a a second opinion on your plan to comprehensive financial plan\nCalled the next ten minutes and you can get involved in that the numbers for oh seven to seven zero one thousand four o seven to seven zero one thousand and always at guarding your nest egg dot com so we just talked about Phil Collins and are being on retired getting back on the road making more music\nAnd there's something similar to this now that the NFL season is underway we noticed some lessons from the players that might also apply to those of us nearing retirement now former QB Danny Werfel says for him moving on from the game was a major transition\nMan well there's always uncertainty and that is so unnerving for all of us I think it's a\nDifficult is risky I remember going off to college and when my parents drove away just that feeling there's this both us excitement this open this this freedom the newness and then there's this fear of of what might happen inside I say to the word that comes to my mind is to trust\nIs obviously you've got to do the things that you need to do\nBut you can't control things that we try to control so often and so I think to be open and receptive and trust any of that phase\nBut it also comes back to earlier principles that you think\nYou today prepares you for tomorrow and I think making long term decisions and investments in delayed gratification can put you in a position where when you make those transitions becoming\nA much better place well you know in professional sports it's not if you're going to retire but it's when you're going to be retiring and basically forced to retire and you kind of end before you really want to cause many players\nRetire on their own in in professional sports not a whole lot of them do share but unlike Phil Collins where he retired but he's not injured or anything like that and it can still do it he\nCan go back to whenever he wants but athletes don't have that luxury usually so that's a huge transition for these athletes and a lot of them have issues with that to dealing with their new wife so how do you help people with that that can you know the biggest transition of their lives\nWhile the transition has really really good word for it because it's a huge change and what we find a week after week when we will meet with people and we'd go to this for a long time so I've known for a while but\nWhat people don't think about when they have a transition to retirement is is all the components that are required to transition retirement so I talk about this too certainly when we're

your happiness get details to\nGuarding your nest egg dot com now talking about how the market's doing so well right now only recently mark the tenth anniversary of the two thousand eight financial crisis and a lot of people are wondering could it happen again well of course that could end it might but\nNobody has a crystal ball ... financial author Suzie Ormond tells CNBC it's important to remember that the market bounce back from two thousand and eight and a big way\nA fortune was made Saturday and two thousand and I just found that if you hadn't sold that they hadn't panic you in the city so pretty today it wouldn't even be funny but they've got all that so they're starting to get nervous against should I should I Do that\nThey're forgetting the laugh and that the last ten years should have taught everybody\nMike let's talk real life here in Florida what's your advice or investors who might be getting a little nervous\nWell first of all I listen to that and I think that it's not easy to hang in there when markets were as bad as a way and I think the hanging their approach is is is very very hard for anybody to deal with particularly if they're close to retirement so it's one thing to say\nYou know now that we have a crystal ball and go on the radio or TV show or whatever you have and go hey listen if you adjust hung in there you'd be fine right now\nIt's not that simple and if you were suffering at that point in time and losing money hand over fist in your four one K. or Iran or whatever retirement account it was\nAnd it was affecting your retirement hang in there is not easy to do a lot of people let emotions take over and and got out and then they didn't have a strategy to get back in and and and those people you know they feel like they missed out but\nI guess I just take issue with anybody saying hey you know you should have hung in there everything it'd be just fine it's not easy to just hang in there when things get really really rough you know it's your money it's a ... it's very very personal\nSo the flipside of that as it is having a strategy and my argument against that sort of hanging their approach would be well yeah that sounds well and good and and and she's sitting there saying if you just hold on to be so pretty right now well\nIt wasn't that pretty for a long time you're going to wait a lot of people you know five six seven years just to get back to even and now maybe in your portfolio you're feeling better about it but it took a really long time so the alternative that was well what if you're working with an investment advisor that has a strategy that's tactical right actively managed portfolios\nAnd we're looking at indicators and we say it was based on what's going on and makes no sense to hold equities at this point in time so we are going to go ahead and get out and if we're wrong you'll miss out on a portion of games but our clients are individuals that are either retired or close to retirement so bottom line is they're more willing to give up a portion of games the narrative take big losses\nAnd that's essentially how we manage our portfolios but\nHad you done it at that point in time Christian you'd be much better off like what if I got out ... indicators weren't good and then I waited for indicators the get go when I got back in and will\nNot only would you not have lost a ton of money when markets crashed but you also would have had an opportunity to invest all that money that you saved by not losing it into a market that was lower and that's what they're not talking about their\nSlogan we promote working with a fiduciary and working with an a fee based advisor that has a vested interest in doing well we promote actively managed portfolios we don't want to hang in their approach and Christian I think we just have to add value if I can show somebody how to get a higher average rate of return\nThan what they're currently doing that have been easy they pay us there's no reason to work with us so we sit down when people week after week and we put together financial plans analysis to help them figure that out and put that financial planning their hands so if you're listening now and you let it comes down to let them else's for that complimentary financial plant\nJust give us a call in the next ten minutes and will do that for you complimentary\nFor seven to

go\nWould've hate to have missed that ... some gun so my ... actually kind of an interesting question you like music I Love music when you Katie go to a concert whether it's just date night with you guys or if it's something maybe for the kids I don't know right in one of those folks that stay till the end or do you leave a couple of songs are only be traffic\n[laughter] so it depends a lot on who the who the band okay it's because at this point with the kids right we do both so we do the Venus and bands at Kenyon I enjoy and then um we also do a few things that I'm like is like so\nAn example of something kids would be more interested than us would be I mean I was sixteen year old daughter so we and the and then also a nine year old daughter and six year old sons were Taylor Swift is pretty big like now in that group yeah I wasn't particularly compelled to stay to the un [laughter]\nOkay so the mother used to lift but not your favorite thing ever known not my favorite thing and I'm sitting there imagining trying to get out there and everybody was trying to go so legal early was I'm actually pretty rate\nOK not situation but yeah we're we're totally open to hanging around if if we don't have anywhere to be seen as you might not\nLike Jimi Hendrix coming out of us will something iconic like that you\nKnow yeah I mean if we can do Crosby stills and Nash I mean clearly at this point you know I Would say till the end but it'd be really hard to pull off\nYou're right the kids to change everything and if they're with you you might need to head out of their cars they could get a little and say well we like to reminisce about things that happened in yesteryear that were a lot of fun and also just a part of our history and pop culture history and we also like to talk about how you can use active wealth management\nTo develop your own strategy that's personalized for you and your situation based on what you've worked hard to save accumulate invest all these years\nTo be financially confident now and in the future of your retirement and to have a retirement income plan he's got questions about\nDoesn't guarding your nest egg dot com or you can speak to Mike or another team member here in Florida off the air force there were seven seven zero one thousand you dream about retirement that's one thing it's fun to do it's an opportunity where you can join dig and\nStink of everything that pay for that dream is another thing might the tips that could help people get ready to leave the full time workforce and fail away toward their own dream\nIt's a transition and we do talk about that are on the radio program certainly when people coming to visit a lot of the individuals that were talking to some of them heard the program one times I've been listening for years you know and they said hey listen I'm I'm looking to make that transition I just want to make sure I'm prepared\nAnd part of that is taking a look at exactly where they're at so they're very very typical scenario would be somebody coming in let's just say it's a married couple he has his investment assets she has her investment asset so each of them have been working each of whom have been sending money aside for retirement\nAnd uh both of them have been the matches and and they're just done a good job and they're trying to figure out how to make the transition the biggest issue with the transition is figuring out I mean in in at least an individual's mines is how do I go from putting money into my retirement accounts for the past three or four years\nTo pulling money out of my financial accounts for the next Thirty years or so\nAnd not having that money run out right and the big question is how do I invest the money to make that happen now we talked earlier about inflation and what interest rates were like in the early eighties and the math and be really really simple if we could just go down to the bank and get a CD for Eighteen percent\nRight I mean and what's in your ... retirement of you to fix Eighteen percent of most people go like hey I'm outta here you know as a whole take this job and shut it kind of thing [noise]\nBut that's not the way it works we're not getting those interest rates at the bank were not likely to ever get those interest rates at the bank unless something goes horribly wrong along the way because that means we've got crazy inflation and the government's had to raise interest rates up to that point to um basically stop an even bigger problem [noise]\nSo what we're doing is we're we're helping people create efficient portfolios\nTo accomplish what their goals are and not everybody unless you spend a lot of time every week again we do this Monday to friday every week and we do this radio program on the weekends but not everybody knows how to take that portfolio and create an efficient portfolio by efficiency I mean how to get the highest rate of return I can get\nBut I also want that returned with the least amount of fees and least amount of ...\nAnd most people right now markets have been good so they might look at their portfolio and think well you know my average rate of return pick a number of let's say you're averaging eight or nine percent per year on your portfolio over the past ten years and and this past year has been really good me you could be up eight ten twelve Thirteen fourteen percent this year\nBut what's your long term average what then also more importantly once you transition to retirement how much risk are you taking to get that return so it was a little process I I I go through with individuals and we're sitting down the office and then we'll take a look at their portfolio and look at what their average rate of return is and\nProgram worked for these patients in
