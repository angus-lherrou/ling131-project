Kessler came in it's not like ... in a while you were probably lead you do if they come back what she was unable to do what he looked OK\nBut the the collar Kaepernick thing I don't understand why any gene that has quarterback issue doesn't give them a look I understand that there's all the backlash if the kneeling and what not the only reason I don't see the jaguars doing it is because\nThat's what the President Trump's tweets and with this narrative of calling Kaepernick just respects the military with the military presence you have in Jacksonville which is probably larger than many other NFL markets with the naval base up there\n... or I just don't see that happening I think you would you would turn away a number of fans are with that signing if you were to do it it would certainly help them if they want to try and go for a Super Bowl I just don't see it happening up\nAll right so a ... I think most of our listeners agree with you\nAnd there's a lot of reasons why\nFirst of all I don't think it happens but I also ask you about this since I got a sports guy on it is UCF is UCF getting hosed in football I read this now on a curb street uh Utah State Appalachian State Fresno state these teams are better and more deserving than UCF [noise]\nYeah if you look at their schedules and and we could spend thirty minutes on this breaking down those schools schedules versus UCS those school schedules are no stronger\nThey make out a little lucky made with scheduling because one of their power I think that they went plate and lost to is a little stronger than that or North Carolina of course the hurricanes have affected UCF put her her street is certainly riled up\nUCF Twitter Bob and I think they're going to be up in Jacksonville sympathy UCF by week\nThey're up there for Florida Georgia expect to see a lot of UCF signs\nBut a big white than out of a like a tweet to college game day saying that the system is broken and I think you have to agree when sixty plus schools\nAre not given a true chance to make the play off all those group of five schools outside the power five no matter what you do it seems when you look at the rankings have a chance to actually get into the playoffs and compete for national championship unlike what you have\n... and she played basketball and baseball and softball and all these other sports\nAnd must not be a let's let's not kid ourselves cursory has never been a fan of UCF self proclaimed national championship he's ripped out he's rip UCF for the last year um I Do want to know about a McKenzie Milton the quarterback who did not play last weekend\nUm many were speculating maybe it was some discipline which that wasn't the case he was being rested um his backup did a good job they blew out east Carolina is is this young man going to be OK going forward regime need more attention medically [noise]\nI think you'll be fine they gotta buy week this week before temple comes to town Josh I realized that use Carolina was not that strong of a teeny felt that they could win with Darrell Mack\nThe backup quarterback in there and they certainly did they one thirty seven to ten or so I think it was a wrestling thing I think if you got into the second half of that game and UCF was behind or maybe it was got down to one scored game you may have seen the ... ... email ... come in because she did all up and from all accounts for folks but I talk to you up there\nHe looks fine but he is a lot more bang up from the big steak and trying to run the football\nOr in previous games then was led on or the light on 'em so I think it was just a wrestling thing and I think it will be back on the field step on a couple of weeks\nAll right how are the lines at a Disney\nSo you know it it doesn't matter if it's Monday or Saturday or Sunday you got to get the fast passes and uh so you got to plan ahead I think that's what I'm slowly learning with a a two year old and so\nAll right we'll listen to have a good time thank you Christian Christian brewery channel nine sports guy or out of Disney helping us out with the Colin Kaepernick like border thing you see up et cetera let's continue on with a look outside with Brian ... who has to feel\nA lot better about this forecast and those ones where it was just over and over Ninety Ninety nine because he's broken the streak here's Brian ... with your five day brought to you by toughie tyrants auto\nAre awesome fault pattern is here low eighties this afternoon and looking good and then for tonight a great night temperatures down to about sixty five just them scattered cloud\nEighty three partly cloudy tomorrow ... about twenty percent up to eighty four on Wednesday the arrangements again twenty percent the better chance of some scattered showers Thursday and friday but that'll knock our highs down into the seventies for the upcoming weekend\nFrom general not I wouldn't ...

I don't know where if you you know he was in a restaurant\nWith his wife Elaine Chao who by the way you don't mess with her I don't know who these people think they are but\nThere there are just you know there's the people that you just don't mess with Elaine is one of those ladies\nYou just don't mess with her do you remember how when they were stopped coming out of their house and Mitch McConnell calmly gets into the SUV she now delaying she goes over transportation secretary she marches right over to the other side of the vehicle and she's all up in these people's faces\nI mean tiger mom unleashed so they were at a restaurant and they were having dinner in Kentucky and still do sure decides to\nGet in their face and he grabs Mitch McConnell's doggy bag of food throws it outside and he was screaming at him why don't you get outta here why don't you leave the entire country\nAnd what gets me and I am going to play the video free but what gets me is the woman who uh I don't know if it was a woman who shot the video ... someone actually had the wherewithal to go I'm going to sell this to TMZ I'm going to sell this footage to TMZ\nThinks like this instead of stopping you know somebody from being completely ignorant you're thinking almost ... TMZ my gosh we live in South park the\nThis is where we are so then this\nGuy decides to go full only Roy Jenkins at Mitch McConnell and this restaurant right\nAnd\nDecides to go full on\nJay and can before\nAt before other customers smartly get out and and decide to uh put a stop to it because they were tired of it [noise] so anyway I'm going to places that I Want you to listen to us because this is what was recorded a and a ultimately ended up on the ... this was Mitch McConnell getting screened bat in a restaurant [laughter]\nSo [laughter]\nThe woman I don't know if it was the woman recording the video of it was someone sitting at her table but I heard that ... that one person they did you watch and then I see you guys remember Christopher walking in the continental on ethanol\nYou remember the ... you got to go watch it if go look for it go Google it if you've never seen it because this is one of my favorite characters that Christopher Walken ever played I watch this and I was in in school it was so good\nIt it it he's talking to the camera and then the camera without stretch an arm and it was almost like chubby fingered arm with a glove on it\nAnyway right after somebody said dad match I see somebody with the continental chubby hand grabbing a margarita and second it down and I'm like really anyway that really just stuck with me that and the fact that someone goes I'm On the the al ...\nWho thinks like that but thankfully there was a table of people that decided to shut this guy out they were tired of it just I was having an entire he he goes in there and nobody comes to his rescue\nHe's screaming at Mitch McConnell who's sitting there\nLike a father in law just looking chilling you know sip and his his sipping his cold drink very slowly and Elaine Chao just confront them I don't even know what it said they see her head shaking so I Know it's like we're on full on level tiger mom mode here so she's not having it and the guys screaming and hollering\nHow are you in life that you decide that you're going to bust up in a restaurant and do this to somebody\nBy the way it's not free speech when you're on someone else's private property doing this crap because you believe in private property rights don't you or are you a communist because then that the business owner 'cause they get out scream all you want to but on somebody's private property they throw you out screw your free speech did\nYou hear the customers actually told me believe in below yeah that was pretty cool yeah that and I'm so glad that they did that I'm so glad that they did that\nI I I'm [laughter] I'm I'm\nI was just shocked by all of this so we have that that happened over the weekend was this guy screaming at Mitch McConnell and apparently this is I I'm not going to accept this is a new normal I'm I'm just not\nSevere in in Florida the New York post I Can't even play any of this I Can't play single bit of this audio a\nNewer posted that house

blank something whatever one person how's you and your blanking Democrats just take a gander\n[laughter]\n\nYeah that's a mob mob\nAnd we're going to have a little conversation about it because I had some people saying that no words that it it was okay because\nFinally people deserve it yeah\nAnd that's not how this works not how this\nWhy couldn't believe the left may be paid for people to act that way but either way if it is from the right nobody's backing it up mhm yep\nExactly [noise] so we have a we're going to come back and we're going to discuss that as well and we have a lot of other

going to withdraw he says that the that a parent late secretary of defense James Mattis is completely aligned with Trump on\nPulling out of that nuclear treaty with Russia\nOr so I mean whatever Madison is okay with I think I'm OK with uh the INS they say that Russia has already violated it on this and then the caravan and all that stuff Steven ... with the D.C international advisory he'd say foreign policy expert having previously advice to a former VP Dick Cheney on foreign policy Steven always a pleasure to have anything for joining us\nHappy to be with you\nSo I'm going to start first off I'm going to start with the Russian treaty that's the analysis on board with the president pulling out of this date the claim is that Russia's already violated this is this going to spark an arms race though\nWell whatever arms race there's going to be is already underway and there's two major throughout the United states is not alone in saying that Russia has violated disagreements or the United kingdom\nOr other allies are completely on board and noting that and it's really a question of what you can do about it and the other major flaw that others agree with the United states about is that it doesn't capture China\nAnd China is the most rapidly growing nuclear arsenal on the planet and so the foreign policy of Nineteen eighty seven doesn't necessarily cover the needs of twenty eight team and the Trump Administration has made a habit\nOf calling out ineffectual agreements threatening to withdraw from them and oftentimes it can provoke constructive debate about how to get back into a better agreement ... but I strongly sent that's where this is\nRight and at this so why do it now as opposed to I mean obviously this has been going on to with a violation of dying by Russia for quite some time ah why why at this particular point would he would he choose to to withdraw now\nWell from my point of view is never a bad day to do a good thing so when we needed to do it it's a good time to start it may have something to do with invested or John ... being national security advisor I don't think we've ever had a more experienced arms control and count up deliberation expert\nAs national security advisor and so we've got someone who is uniquely experience to go and engage this challenge I think part of it is that there's a lot of intelligence come again or in and out of government that suggest that China's really breaking farther ahead\nAnd I think that's what finally tipped the arguments on this is not just the U.S Russia issue it's a global nuclear capabilities issue and from that at this point of view but there's no reason limiting ourselves if the other party is\nViolating it and a third party that's not in\nThe group is running it\nMhm is there a chance that because the president is you know obviously would like to include China and some sort of agreement is that what would they be would they do that is that something that he would even be able to get them to do\nWell he's been able to do things that most experts didn't think could be done already so I Can't say it's impossible because a new NAFTA was impossible and then here we are so and so but I think that there's no reason to believe the Chinese will want to do that and I don't think that the Russians Sara Lee walked\nTo renegotiate because they had a good deal that did what they wanted which was to annoy the United states unlimited its ability to deal with China a and that basically able to get all of the followers of arms control theology to get into high church
