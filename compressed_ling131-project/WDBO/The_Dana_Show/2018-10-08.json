that ... whatever community whichever priest accumulate you live in across the nation\nTomorrow more than likely tomorrow is the final day for you to vote for you to register to vote in your local election\nAnd that's what we need desperately because what we saw this past weekend\n\nAs the U.S Senate was confirming the vote for judge Kavanaugh and and the roll call was out there [noise] um I found it scary the this deranged behavior of these these militants\nIn the gallery\nAnd you see I'm unless unless you want our nation to be handed\nTo these ... these cycles\n... they're they're mentally disturbed [noise] I Know that the Democrat leadership would like to distance itself from them but that is what they have bread that is what they support that is their base that's where they depend on the show up the galvanized vote to do the TV they get out the vote campaigns for the Democrats\nSo on this day we're I mean we've got thirty one base\nThe month of October and election day is the sixth of November ah tomorrow is the final day for you to register to vote so my question to your patriots because I'm blessed on this day\nTo to make this appeal to you your family like minded friends and family not only in your immediate circle of influence but across the nation\nFolks that you may have back in California in the mid west in many parts of the country got brothers and sisters and extended family who are like minded or conservative mind who would like to preserve our nation and would like to arrest this path that we're off to make sure that those crazies those\nThose deranged cycles\nAnd the gallery that those individuals shouting at the top of their lungs disrupting the vote in the U.S and they they can do absolutely nothing to end this will\nAnd the folks who you know the ... the sergeant that arms the staff of security staff at the U.S and what you're talking about earning their keep one after the other if you if you don't know what I'm Talking about this past Saturday afternoon\nAnd perhaps you picked up the headline but the judge Kavanaugh has been confirmed this justice to the U.S and uh but you did not listen to the actual roll call\nWhen vice president Pence and the clerks there they were calling out and eat center to say your name\nThere must have been I Would say let's say\nSeven maybe eight individuals who went by security\nThey didn't have anything sharp on them they didn't have any posters on them and they just made it into the gallery sat themselves down but they strategically placed themselves so that every minute or so or with key senators let's say Senator Flake\nWhen he cast as well but they shouted at the top of their lives and interrupted the process just so that the American public would here\nI don't know the the reason I don't know what goes through the minds of these fools\n... how is it that they think that is gonna win me over how is that they think that's going to win anyone over to their side this cycle pact arranged behavior oh there's wailing at the top of their life and as security\nWas dragging these people away and vice president Pence was waiting for sergeant arms to restore order resisted resort started orange restore order\n\nThe screeching and howling and the screaming as they were being dragged away even in the halls and they kept on screaming and crying and Halloween\nMy wife and I were taking the vote in lives there were staying in place and she was she was screaming at the top as long as it's a charity you need to do something you know these people were coming yeah [noise] I didn't want to say anything I yes they knew these people were coming\nAnd it's our government\nIt's their government the government that's been voted in governs over them it governs over us remind household um their household as well and they've got every right to go up there and said\nUnless they do something dangerous or try to hurt centers I think that gallery would stay open needs to stay open will stay open it's just that there will be aggressive about\nExpressing their their twisted and wrong point of view\nAs they're being dragged away I I'm looking at my wife and until her because I sound like the the\nWay the screen it sounded to me like like defeated demons designs with really like the wailing and gnashing of teeth they tortured soul that was being dragged away that's what it sounds to me they lost and they can't get over it\nMy question to your friend I'm less you wish the government be handed over at the Democrats and I'll make it real simple\nDemocrats need to be voted out of office all of the national low state level we must not reward this deranged behavior these protest miss me or that they brought upon Brett Kavanaugh the destruction of\nHis reputation of the attacks on his family we must never reward that\nSo I'm asking you friend your tired when [noise]\nBecause this is the call to action this is a battle cry you are needed on the front lines of our election tomorrow is the last day for many people to register to vote in many states you know when when it is for you it is that the case more than likely the majority of states I Do believe tomorrow is the last day\nAnd as potentially impotent you think you are in this election process 'cause I suspect\nThat you might be part of that group of people that are ready to ready to go to the polls and and have your say but you don't need to bring your immediate circle of influence\nYou need to find yourself family members neighbors for life might have don't waste your time with the people but they're just going to be\nEating up all your time bending your ear chewing area about how you're wrong and Donald Trump is kinda Satan and ... and all that you know those people are you don't know who those people up you're wasting time with don't waste your time fighting with on like they'll be wasting is on calling up and trying to recruit them to vote\nTo find out on their own\nBut in your immediate circle of influence\nFamily members like minded parishioners church members neighbors business partners this is a call to action front starting today this on the day before the last day they're registered to vote why don't you make a quick list\nPushed the vote empower the vote to save our nation do your part because that's what is going to say we must unite

live coverage from ABC News that to Washington right now we're ABC News political analyst Robert is standing by and see Brett Kavanaugh said politics has no role on the court the politics for certainly here at the ceremony\nWill very much so and he said a very different tone and the president did he went out of his way the new justice to say this court is not a partisan or political institution\nHe said very pointedly the confirmation process was over that he didn't have any bitterness or but it was to the president who brought the confirmation process up and talked about as you mentioned the pain that the Kavanaugh family went through\nAnd um instead of a striking a unifying note the president struck a partisan note and struck a divisive note by bringing up the hearings and signaled\nThat he is going to be campaigning very heavily on this very issue as he goes around the country this fall and he's got a very heavy triborough scheduled bread is going to be in many of the key states and many of the key district and you can bet that that\nI'm a scene we heard from him tonight I'm ah recalling the bitterness of the confirmation fight is going to be very much on his mind because it's one of the issues that he feels strongly can rally the Republican base which by Republicans have admitted\nHave not been as intense not been as enthusiastic gr energetic as a Democrat so\nTwo very different tones are Kavanaugh out of his way to look forward but the president chose to look at least to some extent backward at the er at the events of the last few weeks for it\nAnd see looking at the courts you know all eight other justices current justices were in the room liberals conservatives they were all there are when does the country start seeing Brett Kavanaugh is one of the nine justices and stopped seeing him is is this controversial figure can day at this point\n[noise] [noise] well I think it does start tonight I think uh he went out of his way to put on his justice hat tonight to stress unity talking about being a member of a team of nine several times he talked about\nUm we don't operate on the court as part isn't figures or even though a during his hearing he struck a very partisan tone I think he regrets that\nUh and he even has said he regretted it by in his op ed page piece in the wall Street Journal talking about how the very strong emotions of the moment and being accused of\nA misconduct that he felt was unfair uh he responded in the heated way but I think tonight\nIt was the beginning of of an attempt to say I'm now a justice I'm not a partisan figure I'm not joining a partisan court obviously politics will always play a part in the court um and the court will be very sharply divided between liberal and conservative wings but he went out of his way tonight or to try to get past\nThe very obvious and angry partisanship of his own hearing\nThe cabinet will start hearing cases bright and early tomorrow morning he says his
