take care of it when they should have and they regret it they didn't do the right treatment I'm not saying that you know the find medical profession doesn't offer a lot of good solutions for a lot of things they save lives every day\nBut we're not talking about his people that take one drug after another drug after another try getting injections a contemplating a invasive final surgery which have sometimes is a great option for people\nBut sometimes it's not sometimes you've got to step back and go what else can I Do what else is there for me what are the options are there and again that's the basis of my show what are the options giving people options\n[noise] so you do have options when the takeaway here is you do have options it's not just about taking drugs doing ... and then getting surgery or whatever their drug free ways to get better stuff we do every day and our practices that orange wellness even simple lifestyle changes ... hugely affect us\nWe see patients every day would be in the car actually there's never been given these options other than to take this pill that pill get surgery have injections blah blah blah\nSo what are some options chiropractic as I mentioned

down to the last minute here on a Sunday\nI Want to repeat the phone number one more time for seven to eight seven five one to to the Web sites orange wellness dot com remember free MRI review free consultation and remember I Do have a book\nBut what if I asked the question a little bit differently and I said I've got two portfolios both of them are averaging eight percent per year one of them's half as risky as the other and how would you like to invest your money or some or what I Know from experience of what I Would but all of our listeners would say is\nHey listen put it on the one averaging eight percent with half the risk because\nIt makes no sense to take twice the risky right to take to get a certain return and and all I really did in that example Christian is provide you with more information information is really important so sitting down doing financial plans getting all the information that you can about all the investment options that are available to you\nAnd an answering questions like have you saved enough for retirement and if you have saved enough for retirement how do you need to invest that money to make sure you can maintain your current standard of living adjusted for inflation in taxes throughout retirement\nRegardless of how long you live and if you have that information and it I think it's empowering it allows people to go well hey listen I Know I'm going to be successful and retirement so if I'm retired I can stay that way\nOr if I'm not retired yet at least I have a plan in place so that I Know I can transition into retirement and so for anybody who's listening if you'd like to sit down and that was put together that comprehensive financial plan for you an answer those types of questions I'd be happy to do that just give us call it the next ten minutes and will do it for your complimentary\nFor seven to seven zero one thousand that's for the last seven seven zero one thousand\nAll within the next ten minutes and that kind of come in and sit down with my had him and the team at town wealth management goes through that comprehensive financial plant that's a Fifteen hundred dollar value by the way that there is no charge if you call within the next ten minutes find out more to at guarding your nest egg dot com\nFelt this generic advice that we hear we need to be careful out that's why we need to come in for a comprehensive financial plan\nUnless you're a generic person\nWe don't have generic 'cause I didn't have to\nTalk about what it's like when someone comes in for the first step that comprehensive financial plan what questions do you usually ask in that first meeting with a new clients someone you've never met before\nSure will first thing that we do is somebody and again we we aren't all over the state doing seminars or anything so people right radio show and they say you know what I Would like to sit down and have you put together a a comprehensive financial plans\nTo first thing we're doing obviously is I'm getting the contact information but then we're going to email them with the confirmation of their point of renting emailed them a workbook\nOkay and it's not math questions is not our guys on right now that's already here and there were not testing anyone we we just need certain information in order to build a lot of financial planning it's easier if we give people at work but so they can prepare that information\nSo other than going to do is they're going to bring in the U.S the information that we need including investment accounts statements that sort of things we can do analysis 'cause one of the first things that we are going to do is do a complete analysis of their existing portfolio because it's entirely possible Christian they're already on the right track\nRight nah it's entirely possible that either the really good at planning themselves that they've got a really good plan or maybe they're not get a plan and they just got real lucky with the allegations that but it is possible that you don't need an investment advisor not at not everybody needs one okay so we\nDo that how you make a living and you're saying that sometimes people may not mean\n... it's a pretty big pond and there's a lot of flood of people that a lot of fish out there so to speak so there's plenty of people that need help and there's a lot of people don't need help and I'd be the first one to admit that everybody needs help and if you don't need help we're not going to try to a shooting ourselves in there I mean that relationships work you know\nIf that makes sense they fill out that information for they come in us that some things well yeah ...\nI'm sure so uh so that they've come in and were putting together the analysis foreign and uh there were also getting the information we need things like what are your goals what do you want to accomplish in retirement\nUm if you're not retired when do you want to retire how much income do you need to maintain your current standard of living you know all of these things and and and so literally people share with us what they would like to do in retirement or how they vision their own retirement\nAnd then we build that into a financial plan\nAnd so through the analysis and then through the planning and the planning includes certainly you know taxes and\nAnd all that were to get some answers for and so most of the people that we sit down with Christian they they've done a really good job of preparing for retirement and I'm able to say hey listen you're you're on track but if you tweak this little little bit that a little bit you know your portfolio will be more efficient and if you're getting a higher rate of return\nWhile at the same time taking less risk to get that return\nCommon sense dictates you'll be more successful and retirement and obviously with more information which which they're getting it's very helpful so that's what we're doing and so by the time we've done all this planning what they're going to do is they're going to walk out of our office with a financial plan and their hands okay and\nWhat I encourage them to do is take that financial plan and put it to good use so maybe you have a current financial advisor and you really wanna keep working without advisor I Would recommend that they take that financial plan over to that advisor and say hey this is what I Want you know can you please implement this for me [noise]\nSome people Christian they for one reason or another they don't work went to work with a financial advisor or they they feel confident that they can implement the strategies on their own\nAnd so what we'll do is we'll show them how to implement it themselves right they can save the advisory fee by doing it on there and a Christian you know there's a quite a few people they liked the idea of having somebody that has a vested interest in them doing well after ... after and take care of their portfolio so we're ... and we're fee based advisors\nSo in our clients do well we do well when our clients do poorly we do poorly\nSo we have a vested interest in our clients doing very well because if they're doing very well we'll do very well and also Christian it's great to have happy clients ... actually refer their friends and I don't know for sure yeah yeah so so all of these things go into that planning process whether you work with us or not we just want to provide value\nAnd that's why we put the financial planning everyone's hands but what I'd say is for anybody who's listening if you'd like to come sit now find out what we're all about because of that financial planning process walk out of our office with a financial plan in your hands just give us a call and the next ten minutes and will do that for your complimentary\nFor zero seven to seven zero one thousand that's four zero seven to seven zero one thousand call within the next ten minutes that comprehensive financial planning at the Fifteen hundred dollar value\nBut complementary if you reach out to Mike and the team at town wealth management in the next ten minutes and they can do that at their offices here in Florida in Orlando

the are you from Nineteen sixty eight you know after they scored their first hit with that song John ... says\nThat he and the rest of the band begin to have the same worry that a lot of other musicians to gosh you know what this is big they can we keep this going\nAs Suzie Q is zooming up the charges and we were starting to play out more places and even fly across the country to you know play play in different places I Begin to really kind of worry about what's on the other side of that phrase one hit wonder was really in my mind\nAnd that's a big scary things for musicians obviously they overcame that had many hits after\nMy people tend to pick some of their investment the same way and say you know what I'm at the top of the chart right now that I'm gonna hang in there with that you know just put all my eggs in one basket if you will but here's an album that can be a one hit wonder could be a one time saying maybe it's one stock this just done really well for you just don't know\nWhy things change things change for corporations and we can look I mean right now we think of these companies that are doing really really well\nAnd um you can look back and go well jeeze if I if I had only known apple if I'm if in the eighties I mean you know when I saw everybody carrying around that bag with the big multi colored I'm On a you know if only I had known they were going to do this whole thing involving um iPhones and iPads and I paused and all this\nYou know I Know what a should've could've mhm and it kind of sale you know but you go back a little bit further and you look at companies like Kodak right and um you know there's a time where you know Kodak was on top of the world\nThey were doing it you know not just doing stuff that we know they're doing I mean they were actually had contracts with the government to do and develop all the the photos from satellites mean everything's going great I mean actually knew a guy\nThat was an executive with Kodak and um he retired with a phenomenal pinch and that was and and his pension was like\nIt was literally like five hundred thousand dollars a year was his penchant for eight different different well guess what worst Kodak now I mean that's not it basically the you know they're out of business so who knew that the digital camera would come out and put out of business a company like Kodak that develops\nFilm that happened in my godfather to he helps would also manufacturers film but right right I'm just saying he had a similar retirement working with Kodak and that was pretty high up there and that kind of all went away\nAnd it went away so there are lots and lots and lots of stories like that at some point in time it's just what happens I mean I think Apple's are phenomenal company are they always going to be on top probably not right because we live in a country where competition is encouraging\nAnd innovation is encouraged so we we just we need a plan for all of that and if we could just know what the next great thing is going to be you know I guess we'd all be fine\nBut it's probably not bitcoin you know I get questions have felt that um and and here lately I think the newest thing or the cannabis stocks and everybody really getting into that as a matter that thing out there's always something right we would all like to um\nI guess I have a windfall at some point because it sounds really exciting the problem is that's not good financial planning I mean it just isn't and waiting for our\nOur big payday to come in isn't good financial planning and and good financial planning is well listen it takes discipline it takes saving it takes a setting money aside in investing in letting him grow over time and the people that we work with every single week are typically those individuals right they're they're calling up because they did make sacrifices and they did some money aside\nAnd they have had money sitting in for one k.'s and for all three ... and you know if you work with the government of ESP account or if you work you know for the state of Florida enough for us accounting and they've made sacrifices along the way and now they're just looking to make that transition\nThey need to know how to transition into retirement right or as they're getting very close to retiring than you know how to make sure that they protect that mistake because we\nIm or what happened last and markets crashed the hobby well yeah the individuals that didn't have\nActively managed portfolios unfortunately they had to write it down and and and if they had the the fortitude to hang in there which you know a lot of 'em did they wrote back a bit but not everybody has afforded to to do that and they got the wrong time it is those types of things that can wreck retirement and we need to find a way to\nMake sure that that we're investing money responsibly but but again particularly close to retirement or in retirement how do I invest these dollars so that I Want to take advantage of market gains but I also I I Can't afford it takes huge losses and so what I Know about all of our clients\nIs they want the most that they can earn that with the highest rate of return they can get there just I wanted to take a lot of risk to get there\nAnd so all of our portfolios are built that way away from our most aggressive investors are most conservative investors were putting together financial plans to help them accomplish their goals are also explain to them that these are actively managed portfolios we are ... advisors we have a vested interest in doing well\nIf you lost half your money in your portfolio\nIs going to affect us to miss a really big problem if all of our portfolios lost fifty percent we lose fifty percent of our revenue for the same period of time\nSo building out of a financial planner showing people how to be successful and retirement not only is it rewarding for us right but we're also putting people in front of investments that they probably didn't realize existed to start with\nRight that's true and that's also really important because most people are are most familiar with ... with their current financial advisor or whatever situation there and\nSo you know going back to not being a one hit wonder right or not just relying on one particular investment to make things work for you\nAnd give us a call if you want to sit down and we can show you what the options are but having a diversified portfolio is actively managed I don't care how you slice it it's gonna beat betting on some particular position doing really really well for a yeah some people are gonna get lucky\nWell you never know what you're going to need with your finances actually it shouldn't be that way you should know exactly what you need but your finances if you're working with the right adviser\nAnd that's what Mike and his team of advisors that talent wealth management spends all day doing here in Florida as making sure that you see an older half what you need for your own success in retirement what your investments\nTaxes looking at all these different issues healthcare costs and make sure that you have a plan you can feel confident in\nIf you've got questions about that you can visit guiding an Aztec dot com or you can speak to a team number right now off the air for zero seven to seven zero one thousand but most analysts are in agreement that we're going to see a market correction but they don't agree about when that might happen\nDon't invest ... CNBC that we do still have some time\nWe're in I Would say the seventh inning of this cycle I think that we're at the stage in the cycle where interest rates are being raised wearing the later stage maybe we have two more years I Would say in to the site or something like that\nDo you agree with that make you think we have another two years of the market doing really well\nWell here's the thing I Know Christian as things change right when they change all the time so if everything were to remain a basically like it is now for you know for all the information that we have remains current I'm really really optimistic about the economy I like what's going on businesses are doing well I'm going to continue to do well\nAnd it could be two years we recommend that our clients a visit with us or at least to talk to us say every six months quarterly is even better but but but six months to a year 'cause things are changing over time\nIt could be two years Christian but at this point I'm what I'm most worried about is how good things are right so so things can be really really good and then they're almost too good and so to good is is a relative term we all want to make lots and lots of money in the market that would be great we all want to not have to worry about market crashes that would be great\nBut when things get really really good and he mentioned the fed raising interest rates they're going to try to slow this economy down\nI think back to prior to every market crash things typically are really really good right I mean people are kind of high on live lots of jobs out there are lots of money being made lots of investing being made people are buying new houses are buying boats you know they're they're buying luxury items for like a better word\nAnd then things always seem to you know all of a sudden you know got real bad real quick and and and now those boats people bought got real cheap and the fancy cars people by got real cheap and the real estate people got got real cheap and\nAnd that's the market cycle so we we need to understand more about the cycles and how they work and we need to understand what does it mean when the stock market's gets overbought right and how's it going to reflect us personally because that's\nYou know it is actually happening a little bit right now you need a little bit over ... how long can we sustain this so what I expected that the economy if nothing else pops up is that this this is good as things are as it gets a little bit overheated\nAnd when things get overheated you know people extend themselves rather than they probably should oh for sure and then you know we wind up getting a a bad market and that could happen\nI don't know you know six months a year two years from now this is why we need to be flexible Christian people make comments like it's going to be two years\nAs it winds up being two years in the market crashes that guy is going to be out saying he called it yeah that's true you know what I mean I'm\nI'm the one that sort of putting myself in the back if it winds up being\nA year or he'll come up with some excuse for why he was wrong yeah well I'm wrong because it's changed so it's always a moving target which is why I think it's important that you're working with an investment advisor that that has your best interests at heart you know work with somebody who's going to help you with this if you don't you don't feel like doing it by yourself\nOr you might not even capable of doing it yourself but working in an advisor that has a vested interest in doing well to help you navigate these markets in somebody to be proactive not somebody who just that just says well\nI'm hanging in there right we hate hanging their Christian because hang in there for people that are retired last time people hung in there the U.S and he was around fifty one percent so depending on your allocation of equities you'd probably lost a lot of money hanging there didn't work out too good\nAgain whether it's six months from now a year from now two years from now we need to have a financial plan and I think working with an advisor that'll help navigate that for you is really really important\nIt is very important to make sure that you have someone on your side that can\nNavigate through the good times and the bad when it comes to your money and Wall Street and some of the other things that affect you and your fifty an older here in Florida and you're talking about retirement go to ... dot com to find out more or just pick up the phone and\nSaid at the time to sit down with Mike and his team and ask some questions about where you stand now with the market doing so well and where you stand if you don't make any changes and you don't have that active wealth management when the market does turn because we don't know when that's going to happen we just have to be prepared for the White House\nFor zero seven to seven zero one south and that's four zero seven to seven zero one thousand\nBack in I think it was Nineteen Ninety nine and it was at least the late nineties when Netflix came up with this revolutionary idea of renting DVD movies through the mail\nGo to net flicks dot com fake a list of the movies you want to see about one business day we'll get three eighty\nIt was the most exciting thing when the male would come down to like stay needy nice and then of course things have changed we get most of our movies digitally\nAre all kinds of other subscription services out there that copied this Netflix model the newest one and I haven't seen that it's available here in Florida yet\nBut its cars you pay a monthly fee that bundles the use of the car with the maintenance insurance and everything pretty genius idea\nRight Mike it reminds me that when we talk about the bundling adviser your services are kind of bundled in a similar way I mean yes you're helping people with their investments all straight but you're also helping them with tax planning and retirement healthcare costs and many other things\nWell and there's a reason for that Christian we all of all those relationships so a relationship with an investment advisor or a relationship with an accountant\nOr a relationship with an estate planning attorney and they all need to work together seamlessly right and so we work with CPAs that you know so we have a client that comes to work with us and we're managing their money and then they have a CPA that they've been working with for a long time so they want to continue working with a CPA that's absolutely fine\nRight I just want to make sure I've got a good relationship with their CPA or if they're working with an estate planning attorney that they they really liked that's fine I just want to have a good to know your meeting with their estate planning attorney that that that we have a good relationship\nBut a lot of people that we work with they they don't necessarily have good relationships with CPAs are accountants they don't necessarily have good relationships with estate planning attorneys\nAnd a responsible financial plan is going to you know a\nB responsible when it comes to investing price is going to be efficient actively managed portfolios and that's really really important\nBut Chris and we also want to be really efficient when it comes to taxes we don't want our clients paying more in taxes than they need to pay less not efficient and we don't want to make decisions based on how they invest that hurt them tax wise so going to be careful there that's why we employees CPAs I'm here in town will management\nIn addition to that we want to make sure that we're being responsible from a um estate planning standpoint that's why we have attorneys that work with us to help our clients with state planning\nPerson went when the attorney has just down the hallway or when the CPAs just down the hallway and I'm putting together a comprehensive financial plan flood easier rash more down there and question answer or if I have an a client is working with us and we have an estate planning our tax question and I just you know need to walk down the hall and make that happens a lot easier\nSo it's more efficient in that way and again you can't I just don't believe it's a good idea to work with a financial advisor that's only interested in your money is not going to end because if they're only interested in your money and helping you with that they are all these other things like health insurance and that goes with attorneys I mean it's just to know\nAll by the wayside and in the end you're not going to be in a good position\nIt is and they've got blinders to everything else so\nThat's why we do it that way and it's not so much this bundled into our and our cable company here but um you know or cell phone company ... you know we're we're in the access to be easy and we don't want to complicate it and we will be to help our our clients so\nAgain as we're not in today's show Christian I Know we've we've got a lot of calls but for anybody who would like to come sit down and do that truly comprehensive financial plan where we'll take a look at all of this for you you walk out of our office with a financial planning your hands if you want to implement on your own will show you how to do that if you want to take it to your current financial advisor I'm

will use all the tax money first let all the tax free money grow and then use the extra money later and retirement but one of the issues that we have is the tax laws change from time to time they just literally changed this year twenty Eighteen the tax laws are very different than they were in twenty Seventeen\nSo the reason that that we want to make sure it as a a private wealth management firm and and also doing this radio program that we're offering\nNot just financial services meaning showing people how to invest their money as efficiently as possible but we're also offering tax services the reason we have CPAs that help us out and work with us is because it's very important not just to learn how to be as efficient as you possibly can in growing or money\nAnd all of our clients Doug they want the same thing there they they don't want the highest rate of return they can get to just not willing to take a lot of risk to get it on their money so those are the types of\nPortfolios that we're putting together for clients and again all of our clients are either retired or very close to retirement so it makes sense they would be looking for that\nBut at the same time we have to be responsible with distributions and make sure we know which bucket pulled out of and all of this goes into having a truly comprehensive financial planning dog I mean I I think a lot of people maybe they have a plan in place but they're not exactly sure how over time\nAnd then they do ask themselves that question well I've got this Roth account I've got the traditional Irish account I've got this and joined account I've got this trust account got all these accounts\nAnd you know overall they look at it and and and it adds up to a nice number for retirement and they feel pretty good about where they're sitting but now they've got to take income where do you pull the money out of and financial planning and tax planning an estate planning can showing that\nSo literally for anybody who's listening this is what we do week after week after week when people come in and they sit down with us so if you're listening right now and you have concerns about your current financial planner you have some concerns about you know hey I Am I taking distributions from my ... am I getting it from the right place [noise]\nGive us a call we can sit down with you and we'll put together you know a truly comprehensive financial plan where we will look at all of that and will help you be\nNot only efficient when it comes to the investments she had to get the highest rate of return you can with policemen of all totally but also show you how to be as efficient as you can from taxation you know where do you pull the money from when you need income so give us a call the next ten minutes and will do that for you complimentary\nVery important questions you need to have answered on your portfolio the comprehensive financial plan a Fifteen hundred dollar value so call within the next ten minutes\nAnd get involved with that Michael answer all your questions sit down with you and give you a great opinion and do we joined a great way with your portfolio for oh seven to seven zero one thousand\nThat's four o seven to seven zero one thousand and you can find out more to add guarding your nest egg dot com\nTwo thirds of the people surveyed by nerd well I'd say they're not confident they'll have enough money to retire and uh at this point in our lives Mike how do we find out you know where we stand\n... so it's it's a number right and how do you figure out what that number is so there was a commercial some years back from a financial company and the big tagline was what's your number\nRight and it was kind of it and he was cute people carrying around this big number you know so for some people it's like you know hey if I can just set aside a million dollars for retirement you know that that's my number I saw it with a guy\nOr just the other day we were talking we had a great conversation and he's got plenty of money to retire but but his numbers five million ... getting close to that number and\nHere's the thing I mean we're we're looking at him and well he he doesn't need five million to retire but but that's his number right\nSo the number can come to you in a couple of different ways\nYou could have established a number on your own in your head and you say hey listen I I just want to achieve this goal you know whether you're number's a million or five million or ten million whatever that number is once you get there you've decided we're going to walk away\nYou probably could have walked away by the way a lot sooner it's just that she wanted to hit that number or other people are asking the question that they they are going I don't in my mind how the particular goal like I I'm not fixated on making sure I have a certain number before retire ... what they really want to know is how much do they need to retire\nAnd when somebody asks me Mike how much do I need to retire what they're really saying is how much do I need to set aside for retirement so that I can walk away from this job never have to go back to work again 'cause that's not what they want to do in retirement\nAnd live off us money for the rest of my life right and so how do you take money that you you've been saving and you've been doing putting money in year after year after year and you're watching it grow and grow and grow and then how do you transition into retirement because retirement is potentially thirty or forty years of unemployment\nRight if you think about it because you're not going to go back to work so it's very very easy to go to work now and I'm not saying your work is easy but we get very accustomed to you know I I go to work I Do my job I get a check\nI use the check to pay my expenses you know and as long as they keep showing up for every single week everything is taken care of and I've got a certain standard of living that I'm very comfortable with unhappy with but then when you transition to retirement you have to figure out where the ... going to come from\nSo going back to the question how much do you need to set aside for retirement well let's take a look at\nYour standard of living and what does it actually cost you to maintain that standard of living and then let's take into consideration things like inflation and things like taxes 'cause it's not going to get cheaper over time\nAnd if we incorporate all that into a financial plan and then we take a look at how you're currently invested and what are your odds of success right because it's possible you don't need a financial advisor if you've done everything you need to do in a financial advisor can't provide value but there's no reason to have one\nBut it's a financial advisor can provide value if they can show you how to get a higher average rate of return that you're doing on your own\nNone of any fee you're paying them you know the permanent providing value if they can do that and also reduce the amount of risk you're taken to get that return they're providing value as well so answering those questions like how I set aside enough for retirement or how much do I need to set aside for retirement\nThat's part of putting together a financial plan\nAnd then once we establish how much you need to set aside for retirement and we put together a financial plan that's efficient meaning highest rate of return you can get another fees\nBut also minimizing the risk you're taking to get that return [noise] you know then we found a good spot and that's where we need to be so sitting down and having that financial plan put together is really critical if you want to answer those questions so for anybody who's listening\nIf you'd like to come sit down for our comprehensive financial plan\nWill put that financial planning in your hands you can take it to your current financial advisor if you want will sure how to implement on your own if you want or if you want us to implement it for you that's fine too but it gives the next ten minutes and will do that for you complimentary\nSee where you stand to come in and get your

a bans over the years that became one had wanders and they had that one song but you hear it again in commercials and movies TV shows\nAnd they make a lot of money each time for that so they can just sit back and you know collect the money off of that the royalties or whatnot but I'm sure they probably wouldn't have hit two three and four so\nAggressive Don McLean he's he's been going at that song for ah what forty years at least\nThat's been a long time so I Will now you can have a little history and trivia facts about music so I I'm the music guy and Mike you are the financial guy given us great information about\nRetirement so you know we're talking a little bit earlier about before the segment a Mike how do you help clients achieve a dream of never having to work again so how do you do that\nIt's a process Doug I I think we need to look at where are you currently are right now how you picture your return what what what's your picture of retirement you know what you think it's going to look like\nIt's different for everyone so\nThat there is no sort of blanket approach that we could talk about here on the radio that's going to identify every single person out there that side of their close to retirement or we're currently retired which is why again you know people hear us talk every single week about you know come sit down\nLet's do an analysis of your current portfolio let's put together a financial plan for you\nPart of it is that that that get to know you I Need to know who you are what is it is you you're looking to accomplish and just personality is a big part of it Doug people feel differently\nAbout certain things and it's all about you know where we've been where we're going in who are you where are we from\nAnd all those components go into a financial planted it it's not as cut and dry as somebody just sitting down with you having you fill out a form\nChecked the box so they can figure out what your risk tolerance is you know and then just dropping you into whatever their portfolio is based on the way you check the box is off\nIt's not that simple make people feel differently about different things and through these conversations and and the one on one get to know you and then putting together a financial planner able to do that\nThe only thing that I I the way I feel and what I Do know about our clients is nobody's looking for the hang in their approach it's very hard to deal with in retirement is not so bad\nIf you're working because your portfolio does not drive your quality of life you don't worry about never having to work again 'cause you're working that's where your income comes from\nWhen you step away from your career and you were probably doing it thirty or forty years or you're getting ready to step away from your career\nYou start looking very very closely at your assets and you start trying to figure out a way to make those assets you know last the rest of your life provide you with an income stream that you need adjusted for inflation and taxes moving forward but then also preserving the principal\nI never meet anybody who wants to just spend it down right and and people go every once in a while some bill say something like well hey listen if uh if my last check and balance right before I die that would be great [noise]\nWell yeah that would be great I mean I think all of us could agree but none of us know exactly when we're going to pass away so it's not a responsible way clearly to to build a financial plan so we build these out to where we can show people listen if if if we invest the money this way right and if we get this average rate of return fees\nAt this risk level given the amount of income you need adjusted for inflation taxes moving forward this is how you'll be successful if we do it this way\nAnd it's very empowering I think to put that financial plan and people's hands and trauma exactly how it works because then it eliminates that that big big concern which is how do I get from point a to point B point a being retirement and point me being you know I don't know age Ninety five or one hundred or whenever we leave this this world so\nThat is a big part of that and and it's\nPeople look I mean we're we're private wealth management firm so people start to wonder well I hear you on the radio you're probably all management firm I hear you talk about portfolios\nYou know it sounds good Mike but you know how do you accomplish that and there's a couple of ways we do that but as a private wealth management company one of the things that I Know dog is nobody wants to be the next victim of the next Bernie made off\nRight and we don't we don't know where that person is but they're out there and we know they're out there somewhere and and there are people certainly that are perfectly willing to different people have their money\nSo the way that we you know make sure our clients realize that's not what we're here to do is we utilize custodians are custodians or companies like fidelity Charles Schwab ... so when people invest with us their money goes to this\nSo at the end All right and we don't have access to their funds we can't pull money out of their accounts we can't you know I can go to South America or some country without extradition right and take their money with me I have no access to their money what I have is limited authority to manage their account on their behalf as a fiduciary right\nAm legally required to do it in their best interest and so there is a complete separation there\nWe can be a private will management company so I don't have some big corporation telling me how I have to invest client funds you know a lot of times I Know there I what I Know is there a lot of people out there Doug sitting on a pile of mutual funds or something right\nBecause they're working with some company who believes you should be a mutual funds and I'm not saying that's wrong but I don't think you can put everybody in that basket and say everybody should have hanging their portfolio comprised of mutual funds I don't like that if I was retired I wouldn't want that\nThe Algeria how's life in the fast lane arm as I don't know I Can't find the on ramp [laughter] every member of that one yeah and there was\nOne I remember he said they said no army they said no how you doing today he says poor\nAnd like oh what's wrong normally goes no no poor as informed my beer there you go and or something else kind of interesting you know he always talked about his wife veer off\nAnd she only appeared on the show briefly one time as a love interest for cliff cliff and but she was always\nYou know his real life wife who played vierra and she was always off screen whenever they had some conversations or she was nagging him or something like that so that was cheers I missed the show and but thank God for Netflix you can watch\nAll the reruns on there too so you are listening to guarding your nest egg with Mike Lester I'm Doug Harding infer across in Charles our phone number here as four o seven to seven zero one thousand and the website is guarding your nest egg dot com\nNext avenue it's a website that focuses on baby boomer issue says it's practically impossible for the average person to intelligently navigate their Social Security system so my only this on here so how do we figure out whether it is what we need to figure out\nAll right so when it comes to Social Security one of the issues that have stuck as there's there's a lot of information out there and it starts getting really confusing\nAnd then companies or a financial advisors or insurance sales people I mean you pick a but they're using Social Security and the confusion around it as a way to make you try to get people in their office are trying to get people to a seminar or something like that and they're almost confusing the issue even more\nSo it doesn't have to be that complicated there is a lot of truth around the fact that there are certain strategies you can use\nTo get more out of Social Security but every one of those strategies involves you delaying taking the payment right and the fact is is if we all knew exactly how long we were going to live we could probably come up with a really really really efficient Social Security strategy but none of us have the answer to that\nAnd that's why we need to take a look at Social Security and then all of the options that you have when it comes to Social Security as far as when you should take it should you take it at sixty two she take it at full retirement age which is for most people around sixty six or sixty seven should you wait till Seventy right you see all this is already starting to get a little\nConfusing and then if you're a married couple\nSome different strategies there if you are divorced but you were married to your spouse for at least ten years or something else there so I don't want to get this all convoluted what I Want our listeners to understand is that everybody's situation is very unique and there is no one stop shop or one best way for every one when it comes to Social Security [noise]\nIt is an important part of any financial plan which is why we include\nThat full Social Security analysis and missiles curry planning and timing strategies in every financial plan that we do\nIf you want to go to a seminar and have somebody to talk to you about this for an hour or something I mean that's fine\nI personally don't think it's necessary it's not as complicated as they make it out every single one of them Doug just flips on their computer and put your vision and that in five minutes without all the information so it's not that complicated but again it is an important part of any financial plan we want to make sure that you're\nDoing what's best for you when it comes to Social Security and we will do that for you at our office we'll leave it at that\nYou know but we want to make sure we're doing what we need to do it's confusing but but we can take care of that and we do it in our comprehensive financial point\nIt is kind of confusing Social Security maybe not the most exciting thing either but you need to know about your Social Security and you know how it benefits you are how maybe you need to change up your Social Security making his team at town wealth management will definitely answer their questions for you they have people standing by\nTo take your call their numbers for oh seven to seven zero one thousand four o seven to seven zero\nOne thousand and you can find out to more agile guarding your nest egg\nDot com now Mike I wanted to bring up something since this show is all about retirement you have people coming in sit down with you and talking about their retirement and it's always kind of a\nI Would say sometimes a stressing time and they've I figure out the retirement that eventually you're going to have to retire so how often are your clients that they come in that they're unsure about their abilities to retire\nAlso an ability retire is a big part of it when you take a look at um ability I think there are a lot of people that they feel like they're able to they don't have that road map for lack of a better word you know so so certain things have to be in place in order to to transition into retirement so imagine somebody who\nDecides they're going to retire well they I mean let's say their their retirement date is the first time next month\nAnd they step out of their career well that means the checks are going to stop coming in one of the first things they have to figure out is well how do I start pulling money out of my\nInvestment accounts and how do I do it in the most efficient way possible because that's not set up I mean currently all you've been doing is putting money into it\nSo one of the first things that you would do even without a financial plan is you would just link your investment accounts your four one K. your eye or air or whatever and you'd set up distributions and you're probably going to want to distribution once a month and maybe one at the beginning of the month or the middle of the month you know everybody's a little bit unique\nThe next day you're going to be worrying about this taxation you know how is that money tax\nLiterally in order to to get those two components meaning how much money I'm going to pull out every month than how much tax\nYou have to understand your budget right what is that number I Need every single month\nTo take care of all of my expenses simple things like should I set a little bit aside every month for those expenses that that are are it's not my mortgage or it's not my insurance or it's not my car payment or or what have you it's just discretionary items you know how much do I want for that\nSo that on a surface sounds really not that complicated but you still have to go through the process of setting up that income stream but then you start wondering well how much can I take out before I get into a situation where I Would run out of money right and you have to have a way to measure that\nYou have to understand inflation's impact on your portfolio you need to understand how taxes impact your portfolio\nYou don't want to spend you know or pay I should say more in taxes and we actually need to that's just a waste\nSo there are certain strategies when it comes to taxation we talked about a little bit earlier in the program Doug there are are different buckets of money some of our money is one hundred percent taxable on some of our money only their earnings are taxable if we ever ... none of that's taxable\nSo do we just pull out of one until it's tempting them outta the next one or do we pulled a little bit out of each one you know how do we put all of this together\nAnd so it's really those moving parts and the individuality for each person as far as how much money they've set aside for retirement what their sources of income or going to be in retirement how much they've set aside for retirement and then how is that money invested\nIn we compare that to everything that's available to them because if we can show them exactly which money to access and how to access it shouldn't exactly how to save money on taxes and then also show them how to be as efficient as possible in that portfolio right we all want the highest rate of return that we can get but in retirement we're just\nThere's no reason to take lots of risk\nFor no other reason than it's too hard to recover right we can't afford a loss like two thousand and eight after we've had all this growth and we need to transition into retirement and understand how our financial plan is going to work\nSo for anybody who's listening if you want us to put that financial planning your hands if you want us to do that complete analysis for you and find them if we can make you more efficient and your portfolio\nGive us a call and the next ten minutes

cards\nAnd uh you want to know what's the whole deal about the bottleneck and concerns\nUm well they are the ex graphics at twenty ... twenty series graphics cards like twenty seven twenty eighty are a substantial performance upgrade over the previous generation cards that ten seventies and eighties TI\nAnd what is being reported is that these cards are apparently so powerful\nThat the actual processors or the engines of these machines are actually what's limiting the capability of these cards and a bottleneck situation is something that ah when the specifications of computer are imbalance\nThat the other components of the hardware aren't necessarily able to maximize their potential\nIt's off the same reason why a core I five based machine with only two gigabytes of memory\nWill end up running slower than in older court to do a machine with a mix of memory because I'm In that case the memory is a bottleneck ing or in during the ability of the process or to perform\nAt optimal potential because there isn't enough to enable a smooth transition\nA smooth transition of information ah so that's also why some why uh with uh for example some computers was mechanical hard drives\nUm that in some cases them versus us all stay dry the mechanical hard drive to read by speed can are a little bit slower than with assault state drive and so with salt they drive at maximize the potential if the machine a bit there's different aspects of computer configuration that can cause ...\nBut I'm In this case with the with these new in video cards to be able to maximize their potential you have to ah really have like an expensive core I seven or even a core I Nine\nProcess or you have to really really high and hardware to pair with these really really high
