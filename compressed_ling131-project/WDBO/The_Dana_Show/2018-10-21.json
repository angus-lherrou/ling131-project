most people you'll see it does help [noise] so [noise] Chris um [noise] we're talking about myths today\nYou have another mess\nYeah how about this one the one um that uh you hear all the time doctors you know the ph D doctors are saying you know if you go to a chiropractor it won't really helped anything so why why why aren't going to the ... going to acquire a chiropractor\nThat's a great one so patients family doctors sometimes say that they're just sitting there in front of their doctor with back pain neck pain they got what about a chiropractor and the doctors like nah\nThat's not gonna help you if you should stay away those guys are good and I'm like wow I see the patient while that that that sounds like your doctor really doesn't understand chiropractic and it's\nIt's ... it's amazing to me that in this day and age right now in two thousand Eighteen\n... still think that way it's like it's not this is not in Nineteen fifty anymore right if you're going to doctors still thinking like that you gotta think to yourself\nDoes he really know what's going on in chiropractic I mean let me ask you a question because\nDo you know uh and folks out there do you know their chiropractic profession is growing by leaps and bounds and continues to do so no I didn't know\nIt it is growing exponentially that's why you see so many more car parts out there and it's not because they're not helping people it's not because they don't need us it it is a need for it right well I don't think I'd be growing if there wasn't exactly did you know it's one of the fastest growing professions of all I Do know that the other fact people don't know and did you know that many people\nStill do not choose a chiropractor first for their health problem but they usually go after going to many other types of doctors\nSo of course you know we'll see people who have been to the family doctor had been through the pain management ... has been to the right to predict surgeon has been to the neurosurgeon bit to the neurologist been to the physical therapy and all that stuff they're choosing a first a lot of times yeah so I'm like if it were off in a last resort still in fact the whole\nProfession was built originally on last resort stuff papers persons like yeah I'm trying you know dark chiropractor 'cause there's nothing else has helped me\nAnd my thing is if you got a doctor telling you shouldn't go it's not going to help my question is what is he doing for you yeah like you know he's giving you Medicine He's given more Medicine He's giving you opioids what what is that doing for you but covering the pain right let\nPeople know that it's not really helpful no people set up with that that's why they're coming to me I wouldn't exist I wouldn't have three locations are tied up to six locations I wouldn't have three currently right now\nIf it wasn't helping you know it didn't help if ... if I didn't need it wasn't a need if it's medicine and injections and surgery did the trick I Would not exist I Will be out an unemployed right now instead of have a radio show on Sundays getting the message out there\nI mean come on so it's just it makes me irritated when I hear that um you know it's just a kind of thing that you just you just want to your blood boils because it's just not true you know hey I Wonder if that medical doctor Chris has ever stepped foot in a car practical office the one that's telling his patients they shouldn't go no probably not yet but I Wonder what do you do if you had back problems\n[laughter] well I see a lot of Andy's with back problems they may not tell you that they go but they come to me as well um because they're human beings as well now there's some great MDs and they do refer me patients and they understand the coal management of the patient doing what's best for patient ... let me ask you a couple of quick questions I Know when I got like five minutes here so I'm\nEvery study done Chris I don't know if you notice on the effectiveness of chiropractic his short to be more effective more effective than any other treatments for back pain did you know that I did not and did you know the chiropractor carries the highest patient satisfaction of all\n... whenever they do a survey of patient satisfaction all professional contract that comes out on top as in both satisfy patience ... it's an interesting that they're not an actor how about this fact chiropractic costs significantly less money for treatment they any medical treatment by far\nI Would also I Would also say that it I think it costs less than what people expected to as well\nYes I don't want a deal on another show with the costs but yet but overall the costs are significantly that's way less\nK. and it's the safest by the way did you know chiropractors pay the least amount of malpractice insurance of any health professional we are by far\nThe lowest premiums paid because we are looked at by the industry the malpractice insurance industry and they're the ones that write the policies they look at us as the safest profession based on statistics that you know that I'd done on that one either so here we have a profession that is more effective on treating back pain highest patient satisfaction\nCost is significantly less for the system\nAnd it's the safest and you have a doctor in front of you going oh you shouldn't go to the chiropractor is not going to help you you shouldn't waste your time going there\nBut boy let's give you more drugs let's give the opioids eh that's worked out well let's do an invasive surgery\nSurgery how about the ... right forty two thousand people here are dying from opioids\nThat death doesn't count the all the addictions that people still alive that aren't working because they're addicted they're out on the street doing heroin\nI mean this is a big problem and they're like oh no don't go to a chiropractor it's it's more safe it's more effective it will cost life and and you know blah blah blah blah blah and it's like why what what is what this doctor personally I Would change doctors and my doctor was telling me that because he's not up on this on the research is that what people want to see and hear and do\nKnow and he's clearly not necessarily out for your best interests more ...\nYeah I mean so that it's exactly right so when he tells you that\nHis decision to tell you that he is strictly based on personal opinion or a bias against the profession\nWithout having giving you the facts and if he's your primary doctor his goal his responsibility is supposed to do what's best for you ... you are his patient he's your primary physician he should be doing what's best for you discourage you from a safe\nNatural effective and more cost effective profession is not doing the best interest for you\nNot at all none of this latest\nPeriod ended discussion changed doctors and go find a good chiropractor hey I'm not saying every ... great we've got\nWe've got guys out profession that make us look bad you know and and I'm Sorry about that but hey that's that's in any profession is better lawyer legos there's bad mechanics there's bad dentist bad accountants and as bad car practices way there's but there's a lot of good ones out there\nYou know and I could help you try to find a good one if I'm not in your area you go to orange wellness dot com and you

any ever expected you know what that's my job to help people I don't care if you come to me I care that you get better and you get better naturally and you don't get addicted to drugs and you don't get on opioids and you don't have to get big needles plunged into your spine and you don't get surgery for back surgery that may be unnecessary\nMaybe maybe sometimes there is more of that but sometimes they're not\nSo you know that's kind of what what it's about that is what this shows about look folks I Want to thank you for training and I hope we dispel the couple of chiropractic miss

work\nAlmost exclusively with individuals that are either retired or very close to retirement so they're going to think about things a little bit differently chances are you're not one hundred percent invested in equities if retirements around the corner for you right\nAnd you need to understand your portfolio from the equity exposure you had with stocks but also what about bombs right I mean I think we're moving into a bear market with bonds bonds I don't think are likely to do well for a while so you know this idea of just holding bonds or bond funds could be problematic moving forward all these things\nGo into financial planning and it's about understanding what you have understanding how to make your portfolio is a fishing as it can be so how do you make sure you're getting the highest rate of return you can with the least amount of risk those are the types of questions that we answer every day when we sit down with individuals and do analysis in financial planning\nSo if you'd like that kind of information about your portfolio or you just don't feel really confident in what you're currently doing if you want to come sit down with us we'll put together a truly comprehensive financial plan for where we'll give you all of that data and then also in analysis of your current portfolio\nWe'll put that plant in your hands complimentary if you give us a call in the next ... minutes\nArt at the comprehensive financial planning kind of see where you stand with your portfolio and you know give you that confidence in your portfolio as you're approaching retirement or even if you are in retirement as we speak they comprehensive\nFinancial planning a Fifteen hundred dollar value call within the next ten minutes the numbers for oh seven to seven zero one thousand\nOr oh seven to seven zero one thousand and it was always to add guarding your nest egg dot com Mike I watch a lot of TV because I Do that at night when I get home from work and after exercise and I just kind of want to relax\nAnd a number of times I've come across these commercials or they're kind of commercials what they're more like endorsements of celebrities who's are trying to give you financial advice and here's one I'm Alex for back Pat Boone here I mean\nAnd I'm here to tell homeowners that are sixteen to an older about a great way to live on better retirement\nOkay I'm a I'm listening finds\nGive me financial advice and now it's a trip back and say what is the number you know so I mean how do we deal with this and how do we get our clients get clients to uh you know kind of way through all this financial messages and that we see and hear every day\nEvery single I those commercials always made me kind of sad\nBecause it makes me worry about the ... like ... like if a but I also I Can't knock it because he probably got paid a lot of money or do almost nothing right and he figured why not so here's the problem with it I don't blame those guys out for going out and and and making a buck when it's that easy to make\nBut the one that bothers me the most is gold rank are precious metals so the ones out there doing the gold commercials or the silver commercials\nThey're making statements and making comments and and obviously they they probably don't know I mean they're just the spokes person but there are a lot of people that see those commercials and take that stuff to heart and they honestly start to believe that\nPhysical gold is the only way that you can protect yourself against um market crashes and hyperinflation and all that\nAnd and the reality is well hey that's not true you could just go out and and I'm\nOn I'm a gold ATF or something like that and avoid all of that but also with what's not being told to individuals and that commercial is there's not a lot of disclosure and what's interesting is there's a precious metals when it's in currency form\nBypasses a lot of regulation as far as disclosure goes\nAnd that's the reason we see all those commercials is a there is a very very old law and the books that says if its currency is not regulated in the same way that other security should be regulated just to summarize and so because it's not regulated we get a lot of these statements that aren't necessarily even true because it's not being regulated\nAnd also they're not telling you that well if you call up and you buy that gold you're going to pay a premium for it to your paying way more than the actual cost of gold or silver is\nAnd then they're going to charge you a storage fee because you got to put the stuff somewhere and then if you ever want to get your money back out of it well they're gonna charge you for you to buy back from you as well so the reality is I don't see it as a very good investment because it's going to cost you every step of the way you're paying something either to buy and sell it or store\nAnd you could honestly just go out into the market and buy an ATF that would do exactly the same thing\nSo that bothers me about that but it but again this just goes about understanding all of your investment options how they work with the advantages and disadvantages are and building at a at a diversified portfolio but I think also actively managed and we do actively managed portfolios\nWhat that means is we're not going to leave our clients and stocks structure likely to do horribly I mean it just doesn't make sense we're going to make some changes on our clients behalf\nIf markets are likely to truly well we're going to help our clients my actively buying more equity positions getting more aggressive\nThe reality is understanding your portfolio and I also think work with a fiduciary ... advisor that has your best interests at heart will get a lot of people in every week Doug that just want to find out more about what we do and how we do it and what it means to work with a\nAn advisor that uses active management and that is a fiduciary and I say if you're that person and you just want to know more about us and what we do just give us a call the next ten minutes and we'll sit down for that complimentary analysis in financial plan\nI think I'll take your advice over the funds is advice Mike so I don't know he\nBelieves those financial commercials as kind of just entertainment take it\nTake it a as you will at face value so the comprehensive financial planning a Fifteen hundred dollar value come in and sit down with making his team Italian wealth management call within the next ten minutes\nAnd that is complimentary the numbers for oh seven to seven zero one thousand seven to seven zero one thousand always at guarding your nest egg dot com\nNow coming up next we're going to talk about the importance

Georgia three around one eight nine year old four eighty nine eight seven three\nNow\nLooking back to your bag with my cholesterol down when the wealth management I'm ... and\nHave to admit I used to love that show Mike three's company\nChristie she was the original on one of the original three on the show she played a when I was Suzanne Somers and she turned Seventy\nTwo this week I Can't believe it that she's that old but there's something kind of interesting about what is going on or what went on behind that show is that she left the show\nBecause she wanted an increase in pay from thirty thousand dollars a year to a hundred and fifty thousand dollars per episode that was John Ritter salary that time\nAs well as ten percent of their shows profits now ABC was only offering a five thousand dollar pay raise and I'm thinking you know that show debuted one in the late seventies early eighties and thirty thousand bucks an episode that was some pretty good money way back then [laughter]\nOh listen was it the difference between thirty thousand a hundred and fifty thousand that's a big deal right we talked about this little bit before the show I mean nothing against her and I get it I think if I was her I Would have asked for it as well\nBut John was the talent I mean on the show does that mean does that make sense I mean she she was good I guess okay I mean I don't know what you do you think she made more money off of three's company refined master\nThat's what I was trying to think of it was it was going through my head of what was that can trash and she was I Would put money on my bed she made more off master\nI should make more thigh master yeah I mean I you know her part was important but I mean he carried the show and he got paid for it so I don't know and uh it probably didn't I don't like is she had thigh master is what it is what it [laughter]\nBut more people probably remember her from the ... than they actually do from three's company and I I see that in there is some movies that the master will come up and people will be using in kind of spoofing on that too so seemed more than uh the three's company does\nYeah for sure I still like the show even though it doesn't really hold up\nAs it once did way back then 'cause there was a lot more controversial way back then but we can go into TV shows all the time we are talking about retirement here that's what the show was all about guarding your nest egg with my class or get in touch with him and his team anytime at four O. seven to seven zero one thousand and as always at guarding your nest egg dot com [noise]\nAll right so Mike one reason that people put off talking to a financial advisor\nIs that they're not sure what questions to ask now advisor mark timber John I talk to parents and he gave a few suggestions why\nAsk the question what will happen to me if something happens to you\nSo we need to be thinking about uh whether or not the advisors working with a team was the continuity or a succession plan with that advisor to give me advice\nIf you're trying to make a connection with a trusted individual what are the elements that are important to you so one of the things for clients to be considering is whether they are working with a professional seller a broker\nOr professional buyer at advisor and that's a good filter to be thinking about what kind of relationship you want to have\nAll right there's another financial advisor but I'll I'll take your your word as a as as golden here so what do you think about that and what he said to do you have anything else to add about\nI mean first of all Doug I mean there are lots of great financial advisors out there in a there are way more people that need help then there are financial advisors so I mean the first trick to this uh being successful in retirement\nAnd uh I think being comfortable and confident retirement is is is finding your person finding the right financial advisor\nI'd be the first one to give credit where credit's due I I like the way that he frame that uh are you working with a professional seller or professional buyer I think that's that's pretty neat now I talked about it a little earlier when I when I mentioned um I said it differently but I said\nYou know are you working with an advisor that's a fiduciary or are you working with somebody that's a broker and ... them to sell products and they sell products because they are they get commissions on products now I realize there's probably brokers listening right now they're like oh you know your ear\n[laughter] why are you bashing on us on it and I'm I'm not it's not that there's not a place for that I mean there are certain investments out there\nThat are going to be appropriate for individuals and the only form that those investments come in is is brokerage form so I'm not hitting it that hard but if you're working with an advisor that's only going to promote those types of investments I think that's a problem so I I liked the way that he he frame that\nHe mentioned a couple of things like are are you working with a team or you're working with just one person\nThat's a good point so again there are a lot of great financial advisors out there\nBut when you are investing the money that you've accumulated right over a twenty thirty forty year period of time and that's your life savings\nYou have to make sure it's protected and you have to know God Forbid something happens to your financial advisor what happens then it's a perfectly legitimate question and you should be asking if he had an asteroid advisor that\nAsking that question so our answer is we have a big team here in town look management I'm forty four years old I relatively healthy I have four kids at home and you know so my wife and I certainly hope that nothing ever happens to me\nBut that's not a guarantee and so for all of our clients are there is a plan for that right we have lots of advisors worker at town hall management and then there's also a succession plan so all of our clients are taking care of whether I'm here or not\nBut if you're working with an advisor that doesn't have that you know maybe it's just just one person and a little bit smaller outfit\nDoesn't mean they don't have a plan dog but I Would ask them right and I would want to know what the plane and say if something happens to you clearly you don't have a whole team of people around you it's it's you and your sister or what have you and that's fine I liked that sort of close personal warm relationship\nBut you need to know who you would contact God Forbid something happens that advisor that's a big deal so you know what their succession plan is you know the team part of it\nYou know Hey Mike ... that's interesting you brought that up because the last meeting I had with my advisor he and I were talking and he said I almost died\nOf like a month ago and I was like what what was going on and he's younger than I Am I'm In my forties and he's he's younger than I Am and he had some some blood clot issues and it was I couldn't believe that he 'cause he's so young\nOn retired like Phil Collins did\nWell unfortunately Phil Collins is not my client\nAmazing I mean we're talking about I I I'm an as a child of the eighties you know I ... I was I'm right when he was doing all of his a lot of his best work you know it was like ten or twelve years old and you know I you you can remember\nThat time now in your life and that's what music really started affecting you so he's fantastic and actually my wife and I've talked about atrophied ever is touring and we can just go see him we have to do that I ... I think a good chance in the eighties I wasn't early enough\nFor shooting I wasn't old enough but at this point I Am so glad he's got a tour 'cause usually issues are only in England and you'd have to fly Ali over there and um and they're still out immediately but you know going back to just clients uh who on retiring like heat it ... it happens from time to time\nBut the great thing about retiring is you mentioned Phil Collins me gets to do what he wants to do any loves it may be hard to walk away from it but for most of our clients are individuals that\nI think retirement maybe he just doesn't suit them innocence that once you transition to retirement you got to figure out what to do with all that time and now all of us have interests that are going to occupy a hundred percent over time I mean I Know a lot of us like to go play golf laws like the fish laws like to do\nX Y Z whatever your thing is you know it's your thing but but the flexibility to go do something you really want to do\nAnd you don't necessarily have to make a lot of money at it you just really like it I think those are the types of transitions that we see more than anything else he can go out and do exactly what he likes and loves to do I love putting together financial plans for individuals would they know he listen\nI'm working because I Want to work and because I really really enjoy this not because I have to and once you can show people that type of a a financial planning and that type of active management of their portfolio where they know hey okay I don't actually have to make money at this I'm just I get to have fun making money\nThat's great right and I enjoy it and our clients enjoy it and not everybody does it but I I I really like giving people that type of financial freedom\nFair enough if you want that to financial freedom and a ... come sit down with Mike and his team Italian wealth management they offered this Fifteen hundred dollar value it's a comprehensive\nFinancial plan and see if you want to retire or on retire and he deals with clients that are nearing retirement or already retired but maybe you need a little tweaking that plan or maybe you just need a second opinion on your plan to comprehensive financial plan\nCalls for the next ten minutes and you can get involved in that the numbers for oh seven to seven zero one thousand four o seven to seven zero one thousand and always at guarding your nest egg dot com so we just talked about Phil Collins and are being ... retired getting back on the road making more music\nAnd there's something similar to this now that the NFL season is underway we noticed some lessons from the players that might also apply to those of us nearing retirement now former QB Danny Werfel says for him moving on from the game was a major transition\nMan well there's always uncertainty and that is so unnerving for all of us I think it's a\nIt's difficult it's risky I remember going off to college and when my parents drove away just that feeling there's this focus excitement this open this this freedom the newness and then there's this fear of of what might happen inside I say to the word that comes to my mind is to trust\nIs obviously you've got to do the things that you need to do\nBut you can't control things that we try to control so often so I think to be open and receptive and trust any of that phase\nBut it also comes back to earlier principles that you think about is you know what you do today prepares you for tomorrow and I think making long term decisions and investments in delayed gratification can put you in a position where when you make those transitions becoming a much better place\nWell you know in professional sports it's not if you're going to retire but it's when you're going to retire and basically forced to retire and you kind of\nAnd before you really want to cause many players retire on their own in in professional sports not a whole lot of them do share but unlike Phil Collins where he retired but he's\nNot injured or anything like that and it can still do it he can go back to whenever he wants but athletes don't have that luxury usually so that's a huge transition for these athletes and a lot of them have issues with that to dealing with their new wife so how do you help people with that that can you know the biggest transition of their wives\nFinance transition is really really good word for it because it's a huge change and what we find a week after week when we went to meet with people and we'd go to this for a long time so I've known for a while but\nWhat people don't think about when they have to transition to retirement is is all the components that are required to transition retirement so I talk about this too certainly when we're meeting with people in on the radio as individuals we can get pretty conditions to sort of our our normal way of life and what happens every day and\nYou know it's a simple is hey I wake up and the first thing I Want as a cup of coffee you know I mean that's just this conditioning way we we we need that we feel like we need that cup of coffee to get her day started or we need this or any of that to get her day started\nAnd what happens when we're working and and certainly there's there are things that happen in life we have families raise families we have mortgages we have car payments we have health insurance we send kids to college and we we we do all of these things and\nAll of those aspects cut this really really busy for very long period of time\nAnd what I Know that people experience as they transition to retirement is things change in its very quickly you know and it is on overnight but it almost seems overnight and we all know life happens fast you know we try to figure out what he was on this whole year went by really really quickly will\nHappens too when you're working your way to transition into retirement so people did all these things and they followed the rules\nAnd people that are that are retiring successfully today\nThey did that they pay down their mortgages they contributed to their four one K. is in there for three ... plans they were they were good stewards of the money and uh they they they did things right and they had um you know they they had diversified portfolios but\nBut suddenly the houses paid off the or maybe almost paid off the kids are out of the house the\nThe four oh one K. retirement plan you have through work is is up to a certain amount and now you're late fifties maybe sixties\nAnd you're going hey well now I'd like to stop going to work off I stopped going to work the paycheck stopped showing up right\nSo the first question is well where's that money and it come from do I have enough in my portfolio is it enough to last the rest of my life how long am I gonna live what's health insurance going to cost me what you know is the market going to crash all these questions and that that happened\nThat are all associate with

financial crisis in a lot of people are wondering\nCould it happen again well of course that could and it might but nobody has a crystal ball but financial author Suzie Ormond tells CNBC it's important to remember that the market bounce back from two thousand and eight and a big way\nA fortune with may guardian in two thousand in mind if they just hold on if you hadn't sold if he hadn't panic you in the city so pretty today it wouldn't even be funny but they forgot all that so they're starting to get nervous that should I should I Do that\nThey're forgetting the lessons that the last ten years should have taught everybody\nMike let's talk real life here in Florida what's your advice for investors who might be getting a little nervous\nWell first of all I listen to that and I think that it's not easy to hang in there when markets were as bad as a way and I think the hanging their approach is is is very very hard for anybody to deal with particularly if they're close to retirement so it's one thing to say\nYou know now that we have a crystal ball and go on the radio or your TV show or whatever you have and go hey listen if you adjust hung in there you'd be fine right now\nIt's not that simple and if you were suffering at that point in time and losing money hand over fist in your four one K. or area what a retirement account was\nAnd it was affecting your retirement and there is not easy to do a lot of people let emotions take over and and got out and then they didn't have a a stretch you get back in and and and those people you know they feel like they missed out but\nI guess I just take issue with anybody saying hey you know you should have hung in there everything it'd be just fine it's not easy to just hang in there when things get really really rough you know it's your money\nIt's a very long term and it's very very personal\nSo the flipside of that as it is having a strategy and my argument against that sort of hang in their approach would be well yeah that sounds well and good and and and she's sitting there saying if you just hold on to be so pretty right now well\nIt wasn't that pretty for a long time you got to wait a lot of people you know five six seven years just to get back to even and now maybe in your portfolio you're feeling better about it but it took a really long time so the alternative that was well what if you're working with an investment adviser that has a strategy that's tactical right actively managed portfolios\nAnd we're looking at indicators and we say it was based on what's going on and it makes no sense to hold equities at this point in time so we're going to go ahead and get out and if we're wrong you'll miss out on a portion of games but our clients are individuals that are either retired or close to retirement so bottom line is they're more willing to give up a portion of games the narrative take big losses\nAnd that's essentially how we manage our portfolios but\nHad you done it at that point in time Christian you'd be much better off\nWhat if I got out because indicators weren't good and then I waited for indicators to get go when I got back in and will not only would you not have lost a ton of money when markets crashed but you also would have had an opportunity to invest all that money that you saved by that losing it into a market that was lower and that's what they're not talking about their\nSlogan we promote working with a fiduciary and working within a fee based advisor that has a vested interest in doing well we promote actively managed portfolios we don't want to hang in their approach and Christian I think we just have to add value if I can show somebody how to get a higher average rate of return\nThan what they're currently doing that have been easy they'd pay us there's no reason to work with us so we sit down with people week after week and we put together financial plans analysis to help them figure that out and put that financial planning their hands so if you're listening now and you let it comes down to let a mouse was sure that complimentary financial plan\nJust give us a call in the next ten minutes and will do that for you

was Nineteen sixty nine Crosby stills and Nash a specially released this one sweet Judy blue I assume they chosen to open their performance at Woodstock a few weeks earlier but they didn't\nGo on all three am on the third night so here's the thing those who left being all responsible\nThey get to work on Monday morning not only missed Crosby stills and Nash they didn't see Jimmy hendrix close out the festival and he was one of the most iconic figures of that time at Woodstock sounds a lot of waiting for a lot of waiting and\nPeople are I guess like hey I got to go live my life Monday so I gotta go\nWould've hate to have missed that ... some gun so my ... actually kind of an interesting question you like music I Love music when you Katie go to a concert whether it's just date night with you guys or if it's something maybe for the kids I don't know where are you one of those folks that stay till the end or do you leave a couple of songs are only be traffic\n[laughter] so depends a lot on who the a ... who the band is okay it's because at this point with the kids right we do both so we do the Venus and bands at Kenyon I enjoy him and um we also do a few things that I'm like is like so\nAn example of something kids would be more interested than us would be I mean I was sixteen year old daughter so we and the and then also a nine year old daughter six year old sons would Taylor Swift is pretty big like you know in that group yeah I wasn't particularly compelled to stay busy and [laughter]\nOkay so the ... but not your favorite thing ever known I Know my favorite thing and I'm sitting there imagining trying to get out there and everybody is trying to go so\n... early was I'm actually pretty great okay not situation but yeah we're we're totally open to hanging around if if we don't have anywhere to be\nThinking he might not like Jimi Hendrix animal animal something iconic like that you\nKnow yeah I mean if we could do Crosby stills and Nash I mean clearly at this point you know I Would say till the end but it'd be really hard to pull off\nYou're right the kids do change everything and if they're with you you might need to head out of their cars they could be getting a little and say well we like to reminisce about things that happened in yesteryear that were a lot of fun and also just a part of our history and pop culture history and we also like to talk about how you can use active wealth management\nTo develop your own strategy that's personalized for you and your situation based on what you've worked hard to save accumulating invest all these years\nTo be financially confident now and in the future of your retirement and to have a retirement income plan\nHe's got questions about that doesn't guarding your nest egg dot com or you can speak to Mike or another team member here in Florida off the air force there all seven to seven zero one thousand in a dream about retirement that's one thing it's fun to do it's an opportunity where you can bring big and\nStink of everything but pay for that dream is another thing might the tips that can help people get ready to leave the full time workforce than sail away toward their own dream\nTo transition them and we do talk about that are on the radio program certainly\nAnd people coming to visit a lot of the individuals that were talking to some of them heard the program one times I've been listening for years you know and they said hey listen I'm I'm looking to make that transition I just want to make sure I'm prepared\nAnd part of that is taking a look at exactly where they're at so they're very very typical scenario would be somebody coming in\nLet's just say it's a married couple he has his investment assets she has her investment asset so each of them have been working each of them have been studying money aside for retirement and uh both of them have been the matches and and they've just done a good job and they're trying to figure out how to make the transition the biggest issue with the transition is figuring out\nI mean in in at least in individuals mines is how do I go from putting money into my retirement accounts for the past three or four years\nTo pulling money out of my financial accounts for the next Thirty years or so\nAnd not having that money run out right and the big question is how do I invest the money to make that happen now we talked earlier about inflation and and what interest rates were like in the early eighties and the math it'd be really really simple if we could just go down to the bank and get a CD for Eighteen percent\nRight I mean what's in your ... retirement of you to fix Eighteen percent and most people go like hey I'm outta here you know settled take this job and show that kind of thing [noise]\nBut that's not the way it works we're not getting those interest rates at the bank were not likely to ever get those interest rates at the bank unless something goes horribly wrong along the way because that means we've got crazy inflation and the government's had to raise interest rates up to that point to um basically stop an even bigger problem\nSo what we're doing is we're we're helping people create efficient portfolios\nTo accomplish what their goals are and not everybody unless you spend a lot of time every week again we do this Monday to friday every week and we do this radio program on the weekends but not everybody knows how to take that portfolio and create an efficient portfolio by efficiency I mean how do we get the highest rate of return I can get\nBut I also want that return with the least amount of fees and least amount of ...\nAnd most people right now markets have been good so they might look at their portfolio and think well you know my average rate of return pick a number of let's say you're averaging eight or nine percent per year on your portfolio over the past ten years and then this past year has been really good ... you could be up eight ten twelve Thirteen fourteen percent this year\nBut what's your long term average but then also more importantly once you transition to retirement how much risk are you taking to get that return\nSo it was all process I I I go through with individuals and we're sitting down to the office and and we'll take a look at their portfolio and look at what their average rate of return is and let's say that we look at it and and your average rate of return is about nine percent per year and it's pretty good to feel pretty good about that right because we know if we go to the bank\nUm we're not going to get that if in our brains are thinking well if I could just continue to average nine percent on my portfolio I'll be finding retirement that would be great\nWhy first of all I mean I I don't know where those numbers came from Christian but I'm guessing somebody took a look at markets or that period of time and said hey if you had put twenty five million in here um it'd be what four hundred percent more hundred million that's huge okay yeah I mean markets can do obviously they can do very well\nAnd we hear this all the time but if we had a crystal ball we would know exactly how to position at chances of them doing that right and ... million at risk\nThan really really aggressive portfolio is to get to a hundred million is really really unrealistic right we don't know exactly what's going to happen moving forward\nAll of the Clinton is definitely a wealthy family because they struggle al ... that's not real life but realizing that you work with all types of people over the age of fifty here in Florida with their investments and you have some pretty wealthy clients so some types of planning strategies the ways of going about this that you use with clients who has\nA rather larger nest egg\nSure what we're working on and and what we've been doing for years is active management of portfolios and people hear me talk about that but but an endless you actually see it as hard to understand exactly what that involves most investors are dealing with portfolios that are very static and what that means is\nThey aren't actively manage somebody has sat down and and hopefully done a good job of putting together a diversified portfolio but there's no real tactical strategy for moving in and out of stocks are moving in and out of bonds are moving in and out of real estate based on certain indicators that are going on\nAnd we want to fall that because it helps us be smarter investors it's easy to easiest example I can give is if markets are doing horribly in the stock market is crashing in and we could use two thousand ain't as an example\nHow many of our listeners we're\nIn a situation where nobody gave them any advice on what to do about that and they had to decide for themselves whether to hang in there and just write it down and then ride it back up or did they feel kind of alone and having to go in and liquidate portfolios and maybe doing it the wrong time\nAnd then maybe potentially never even getting back in I mean we do meet people who have that situation it's hard to do and you have to be careful and that sort of guidance is is really where we come in and not because you know we're a bunch of rocket scientist over here or anything but because we literally work with this every single day\nAnd it's our job to not only protect or ... portfolios\nAnd then help our clients be successful in retirement\nSo you know strategies to helping clients with larger portfolios for smaller portfolios are the same right traditionally individuals who had more money\nTens of millions of dollars would have access to actively managed portfolios and very very strategic per fully utilizing algorithms and that sort of a thing\nWhat we've done is we want to bring that to everyone and we want to make sure that individuals who maybe not knee and maybe they don't have tens of millions of dollars can still benefit from actively managed portfolios\nAnd if we're able to do that and just how people not only be more comfortable in retirement help them participate in market gains help them not have to worry as much about market losses help them no you know they have an advisor that has a vested interest in doing well\nAnd putting all that together is really where we're at\nAnd that's what we're showing individuals when they come sit down and if you feel like we're providing value what happens person as individuals decide to work with them if they don't feel like we're providing enough value then I don't get to work with us right and we don't have an expectation that everybody out there should should work with is right I mean everybody's got their own thing but\nYou know coming in and sitting down and letting us all the what the analysis showing how to make your ... more efficient at least you're going to walk out of our office with a you know some ideas on how to make that portfolio more efficient um letting us put together that financial plan for you will show you how to implement that on your own if you honestly want to do that I don't have any problem with that\nBut a lot of people don't want to so we'll implemented form at any rate if you give us a call the next ten minutes we can do that for your complimentary force\nAnd I was seven seven zero one thousand that's four zero seven to seven zero one thousand it's all about active wealth management and you can find out more by having making the team put together that comprehensive financial plan that the Fifteen hundred dollar value\nComplimentary if you call within the next ten minutes is it has to at guarding your nest egg dot com\nIt is officially fall one of my favorite times they've probably absolutely my favorite time of year now that I sang it out loud\nAnd it's all the time of year that most of us are making enrollment decisions about health care including Medicare might get advice for people listening here in Florida who may be going through this right now because talking to some friends of mine that their phone is ringing off the hook if they are in this demographic of age\n... bringing us up because yes fall is a time when you are going to get bombarded because as what's referred to as open enrollment when it comes to these plans that cover expenses Medicare doesn't cover All right\nAnd so for a lot of people that's going to be a Medicare supplement uh they're also Medicare Advantage plans I don't want to get too far into the\nWeeds on exactly the differences because there are a lot of differences between them and the different plans that they offer\nBut if you are age sixty five are older and you're eligible for Medicare you were in the crosshairs you know for this marketing\nAnd I think what is going to boil down to for individuals is making sure that they have the best plan that they can get right for the amount of money that they're spending\nPresident you got to be careful of a few things here or there are representatives who\nWill come to you every single year and try to switch from one plant to another\nThat's not a good thing is not even technically legal if it's not in your best interest but the reason they do that is the commissions that they get first year out are more than the commission as they get if you just stay a client sort of feel like you're in that position\nTo be careful and then also the marketing in general there are a lot of regulations around it but I hate that individuals have to talk to maybe you know three or four or five different sales people just to get the information that they need to try to make a good decision which is why\nYou know I tell them will management and through a radio program we have individuals that work with all of the different Medicare Advantage and Medicare supplement plans out there in that way so for our our clients when the when they sit down and they have questions you know they don't have to go see five or ten people they can add on with us we can look at all the plans that are available\nAnd whether they've had a change in their life or whether they just want to\nYou know maintain what they currently have we can do that for them of course and we can also do that for our listeners if you don't want to sit down and talk to again three or four or five different individuals or have to go to a whole bunch of different meanings find out what health care plan is right for you you could sit down with our Medicare specialist\nAnd they can walk you through all the options help you make an informed decision Christmas part of the overall financial planning process I mean yes we help people invest money and yes we want to help you get the highest rate of return you can get ... feet\nBut at the same time if we're saving money on things like health care or\nWe're getting you better coverage for the same price and that's a big benefit we have CPAs that we work with Christian that are employed by us and the point there is we don't want our clients to pay more taxes and they have\nAnd that's part of the financial planning process right it's not just about the investments we want to help you save money in taxes we also have attorneys that we work with\nBecause the state planes are really really big part of any financial plan\nAnd we have to understand our money works for us now but also eventually Christian as I say what's guaranteed death and taxes right you know eventually we're going to pass away so how do we make sure that our assets transition as as efficiently as possible to our beneficiaries we want to keep on call Sam right\nOut of

coin advisor and money manager\n[noise]\nAnd when you [noise] [noise] [noise] and [noise] [noise] yeah that's a very good question family\nAnd uh unfortunately when it comes to the actual service if the surface slow down is happening at the providers and there's not really much you can do about it especially since you've been trying all the appropriate steps that you can take would be saying you ... your network equipment\nUm if you have your own sometimes what can happen is if you have your own route or in your own route are getting older sometimes that can cause ... phone is um\nIf you have a modem and the modem is a few years old um one thing you can do is try to have them come out and replace it and sometimes there have even been cases where also if you had a virus on a computer that can also cause a parent's slowness with your net service if you had a virus or if you just had a sore computer I'm\nNow I'm One thing I Would probably recommend doing or just for the heck of a time when you experience\nThe slowness issue um I Would probably want to check if you're having the issue on just that one device or if you have other devices in your home are also experiencing the same problem\nThat we can help better isolate is a problem on the computer side of the equation or is the problem on the ... the basically is on the computer or the connection\nUm that would probably be able to help uh basically uh say your online computer and you know is it getting slow and jump on another computer and you see it's still going blazing fast and that will tell you that the computer versus if you're on the computer so you jump on another computer and you know it's Alan hey I'm having some slowing a Web page to\nAnd that would tell you the issues going beyond needed a network equipment on the service provider side so I Would probably recommend doing or if you're still having these issues or to go and take a look in at those other items\nAnd uh if uh it is indeed look like that's going to be at the connection side\nI Would I Would probably recommend would probably be a harp on spectrum a little bit more possibly a C ... next level here ah repair people on the phone and because chances are you're experiencing this issue and it is connection issue it could be an issue with the line running from the street to the home I've had that happen\nAnd uh that's of course would be spectrums responsibility\nUm it could also be an issue if it's affecting multiple people like or I Would suggest maybe ask your neighbors see hey are you having the same problem because that could be an infrastructure related issue that they need to send an infrastructure team to fix the problem\nA so definitely a hope hopefully we can ah try to get them to get to the bottom about this for you because uh\nNeeds to say especially with our interconnected world slowness with the Internet is a real pain in the butt\nThat go ahead and answer your question their Stanley\nRichard\nYou're most welcome Stanley and thank you for joining us\nAppreciate that call Stanley good coffee want to take Stanley's lines at one of our other open minds you can call and nowadays for for two two zero zero Ninety six five eight four for\nTwo two zero zero nine six five if you want to call it enjoying the show today we're going to go ahead of how to St Cloud we still got people on hold so let's talk with Joe Joe welcome on into the show what's your question for Andre\nOh I've got a a an external hard drives it I had pulled out of the computer was mother in law went down and it was an old computer so I really wasn't going to try to rebuild that\nAnd I had it for a little while before I got to know the computer and when I did I remembered oh I got that show on Dr Paul ... photographs and stuff and some of the nation all things that I had on it\nAnd I can see those files but I Can't access so I'm stuck with files but I Can't do anything with them\nGotcha Joe hum I there's a couple of different things that can cause a difficulty with accessing files on external medium or one possibility is that uh which I see a lot of times when we were moving hard drives between computers\nIs that windows has a what we call virtual ... permissions and essentially which tells the computer\nUm whether it can what whether the user account has the rights if you will to be able to view access or open or do anything with the files and or if you have a hard drive that was taking out of another computer\nI'm more used with another machine the file permissions might be associated with the user account from the other machine and when you're going to this new computer the virtual permissions would be different because this is a different accounts so basically\nThe Yorktown is trying to access the files and the files permission information the digital information that most users don't really see our is basically saying well this particular user doesn't necessarily have the authority to open the phone so I'm just gonna sit here or say access as an eye or something like that\nOne thing that you can do to fix that problem would be to ah right click on the file or right click on the folder containing those files and then you can go to properties\nAnd then from there you can go into the security tab and then from there you can go ahead and modify the permissions to allow your user account for control or you can also go into the advanced option and then choose your account and take a virtual ownership of death folder on the drive\nUm that would probably be the first thing I Would try doing we see this all the time when we're doing dad transfer is when we do our complementary ... transfers with our computer sales this comes up like Ninety nine percent of the time\nAnd it's just something that Microsoft introduced a back in the days of XP invest a and um it's supposed to be for use of security but in the end it becomes a quite burn some to everyday users that I'm a migraine between uh computers and hardware\nUm so again you would right click on the file or right click on the folder go to properties and then the security tab and that's where you'd be able to go ahead and modify the permissions so you should be able to access the files from there\nWas there a follow Joe does that answer your question\n[noise] I watch\nYou got Joe and if you're still having difficulty please don't

to come to your next but Paul actually had a follow up question we couldn't squeeze it because we had to head to the break so we're going to I had to bring Paul back in ... what was your follow up there with Andre\nAndre I also have the problem with the extra mouse in fact I had excellent mouse was using that will that started\nAnd they they think is just about got to be something in the software or is it could it be when it gets hot that it does is this what I Want to try and check if it took time issue how long it's been on\nWell another possibility I've seen ... even when you use the external mouse at the touch pad has developed a fault it can essentially produced so what we call phantom inputs where it's a sending essentially signals to the machine\nThat are indicating a touch response to it when you're not actually touching it if you will a so one thing that you can also tried doing would be to\nThe to the touch pad icon or on some on most computers that will be at the bomb right hand corner I'm of the screen and then you can just go into the sayings and disabled the touch pad itself um and then see if it happens with just the external mouse if it happens to adjust the external mouse um I'd hate to think that\nBoth times will be faulty but I have seen that happen also um but it's another possibility is that we've also seen cases where malicious software or a where a malicious software macro can cause a phantom inputs are when running bad scripts as well\nSo one thing I I Would probably recommend Paul that the first thing you should try would be less disabled to touch pad and use it would just extra mouse\nAnd uh that would tell us with absolute certainty if indeed the touch pad itself is the problem I have also seen cases where on Mac books in some other laptops where the battery\nEnded up being a culprit for touch pad issues because so many Mac books have internal batteries and many other laptops do as well and sometimes when these berries can go bad and they ... they swell dangerously and they actually pushed into the touch pad and I've actually seen\nMany situations where the ... I was bad and it was actually pushing against the touch pad and working the actual casing of the computer\nAnd a ... and sometimes you don't even know know that that's actually going on until until you actually open up the computer and see it so that is also another possibility depending on the making miles computer that you have\nUm so I Would probably ah I Would probably recommend let's disabled attach back first and uh hopefully that will temporarily alleviate that issue\nAnd then from there if you wanted to come by our store we can go and take a look and uh see about either replacing the touch pad or the or even could be the battery both we'll see [laughter]\nAs advertised we're going to continue on the phone lines and talk with Robert in Melbourne Robert will come out of the show what's your question for Andre\nBush's uh\nOvertime I've tried to uh go on our drive so another hard drive I drive by then my laptop right now and I need the transferred over to another hard drive and I'm not a hundred percent successful at what kind of software would you use to do that it's one of those seven days\nIn a gotcha Robert um we usually when we copy data usually we actually do it most of the time from within windows directly that we usually have a special apparatus that we connect the hard drive to the machine and we can copy the files over\n'em learn so having a diagnostic environment that sometimes we boot into when we're trying to do it in an isolated environment a type of situation as well if you're trying to copy found that and it's not coming over successfully especially since uh you might be dealing with a failing hard drive as you said\nUm that would probably something that we would ... that would probably require doing more advanced recovery

remarkably that David band camp so much\nFor the drugs so much I Love this idea I don't\nThink it'll actually happen uh but I Would love it to happen so health and Human Services secretary our days are announced yesterday they are proposing a new rule that would require pharmaceutical companies to include the price of prescription medicines in TV ads\nKnown why do you know the whole whether you're seeing yeah the first of all a lot of people think of as the blue pill or whatever it might be it was like and here's the cost of fright\nRecommended price for Bill right\nI Love this idea get probably not going to have the whole idea of course it was to try to I mean you get these companies do admit how much they're charging ... job and looked everyone's titled to make money in this country I think this is one of these regulations where you're not forcing businesses to artificially lower or inflate cost here\nRight there's the situation where a company just has to be up front about what they have about what what what their product costs\nWhat other business doesn't have to do that for a consumer right I mean if you're going to get your car repaired how much is this going to cause yeah sometimes it could be what we got to see what's wrong with it but once you know\nWhat the diagnosis is here's how much we charge yeah or if you know it's oil okay here ... years\nMuch the oil is going to cost whatever it is that's what's so maddening about the medical industry\nSo yeah pharma pharmaceutical research and manufacturers of America this is the big lobbying group a sad that they would they don't want this of course they say and it's because well the reason we don't want this is because you're actually going to be harming consumers so please guys how you harm consumers most people will not pay what the price per pill is\nSo good tech and we'll get a technically be Seventy five dollars write bad PR pill for most people would play it would pay no more than ten or Fifteen bucks for a script\nAh well I think there's actually forces companies to be honest about what they're charging absolutely isn't this isn't this a way of creating transparency in the medical industry\nYes it's the same way you need your appendix taken out how much they're going to cause I go to the hospital and blow it all depends where's your insurance through because what you're charged if I have insurance different than if I didn't ... it it's all jacked up you just can't call and get the price yeah\nI think they're so used to being people in the pharmaceutical industry and and medical industry in general are so used to being protected by the system that's in place now and has been in place for a long time that they just don't like the idea of actually having to compete and actually having to be open with the consumer\nOh yeah why would they want this to change their making billions of dollars because I Would also think and there's nothing wrong with making that kind of money\nBut I Would also think that a savvy business person would say well now here's an opportunity\nTo brag about what state you know the little blue pill versus another a similar product guy wouldn't you see an opportunity to undercut your competition by advertising how much less you're charging per pill then this other company\nYes isn't there an opportunity there\nMy fear is then it's going to be a war and marketing and the ads are going to get crazier [laughter] it's not just me and the lady you're going to be in his tubs looking at a sun side but with this bill it's like three times a day [laughter] I don't I don't need any more the crazy at just the price fine\nNow now that now now farmers are saying what we can do is we can direct people to our Web sites that will have the sliding scale of costs and all that stuff no man put it on the freaking TV ad\nNo I mean listen man when people can go online and see how much it costs in Canada and it's one sixth of what it costs here they're ticked off there like this doesn't make sense it's not about well a company you know shouldn't be able to make money no absolutely a company should be able to make money but\nFor something that you need you shouldn't be held hostage for it I think that's what Trump is being been saying and that's one of the things that has resonated with me now\nKnow he's about this so you know we'll see where it goes\nYou know the whole healthcare thing man we really haven't made much gains there but a lot of games in different areas but not so much um in that area I don't know if you saw this story very interesting that if you have a late model Honda watch out somebody might be trying to steal the airbag outta there\nThis was out of USA Today I didn't realize this was a big issue stealing airbags yes\nAnd the reason is because these can make a whole lot of money with the stolen airbags\nI didn't realize there was a there was an airbag black market yes there is", "year":
