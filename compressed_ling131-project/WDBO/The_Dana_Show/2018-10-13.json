right now and you have concerns about your current financial planner you have some concerns about you know hey I Am I taking distributions from my ... am I getting it from the right place\nGive us a call we can sit down with you and we'll put together a truly comprehensive ... where we will look at all of that and will help you be\nNot only efficient when it comes to the investments sure how to get the highest rate of return you can with the least amount of all totally but also show you how to be as efficient as you can from taxation you know where do you pull the money from what you need income so give us a call the next ten minutes and will do that for you complimentary\nVery important questions you need to have answered on your portfolio that comprehensive financial plan a Fifteen hundred dollar value so call within the next ten minutes\nAnd get involved with that Michael answer all your questions sit down with you and give you a great opinion and we joined a great way with your portfolio for oh seven to seven zero one thousand\nThat's four o seven to seven zero one thousand and you can find out more to add guarding your nest egg dot com\nTwo thirds of the people surveyed by nerd well I'd say they're not confident they'll have enough money to retire and are at this point in our lives Mike how do we find out you know where we stand\nIs so it's it's a number right and how do you figure out what that number is so there was a commercial some years back from a financial company and the big tagline was what's your number right and it was kind of it and he was cute they have people carrying around this big number you know so for some people it's like\nYou know hey if I can just set aside a million dollars for retirement you know that that's my number I saw that with a guy or just the other day we were talking we had a great conversation and he's got plenty of money to retire but but his numbers five million ... getting close to that number and\nHere's the thing I mean we're we're looking at him and well he he doesn't need five million to retire but but that's his number right\nSo the number can come to you in a couple of different ways\nYou could have established a number on your own in your head and you say hey listen I I just want to achieve this goal you know whether you're number's\nA million or five million or ten million whatever that number is once you get there you've decided we're going to walk away you probably could walk away by the way a lot sooner it's just that she wanted to hit that number or other people are asking the question that they they are going I don't in my mind how the particular goal like I Am not fixated on\nMaking sure I have a certain number before retire ... what they really want to know\nIs how much do they need to retire and when somebody asks me Mike how much do I need to retire what they're really saying is how much do I need to set aside for retirement so that I can walk away from this job never have to go back to work again 'cause that's not what they want to do in retirement and live off of\nMoney for the rest of my life right and so how do you take money that you you've been saving and you've been doing putting money in year after year after year and you're watching it grow and grow and grow and then how do you transition into retirement because retirement is potentially thirty or forty years of unemployment\nRight if you think about it you're not going to go back to work so it's very very easy to go to work an hour and I'm not saying your work is easy but we get very accustomed to you know I I go to work I Do my job I get a check\nI use the check to pay my expenses you know and as long as they keep showing up for every single week everything is taken care of and I've got a certain standard of living that I'm very comfortable with unhappy with but then when you transition to retirement you have to figure out where the ... going to come from\nSo going back to the question how much do you need to set aside for retirement well let's\nTake a look at your standard of living and what does it actually cost you to maintain that standard of living and then let's take into consideration things like inflation and things like taxes because it's not going to get cheaper overtime\nAnd if we incorporate all that into a financial plan and then we take a look at how you're currently invested and what are your odds of success right because it's possible you don't need a financial advisor if you've done everything you need to do in a financial advisor can't provide value but there's no reason to have one\nBut it's a financial advisor can provide value if they can show you how to get a higher average rate of return that you're doing on your own\nNone of any for you're paying them you know the ... providing value if they can do that and also reduce the amount of risk you're taking to get that return they're providing value as well so answering those questions like how I set aside enough for retirement or how much do I need to set aside for retirement\nThat's part of putting together a financial plan\nAnd then once we establish how much you need to set aside for retirement and we put together a financial plan that's efficient meaning\nHighest rate of return you can get another fees but also minimizing the risk you're taking to get that return you know then we found a good spot and that's where we need to be so sitting down and having that financial plan put together is really critical if you want to answer those questions so for anybody who's listening if you'd like to come sit down for our comprehensive financial plan\nWill put that financial plan in your hands you can take it to your current financial advisor if you want will show you how to implement on your own if you want or if you want us to implement it for you that's fine too but gives going next ten minutes and what does it for you complimentary\nSee where you stand to come

Nineteen Ninety One McLean gave his interview any ways to ask for about the the millions times\nWhat does that song American Pie mean to you and and that's your answering the question a million times done explains it means never having to work again for the rest of my life\nIf I can imagine renting one song and that's it you know as you know just live off of that not that that'd be nice you know I hear that a lot from a bans over the years that became one had wanders and they had that one song but you hear it again in commercials in movies TV shows\nAnd they make a lot of money each time for that so they can just sit back and you know\nCollect the money off of that the royalties or whatnot but I'm sure they probably wouldn't have hits to three and four so\nAggressive Don McLean he's he's been going at that song for ah what forty years at least\nFor a long time yeah so I Will not use a little history and trivia facts about music so I I'm the music guy and Mike you are the financial guy given us great information about\nRetirement so you know we're talking a little bit earlier about before the segment a Mike how do you help clients achieve a dream of never having to work again so how do you do that\nIt's a process Doug I I think we need to look at where are you currently are right now how you picture your return what what what's your picture of retirement you know what you think it's going to look like\nIt's different for everyone so\nThat there is no sort of blanket approach that we could talk about here on the radio that's going to identify every single person out there that side they're close to retirement or we're currently retired which is why again you know people hear us talk every single week about you know comes down\nWhat's doing analysis of your current portfolio let's put together a financial plan for you\nPart of it is that that that get to know you I Need to know who you are what it is you you're looking to accomplish\nAnd just personality is a big part of it Doug people feel differently\nAbout certain things and it's all about you know where we've been where we're going in who are you where are we from\nAnd all those components go into a financial plan it it it's not just cut and dry as\nSomebody just sitting down with you having you fill out a form\nChecked the box so they can figure out what your risk tolerance is you know and then just dropping you into whatever their portfolio is based on the way you check the box is off\nIt's not that simple I mean people feel differently about different things and through these conversations and and the one on one get to know you and then putting together a financial planner able to do that\nThe other thing that I I the way I feel and what I Do know about our clients is nobody's looking for the hanging their approach it's very hard to deal with in retirement is not so bad\nIf you're working because your portfolio does not drive your quality of life you're not worried about never having to work again 'cause you're working that's where your income comes from\nWhen you step away from your career and you were probably doing it thirty or forty years or you're getting ready to step away from your career\nYou start looking very very closely at your assets and you start trying to figure out a way to make those assets you know last the rest of your life provide you with an income stream that you need adjusted for inflation and taxes moving forward but then also preserving the principal\nI never meet anybody who wants to just spend it down right and and people go every once in a while some bill say something like well hey listen if ah if my last check and balance right before I die that would be great\nWell yeah that would be great I mean I think all of us could agree but none of us know exactly when we're going to pass away so it's not a responsible way clearly to to build a financial plan so we build these out to where we can show people listen if if if we invest the money this way right and if we get this average rate of return fees\nAt this risk level given the amount of income you need adjusted for inflation taxes moving forward this is how you'll be successful if we do it this way and it's very empowering I think to put that financial plan in people's hands interim exactly how it works\nBecause then it eliminates that that big big concern which is how do I get from point a to point B point a being retirement and point me being you know I don't know age Ninety five or one hundred or whenever we leave this this world so\nThat it was a big part of that and and it's\nPeople look I mean we're we're private wealth management firm so people start to wonder well I hear you on the radio you're probably all management from here to talk about portfolios\nYou know it sounds good mind but you know how do you accomplish that and there's a couple of ways we do that but as a private wealth management company one of the things that I Know dog is nobody wants to be the next victim of the next Bernie made off\nRight and we don't we don't know where that person is but they're out there and we know they're out there somewhere and and there are people certainly that are perfectly willing to different people have their money\nSo the way that we you know make sure our clients realize that's not what we're here to do is we utilized custodians are custodians or companies like fidelity Charles Schwab ... so when people invest with us their money goes to the custodian alright\nAnd we don't have access to their funds we can't pull money out of their accounts we can't you know I Can't go to South America or some country without extradition right and take their money with me I have no access to their money what I have is limited authority to manage their account on their behalf as a fiduciary right\nAm legally required to do it in their best interest and so there is a complete separation there we can be a private will management company so I don't have some big corporation telling me how I have to invest client funds you know a lot of times I Know there I Would I Know is there a lot of people out and her Doug sitting on a a pile of mutual funds or something right\nBecause they're working with some company who believes you should be a mutual funds and I'm not saying that's wrong but I don't think you can put everybody in that basket and say everybody should have a hang in there ... who comprise of\nBill funds I don't like that if I was retired I wouldn't want that and so I Can't promote that to our clients and say hey you should hang in there and not worry about whether the market's up or down it just doesn't work I personally would rather have a relationship with an advisor to have a vested interest in doing well\nWho was not just going to leave me invested in stocks all the time because I Want to be invested in stocks when they're doing well and I want somebody to get me out of stocks when they're doing poorly or likely to do poorly that type of relationship I Would be looking for which is why that's the type of relationship that that we have with our clients and that's how our portfolios work\nAnd I know there's a lot of people out there that don't have that type of relationship so I Would invite you if you don't feel like you have that type of relationship or it looks like just a bunch of mutual funds or you don't really understand what's going on and you just want to great financial plan and give us a call\nCome sit down and takes about an hour all sit down with you in our office either in Jacksonville Orlando Melbourne palm coast the villages but we'll sit down with you at whatever office is closest to you\nYou know his real life wife is who played vierra and she was always off screen whenever they had some conversations or she was nagging him or something like that so\nThat was cheers I missed the show and but thank God for Netflix you can watch all the reruns on there too so you are listening to guarding your nest egg with Mike Lester I'm Doug Harding infer Christian Charles our phone number here as four o seven to seven zero one thousand and the website is guarding your nest egg dot com\nNext avenue is a website that focuses on baby boomer issues says it's practically impossible for the average person to intelligently navigate their Social Security system so my only this on here so how do we figure out whether it is what we need to figure out\nAll right so when it comes to Social Security one of the issues that have stuck as there's there's a lot of information out there and it starts to get really confusing\nAnd then companies or a financial advisors or insurance sales people I mean you pick a but they are using Social Security and the confusion around it as a way to basically tried to get people in their office are trying to get people to a seminar or something like that and and they're almost confusing the issue even more\nSo it doesn't have to be that complicated there is a lot of truth around the fact that there are certain strategies you can use\nTo get more out of Social Security but every one of those strategies involves you delaying taking the payment right and the fact is is if we all knew exactly how long we were going to live we could probably come up with a really really really efficient Social Security strategy but none of us have the answer to that\nAnd that's why we need to take a look at Social Security and then all of the options that you have when it comes to Social Security as far as when you should take it should you take it at sixty two she take it at full retirement age which is for most people around sixty six or sixty seven should you wait till Seventy right you see all this is already starting to get a little\nConfusing and then if you're a married couple\nSome different strategies there if you are divorced but you were married to your spouse for at least ten years or something else there so I don't want to get this all convoluted what I Want our listeners to understand is that everybody's situation is very unique and there is no one stop shop or one best way for every one when it comes to Social Security [noise]\nIt is an important part of any financial plan which is why we include\nThat full Social Security analysis and missiles curry planning and timing strategies in every financial plan that we do\nIf you want to go to a seminar and have somebody to talk to you about this for an hour or something I mean that's fine I personally don't think it's necessary it's not as complicated as they make it out every single one of them Doug\nJust flipped on their computer and put your permission and that in five minutes it's been out all the information so it's not that complicated but again it is an important part of any financial plan we want to make sure that you're\nDoing what's best for you when it comes to Social Security and we will do that for you at our office we'll leave it at that\nYou know but we want to make sure we're doing what we need to do it's confusing but but we can take care of that and we do it in our comprehensive financial plan\nIt is kind of confusing Social Security maybe not the most exciting thing either but you need to know about your Social Security and you know how it benefits you are how maybe you need to change up your Social Security making it seem as talented wealth management will definitely answer the questions for you they have people standing by\nTo take your call their numbers for oh seven to seven zero one thousand\nFor like seven to seven zero one thousand and you can find out to more at guarding your nest egg dot com now Mike I wanted to bring up something since this show is all about retirement you have people coming in sit down with you and talking about their retirement and it's always kind of a\nI Would say sometimes a stressing time and then I figure out the retirement that eventually you're going to have to retire so how often are your clients that they come in that they're unsure about their abilities to retire\nAlso an ability retire is a big part of it when you take a look at um ability I think there are a lot of people that they feel like they're able to they don't have that road map for lack of a better word you know so so certain things have to be in place in order to to transition into retirement so imagine somebody who\nDecides they're going to retire well they I mean let's say their their retirement date is the first time next month\nAnd they step out of their career what that means the checks are going to stop coming in one of the first things they have to figure out is well how do I start pulling money out of my\nInvestment accounts and how do I do it in the most efficient way possible because that's not set up I mean currently all you've been doing is putting money into it\nSo one of the first things that you would do even without a financial plan is you adjust link your investment accounts your four one K. your eye or air or whatever and you'd set up distributions and you're probably going to want to distribution once a month and maybe one at the beginning of the month or the middle of the month you know everybody's a little bit unique\nThe next day you're going to be worried about his taxation you know how is that money tax\nLiterally in order to to get those two components meaning how much money I'm going to pull out every month and how much tax\nYou have to understand your budget right what is that number I Need every single month\nTo take care of all of my expenses simple things like should I set a little bit aside every month for those expenses that that are are it's not my mortgage or it's not my insurance was not my car payment or or what have you it's just discretionary items you know how much do I want for that\nSuit that on a surface sounds really not that complicated but you still have to go through the process of setting up that income stream but then you start wondering well how much can I take out before I get into a situation where I Would run out of money right in the ... you have to have a way to measure that\nYou have to understand inflation's impact on your portfolio\nYou need to understand how taxes impact your portfolio we we don't want to spend you know or pay I should say more in taxes and we actually need to that's just a waste so there are certain strategies when it comes to taxation\nWe talked about a little bit earlier on the program Doug there are are different buckets of money some of our money is one hundred percent taxable on some of our money only their earnings are taxable if we have Roth accounts none of that is taxable\nSo do we just pull out of one until it's empty then moved to the next one or do we pulled a little bit out of each one you know how do we put all of this together and so it's really those moving parts and the individuality for each person as far as how much money they've set aside for\nWhat their sources of income or going to be in retirement how much they've set aside for retirement and then how was that money invested\nIn we compare that to everything that's available to them because if we can show them exactly what you want you to access and how to access it shouldn't exactly how to save money on taxes and then also show them how to be as efficient as possible in that portfolio right we all want the highest rate of return that we can get but in retirement we're just\nThere's no reason to take lots of risk\nFor no other reason than it's too hard to recover right we can't afford a loss like two thousand and eight after we've had all this growth and we need to transition into retirement and understand our financial plan is going to work\nFor

I think you need to sit down with somebody who can help you navigate these markets\nHealthy participated market gains when they're there\nBut also we need to look at how to invest fixed assets if

and\nThis comes down to it now says Christian which is why we recommend a we're talking on the radio it's really important to understand your portfolio and how it works your portfolio might be an a

about inflation and interest rates and how those things impact your portfolio and the future of their financial life and your happiness get details to at guarding your nest egg dot com\nNow talking about how the market's doing so well right now only recently mocked the tenth anniversary of the two thousand eight financial crisis in a lot of people are wondering could it happen again well of course that could end it might but\nNobody has a crystal ball that financial author Suzie Ormond tells the NBC it's important to remember that the market bounce back from two thousand and eight and a big way\nA fortune may Saturday ... thousand and if he hadn't sold if he didn't panic you in the city so pretty today it went to even be funny but they've got all that they're starting to get nervous they should I say I do that\nFor getting a laugh and that's the last ten years said have taught by\nMike let's talk real life here in Florida what ... might be getting a little nervous\nWell first of all I listen to that and I think that it's not easy to hang in there when markets were as bad as a way and I think the hanging their approach is is is very very hard for anybody to deal with particularly if they're close to retirement so it's one thing to say\nYou know now that we have a crystal ball and go on the radio or your TV show or whatever you have and go hey listen if you adjust hung in there you'd be fine right now\nIt's not that simple and if you were suffering at that point in time and losing money hand over fist in your four one K. or IRA or whatever retirement account was\nAnd it was affecting your retirement hang in there is not easy to do a lot of people let emotions take over and and got out and then they didn't have a strategy to get back in and and and those people yeah they feel like they missed out but\nI guess I just take issue with anybody saying hey you know you should have hung in there everything it'd be just fine it's not easy to just hang in there when things get really really rough you know it's your money it's a ... it's very very personal\nSo the flip side of that as it is having a strategy and my argument against that sort of hanging their approach would be well yeah that sounds well and good and and and she's sitting there saying if you're just held on to be so pretty right now well it wasn't that pretty for a long time you had to wait a lot of people you know five six seven years\nJust to get back to even and now maybe in your portfolio you're feeling better about it but it took a really long time so the alternative that was well what if you're working with an investment advisor that has a strategy that's tactical right actively managed portfolios\nAnd we're looking at indicators and we say listen I based on what's going on and makes no sense to hold equities at this point in time so we are going to go ahead and get out and if we're wrong yeah you'll miss out on a portion of games but our clients are individuals that are either retired or close to retirement so bottom line is they're more willing to give up a portion of games the narrative take big losses\nAnd that's essentially how we manage our portfolios but\nHad you done it at that point in time Christian you'd be much better off what if I got out ... indicators weren't good and then I waited for indicators the get go when I got back in and will\nNot only would you not have lost a ton of money when markets crashed but you also would have had an opportunity to invest all that money that you saved by not losing it into a market that was lower and that's what they're not talking about their\nSlogan we promote working with a fiduciary and working with an a fee based advisor that has a vested interest in doing well we promote actively managed portfolios we don't like hanging their approach and Christian I think we just have to add value if I can show somebody how to get a higher average rate of return\nThan what they're currently doing that have been easy they pay us there's no reason to work with us so we sit down with people week after week and we put together financial plans analysis to help them figure that out and put that financial plan in their hands so if you're listening now and you let it comes down to that analysis or that complimentary financial plant\nJust give us a call in the next ten minutes and will do that

her I was Nineteen sixty nine stills and Nash especially released this one ... and they seemed to open their performance at Woodstock a few weeks earlier but they didn't\nOn all three am on the third night so here's the thing those who left being all responsible they get to work on Monday morning not only missed Crosby stills and Nash they didn't see Jimmy hendrix hold out the festival and he was one of the most iconic figures of that time at Woodstock so a lot of waiting for a lot of waiting\nAnd people aren't I guess like hey I got to go live my life Monday so I gotta go\nWould've hate to admit that doesn't sound good and so my ... actually kind of an interesting question you like music I Love music when you Katie go to a concert whether it's just date night with you guys or if it's something maybe for the kids I don't know right I mean one of those folks that stay till the end or do you leave a couple of songs early traffic\n[laughter] so it depends a lot on who the who the band is okay it's because at this point with the kids right we do both so we do the Venus and bands at Kenyon I enjoy and then um we also do a few things that I'm like is like so\nAn example of something kids would be more interested than us would be I mean I was sixteen year old daughter so we and the and then also a nine year old daughter and six year old son so Taylor Swift is pretty big like you know in that group yeah I wasn't particularly compelled to stay to the end [laughter]\nOkay so the now the Taylor Swift but not your favorite thing every now and I know my favorite thing and I'm sitting there imagining trying to get out there when everybody is trying to go so\n... early was actually pretty great situation but yeah we're we're totally open to hanging around if if we don't have anywhere to be I\nThink as you might not a good thing like Jimi Hendrix something iconic like that you\nKnow yeah I mean if we can do Crosby stills and Nash I mean clearly at this point you know I Would say till the end but that'd be really hard to pull off\nYou're right though kids do change everything and if they're with you you might need to head out of their cars they could be getting a little and say well we liked to reminisce about things that happened in yesteryear that were a lot of fun and also just a part of our history and pop culture and history\nAnd we also like to talk about how you can use active wealth management to develop your own strategy that's personalized for you and your situation based on what you've worked hard to save accumulate invest all these years\nTo be financially competed now and in the future of your retirement and have a retirement income plan\nHe's got questions about that does it guarding your nest egg dot com or you can speak to Mike or another team member here in Florida off the air force there were seven seven zero one thousand you know dream about retirement that's one thing it's fun to do it's an opportunity where you can bring big and\nStink of everything but pay for that dream is another thing might the tips that could help people get ready to leave the full time workforce and sail away toward their own dream\nTo transition and we do talk about that are on the radio program certainly when people coming to visit a lot of the individuals that were talking to some of them heard the program one times I've been listening for years you know and they said hey listen I'm I'm looking to make that transition I just want to make sure I'm prepared\nAnd part of that is taking a look at exactly where they're at so they're very very typical scenario would be somebody coming in what you say it's a married couple he has his investment asset she has her investment asset so each of them have been working each of them have been sending money aside for retirement\nAnd uh both of them having the matches and and they just done a good job and they're trying to figure out how to make the transition the biggest issue with the transition\nIs figuring out I mean in in at least an individual's mines is how do I go from putting money into my retirement accounts for the past three or four years\nTo pulling money out of my financial accounts for the next Thirty years or so\nAnd not having that money run out right and the big question is how do I invest the money to make that happen now we talked earlier about inflation and what is your traits were like in the early eighties and the math it'd be really really simple if we could just go down to the bank and get a CD for Eighteen percent\nRight I mean and what's on your ... retirement of you to fix Eighteen percent of the most people go like hey I'm outta here you know as a whole take this job and show that kind of thing\nBut that's not the way it works we're not getting those interest rates at the bank were not likely to ever get those interest rates at the bank unless something goes horribly wrong along the way I guess that means we've got crazy inflation and the government's had to raise interest rates up to that point to um basically stop an even bigger problem\nSo what we're doing is we're we're helping people create efficient portfolios\nTo accomplish what their goals are and not everybody unless you spend a lotta time every week again we do this Monday to friday every week and we do this radio program on the weekends but not everybody knows how to take that portfolio and create an efficient portfolio by efficiency I mean how do you get the highest rate of return I can get\nBut I also want that return with the least amount of fees and least amount of volatility\nAnd most people right now markets been good so they might look at their portfolio and think well you know my average rate of return pick a number of let's say you're averaging eight or nine percent per year on your portfolio over the past ten years and then this past year has been really good meat you you could be up eight ten twelve Thirteen fourteen percent this year\nBut what's your long term average but then also more importantly once you transition to retirement how much risk are you taking to get that return so it was a little process I I I go through with individuals and sitting down at the office and then we'll take a look at their portfolio and look at what their average rate of return is and\nLet's say that we look at it and and your average rate of return is about nine percent per year and it's pretty good to feel pretty good about that right because we know if we go to the bank\nUm we're not going to get that if in our brains were thinking while you're just going to the average nine percent of my portfolio I'll be finding retirement that would be great but then we do another exercise where we go ahead and test how much risk we're taking to get that\nReturn and what we're doing is we're measuring the drawn out what what would happen if the markets crash on your portfolio which is essentially what people are wondering about but we can define that for you what would actually happen\nAre you ready to get in get out and get paid flipping houses in the Orlando area if so here's an amazing opportunity for

extend wishes to him and his entire family as well ... thank you\nFor reminding me but there was an attack on men there's no question about it\nAnd you can say that the Christine\nBlasey Ford lousy forward however you pronounce it that coming out after capital but that was the start this goes way way before that there has been an attack on men and on masculinity going back forty fifty years but it is intensified the last number of years with this contrived statement called toxic masculinity\nThat all of a sudden if you are born a male\nThen you are born with a toxic masculinity gene in your body that when you are born a mail from the time you come out of the womb\nThan you are a future sexual predator your future criminal that's how some of the ultra ultra left wing feminists the nut cases the whack a doodles that we're seeing on the ultra left these socialist lives that's exactly what we are seeing now\nAnd so we are seeing not only that but we have seen the intersection of political correctness with now the war and attack on men\nLet me give you a perfect example of Winston Churchill one of the great leaders political leaders in history one of the great statesmen of all time went in the face of the German Nazi invasion\nHe stood tall inspired instilled confidence of course it helped with the United states of America and other allied nations including Canada and the other allies but really the United states let's face it United States and secondarily Canada we came to save\nEuropean allied as is there's no ifs ands or buts but he instilled confidence saying we shall never ever ever surrender\nWinston Churchill always with a cigar and the the whiskey in hand\nAnd what is amazing is that\nHe was very popular during the war after the war's popularity waned when he was out of office number of years later popularity skyrocketed there's no question that his popularity probably higher today than ever except when it comes to the whack a doodle ultra lives\nThat now seem to\nHijack the political correctness conversational maneuvers let me give you a perfect case in point\nX astronaut Scott Kelly\nHeed his brother astronaut Scott Kelly alpha male no ifs ands or buts you're an astronaut you go to space in my estimation you're an alpha male when I was growing up in the sixties late sixties early seventies I mean in Nineteen sixty nine I'm\nYou know it was five six years old and I remember when men landed on the moon I remembered Neil Armstrong Buzz Aldrin Michael collins Apollo eleven\nI remember vividly at my grandmother's house washing on their ...\nBlack and white TV with the space age remote and everything was space age back then everything was space age if you had tank was space age remember the the drink tank and I remember everybody said that every product that came out a new microwave radios transistors it's because of the space program that a lot of it was\nA lot of it was but I remember everything was space age it's a new amount of space age men are radar range microwave a new space age refrigerator space age from everything was space age but I revered those aspartame were gods and today I still think those guys that are exploring the new frontier exploring space\nThere alpha males you going full seven ten geez you're an alpha male no question about so Scott Kelly\nWas making eight or rocket a derogatory but making a negative in a polite way I Will say negative tweet negative comment about President Trump taking a victory lap at the swearing in the public swearing in ceremony of justice or Kevin all at the White House earlier this week last Monday\nAnd Trump took a victory lap and he kind of went after some of the critics send that I thought prompted a fine job I had no ifs no problems with it whatsoever there was an attack on Capitol\nBasically labeling him a rapist they sexual molester or sexual ... without any evidence and when people say well\nChristine Blasey Ford we she gets the presumption that that she's right he's wrong no it's not how it works I'm Sorry and don't give me this be as well it's a job interview therefore the presumption that he is innocent until proven guilty does not exist no that's wrong too\nAnd the witnesses that she named every one of them including her very lifelong best friend a Democrat by the way came out and said I don't know I don't ever recall meeting Brett Kavanaugh we weren't at that party never happened\nAt admitted that lazy forged people pressured her into changing her story and she said I'm not going to perjure myself pull the FBI everything got to give her credit\nPull the truth told the truth tell the truth you don't get in trouble very simple\nSo Trump took a victory lap no problem okay and of course you've got the the lame stream media going after him and saying oh he was not magnanimous he was he was spiking the football oh please spare me\nWell Scott Kelly excess route Scott Kelly to each one of the greatest leaders of modern time sir Winston Churchill said in victory magnanimity I guess those days are over\nNow you look at that tweet okay he disagrees with Trump I thought it was actually a good treat I thought hey look he made his point it didn't ... just basically said look quoting the great Winston Churchill and victory magnanimity and ah you know I always felt that when you're when you don't like the ball you win gracefully you lose gracefully\nMean more lady ah the great hall of fame football coach the Buffalo Bills had him on the show many times used to always say when you're when act like it when when you lose you lose gracefully\nThere is the right decorum so maybe Trump did swipe the ball a little bit but it was not over the top it was not a noxious\nAnd I thought that Scott Kelly's tweet was appropriate well not so fast my friends all of a sudden he starts getting a lambasted and bombarded with negative tweets and replies critics saying that Churchill\nThe great leader who rallied Great Britain and the darkest days of World War two against the third Reich against the Nazis\nHelped lead the ... the allied victory over Adolf Hitler and Nazi Germany\nWell all of a sudden Scott Kelly\nGets bombarded with people associating Winston Churchill with Adolf Hitler why because they say that's Churchill was an imperialist and a columnist and they quite at him to Hitler and the next thing you know relatively quickly thereafter\nHe tweets a reply saying and I quote did not mean to offend by quoting Churchill my apologies I Will go and educate myself further on his atrocities racist views which I Do not support\nAre you kidding me this smacks you know when you take a stand and you you make a quote if people don't like it too bad a problem in this country as we apologize to quickly if you have an opinion and you believe in that opinion and you believe that Churchill was a great leader others may disagree\nI don't care if there's ten thousand people who disagree to your one who agreed was with a statement you don't apologize if you have conviction in your statement if you believe in your statement do not apologize\nBeing alpha stand by your opinion I have many people that say I get emails saying well I disagree with your opinion you should apologize and my reply is I Believe in what I said I'm not going to apologize if you don't like it you can respectfully disagree with me I have no problem with it and I'm happy to debate you\nKnow most people will debate me because I have the facts on my side and what I usually make a comment it is fact based but you may have your own opinion but the opinion of equating Winston Churchill\nThe leader of Great Britain during World War two equating\nHim with a Nazi being a Nazi because he was an imperialist than a colonialist sorry that doesn't cut it and when Scott Kelly\nAlpha astronaut rolls over\nLike a defeated dog that is to me unacceptable have the ... to say to all those people who disagree with me and our equating Churchill\nWith being a Nazi I vehemently disagree with you you may disagree with me but I Do not retract my statement but instead the UN ambassador for space\nPresident Trump's taken the
