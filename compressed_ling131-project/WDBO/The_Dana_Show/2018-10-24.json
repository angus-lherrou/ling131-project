organized obviously this I mean I it is absolutely organized a right now\nA coma and there are governor Cuomo's giving a press conference bill de Blasio also just gave a press conference at the latest that we have\nAnd let's see here we have seen and that was a vacuum created the package with that that it was an explosive device that was sent to the New York offices and apparently it was ... it was a direct to John Brennan\nWhich is more on it because he's a contributor to MSNBC so I ... if that person isn't the it's not that they're not the the\nSmartest are the sharpest tool in the shed as it were so we have the latest um uh we have Wasserman Schultz who apparently received a package Eric Holder Cuomo a and this was after sources yesterday all for\nA link to\nIt but the four of them are linked as what we do know a four of them are linked and I'm trying to see 'cause this is all all of this stuff is coming in a relatively fast they uh San Diego union Tribune was evacuated and I don't\nKnow if that's related or or ... or what they're still kind of investigating at\nThe way that I understand it the so the the package that was sent to\nHolders office had to return address the Wasserman Schultz like killed the packages had a return address of Wasserman Schultz [noise] so uh and\nAnd you get so there's there's a lot that's happening right now and that was in sunrise Florida her because she ... the uh in sunrise Florida at her office they are also received a package a show this I'm looking at more the also the Clinton the Clinton went through a male sorting facility so doesn't actually go to their house\nBut it went to a sorting facility\nUh CNN was evacuated some time ago the White House issued a statement saying we condemn the attempted violent attacks recently made against\nA former President Obama or Clinton Secretary Clinton and other public figures these terrorizing acts are despicable and anyone responsible\nWill be held accountable to the fullest extent of the law the United states Secret Service and other law enforcement agencies are investigating and we'll take all appropriate actions to protect anyone threatened by these cowards and then there was also\nLet's pull a this up as well\nUh there was a statement also from Mitch McConnell\nHe issued want a little earlier saying quote a I stand with all Americans in condemning today's attempted acts of domestic terrorism and as we continue to learn more Americans are United in gratitude for the first responders the secret service the postal service and other law enforcement who protect our leaders in public figures from such unconscionable acts and quote\nSo this is the latest as we are kind of watching to see exactly what comes like ... is there anything else what else is there good grief [noise] um but I think you I think it's safe to\nIf it I think that it was all organized um and to me that makes it terrorism\nThat makes it terrorism and apparently a so let me see New York is saying that\nThe Soros Clinton was Soros Clinton\nA Cuomo and I think the CNN one\nWas they that they are all linked I Would imagine all of them are like not just those I think those are just on the ones that they were able to confirm and apparently um wait there's more there was a letter I don't know if all of them received it but there was a letter containing a white substance\nA potential ... explosives so apparently there was a letter I mean all of this is like coming into work so we're juggling it as it as it's coming and\nUh and that no no nothing was addressed to the White House a ... in New York uh NYPD has sent officers to\nA media outlets across the city yeah the packages listed Wasserman Schultz is a return address which I think it's weird um and that's according to CBS local in New York they said that the one that we're apparently ... cents to\nClinton Obama their uh their story and centers because they smartly and I would imagine you know you kind of have to you have to have a facility that goes through Medicaid habits to your house your former president ah that those those packages had Wasserman Schultz is the return address it's important because it shows a disorganized\nAnd then it's one individual or a one entity so\nThis is what we know the U.S now on this far um and\nThis is I'm a CNN their their headquarters were evacuated um and a parent I mean anchors were pulled off air alarms going off in the building and so it's ... there's and so there is a lot for Secret Service an FBI to figure out\nA lot for them to figure out um audio or do we play twenty three hundred and twenty\nThree that's yeah that's what they said that they that they secured the device they take them to and from what I understand they take them to\nA different facility correct to where they detonate them that's what I thought it was like a robot said there's no no no they remove them from the ... and they take them somewhere and then I think they have a robot come in and detonate them or do whatever\nToo because my on my TV shows or moment reference for that but I have that moment on CNN where the alarm went off live on the air if you wanted to hear how that went\nTo yeah yeah yeah you know what I mean 'cause I think it's kind of interesting where most of the joint terrorism task force is taking the lead on this investigation\nWas movies are no longer suspicious packages are saying that they were rudimentary but functional that means they were explosive devices or to a project\n[noise]\nThat sounds like a lawyer will keep you posted on that but that projectiles that is a a future you often\nSee bombs or as soon as where ISIS is usually here we have the\nRight yeah yeah so it yeah very much just yeah very much so uh this is\nVery um ...\nI mean it's still a developing story and it is uh Mike Pence or just spoke about it a little bit earlier audio somebody twenty two I mean this was maybe twenty minutes ago listen to this\nOr just new [noise] good America [noise]\nBut when it was for the source\nOf either the are the United states Secret Service there will be very closely with law enforcement officials will continue to monitor the distribution [laughter] those responsible will be brought to job\nNow so I just uh to me it seems like this is a this is Tara it's a it's a it's a terror a ... and it's\nJust all terror now I Know that promote the Blasio we're we're getting into some politics with it um which I I just I think I don't know how you can do that right now because we're still determining what the heck is happening um I think that you have to make sure a people or say first be that you\nDo we even know are are all of them have all of them bend a secured I mean are there more out there I think before people start politicizing the issue and blaming the administration\nAnd all of that maybe perhaps they should wait\nFor more information to come in there's nothing wrong with waiting to see what other information comes out\nUm I don't I mean there's there's never been anything there's no nothing wrong with that I mean there's been I mean for instance I remember back when there was a there was a run of a bomb threat on a a a whole bunch of Jewish centers after\nThe election and it was this a disturbed it was in Israel and it was a disturbed teenager\nUh there there were the rice and letters that were sent in two thousand and fourteen to the New York city mayor to the White House that was\nThat was a scorned deliver trying to frame their husband so I think it's a very important that people just kind of weight and makes and wait for more information to come in before they start rushing to politicize things\nI mean that you know that's just that's just the nature of it and so this is\nWe're going to be this is what we're going to be we're going to be watching the story and getting developments or from it as a as we as we get them then there's just a lot of information coming in right now uh with the White House statement McConnell statement will continue objecting you as well to the or the Caribbean it's still coming from through Mexico a shoulder to fourteen thousand\nUm will also have making Kelly who is apologizing for a statement that she made or an argument that she made yesterday on her NBC show um there was additionally and I and I want to go and hear about the um K. I. R. O. channel seven\nHad reported as in Washington that there was a guy that made five bumper to state buildings and for weeks\nAnd he made one to the ... office in Olympia, Washington so it it this isn't the only and I know that they're ... and there's and I don't there's copycat stuff this happened obviously before all of this stuff today but dang people are on hinged they are absolutely

and none of the stance have posted marks\nIts wasn't mailed this was handled liver and ...\nIt's true that if you're if you're emailing if you're sending a package and it's like this heavy gear to put

went off right in the clearly in to some people that are experts looked like hoax type bombs which you know great so I really believe this was to create a narrative as were less than two weeks out from mid terms\nThat the right as violent and the Dems are calling for civility and they want to ride that narrative until mid terms to increase the vote the the democratic vote turnout and the votes for Democrats and the this is I look at it as a coordinated effort I Know that\nYou you don't see it that way and you know some people don't see it that way and I may be completely wrong and I'm willing to accept the radio cane I'm at risk you know I have enough I think we've been doing this long enough to to notice what Dems do when we're leading up to midterms like this or any election\nFor that matter it's the medium Dems have been in bed together for so long they both suffer from bed sores is just the way it works so\nWell right now so ah\nYeah I\nI might have taken some I I don't know if it's your hot and then I see what you're saying it's just it's the whole thing is weird I I think it's just I think it's it's super easy to\nSpeculate when we don't know enough yet 'cause we're

news\nAfternoon two o'clock news Ninety six point five double duty video cooler weather finally here in central Florida we are tracking a little bit of rain though will tell you where coming up in a second\nFirst or job story this our President Trump's strongly condemning with the White House is calling imperative tax or for President Obama and other prominent Democrats roasted pipe bombs that were intercepted another package sent to CNN which also contained a white\nPowder saw here today it was a effort to terrorize clearly is an act of terror\nOur free press police believe the devices were sent by the same person is our Washington watched oj me to bring two point oh continue searching coverage you get\nI don't know that's what I'm really I'd just insane that's just you know the thing so as soon as the president comes out we're going to go live with that he's going to work on these packages that had been that\nBut I Am just and just mystified as I mean why would it have I don't know the ... the\nThe stance on it then sent by courier et cetera et cetera so the one that was sent to the Clintons apparently went to the I guess that one went through the United States Postal service I'm assuming\nI'm I don't know how many were hand that's what I'm actually actively looking for right now I'm trying to see if that can I can find and we are owned news department I'm trying to see if we can find out how many were actually would deliver hand courier and how many were\nUh how many were over my career and then how many were actually sent in but it is weird I'm so now what said that the one that was sent to waters that was intercepted at the processing facility in Capitol heights\nThat\nGoes that was that was intercepted at the at the process at Capitol heights that handles mail going to the capital according to free congressional leadership sources that package was addressed her office but never made it that far so that\nDid go through a that did go through the United States Postal service but it was intercepting\nAnd so we'll see huh but\nUh this very yeah and the congressional mall sorting facility has been cleared by the bomb squad there but the facility was locked down for hours as I understand that they move the devices and then they take\nIt somewhere else they take it somewhere else uh and then\nSee if it can be I guess that needed or however\nYou know they can they can they can do it there but just just very um this is just insane just as a sell insane and apparently now yeah because we had there was one there was the first one I guess the first one was sore us I think\nUm and that was hand delivered sources that and I I don't know if that I guess that might have been a career I don't think anybody has ever said whether or not it was a courier but it was still roses I'm ... I'm Still like why would you put dams on it\nIs I don't know why would you put stamps on it if it was sent by a career I don't know thoughts emitted by I mean that what came here over there I can\nI just this is look again we've been doing this a long long time and I know you're not in the business speculating because that's not what the shows about but\nAt least I can express that speculation on my part okay you go ahead and you 'cause you're speculating over there and that's exactly what it is because obviously I don't have any proof and that's kind of how it's designed\nOr up to this point because if you noticed this will take a while before we really get all the answers on how this all happened in whatever my guess is it'll take longer than it takes for terms to get here\nAnd this is an effort on the left with the coordination of the media to do this and this this is how I Believe now\nI'm only basing this on my experience on how the left acts up politically okay so your idea\nSo this is this is basically my speculation but then the eight years but yes you know you're supposed to be clear but I I Can't help but think that not only was this coordinated which is what you believe but it was coordinated\nIn an effort to help the left as we enter into mid to less than two weeks out and they don't mind making a big hubbub about stuff like this they don't mind ruining the guy's life\nAre being appointed to the Supreme Court they don't mind doing any of that stuff that's how I feel about it and that's how I think this is\n... ...\nWell and so you have all these questions about jeeze why stamps Jews wise wider wires and both ... everything looks dumb and ... because of exactly how what I'm Talking about\nI definitely understand that there is that\nThere is that sentiment out there\nI still think it's just like I think it's too early to be able to say yes that is absolutely the ISIS flag bets on this\n... at least ... you know what I'm saying is I'm speculating and I'm being honest about the fact that I'm speculating that I don't really have any tangible proof to back it just tobacco what I'm saying but it's just too coincidental for me to just sit back and believe all of a sudden less than two weeks out from mid terms this is what happens\nLike all of a sudden ... like\nThey've been way more violent before if someone truly was going to retaliate against the Democrats would have been way before now\nUh in regards to how they've acted since twenty sixteen since Trump Trump won the electric so to me this is too convenient of time and I'm not swallowing the idea that it's anybody from the right doing this to dance and I'm not ...\nWell I just don't well this ah\nYeah I [noise]\nSomeone else made the observation it was an envelope it seems like it was not meant to go off\n\n[noise] I [noise] I don't know but I don't know what that they will just Valerie I'm In a box may I Would never be novel open a bus it's not like a box is going to be\nMagical rather yeah it's not going to be any more protective\nSo it just to me please we know that uh we're\nAll now going to be bomb experts where\nDoes the left pay for protests on both sides so that each side has you know some sort of either positive or negative view because we've seen how paid protesters\nFor now ... now here's here's something else out so now a a job the morgue auto who's an executive producer over at CNN says at the package that was sent to the building was delivered by career they had previously reported that the package that was addressed to George Soros was put in the mailbox not mailed\nSo was it\nIf it was so hand delivered because remember how I literally like two minutes ago said they said hand delivered but they didn't say courier if it was just place in the mailbox and a staff person found it 'cause that's what happened it was a member of the staff had had had at first\nAnd then my right is it now to fill a need for us and non mail delivered to put something in someone's mailbox no matter what you can't go into someone else's mailbox just like a\n... well it's a federal law to federal ... yeah\nI Would have to break real quick because the president's going to be speaking at some point soon at well that's why my friend Johnny Jones I messaged him 'cause he's on Fox I was asking him because he's a bomb tech expert\nSo uh yeah this is

so far\nWell first things she has to treat everything like if it's a big bomb and they can go off at any moment you evacuated record in baseball you push people away a certain distance or your blast brag collateral damage radius\n'em and you judge that um well basically you get everyone out of the building is what you do\nThen when you have an opportunity to a movie called prosecute or attack this potential bomber id you look at this little clues and accused the sea okay what is this and that was working or can I Do to the feed it would be the only picture that's available that obscene personally\nAnd a hundred percent guessing and that's the the best part to be an expert at and do your\nIn a new look at it and say okay well there are a lot of things here that just don't add up so ... and lives in a very good bomb maker or it's a hoax bomb or something that's so sophisticated that looks very different than what you would expect\nI can tell you that my gut feeling is the picture of a pipe bomb that we're seeing probably could not function as a bomb but there isn't enough there to say that definitively and fortunately the right people are working on it and we'll know very soon what it is a perhaps maybe once every him individual will know more along the lines of if it would have ever been a bomb to begin with\nYeah and and that's that that's the other thing that and I love how you know that because of your training and your expertise and that's because I looked at it and I thought that was like a bomb but that's all that's all I Know I the wires and I'm like that looks dangerous wouldn't want to touch but you said something that really intrigued me that it that it that it looks\nLike it it may be perhaps it the way that it was built it wouldn't explode and people keep telling me about the amount of explosive material that's important as well I'll be explain a little bit a bit on that if he was\nSure at first thing people need to understand is that fireworks kill more people every year than any other type of explosive so big things can come and small packages without being at looking at the picture without much the scale of by other than what looks like six pack abs it's a pretty small pipe\nOr I so you can't have that much explosive material in it to begin with if you have water is going to both sides that's presuming one set of wires is going to other components like a power source so if you're trying to contain that within an already small time you're going to reducing the footprint of what the explosive material would have within that pot\nOne thing you have to have a certain amount of over pressure in order to uh to create the explosion in other words if you are for lack of a better explanation tried to ignite explosives in a container much larger than the explosive itself then it'll do what's called low order or it won't actually blow up so if there are components and things within the ...\nReally what you get into as it is not very well made bomb if it is a full of bomb and could explode and there's a good chance it wouldn't explode even if it tried but all that aside we see something that looks like a bomb melt the people that are nationally known and political figures it needs to be treated that way until ... we found out otherwise\nRight to you it doesn't look in ... and one of the reasons I asked Mrs because for an eye on one of the photos there there were reporters at buzzfeed and again I none of that was confirmed it all just some reporter speculating I don't know if this looks like the ice a swagger look what this looks like and they were kinda everybody was kind of debating as to what they thought the skill level was and therefore\nHow much of a danger that individual posed because I mean is that is that a fair assessment to think that if it's a more sophisticated looking device in a person's probably more dangerous than just you know some of what what might look like at first glance some kind of not job more on that can't is not really doing anything well thankfully\nIt it is but at the same time that doesn't really get us anywhere if we sit here and go oh this person is it that dangerous next thing you know something blows up because we didn't read it that way\nSo it's not I mean I understand people's curiosity and understand the need to talk about this even this early but at the end of the day there are things that appear to be bombs making their way all the way to the repetitive in some cases a very influential people which means this is a dangerous person um you know it doesn't take a rocket scientist\nTo use a gun make a bomb used tools that are out there really when it comes down through the Turing and the sad thing finding bad people rooting them out every hitting them and getting them away from any opportunity to do things like this I mean\nYou know we talk about firearms all the time you can't legislate your way out of an explosive threat all the walls are already there it's illegal\nBut at the same time all the tools or very much readily available fortunately Rickles were first and then we can look up ways\nTo make bombs legally so at the end of the day we have to rely on law enforcement to do their job support them raise a flag when we see something suspicious and then will dissect how effective this person was or wasn't hopefully not very effective at all\nOr maybe by the end of the day that person can be apprehended um so you know what if we're talking about this picture that surfaced in what looks to be a bomb\nNo it doesn't look like something that would be very effective but if you compare bombs in Iraq and Afghanistan the more simpler bombs had a higher success rate because if you've ever played the game mousetrap more complicated than it is the more can go wrong\nOn so there's a lot of ways to spend this and look at it as a bomb tick looking at that picture my expert opinion would be this is probably not a full of explosives device but there's no way of for me to make that you know with any confidence without being right there on it and having more information [noise]\nRight well Johnny we so appreciate your
