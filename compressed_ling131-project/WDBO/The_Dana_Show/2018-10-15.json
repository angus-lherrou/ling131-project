good afternoon one o'clock it knew he was Ninety six twenty five WFDD our top story any minute now the president and first lady Melania Trump will be getting a look at the devastation from hurricane Michael on Florida's panhandle [laughter]\nA a\nNews cycle than this one right here so let me get a hold on let me give you the back story so um this let's start with how the Boston Globe because remember\n... yeah you know if I'm Talking about Elizabeth Warren and her ethnicity here that it's something happened to the Boston Globe ran a story checked us\nThey ran a story and they uh were trying to kind of a\nCause she's been bothered for a really long time about her claims previously that she was an American Indian Native American\nAnd the problem is that uh she's not [laughter] so she lied about it she had refused to meet with Cherokee genealogist she'd refused to meet with um you know a number of like actual indigenous American groups et cetera et cetera so the Boston Globe ran us the story and she has\nBeen ... about it all down morning my gosh you guys quote about it all morning so\nAnd then the Daily Beast you know that they coordinated this at the Daily Beast because right after the Boston Globe runs therapies the Daily Beast runs there so you knew that it it's it's all coordinated\nSo the Daily Beast after the Boston Globe ran this peace uh they said Senator Elizabeth Warren has taken the extraordinary step of releasing DNA results that proves strong evidence that she has Native American ancestry the\nBoston Globe reports yes extraordinary step you guys [laughter] oh [noise]\nThe analysis of her DNA was done and she said famous geneticists\nDoes what she had said about whatever I Want to come back to that we look like that for me 'cause I'll come back to that and I'll forget [noise] so the Boston Globe has this huge oh my gosh Elizabeth Warren and on the way let me go to her Twitter account real quick 'cause I got I got a role that in hold on let me go to her Twitter account\n'cause it's worth it it's worth it so she take this you guys she takes us and she has been tweeting up a storm\nAll morning long oh my gosh\nLet me start let me farmers are dark so this is so crazy [noise] she wrote can I use her voice [noise] okay\nMy family including Fox News watcher sat together and talked about what they think of real Donald Trump's attacks on our heritage and yeah so famous geneticist analyze my DNA and concluded that it contains Native American ancestry I get it Donald Trump is afraid of facts\nBut I'm not on the facts are clear a deep independent investigation shows my background played no role in any job I got oh my gosh I'm so coming back to this [noise]\nI never expected my family's story to be used as a racist or political joke but I don't take any fight lying down I Want you to have the power to fight the lies with the truth\nSo there's a new site for you to review every document for yourself Elizabeth dot com Elizabeth Warren dot com slash heritage and then she says remember\nTrump said on a July fifth that you get one million dollars to a charity of my choice of my DNA showed Native American ancestry\nAs she said I remember here's the verdict please send a check to the national indigenous women's resource center send them you're one million dollar check I mean she's treated this for hours and hours and hours like I could still go on but you guys get to pictured should I read more for the guy she went for hours she tweeted\nAbout this okay so I Know what you're thinking you're thinking oh so what does that mean that most Americans I think everybody thinks that they have and most people do because America's such a melting pot right uh so here's the problem though okay so at first it was\nFirst they said she was won five hundred and twenty fourth right\n... and they and they didn't actually use they didn't actually crossed this with actual American indian DNA they went to like South America and use that that I'm going to come back to that\nThey asked if anything it first she's like one it proves she was won five hundred and twenty fourth Latina but I digress\nIt's not like there's you know a dearth of you know actual Indians here or anything that she could you know to get to use but other than that it's not a stolen out to see what they do pay so that you know that's so that doesn't even prove anything Elizabeth Warren because you know you said that you were an actual Native American but wait there's more I just I'm not even started\nSo now the Washington Examiner noted because of the Boston Globe had a little correction\nAfter they were trumpeting this one five hundred whatever and Elizabeth Warren raged about it all morning [noise] someone had the ... problem so they went back and at the very bottom of the story they had to add it should always ready\n[noise]\n'cause at first it was won five hundred twelfth our point Nineteen percent and they said that was strong evidence that was their quote the Boston Globe said war has strong evidence of Native American heritage already okay now here's the correction at the very bottom of the article that they had pushed all morning quote correction\nDue to a mass air a story about Elizabeth Warren misstated the ancestry percentage of the potential tenth the generation relative it should be one one thousand than twenty fourth [noise] that would put the percentage at point zero nine\nWow\nNow to see you know the New York times had an article in two thousand and fourteen that discussed it was the largest genetic profiles study and what they discuss what they discovered was that European Americans had genomes that on\nA rich held point Eighteen percent Native American ancestry\nShe's at point oh nine seven that means that European Americans are are more ethnic than she is\nShe does not even register furthermore she it it's not even a ... D blood quantum measurement that they used in in indigenous nations to determine inclusion into the tribe\nBut that's not even the thing that's not even the thing let me let me put something up to you\nAnd then I and then we got a lot more we have to I just I'm just starting on this I don't know if I sent you you guys this that audio though\nSo that's not even the same and I've talked a lot\nAnd we have um talked to an uncovered quite a bit about her ... her ancestry claims right uh because she has said she had this crazy story this really crazy story where she was talking about her family\nAnd she had said that\nIt was her mother who was Indian and her parents had to a low so that's a little bit more than ancestor I don't think I gave that I don't think I gave that to you guys and she did this um\nShe did this interview this was when when was this this is back in two thousand and twelve that she did this interview\nAnd it was with I don't remember who was and she was asked about this listen to the story\nActually you're right or wrong about what it is I Believe was starting to ask\nMom and dad all will very much in love with each other and they wanted to get married and my father's parents said absolutely not [laughter] you can't marry her because she's part Cherokee parts Delaware and\nUm [noise] after fighting as long as they could my parents went on sale oh it was an issue when I write\nWhat so what\nThat that's not so she actually was saying that her mother was Indian\nShe wasn't just Elizabeth Warren wasn't just saying that she had ancestors do you see how she's trying to subtly move the goalpost she was saying that she was Native American\nFurthermore she actually began in the eighties identifying herself as a minority she did physically herself\nShe changed documentation first off you know the Palau chow book that she plagiarized\nBack in the day they said that the back of the day Elizabeth Warren who then lied about\nHer ancestry in the news her new attempt at defending it just blew up our face a she submitted recipes to Native American cookbook called powwow child they were plagiarize recipes from a French chef and she said that they were her native\nFamilies longtime recipes and she signed it Elizabeth Warren Cherokee now that's not enough for you wait there's more with the purchase of one lab job you get a bonus laptop free\nSo she changed her identification on her academic documentation she actually began identifying herself as a member of a protected class\n\nShe identified herself she changed it and she actually checked the box for Native American she changed her ethnicity from white to Native American when she was at University of Pennsylvania's law school and I was in the eighties\nAnd then she changed it wasn't going to Harvard and that was at the time when all these companies were encouraged to diversify their hiring\nSo she actually changed and check literally checked the box and began identifying that\nSo when we come back she's demanding that Trump give her a million dollars because she said she ... she was\nIn it she had ancestry well she never said ancestry she said that she was Native American but since she was one one thousand than something or other that's about nine hundred and some odd dollars out of a million so maybe he should just donate that we're gonna we're going to get into that as well and wait until you see how the media has bent over backwards to protect her you are going to laugh and\nWe have a bunch of other stuff where you as well including the latest that the Saudis story a

didn't know how to fight [noise]\nThey didn't know how\nThe way he explains history as a riot it is hysterical but he was in Ohio right he's an Ohio and he was talking about a Ulysses S grand was from Ohio and he was going to you know talking about somebody notable from the state it's at our cetera so\nHe in this story because everyone's like the proof that he's racist he became the the nice things about robbing the proof that he's racist he was actually talking about how he said yeah he was saying Robert he was a\nGood general but Ulysses Grant was greater\nAnd that's how we ended up losing here's the thing I don't think that people here say that him staying as racist and this might be it stretches like pat and\nBeing called a racist because he believed that rumble was a decent general

that's you know what happened\nBut the fact that they tried to making like a racist I guess underscores the fact that these people either don't understand history because they weren't taught it or they're trying to be purposely ignorant\nBecause Robert he when he was asked he was given um a role of of a a general over the forces the unions forces before the civil war\nAnd they tried to recruit him and he was actually Robert he wrote a bunch of stuff that comes later he was not for secession he was not for he was a\nVery much I very reluctant he took ... days to think about this the reason ultimately that he ended up working with the confederacy is because he did not want to bear arms against his home state of Virginia\nAnd you know it divided his family it was but they and then

listen geneticist quote your samples from Mexico Peru in Colombia to stand in for Native American\n... okay okay\nWell okay\nIt's not like there's there is not any Cherokee that you know could have [noise]\nAnd again it was one one thousandth or something or other it's less than what European American half\nThat's the other thing it's less than what European Americans have which is wow\nAnd that was from New York Times piece that there was a a huge study that was done\nThis with goodness way says a couple of years ago and\nIt said quote with respect to European American percentages are much more different than African Americans or Latinos with America European American genomes being Ninety eight point six percent European point Nineteen percent African point Eighteen percent Native American hers is point zero nine so it's actually less than European Americans and points\nThere are nine percent let's make that clear because point zero nine as ms point your average around ... percent that's [noise] that's pretty crazy\nSo it it's just it's just worse\nBecause she is an average white person who said that she was a Native American so she could get jobs because then around eighty seven is when she began changing her ethnicity on farms that she herself filled out wow\nYeah and so it was about why guys will now I proved that you didn't prove anything actually and if she thinks that Donald Trump or was a million dollars because he said if you prove you're an Indian and she goes well I ... no she literally said she ... she was an Indian this is the most is is the dumbest\nThing ever were going to we got more on this and the latest the media the hill came out with a defense the stay with us\n[noise]\nMaybe six point five double the baby with him or led by new sound window solution about to leave the station\nIs news Ninety six point five in the window turns first for breaking news\nHappy Monday two o'clock news Ninety six point five ... we are all dry out their ear in Orlando we're taking a look at the interactive radar hot once again though we are did not have those false temperatures for long\nIt'll take a look at the interactive radar coming up first start top story this our President Trump getting a bird's eye view of Florida community shattered by hurricane Mike\nRight after he arrived from DC truck praised governor Rick Scott in front of reporters at Eglin air force base\nClaim here is that her mom was so much Cherokee and Delaware that her parents wouldn't that you know her dad's parents wouldn't allow them to be so she would at least be one for one sixteenth you would think but\nI don't even look at it that you know they were looking at the DNA is improving inter Mexican people was really ... and she's still only one one thousand and twenty fourth\nOf that yeah yeah\nThere is no proof here who makes up a family or a story about the family being racist like that if she lies about her family like this and throws them under the bus do you think she's going to treat voters\nGoodness\n... oh my gosh I bet you are more to do oh yeah\nI bet Trump is ... ... you should take it he should seriously do like a twenty three me thing I Do think it was interesting that uh this morning he story in Florida\nAnd he's like not even paying attention to her and she went on for hours this Twitter rampage talking about this and in the Boston Globe cannot the oh no sorry we screwed up\nWe I'm Sorry we messed up a she's actually a one one thousand something of a Peruvian and whatever which they they use that to stand in front Native Americans something other than you might but point out she's now she's saying we'll prove my native ancestry which it doesn't\n[noise] she said Cherokee where tobacco she specifically said she wished Cherokee she literally signed her name and the Powell cookbook as Elizabeth Warren hype and Cherokee\nShe used to that to identify on documents when she applied for jobs in the late eighties when she was at the University of Pennsylvania law school in eighty seven is when she changed her ethnicity and Harvard said she was a Native American and they called her quote their first woman of color in ...\nThat's a really inconvenient fact that a lot of people are missing she very\nVery subtly moved to the goalpost\nAnd of course everyone wants to circle the wagons so to speak that's what they're doing media to the defense so I have to tell you to\nYou guys know my you guys know my I'm a\nTemperament when it concerns biased right I've got to let me share something with you I got to shut us there 'cause I thought this is funny so we did a bunch of stuff earlier and I even said you know most Americans have like some form of you know Native American ancestry\nSays hill decided they were going to look into my tweet and everything I say it's always on our a spokesperson even though that's like one part of what I Do\nI Do radio program ... TV commentary on an author I write I Do all kinds of stuff but anytime I like blink it's an already spokesperson so that they can try to denigrate a group that I work with which is separate from everything else\nAnd they so this reporter from the hill I got this has this report from the hell is doing a story about Dan lashes tweet on all those are the foreign uh where did she come up with the and I guess they're quoting him a the most Americans of Native American ancestry what did she come up with that data information\nOh really so I decided not to go ahead and respond to this because it's just you know how I Do it's just how I Do right so I put it out there and like hey guys by the way the hills getting ready to run a um how did they put it\nMay make sure I Want to read myself correctly\nShe uh uh\nOn the lives of an unlimited foreign um\nHer comments nobody nobody is right about the video no one's written about any of that I just found out that the hell is preparing a reaction story and tweets about Elizabeth Warren is the way to fight back for her they're going to look at everyone sweets as opposed to warrant false claims why don't people trust media again\nSo it's interesting because the question that I was quoted ended up being vastly different from the article that they literally just ran and of course they ran in RA spokes person that's what they ran\nYou know because I'm not I apparently media people think that women can't be anything else like it's never again to lash radio show ... best selling author it's an hour a spokesperson\nArea and said anything about any of that I'm Talking\nAbout it now I realize that's so troubling for me of people it's so hard for you know but yeah that's how the hill ran but they did walk it back or because of that they quoted question that I got was very very aggressive\nAnd I'm like you this is the stupidest thing I've ever seen but they I mean it's fascinating and I even asked I said you know or any of these journalists going to talk about this video here where she says her family's racist because her mom was still a Native American that they didn't want her dad Mary and her mom\nYeah\nSo that that's just what makes up a story like that\nSo the media began spinning CNN quote Senator Elizabeth Warren has released the results of the DNA Analysis showing she had just didn't Native American ancestry which could preempt further questions and attack should she run for president and twenty twenty now that's the whole point of this by the way just to you know\nAll of this was only ever countering Trump's attack this was hurting her\nAnd it ended up making it worse it ended up making it worse\nThere are so many good pieces and tomorrow we're going to talk to twyla Barnes the Cherokee genealogist that Elizabeth Warren would have nothing to do with and I think that lives with Lauren I'm\nInsulted her when she came out said famous geneticist trying to insult twyla Barnes I think with her wording Elizabeth Warren is still a fraud she also once claimed to be the first nursing mother to take the New Jersey bar exam and the the New Jersey bar the New Jersey judiciary said that's what\nShe she's a granddaughter that's what she did\nShe actually was considered a minority hire at Harvard she lifted literally lifted herself as a minority and you have to fill that out you have to identify yourself\nThey don't just do it for you don't listen to the people who are like oh I Know that that didn't stop she said herself that way and she they actually she and then\nAnd there's proof all all of that they have you guys really say a PDF of all the stuff like her applications how she was lifted in the academic journals it all is out there so it's stupid and pointless to try to argue this otherwise\nI mean she that\nThis was back during the time when everybody was under under pressure to diversify their hiring so Harvard was like well we can say we have we diversified are hiring and she was able to get a job I\nHow many actual Native American she disenfranchised by taking these spots\nI mean she I mean\nIt doesn't and there was a a really good piece about her and the Atlantic um I let me ... that is really gets into I mean she has pretty much faith almost everything\nAnd making them a card all wrote this skating takedown peace are saying that\nThere are so many problems and she went after a her book the two income trap\nMegan McConnell did an academic takedown of her book of Warren's book you have to go read the whole thing because it I mean she gets into the weeds very much so but um for instance um my friend David French wrote about\nHer signature work of academic scholarship same war made a name for herself in the pre Obamacare years with a pair of studies claiming that\nMedical bills were responsible for an extraordinary share of American bankruptcies this research presented the left with an ideal talking point that they admit that the medical system wasn't broke and it was a pressing but they said that I'm One of her co authors classified of medical bankruptcy is any bankruptcy that included a thousand dollars in medical debt a cetera et cetera\nBut I mean basically they it was they they\nIt was ridiculous making the cartilage and set her work it so much attention because it comes from a Harvard professor professor and this isn't Harvard caliber material not even Harvard undergraduate\nAnd she all accomplish this by leveraging a fake Native American ethnic ethnic claim\nWe have more to get into a and we've got quick five on

on this and I think that there's a lot more I haven't seen a lot of stuff about cars soggy and political like affiliations and things of that nature and um it again it it there's so much nuance here and we live in an era where nuances not to be had\n\nNot to the ad a but he was ... he was very critical\nOf uh the of Saudi Arabia um\nThere was a I mean there have been discussions about his his about his family um you know and we're going to talk to Steven yet more about this but the way that the media he pulled us up\nThe way that the media has discuss is like for instance in New York Times article reality breaks up a Saudi prince charming media narrative because remember the crown prince Mohammed bin Salman of Saudi Arabia\nHe did this whole he ... he went to Los Angeles and he was he visited Hollywood and Silicon Valley and New York and\nHe met with Michael Bloomberg and that with the Google founders and all kinds of stuff and then there was a story that came out oh well he's allowing women to drive in Saudi Arabia and they're getting more rights he's a moderate et cetera so he was doing this this I mean it really was a charm offensive\nAnd at the same time while the Iran deal was being deconstructed by this administration\nAnd so these two things put together and made a lot of made Iran and green made a lot of um Iranian\nOr the surrogates upset\nAnd so that's why this is that's why the story is such a one of the reasons why it's such a hot you know a really a controversial issue and so the way that the media wants to present this is that the president had a full face in the\nCrown prince and Saudi Arabia and this is a crown prince who jailed a lot of the former ah one of the other members of the royal family for what he said was corruption somewhere you know put to death et cetera um he apparently has been cracking down on any kind of like extreme is just as she I mean that's just what's been coming out\nAnd so um did this story has given the uh\nPeople who are living in the administration for pulling out of the Iran deal it's given them the ability to attack an entity that they believe to be partially responsible for said undermining because they believe that pulling out of the Iran deal was a way to\nA tip the scales toward Saudi Arabia as opposed to Iran there have been a bunch of Hollywood folks that have pulled out of Saudi Arabia deals a film deals in business deals all kinds of stuff [noise] um\nThis um and they're trying to stay well just as you know the president can't handle this and uh you know just as he messed up this is why he doesn't he didn't know he he had faith in the wrong person the this is why we don't I mean they they're they basically want to create a justification for their dislike of this administration [noise] um\nAnd so that's it and I've been seen\nUh what was that there were a couple of us celebrities that had tweeted that are very wealthy celebrities that have been treated that aren't they're getting out of certain business deals [noise] um and this is so for instance a Washington Post\nI'm told\nPulled us up I got a lot of information the editor in chief of Yahoo Daniel Klaidman wrote a close friend of Washington Post columnist Jim ... tells Michael is a cough ... as strict as a cough and me that Saudi crown prince may have felt emboldened by Trump's anti media rhetoric\nThat the spin that I told\nYou they're going to try every which way now remember Michael is accomplish the journalists that work with using GPS is said to have been paid by fusion GPS\nTo re appropriate and re purpose a Christopher Steele Hillary Clinton campaign document flash dot CA as a as a original investigative reporting that was later used to substantiate the application for the Pfizer warned against Carter Page and is a cough apparently offered no disclosures of any of this at any point it has never\nActually owned it that's ... that's what the report it so anything what

niners broadcast nationally but only got what we want is sort of on\nMore easy to sneak out or Trump may\nFederal credit unions like I go for it but ... language gene by NFL dot com\nAnd it was a good evening wherever you may be welcome to thirty six degrees Green Bay Wisconsin on the shores of Lake Michigan the sun is setting it is the dust here in northeastern Wisconsin this was a little on with all of a quarterback Kurt Warner or sideline reporter tonight Olivia Harlan decker\nAnd Olivia will join us shortly live from the sidelines here in limbo and the award winning Jim Graves here as well there's always\nFrom our Westwood One studios the Green Bay Packers come in to to win on San Francisco at one in four currently say good evening to you\nAnd uh you know this is an important game for Green Bay it seemed that many people take before the season to make it all the way but they have staggered out to the gate to be sure out of the season\nWill this hasn't been the start that they've been looking for but the great thing is is with the bears last yesterday they said just one game and the wind column behind broke the bears and the Vikings and we know they beat the bears they tied with the biking so that's how important it is is that they have played their best football\nYet they're still in a position to be on the top of their division and that's what you always talk about the beginning of the year\nYeah we want to get the ... when when the super bowl but it all starts with winning they're your division and this is again they're supposed to win that's the bottom line with good football teams is you have to win the games you were supposed to wait a banged up San Francisco team without their starting quarterback playing at your house you're supposed to win this game\nBoy you hate a new set the game up so well but you have to go into a game without your play makers don't you have ... teams come see that's what I\nWas in the company to go out we got we got other guys that we can play but no ... no drawing them all Alison ... and you're going into the quarterback where you haven't been hitting on all cylinders offensively anyways\nYeah these are things that you think about is that you try to block it out but you know you want to have all your weapons to get back on track they still got some good play makers but Aaron Rodgers is going to have to play good football and he's not going to have that comfort zone and some of those guys that have been around for a while\nWhat is the chief telling you on the performance of Rogers to start to see some\nWell I tell you what the other thing is we know that he's been banged up a little bit in where he is always so special is outside the pocket he hasn't been able to get outside the pockets as much this year now he's the guy that can beat you any which way you could throw from inside the pockets but he just doesn't seem to be as comfortable\nIn there as he is when he's out creating an ad living in so he's got to play a little bit better in the pocket hopefully the nice feeling a little bit better so we can do some of those special things outside the pocket of what we know that it starts with number twelve he's going to have to play well tonight and spread it around and get it the old way makers\nWill do the forty niners and the Green Bay Packers around the field right now as we get ready for the kickoff this game between Green Bay in San Francisco and [noise]\nIt is every parents' dream and I speak for a lot of dads out there are certainly listening to work side by side with their child will

pride that I now center down to the sideline reporter tonight in our daughter Olivia ...\nThank you and it's great to get to talk to me like that that there is a lot of fun and to be one of the hallowed Venus and the NFL Atlanta field and looking at Aaron Rodgers warming up right now like you mentioned both teams are on the field\nAaron has on that thinner and lighter brace that we saw and have for three games you know there was talk all we got that he'd go back that clunky big one that's almost robotic it looks like an offensive lineman would where do good news is that he isn't that in a race\nCaught up with I think the coordinator Jo failed\nOn and he said the greatest news errands or every week by week he dies the uh different tell though he did say there was a small step back last week I prescribe because if they tack\nI'll go with the receivers out like you guys were mentioning drawn to miles in Randall caught building said they have to increase their balance this week as good as their path game has been there in the bottom half of the NFL and running the ball now down a couple of guys and then it receiver depending on some rookies they're really going to have to run it there\nThat's nice that starts with Aaron ... he had the most ... last week although he Aaron Rodgers has been so vocal about wanting to get him more involved and don't feel them confirmed that would mean the minutes ago the guys the tight end any grand and Lance Hendricks both only have one touch down this year and sell them to get both of those guys more involved\nThey're tough love you're
