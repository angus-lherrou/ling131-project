like is it raises so because she's not doing it to make a show of it to market but she wanted I mean she the little girl was like four years old three or four years old she wanted to do it because she thought that was the prettiest\nAnd she wanted to be the prettiest for Halloween\nAnd everyone wish do in their own little head space that they wouldn't stop and consider for just among the first officer can has no idea what racism is that you're projecting your baggage on her it's taught\nAnd secondly she wanted to be the most beautiful thing in the world and she thought it was Princess Diana and her her beautiful dark skinned and that's what she wanted to dress up as an all these barbarians on Twitter and Facebook attacking her mom ... most and Facebook attacking her mom and an end and attacking the kid\nAnd then finally other people stepped up and we're like okay this is kind of ridiculous now\nIs this is a dangerous is what I'm Talking about so that you think about your kids how many of\nYou have little girls who who maybe one or to dress up like Pocahontas or maybe your kids are older now but you have little girls that wanted to dress up like Pocahontas or maybe even princess T ana\nThey can't do that now because you're going to be called racist even though people who are saying that you have no idea what the hell it means when using this context because trying to be like something because you admire it is legit the opposite of racism\nBut people are stupid\nBut you can't do that I share the story with you I mean I'm going to bring this back up because I mentioned this on Twitter and nobody believes me and I so I had to go back and be like of why I yeah do you remember when we had the story of the sorority that had to end it taco Tuesday\nBecause they it was deemed offensive\nAs I was offensive attack on Tuesday was offensive it was a sorority and I thought it was fun and they love tacos and you know cetera but they were told that because they enjoyed tacos\nThat they were somehow uh being racist and so they had to end their taco Tuesday the sorority\nAs California State University Fullerton\nThey had to stop the taco Tuesday I think they said they said you're all the ... year old being racist\nSo the sorority says well what we've never ask people to wear costumes and you know some people were ... but it wasn't people love the food and they love the culture and that's the whole thing well then you had the whole world culture not a costume program\nAnd\nThey had to stop it so you can't do that your kids can't dress up as Pocahontas or princess T ana you can't have taco today you can't do anything like that\nBut a white woman up in Massachusetts can lie inappropriate and ethnicity and you all are supposed to look the other way because she got that Democrat white privilege and that's exactly what it is\nI just just crazy\nThat that is I mean as I did have identity politics jumped the shark and I think that's the big question right now\nAnd it was with one was on Twitter earlier and she says millions of people watched you real Donald Trump is you fumbled and lied on your one million dollar pledge and then it took and then took a day for your handlers to tee up this recycled racist name\nA name calling you've lost a step okay yeah I don't think that you know what and I responded because I was like your your wider than most European Americans and you purposely changed how you identify your ethnicity is you can take advantage of diversified hiring if that isn't race is not racist nothing is\nSo you have now you have Cherokee Nation out there the spokes person well that the\nSecretary the Cherokee Nation secretary of state check off in junior he got out there he didn't like what the president said but he really didn't like what what Elizabeth Warren did he said it was inappropriate wrong you heard the soundbite\nHe said it was ... this should not be doing this so it should not be doing this they released a statement just land in her\nThey the statement that they as you said that uh the great majority of her identifiable ancestry is European\nAnd\nShe hit back at them she actually trying to argue with literal actual Indians\nThe statement that they really sort of DNA tests as useless to determine tribal citizenship\nCurrent DNA tests do not even distinguish whether a person's ancestors were indigenous to North or South America\nSovereign tribal nations set up their own legal requirements for citizenship and while DNA test can be used to determine lineage such a fraternity to an individual and it's not evidence for tribal affiliation\nUsing DNA tests to lay claim to any connection to Cherokee Nation or tribal nation even vaguely is inappropriate and wrong it makes a mockery out of DNA tests and it's a legitimate uses while also dishonor ... legitimate tribal governments and their citizens\nWhose ancestors are well documented and who is heritage is prove\nA Senator Warren is undermining tribal interests with her continued claims of tribal heritage\nI mean\nShe's not plan or they're not playing with her so they're saying no that's not going to work but when everyone else says that it's racism so it was a white woman going to call Cherokee Nation racist\nI'm waiting like what do you do white liberals are white progressive because I think liberals and progressives are different what do I progressive do what do you guys do now\nWe have a lot more coming up including that the Lindsey Graham I ... he says well you know what I think I'm going to take a DNA test due to see if I got more Native American heritage and Elizabeth Warren does will discuss that will also get into how the media is be clowning itself\nBecause they are the media does in this and ran like

to senator warns claim of Native American heritage because it like to contact and new to this coming proof she proved that she's actually less Native American by blood than the average white person is

the interactive radar coming up first\nOur job story today after President Trump toward damage in the panhandle vice president Mike Pence getting a look at damage from hurricane Michael today and I and our\nI just don't again like I said I just don't know why Warren didn't just say from the get go\nThat I thought\nI Believe in something that was incorrect down you know and just and then let it go from there\nShould be going from strength the strength right now instead of this\nThat's what's so frustrating about it I Can't stand when people in these stupid decisions you know I just can't I cannot stand people make stupid decisions when you clearly have better ones by the way I guess somebody Fifteen Swalwell clearly doesn't understand this is representative Eric Swalwell he clearly does not understand what any of this was about\nA bit of a fortress you have to do that you know there is no evidence that she was not Native American uh but you know I'm Glad that she stood up for her so she's not going to be bullied or by this president but again the president doesn't share facts don't matter what it said on Monday to give her a million dollars if she predicts\nDoesn't affect anything as to what you do on a Tuesday I did want to see about threats have your ...\n[noise] uh what\nYou said there was no proof that she wasn't I mean we now have it we don't have the proof\nShow because you can't prove a negative than through that house back\n\nI think you are raised this because you can't prove you're not it's true\nOld oh my gosh these people these people I was just not working\nAt it I don't know I'm almost at a loss for words here so I Want to because they have a couple of other things to touch on a we've talked about some of the crazy media um the way that the media has has handled all of this as well we are twenty two days out from the terms\nRight and\nI was looking at Emerson polling has new data out\nWhere they have a\nDean Heller at forty eight and Democrat challenger Jacky Rosen at a forty one any of a percent undecided or you have in the governor's race Adam lack salt is a forty six percent the Democrat Steve just a lack is at forty one percent eleven percent are undecided\nSo Heller is pulling away a little bit\nBut I still think it's a tight race because this is this is just the latest from um\nThat's just the latest from from Emerson I still think it's a a a a pretty a tight race and I'm not the only person because there are there have been a bunch that have been um a moved from like likely them to lean them you know et cetera et cetera\nBut that's actually that's kinda good that's good news though and looking at because the Nevada race Heller is one that I think\nIf they if they lost Taylor and they uh ended up end up losing a it well it's just let me put it this way it's making it more difficult for them to even have a chance at flipping the Senate if that makes sense because they would need a couple of senators to lose their beds\nIn order for that to happen so and looking at some of the um and looking at some of the top Senate races a look at Missouri really quickly because we talked to James O'Keefe last hour or so the ... the average I mean it is I mean it's close\nTo our CPA average only has Holly up by Josh Hawley who's the AG and the Republican challenger to ah income Claire McCaskill they have him it's it's forty six forty five a Holly and he's the ... I mean is literally point for I mean it's very very very close\nUm and this is going to be the really this is a very interesting race for me um because Claire McCaskill has been a juggernaut in Missouri since two thousand and six when she first defeated Republican Jim Talent in two thousand and two\nAnd a this she I mean it\nShe looked like she might have lost and twenty twelve but then you had the ... situation and\nThen a now Trump took the state by double digits and Brock Obama narrowly lost it uh in two thousand and eight Trump won by twenty points and just a\nA lot of the voters that had that have always kinda been reliably Democrat I've been really really disillusioned and so as a result this has been um her luck maybe I may I may be out\nAt though that this is going to be very interesting state to wash in Nevada is an interesting state to watch just because the um the ideological demographic politically speaking has changed uh you have Dean Heller who's the incumbent jak heroes and the Democrat challenger ... up by one point seven is the spread for our CPA average\nUm but I think it's a lot I think it's a little closer than that Emmerson has them a closer and cook has it a little bit closer or as well but will be will be checking that out of Texas was one where everybody I think um\n[noise] uh Beto O'Rourke Robert or work the guy who again you want to talk about appropriation he kind of wants to suggest that he's Hispanic until you call them out on it and then he acts like your bad for assuming that he or white Irishman using a Hispanic nickname is in trying to suggest something [noise]\nUm and in Texas a Hispanic voters weren't going for the Democrat they're not as enthused about the Democratic as a Democrat Party needs him to be so his shtick is not working\nHis whole identity politics appeal which some might argue might be kind of racist or is not working but Cruz's up by seven in the er C. P. spread which I think it's too close\nFor me by the way in Texas and if you notice if you go back and you look at the Wendy Davis situation you need to go back and look more I I feel like they're working right now progress\nAs in Texas because I've always said of Texas flips and becomes Democrat will never have another Republican in the White House again because Texas is what has been making sure that Republicans have the electoral votes to get in the White House or even be competitive\nAnd you've had Democrats have been trying to do the blueprint in Texas just like they've done in Colorado they'd Colorado like sixty three years of a Republican\nUh administration\nAnd into election cycle with an influx from California and a progressive ideological switch they were able to change the state legislature and really change Colorado into a blue state even wrote a book on it literally called the blueprint\nAnd they were trying to do the same in Texas but it's proven to be a lot tougher not just because he expanse but because you were talking about generation after generation and just a very animating spirit of native Texans\nIt's very limited government minded\nUm I mean they teach Texas history in schools and you're taught about the Alamo when you're taught I mean it is very much the reliance on the republic of Texas and so\nI ... it's just a little different here a little different in Texas and so but they've been working at closing that gap that's what they want these are all tests runs and I think that ... or work is still also a test run their whole goal is to just keep closing that gap every single election every single election which is why\nFor them winning isn't really the victory the goal is to close that gap and that's the victory if they're able to to make that spread smaller than previous election that's a victory for them\nAnd that's what a lot of people have to realize you can't just sit back and be like oh you know you still like this many ahead not the point the point is how far\nHow how is the spread compared to previous elections what is voter enthusiasm looked like you have to look at this stuff because that is their victory that is their goal not all this other stuff [noise] uh and then of course we're also taking a look at\nUm if I can pull this up in front of me you have to bear with me in ... to\nWhere it's really close you've got Bill Nelson the Democrat incumbent challenging a or he's being challenged by Rick Scott now the governor Nelson's up by two points right now two point four points\nUh but that's within the margin of error it's really tight is going to be a tough race that's a tough race we have a lot more to get into twyla Barnes Cherokee genealogist joins us to discuss the latest and the

I guess essentially donated to her are\nSuckers yeah here's a headline a friend of mine wrote the great moments in presidential decor on the ballot have done and horse race [laughter] I just [noise] so I'm of two sides of this part of me is like oh you're the president in your so much better and then the other part of me\nThe bar brawl or part of me is like yeah\nI mean so I don't know you know I'm torn look I'm listening to the other side I I just think you know maybe you don't I mean it isn't funny yes why is it funny because\nIt's ... it's as if to Trump is and that the idea that somehow when he walked into the White House that a magic would overcome him and make him not talk like Donald Trump anymore\nThat is such a far fetched dream people need to realize those who are scratching their heads over this this is legit why people voted for him because they wanted someone to just tell you in no uncertain terms that you suck this is why people voted for him\nThey're tired of the I get it that I think that statesmanship we're talking about the Trump Stormy Daniels tweet here I think that there is there's a certain formality to statesmanship and I think that it it it\nPromote civility even restrained civility some might even say a fake stability within the political process and there are some people who think it's necessary even if it is they just said that things can be kept civil by the restrictions of these these some might say antiquated formalities right\nBut at the same time there are other individuals were like you know what's screwed this stuff because look at where we look at where we then let's just go ahead and tell us as it is\nI think that you I\nKnow I don't believe that it took to quote the a ... on a Downton Abbey I don't think that will guarantee as a substitute for wet but it sure is funny and sometimes perhaps may be necessary\nIn those very reserved\nInstances like rationed it out like Charlie Bucket the did his Willie ... you know what I mean like you got to ration that out otherwise people may think you are vulgar but I think he ... I mean I just that horse race came out of nowhere and the fact that he can just wait it out and you know he\nDid that and didn't even think anything of it you know he did he is just like one of her horse race and like I Love to go through and then he goes off and starts talking about palm pay on Saudi Arabia\nSo and at the same time this is one of the reasons why I Do think now bear with me here I Do think that there is some value in it and let me tell you so\nYou have people like oh I don't know maybe the the crown prince of Saudi Arabia he thinks he's going to be getting from the I don't know and some of these other world leaders and you know the Iran theocracy those dude\nIf they see an acting like this on Twitter how do you think that he's going to react if he didn't get what he wants when he's talking with them and negotiations about the escalation\nSo I Do like the idea that hour frenemies and maybe potential enemies think that our guys crazier than they are there's a value in that because you're going to walk on eggshells 'cause you're gonna be like well my gosh this guy may call me or space next suppress the red button you don't know\nIt peace through strength and also maybe making them think you know you could call them ... through certain foods\n[laughter] they're strict and also uncertain day so I I don't know but I I\nAnd then yeah and then he talks about how he spoke with the crown prince of Saudi Arabia who totally denied any knowledge of what took place in their Turkish consulate I mean that's\nOkay so it has been made and I will say this rental out on Twitter makes a really good point as soon as the president gets interviewed by a woman who's sitting in a bathtub of fruit loops of grand ... presidents all the Koran has gone lead and push the ... for all I care now see I Do agree with that\nI Do think because what was that checks named flow yeah glow the flow of it was slow below ... I don't remember ever was I just thought that was weird like you anyway so\nI Do think it's kind of funny and\nHave you know I mean the between two ferns to like this all that stuff and it was weird the river Obama's going to the weird phase where he was trying to be Internet guy also as well yeah 'cause you knew it was going to be going and that's led to exactly\nSo I'm just saying it's funny the because of other stories and I'm Glad to hear the tree isn't offended by it because she came up here to back you know what I mean I'm Glad I don't care I mean I'm just glad that it was it didn't turn into her becoming a victim sort of a thing like I Would have\nHated to hear that from her because she's ... we're talking about his mushroom\nOh stop in his you know him being a year so it's like ... this was the same rhetoric she's been giving him publicly it makes sense that he would give it back um and then were forced to sort of defend Trump in a way I just\nWant everyone out there to know that he says this stuff and then I like even skate and the ballpark of something and he can't has a stroke I just want to I just want to make that\nWell I mean there's a sub ... we have been Trump's pretty much now\nGotta we gotta get rocking because we have a bunch of others so we got caught by that we've got to get too as well and I don't want to completely misses that will make sure that we do that in the meantime as we get moving on ...\nOne of my favorite manufacturers because they make stuff that's cool stuff that's fun stuff that you're going to enjoy shooting whenever you go to the range or what what I mean it's just if they make some awesome stuff\nUh I talk about um a lot and you know I think that scene is believe him\nSo if you're passionate about you know the safety of your family and being able to secure your word no matter what you need to become a believer and invest in the bus firearms out money can buy\nLike a ... now if you already on some uh any contact firearms you that you know there there's so many good reasons to own them all\nThe foundation of what type of leaves goes into every gun they think the performance of design that helps an accurate shooter be consistently accurate performance was also quality of engineering and design as well as manufacturing reliability is a ... type performance to will it work like as opposed to when it needs to\nRepeatedly and consistently performances safety most definitely and it's also affordability\nBut because you know you got to think what what good is accuracy and quality and reliability and safety if he can afford it check out everything that they had to offer whether it's the already be lined the bull ... done right the cash and gee ... shells are I checked it out of your line of sight whether it's the awesome ... thirty or the show copied peace\nThe eighty which is the smallest a little compact gone all three eighty that you can carry super lightweight I think it's like what eight ounces a little of just barely over eight ounces a awesome awesome little a little gun so you have to go check out everything caltech offers K.
