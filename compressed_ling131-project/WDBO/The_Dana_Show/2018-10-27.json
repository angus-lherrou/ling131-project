the Gary and French speakers poor little Bulgarian yeah yeah [laughter]\nSo are you surprised so if that if you prefer to communicate in another language or to really make sure you understand what's going on with your financing we've got someone here to help you\nIn central Florida I Would not be surprised we are a a hodgepodge of everybody all around the world\nActually I like I mean our number four in the country for the now as I'm a foreign national transactions\nAnd so you have to ask yourself in retirement or close to retirement is that the type of relationship you want with your portfolio or would you rather have a relationship that was more actively managed now we're on the active management or tactical side because I Believe we can be smarter and busters there's plenty of data out there\nThat shows us when certain things happen markets are a lot more likely to go down a crash or other things happen markets are a lot more likely to go up right or rally and if we use that information and use it in a way to help us dictate how much of our assets we won allocated to stocks versus how much are us as we win allocated to fix investments are bonds\nIf we use that data and say well hey listen I Know that under these circumstances markets are very likely to do well now I Want to be more aggressively invested or opposite of that I Know under these circumstances markets are much more likely to do very poorly or even crash\nI don't want to be as aggressively invest it to the type of relationship we have with our clients is not just putting them into a pre determined allocation that says you're going to be this much in stocks and this much and fix investments are bonds or we're just going to stay there what we're going to do is slide that back and forth\nHelp you make money when marketing doing well are likely to do well but then also help you protect your assets when mark storing poorly and at the end of the day that's the type of relationship I Would be looking for if I was out looking for an investment advisor I Would want somebody that had a vested interest in doing well\nSo that's what we present and that's what we do for our clients and what happens Christian as we would just\nThe radio program and and every week we get people who call in and say hey listen I'd like to know more about what you guys do and how you do it I like this idea of active management of my portfolio I Am close to retirement or I'm currently retired I don't want to hang in there and days like we were just talking about an eight hundred point drop and then another five hundred point drop\nThat's a reminder that hey listen things aren't always going to be good\nYes I'm optimistic about this economy but eventually that will come to an end and we just need to make sure we have a relationship with our portfolio there's going to help us when things are doing well but it's also going to protect us or have a relationship with an advisor that's going to protect us when markets get back because they will eventually get bad\nAnd by the way Christian mortgage getting really bad or even crashing it's only a bad thing if you're having other approach right in there for the crash site if you have a relationship with the devices that can help you avoid that\nAfter Marcus crash you get an opportunity get back and guess what everything's on sale so not everybody understands how to have access to or how to have that type of relationship with an advisor that's the type of thing we can explain when we sit down with individuals and\nThe way we explain it in the way we show people what we do and how we do it is we sit down and and we do a complementary analysis of their current portfolio to show them where they're at right now what they're likely to average and the rate of return if markets are doing well but also what they are likely to lose markets crash\nWe explain to them what they're paying fees and as soon as you just how efficient is their current portfolio right for the average rate of return you have are you taking more risk than you need to or is there a way to reduce the amount of risk to get that average rate of return and then we apply those numbers in that data\nTo a truly comprehensive financial plan where we sit down and we walk you all the way through retirement\nWhether you're you're retired now or whether you're going to retire in a year or five years down the road we put all that data and\nAnd we build out a truly comprehensive financial planning that answers the questions people have which is essentially\nHave I set aside enough for retirement\nHow should that money being busted if I have set aside enough money for retirement\nHow long will my money last how much income can I have an MIT prepared for things like inflation and taxes and all that we can answer all of that when we sit down and do that announces some and financial plan so for anybody who's listening if you want to get ... in the next ten minutes we'll do that for you complimentary\nFor zero seven to seven zero one thousand that's four zero seven seven zero one thousand\nWhen you have a comprehensive financial plan that uses active wealth management tactical management you don't have to have the concerns about when the Dow dropped a couple of hundred points because their advisors on top of that and that's what Mike and his team at talent wealth management do\nEvery single day especially when there's volatility find out more at guarding your nest egg dot com\nI was wondering the other day when we had this conversation each week here on the radio it's kind of mean different things to different people so here's the question Mike should we spend all of our retirement money or should we leave a financial legacy to our loved ones so which one is the right answer\nWill obviously there is no right answer it's depending on what it is you would like to do personally I I Would say it's a question that that I ask really I'm not every time but very very frequently when I'm sitting down with individuals and they're coming to sit down with us for the first time\nAnd we're putting together the planning for the mental asking the question listen is it a goal of yours to maximize the amount of money that you're beneficiaries receive\nWhen you're gone or do you feel like I just want to make sure that I can live the best retirement I can make sure that I don't run around in retirement make sure that I have an income stream that helped me maintain my standard of living adjusted for inflation and taxes moving forward\nIf I can do all of that would you rather just have them get whatever's leftover after you've accomplished your goals and retirement now I can tell you some people almost apologize to me like they'll say\nWell hey I'm Sorry but the way I feel is the kids can have what's left or the beneficiaries can ...\nWhat's interesting person is probably Ninety five percent of people feel that way and in person for the other five percent that don't feel that when there's nothing wrong with that either so so there is no correct answer to that question which one should you do\nWhat you should do is what feels best to you and then make sure you have a financial plan that caters to that specific needs\nTo you know if you're trying to maximize what your beneficiaries you're going to get you're probably going to spend less on retirement because trying to maximize which are beneficiaries are going to get\nIf you're not trying to maximize what beneficiaries get and they're just going to get you know what's left\nThen you know that's a very reasonable we want to put together a financial plan to make sure you don't run out of money but also make sure you're not leaving a whole bunch of money on the table that you can't take with the right I mean you've earned it enjoy the retirement and that's one of the best things about my job is helping people identify how to make those things happen and doing it through a financial plan\nAn analysis of the current investments server anybody who's listening if you'd like to come sit down again you know come to one of our offices sit down we'll do the analysis for you will put together a comprehensive financial plan for you will do that all for you to give us a call and the next ten minutes\nIf you'd like to speak to Mike and the team

day to day life because most of us don't have a twenty thousand dollar a month a year or whatever budget word reload [laughter] but how important is that dreaded words for a lot of people budgeting when it comes to retirement and it is to try to work I'm not trying to\nBe awkward here but you know it's something it's like taxes he just got a deal with that\nIs a dreaded word ... so what I find is most of us by the time we're getting close to retirement are transitioning into it we we spent in our entire life kind of figure out what's\nIt should be and and most of the people that we sit down with Chris and honestly\nBecause it's individuals who have that nest egg man it is the guarding your nest egg radio show frankly some people call us from week to week and they go hey listen\nYou know come sit down and get an analysis of my current financial plan\nI'd like for you to do a financial plan for me and we have a little bit of an interview process that we go through just to make sure that it's the right fit and then when they say well hey listen I'm forty five years old I haven't actually saved any money for retirement yet but I'd really like to start right at this point [noise]\nUnfortunately I mean for them that that's not what we do and it's not that we couldn't\nHelp somebody or or put together a plan that shows them how to say but but because it's not our niche because it's not what we're really really good at what we do is we direct people to other companies that are very they're very very good at that there are companies that are really really good at low cost approach to saving towards retirement\nIf you're willing to you know set aside a certain amount every single month to make that happen\nNow people that that we're working with or or usually again looking to make that transition from asset accumulation to asset preservation distribution\nThey have their nest egg and part of the reason that they've done such a good job of building that nest egg is they've got a pretty good idea of what their budget is right if they know what their cost of living is on a monthly basis or what their expenses are they established that probably a long time ago because part of that budget was set aside money for retirement\nAnd now I'm sitting with them and one of our offices and we're having a conversation about making a transition and so the big question is they know what their expenses are so we don't really have to put together a budget necessarily\nBut if you ask them for their budget because that's going to go into it\nAnd then we take a look at how much money they've set aside for retirement we take a look at how it's currently invested and we just compare will the way your money is currently invested help you maintain your current standard of living throughout retirement meaning\nWhat's the average rate of return likely to be moving forward for the next ten twenty thirty forty years on your current portfolio\nAnd then also how much risk are you taking to get that return because what we're looking to do this is how we help people is if we can help you be more efficient with that current portfolio and what I mean by that is well for the level of risk you're willing to take could we get you a higher average rate of return to fees because if we can\nIt's gonna make you more successful retirement or for the rate of return you need to maintain your standard of living\nAre you taking too much risk because if we can reduce the risk you're taking to get that rate of return you'll be more successful retirement\nAnd also what we find Christian is a lot of times people have a have a portfolio that will help them accomplish their goals and retirement meaning they set aside enough for retirement it's invested in a way currently that will help them maintain their income stream throughout retirement\nLeave each station [noise] this is six point five ...\nWith Mike Lester and the Palin wealth management on your radio now and only the guarding your nest egg dot com and October of Nineteen sixty or early ... when the eight days a week is Lenin apparently never really liked the song in an interview with labeling magazine he said\nDays a week was never a good song we struggled\nTo record it and struggled to make it into a song everything turned out okay because it became a number one hits so not worrying about that [laughter] sometimes do artists are so picky and sell obsessive about the aircraft that they can get wrapped up in that very easily so I get\nThat you also sometimes we're we're our own worst critic writes yeah it's hard to imagine but there you go obviously a great song\nWell if you've got questions about the craft that we do it's all about financial things that matter if you were fifty and up here in Florida that's what guarding your nest egg is about every single week here on the radio and you can connect and find out more about that right now at guarding your nest egg dot com\nSo listening today here in Florida whether you're in Orlando or Jacksonville palm coast Melbourne the villages or I'd say your town in between do you think your children and grandchildren will be financially better off than you are\nThe pie did some digging on that to find out what the kids in this scenario thing and then you a piano RC center poll finds that about half of young\nAmericans expect to be financially better off than their parents twenty percent expect to be worse off and about twenty nine percent expect to do as well as mom and dad\nWhat are their parents think they're a little more hopeful for their children sixty percent of the kids will do better than they did only twelve percent of their children might do worse\n... ... ... people feel okay it's interesting to think about that but feelings aside what some steps that those of us over fifty five can take today to become more financially confident about our own future because we really can't control what happens to the kids are ...\nI mean there are a lot of us are concerned about I'd say the savings\nRate but a lot of um younger people are participating out I mean\nWe see a lot of people are they're getting the latest phone or the shiny us car or the biggest house and maybe not setting aside enough for retirement as as we think they should but then that's not a discount the individuals that are doing a great job at it and we hear stories on both sides because we're rushing down with so many people\nOn a weekly basis but as far as with our own retirement and our own future we just have to make sure that we first of all we've set aside enough for retirement but then let's look at how those investments are invested\nI had a conversation or just the other day with a very nice woman who\nHad some concerns about her current portfolio in her concern were wasn't necessarily based on on how it's been doing here recently marks have been doing well but um she had gone to her bank and her she'd gotten a buyout from her company took a lump sum distribution winter bank and they invested it for\nAnd um she had listened to a radio show in and she was inquiring about having a financial planner\nAnd as the conversation went on what I learned from her was basically her feeling was while I went into the bank I told my I have this money and they invested for me and I like the person very much they were very nice and they seem very professional or in the markets been doing OK so she was All right with it\nBut her question was but they never gave me a financial plan like I don't have any sort of financial plan I don't really know\nHow things are likely to do I don't know how much risk I'm taking to get the return that I'm supposed to get they they literally just invested the money and that was in no that was it Russia's really know what the next step is\nAnd for her that was that was pretty critical because she's in her sixties and she had a retired from one job and took that lump sum payout and then how to invest in by the bank and then she went took another job and she's looking for\nYou know very specific answers to questions like well if I were to retire now what would happen if I were to retire a year from now what would happen if I were were to retire five years from now what would happen [noise]\nWhat about Social Security when should I take it what about her husband what about you know how she actually set aside enough for retirement to maintain her current standard of living if it was invested the right way\nIs invested the right way or not I mean all those are very very legitimate questions and I think her big issue was\nNone of them were actually answered right it was she certainly accomplished their goal is getting the money invested and in theory it's been invested towards retirement\nBut she doesn't have a potential outcome nobody has given her a roadmap to what that looks like\nSo she has a lot of questions so what what's going to happen is I she she called and I told her we sit down and we'll we'll put together a a comprehensive financial plan to help you navigate you know where you want to be in retirement will also do an analysis of what they put together for you so that you'll understand\nNot just the average rate of return you're likely to get moving forward but also how much risk\nSo explain to her you know once we do all this planning for you\nYou're more than welcome to take it back to them you can show them what we did ask them if they can implement it for you\nUm if you want us to show you how to implement on your own we can do that if you'd like for us to do it for you that's fine too you know you want to hire to do it but either way what's gonna happen if she's going to come in and we're going to answer all those questions and she's going to walk out of her office with um I've written financial plan\nSo that she doesn't have as many questions as she currently has you know about what what's going to happen moving forward and and that's one of the greatest things about our job Christian is being able to sit with people throughout the state of Florida helped them with these ah retirement questions or concerns and just make sure they're on track for successful retirement\nThat's the big deal is make sure that you're on track for these types of things you want to have a successful retirement and it's not something that you can just do by investing in saving all these years yes that is important and we're so glad that you've done that\nUnder the age of fifty that's exactly what you need to be doing investing in saving and focusing on that now when you're over fifty you have to focus differently how can you create a retirement income plan you can feel confident in\nHow can active wealth management tactical wealth management impact your portfolio so that you have more money later on and can make sure that you're confident about the future\nGet details by picking up the phone and speaking to Mike or a team member right now here in Florida off the air and setting up a time to sit down with him in Orlando Jacksonville palm coast Melbourne or the villages\nForce there were seven to seven zero one south that's four zero seven to seven zero one thousand can act as well at guarding your nest egg dot com\nBoy things have changed remember back in the day you could get most everything you needed for the entire family at the age\nElse could you change\nThat's bringing back some memories right there in my time but that changed and now the ironic retailer is on the verge of bankruptcy the c._e._o. of seer says that pension benefits for the company's retirees are to blame it's not online shopping or competition it's pension benefits for the company\nKnown what lessons for people listening today that are counting on pensions probably not from the ears listening today here in Florida but from somewhere\nOh first of all I doubt that the problem right I mean if you hadn't let me say oh and that's the way in there that is the sound and again that what a great just throw back I mean I've ah my father has\nA which I guess I have now but I'm below him not everyone realizes I Know where are our listeners do matter rifle from Sears Sears on it you know oh my gosh that's cool yeah rifles and both motors that whole sporting goods department that would\nRival you know what's going on now I mean obviously the ones that are out there on our way bigger and way better but at the end the day right I mean that was where he went for sporting goods and stuff like that\nAnd then all of it is a change so so much but just going back to your question about pensions Kodak's another good example is an example you know all these companies that have gone under because things change\nAnd relying on a pension isn't necessarily something we can rely on\nBut for the most part when you put together financial planning want to make sure that you know obviously that pension is a part of the financial plan right but also let's test and see if you'd still be successful retirement without the pension because if for some reason you wouldn't and if you're at risk for some reason we could certainly evaluate that for you\nMost of the pensions that are out there right now Chris and I don't think anybody should be afraid of particularly if it's a government pension but things do change over time and it just goes back to how important it is to have a really really strong financial plant\nAnd to understand all the different factors and how they could possibly affects you moving forward whether it's pension whether Social Security whether it's how your portfolio is currently invested\nAll of these things go into building a strong foundation for a solid successful retirement and begin an analysis of that is going to be helpful Christian we're we're getting to the end of days program obviously we really appreciate people listen to us this weekend tuning in we appreciate all the calls that we get\nI Know some people to get a chance to call in and we're still going to offer those comprehensive financial plans\nTo anybody who calls her at the end of the show if you wanna get was called the next ten minutes we'll do that complimentary analysis and comprehensive financial plan complimentary again if you call the next ten minutes\nAnd that's a Fifteen hundred dollar value for zero seven to seven zero one thousand that sports around seven seven zero one south and\nFundamentally things are bad and that would mean you know this economy is is really really starting to slow down I think we're going to probably do pretty well throughout the end of the year and we're confident now that that could change sure um tomorrow news\nBut she got to look at things fundamentally and you really can't get too caught up in the next thing is take a look at how\nYour invested you have to understand your portfolio if that sell off last week was a big big problem for you and it was it created an emotional rollercoaster for you and if you were really really worried at that point in time does that suggest that you're probably not real competent in your financial plant and you probably need a little bit of help\nRight um I think people that understand where they are understand how their portfolios work and understand you know how they're either protected or get information that they are not protected so they could get protected and the portfolio is going to take away a lot of that concern and put you in a position where you are a lot more confident and\nConfident investors so much easier time staying committed to their plan if they know it's a good plan and this type of volatility doesn't bother them a lot but but I think it takes communication and I think you need you need a written plan to actually be able to see visually what your portfolio does when markets are up but also\nDoes your portfolio does when markets are down and understand that you have a plan to to help navigate that so for all of our clients we have very very specific strategies that we use we explained those strategies to our clients and for people who don't work with us who want to come in and sit down and and do some analysis in a comprehensive financial plan we\nLiterally do that analysis for them showing them what their portfolio is likely to do you know markets are up this is what you're likely to do with markets were down and says what you're likely to do if markets crash\nThis is you know the amount you could expect to lose if markets rally this is the amount you could expect to make me once you have that kind of data and your uninformed investor he can make better decisions moving forward the other piece of that is we work\nAlmost exclusively with individuals that are either retired or very close to retirement so they're going to think about things a little bit differently chances are you're not one hundred percent invested in equities if retirements around the corner for you right\nAnd you need to understand your portfolio from the equity exposure you had with stocks but also what about bombs right I mean I think we're moving into a bear market with bonds bonds I don't think are likely to do well for a while so\nYou know this idea of just holding bonds or bond funds could be problematic moving forward all these things go into financial planning and it's about understanding what you have\nUnderstanding how to make your portfolio as efficient as it can be so how do you make sure you're getting the highest rate of return you can with the least amount of risk those are the types of questions that we answer every day when we sit down with individuals and do analysis in financial planning\nSo if you'd like it that kind of information about your portfolio or you just don't feel really confident in what you're currently doing if you want to come sit down with us we'll put together a truly comprehensive financial plan for where we'll give you all that data and then also in analysis of your current portfolio\nWe'll put that plant in your hands complimentary if you give us a call and the next ten minutes\nArtist the comprehensive financial plan kind of see where you stand with your portfolio\nAnd you know give you that confidence in your portfolio as you're approaching retirement or even if you are in retirement as we speak the comprehensive financial planning a Fifteen hundred dollar value call within the next ten minutes the numbers for oh seven to seven zero one thousand\nFour o seven to seven zero one thousand and as always to add guarding your nest egg dot com\nMike I watch a lot of TV because I Do that at night when I get home from work and after exercise and I just kind of want to relax and\nA number of times I've come across these commercials or they're kind of commercials but they're more like endorsements of celebrities who's are trying to give you financial advice and here's one I'm Alex for back Pat Boone here Henry\nAnd I'm here to tell homeowners that are sixty two in older about a great way to live on a veteran time\nOkay I'm a I'm listening finds\nGive me some financial advice and now it's true that can always say what is the number you know so I mean how do we deal with it is and how do we get our clients get clients to ah you know kind of way through all those financial messages and that we see and hear every day\nEver shall I those commercials always made me kind of sad\nBecause it makes me worried about the Fonz like man like give up but I also I Can't knock it because he probably got paid a lot of money do almost nothing right and he figured why not so here's the problem with it I don't blame those guys out for going out and and and making a buck when it's that easy to make\nBut the one that bothers me the most is gold rank are precious metals so the ones out there to do in the gold commercials or the silver commercials\nThey're making statements and making comments and and obviously they they probably don't know I mean they're just the spokes person but there are a lot of people that see those commercials and take that stuff to heart and they honestly start to believe that physical gold is the only way that you can protect yourself against a market crashes and hyperinflation and all that and\nAnd the reality is well hey that's not true you could just go out and and I'm\nOn I'm a gold E. T. F. or something like that and avoid all of that but also what what's not being told to individuals and that commercial is there's not a lot of disclosure and what's interesting is there's a precious metals when it's in currency form\nBypasses a lot of regulation as far as disclosure goes\nAnd that's the reason we see all those commercials is a there is a very very old law and the books that says if its currency is not regulated in the same way that other security should be regulated just to summarize and so because it's not regulated we get a lot of these statements that aren't necessarily even true because it's not being regulated\nAnd also they're not telling you that well if you call up and you buy that gold you're going to pay a premium for it so you're paying way more than the actual cost of gold or silver is\nAnd then they're going to charge you a storage fees you got to put the stuff's somewhere and then if you ever want to get your money back out of it well they're gonna charge you for you to buy back from you as well so the reality is I don't see it as a very good investment because it's going to cost you every step of away you're paying something either to buy it sell it or store\nAnd you could honestly just go out into the market and buy an ATF that would do exactly the same thing\nSo that bothers me about that but it but again this just goes about understanding all of your investment options how they work with the advantages and disadvantages are and building out a at a diversified portfolio but I think also actively managed and we do actively managed portfolios\nWhat that means is we're not gonna leave our clients in stocks stocks are likely to do horribly I mean it just doesn't make sense or going to make some changes on our clients behalf\nIf markets are likely to do strongly well we're going to help our clients my actively buying more equity positions getting more aggressive\nThe reality is understanding your portfolio and I also think work with a fiduciary a fee based advisor that has your best interests at heart will get a lot of people in every week Doug they just want to find out more about what we do and how we do it and what it means to work with a an advisor that uses active management and that is a fiduciary\nAnd I say if you're that person and you just want to know more about us and what we do just give us a call the next ten minutes and we'll sit you down for that complimentary analysis in financial plan\nI think I'll take your advice over the Fonz is advice Mike so I don't know he\nBelieves those financial commercials as kind of just entertainment take it\nTake it a as you will at face value so the comprehensive financial plan a Fifteen hundred dollar value coming to sit down with making his team Italian wealth management call the next ten minutes\nAnd that is complimentary the numbers for oh seven to seven zero one thousand four o seven to seven zero one thousand always at guarding your

Georgia three zero one eight die for zero four eighty nine eight seven three we're\nNot going to go\nBack to the guardian yesterday with Michael insurers commonwealth manager and I'm ... and\nI have to admit I used to love that show my three's company\nChristie she was the original on one of the original three on the show she played a when I was Suzanne Somers [noise]\nAnd she turned Seventy two this week I Can't believe it that she's that old but there's something kind of interesting about what is going on or what went on behind that show is that she left the show\nBecause she wanted an increase in pay from thirty thousand dollars a year to a hundred and fifty thousand dollars per episode that was John Ritter salary that time\nAs well as ten percent of their shows profits now ABC was only offering a five thousand dollar pay raise and I'm thinking you know that show debuted one in the late\nSeventies early eighties and\nThirty thousand bucks an episode that was some pretty good money way back then\n[laughter] oh listen to the difference between thirty thousand a hundred and fifty thousand that's a big deal right we talked about this little bit before the show I mean nothing against her and I get it I think if I was her I Would have asked for it as well\nBut John was the talent I mean on the show does that mean does that make sense I mean she she was good I guess okay I mean I don't know what you do you think she made more money off of three's company or ...\nThat's what I was trying to think of it was it was going through my head of what was that can trash and she was I Would put money on I bet she made more off master\nI should make more than a master yeah I mean I you know her part was important but I mean he\nThe show and he got paid for it so I don't know in a probably didn't I don't buy Michigan thigh master it is what it is to\nPut more people probably remember her from the thigh master than they actually do from three's company and I see that in there are some movies that the master will come up and people will be using in kind of moving on that too so\nSeemed more than the the three's company does\nYeah for sure I still like the show even though it doesn't really hold up\nAs it once did way back then 'cause there was a lot more controversial way back then but we can go into TV shows all the time we're talking about retirement here that's what the show was all about guarding your nest egg with my class or get in touch with him and his team anytime at four O. seven to seven zero one thousand and as always at guarding your nest egg dot com\nAlright so Mike one reason that people put off talking to a financial advisor\nIs that they're not sure what questions to ask now advisor mark ... John talk to parents and he gave a few suggestions why\nAsk the questions what will happen to me if something happens to you\nSo we need to be thinking about uh whether or not the advisors working within a team was the continuity or a succession plan with that advisor to give me advice\nIf you're trying to make a connection with a trusted individual what are the elements that are important to you so one of the things for clients to be considering is whether they're working with a professional seller a broker or professional buyer at advisor that's a good filter to be thinking about what kind of relationship\nYou want to have All right there's another financial advisor but I'll I'll take your your word as a as as gold in here so\nWhat do you think about that and what he said to do you have anything else to add about\nNo I mean first of all do I mean there are lots of great financial advisors out there and uh there are way more people that need help then there are financial advisors so I mean the first trick to this ah being successful in retirement\nAnd uh I think being comfortable and confident retirement is is is finding your person find the right financial advisor\nSo I'd be the first one to give credit where credit's due I I like the way that he frame that uh are you working with a professional seller or professional buyer I think that's that's pretty neat now I talked about it a little earlier when I when I mentioned um I said it differently but I said\nYou know are you working with an advisor that's a fiduciary or you're working with somebody that's a broker and number of reasons to sell products and they'd sell products because they are they get commissions on products now I realize there's probably brokers listening right now they're like oh you know your ear\n[laughter] why are you bashing on us and I'm I'm not it's not that there's not a place for that I mean there are certain investments out there\nThat are going to be appropriate for individuals and the only form that those investments come in is is brokerage form so I'm not hitting it that hard but\nYou're working with an advisor that's only going to promote those types of investments I think that's a problem so I I like the way that he he frame that he mentioned a couple of things like are are you working with a team or you're working with just one person that's a good point so again there are a lot of great financial advisors out there\nEight minutes away from news trafficking weather as you listen to our programming on\nNews Ninety six five and you know there's all weekend long there's experts in people from various industries around central Florida\nAnd we welcome back to the microphone for this segment of the show Dr Patrick change remained the pioneer I was a revolutionary fat burning program burn federal land do dad gummed under it is revolutionary\nWhere you can lose thirty to forty pounds and forty days and\nYou know the real key for most people you know they think that this is a diet and they'll say it's so much more than a diet that we don't even call it a dive we call it fat burning because the difference between the diet in fat burning is that it's all about starvation is all about exercise it's all about pre packaged foods\nShuts drugs pills you know maybe a freeze it up burn it out or you don't have surgery whatever it may be in and this is none of that\nThis is a program that safe effective certainly affordable\nBurning thirty to forty pounds of fat and forty days and they'll tell you what that's what you do we have out of the
