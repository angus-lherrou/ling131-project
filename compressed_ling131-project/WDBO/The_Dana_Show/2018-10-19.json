six forty five\nTrump never said that the media the price of as the enemy of the people he never said that ever just like Sarah Palin never said I can see Russia from my house Tina Fey set it but all these neurons out there thought well it's the same thing\nRight yeah ... never said\nThat the price of the any way that people what he said was fake news was the enemy of the people but the the media that treats and his is whenever it's criticize this is the the media that literally made up more fake news\nHe never said that the price as the enemy of the people he said fake news with the enemy of the people\nAnd I hardly think that that is something that in that is just dumb it's a dumb hot take from ... who is that what you get when you get when you talk with her so turkey says\nBelieve us they've got all this stuff on record we got all these recordings way that I mean we totally had the recording of him getting murdered and all this stuff and but they they say yeah but we're not going to share it with anybody my ... until the press yesterday well I haven't heard a tape I haven't seen a transcript\nThey they released some surveillance photos\nIdentifying an intelligence officer in the Saudi crown princes entourage as being involved but they didn't release any like audio anything like that ... to\nI just the whole thing coming back to whether or not the principals involved the whole thing priests opposes that\nHis entourage people within his entourage decided to go rogue and I just don't I just I just find that doubtful I really do\nBut the way that I mean we have to obviously we were things require an investigation but we are talking with people who think that just mere accusations can condemn someone ... wife too you know at the destruction\nJim Acosta who got mad until someone to go up off last night on Twitter had this to say adios somebody for\nA long record of an angry mob lawyer John\n... with the crowd around on\nAudience when\nIt was a\nGeneral or just doesn't have anything that they were started or I guess so I really don't give a flying rat's ass about the ... of autism but [noise] yeah so we'll get to it later\nYeah he said I just I don't want to feel like listening to him that much you know what I mean it's just I guess he just he aggravates me I hit a friday it's rainy and tired he aggravates me and and and but he said the same thing that you hear me to\nResist gay and everybody else say oh well you know Trump is he's the reason Saudi Arabia kill people because of Donald Trump because\nYou guys know that no one in any Middle Eastern country ever handle anything political like this ever until Donald Trump came into office and ...\nAnd said that the fake news is the enemy of the people here's the thing since he didn't say that and the prices insisting that he did\nJust by their own logic they're the ones who are inspiring violence not him because they're the ones who were insisting that he called them the enemy of the people when he called the news the enemy of the people so the prices are responsible and if you really want to go that far and have that argument which all argument should be based in truth\nThat's the reality of the situation this\nNew defense and this is how the media is reacting to if you want to search for answers as to why this happened\nBecause it does seem weird doesn't it like seriously\nThe crown prince is going to go after them do who wrote for the Washington Post to was a legal American resident he wasn't a citizen who is a legal American resident who lived in Turkey or who lived in London in Istanbul\nWhy in the world is the crown prince going to go after that guy so he was critical of the crown prince that seems weird because there are other people who have been dissidents but they've you know I mean are walking around a live\nSo in searching for questions as to why this happened anytime you ask a question anytime you try to get into maybe the back story like was there some sort of did he was there something between these two in the past like what's up I'm well this is how the media handles it quote headline\nConservatives mount a whisper campaign to marry in ... in defense of Trump\nSo that's how they treat it if you are if you ask questions and you try to get into his background that's how they treat it because again nuances dead and these people are ethic more on you\nKnow I'm not using any nicer words because these people don't merit the energy of a more creative way to stay more on their moron it's\nIt's insane people what I mean in order to figure out what happened you kinda have to go back into someone's pass to figure out if there's something else other than him just writing hurt feelings words in Washington Post that triggered the crown prince\nSo that's the big question and so that's what a lot of people have been doing\nA lot of people have been looking back into his previous political uh associations et cetera there is the story of him being associated with the Muslim Brotherhood\nAnd apparently he was associated and this is according to a couple of other he was associated with the Muslim Brotherhood and he was and it was through that perspective that he was apparently critical of uh the crown prince and\nA Patrick pool who is a terrorism correspondent for PJ Media said that ... was a friendly and associated with\nFighters in Afghanistan that opposes the Soviet Union in Nineteen eighty eight he was one of notes pool a number of a journalist who had interviewed bin Laden in the eighties and nineties and he himself had had had apparently treated stuff previously or had written stuff about uh the Muslim Brotherhood prior\nAnd the federalist have noted that as well\n[noise] um the\nShawn Davis over the federalist to tweeted it's almost like reality is quite different than the evidence free narratives pedal by the media with a long history of cooperating with or getting duped by Iran echo chamber architects\nAnd\nFor the media to say that this was a whisper campaign to try to whatever Trump I don't think people give that much of a crap about his reputation in this as opposed to well how is it that this is again you're a columnist for the Washington Post is targeted by Saudi Arabia how the hell does\nThis happen well there's more to the story as there is with every story\nAnd I do think that Shawn Davis has a huge point you're talking about the same people whose jealously defended Brock Obama's insane stupid non deal with Iran these people are ... are apologist for Iran so if you immediately don't go with whatever narrative\nAbsent any evidence is best for Iran than anything the opposite of that is a smear campaign a whisper campaign what have you but there's hard evidence that\nHe would he was actually friendly to their particular ideology and political Islam Islamic ... more so than some of the soft reformation that people have seen trying to get started in the Arab world\nSo there's something to that\nI mean there's there's there's there's something to this this isn't a whisper campaign this is what you do so I guess any time somebody tries to go and find evidence in a case that's a whisper campaign\nThis what's called trying to ascertain what the heck happened asking questions to receive answers but it's not it's not as cut and dry\nAnd I'm Sorry but I really don't feel like taking the word of a bunch of reporters who were duped by a romance writer in the previous administration who sold them a line of crap about Iran because they like to be an apologist for Iran\nWe're going to talk more about this coming up um additionally we will talk to Louie Gohmert later on in the program a about the latest concerning the caravan that's coming up from Honduras which is great for real you know the mid term election\nA show will get a will touch on all of that we have some hate mail for you and more in the meantime uh when it comes to hiring their

is that there's something else happening here that people are to their tribalism is getting in the way of asking the bigger questions why would the crown\nPrince gamble all of everything that he has built and his reputation as a reformer\nDo all of that on this guy if he was just a lowly columnist\nWhy if\nYou believe as the New York times had written that he was an Islamist here's associate with

five ...\nI asked my husband if he bought one of those one billion dollar jackpot tickets and he tweets so damned passive aggressive choice\nFor some often the most downtrodden the lottery is a tax on hope has tacked on hope [laughter]\n\nHe said that he hates ed I'm wrong but the key is the phone killer when it comes to playing the lottery I so well\nBut I like what you said yesterday and he said well you know it's five dollars do I want to lose out on five bucks on a billion I'd had mentally spent and spent my head I know I think we all have a fighter\nJet really I think so for nine hundred and Seventy million you could probably up to ...\nBut I don't know if I take the lump sum the government because five hundred and forty eight million dollar pay out for the lump sum I Would pay everybody is fair share I I Would get a giant middle finger salute in gold and diamonds and I wear it on my neck\nAnd then you've got to take the thirty whatever percent tax off of that lump sum golly you end up with I don't know three hundred and eighty fast I Would avoid a jet because I I Would actually pay\nMore in tax and I get to keep that's ridiculous taxation is staff you know what you know how to buy and sell me in an election we're going to abolish the IRS holy cow do we just become best friends you have my vote for life I get it is like totally Dana I ... I you know national reciprocity and\nAlso about\nThe Iraq we became best friends that I Will vote for you always that's how that works we just yeah meanwhile\nCanes Quito I don't know if you guys know that he reminds us five thousand times a day they Quito I had a pumpkin filled with Halloween candy that is sitting\nLike not four feet from him intentionally tend to me well it's ... comes in here\nAnd he dug through yesterday and he was getting because he found himself a little on enjoy which by like ... is ally yet except for him and he can he he takes the Allman joined I was telling them oh yeah ... you need it he still hasn't eaten at\nThe story or you try to piece together this guy's background to determine what made him so special that the crown prince wanted to execute him a then you're told that you were mapped matinee whisper campaigns marrying him in defense of Trump that's at least with the Washington Post a thing even though the New York times had dated in their piece\nHe had he was associated with a member of the Muslim Brotherhood and that he wasn't as long as the ... century so it was a little bit more than him just writing columns and uh and no one is saying that well then by all means you should be cut up and put to a suitcase no one's saying that but\nPeople are trying to figure out what because clearly the crown prince of Saudi Arabia is not just randomly killing people and chopping them up and having it for that is if he is behind this which you know I just find it difficult to believe that his someone at within his inner circle his picture on the ... circuit security footage going into the consulate\nAfter that guy went in after ... when I find it difficult to believe that human road so\nAnd you have to ask well then what made this what made him such an attractive target it couldn't be just because he was saying things that hurt his feelings especially after he ran such a charm offensive why would the crown prince gambled his charm offensive that he has laid out for all of these months on this in broad daylight so that's the big question\nAnd that's why people are saying well is it was there more than just the you know what what what made him so attractive\nAnd the New York times had this piece that they ran on the fourteenth where they said well he I mean he was a member of the Muslim Brotherhood and he was an Islamist and he had um you know would speak it and use anti western rhetoric\nAnd and and things such you know things like that and he had also apparently previously worked as an advisor and an unofficial spokesman for the royal family and I I'm also interested in what made him an attractive hired of the Washington Post\nWhy did the Washington Post tier ... him\nUm he he's pro Palestinian and Saudi Arabia meanwhile has expressed support for the state of Israel so they're at odds there there are at odds over political Islam there at odds over a number of things and so\nHe's taken out\nAnd so we're going to talk to doctors duty gesture about this because I think it's just really stupid narrow minded to say that investigating this further is somehow conducting a ... it's not going to whisper campaign these again people don't want any research or any questions or any facts to come into play just like if\nIf someone is if someone is accused of of sexual harassment or assault well that's just the accusation that the evidence so it's more than that and then our third our Louie Gohmert is going to join us to discuss this mob of migrants this caravan that is leaving Honduras\nIn moving through I think what they're in Guatemala right now is that we're there to make the care of and\nYou can't use the kissing mob mob is bad you can't so we'll get into all of that and I'm In more uh additionally additionally I was just a beta or you know they had the CNN town hall last night\nAnd it was just a beta Robert or work town hall\nAnd they had said that day and they had invited Ted Cruz and Ted Cruz's people released our correspondents or the ... campaign said well why don't you just turn this into a debate\nWould gladly you know why don't you turn this into a debate but seeing and didn't want to do that and so cruises like as senior town halls and that we're not doing enough I can tell you about their town halls and so it was him being weird\nAnd so he would ask also about ... ... he was asked specifically about impeaching Trump and you remember when\nThe kids even before he started his you know the Senate campaign he had said that he would vote to impeach Trump and then at the last debate\nHe said he would impeach Trump so after he said he would work with him well now he was trying to go for he he wouldn't answer the question actually right away listen to this because he was asked about this again listen\nAlready said [noise] even though that's not done that you would vote to impeach and so according to the constitution that means that the president has committed a crime of treason primer bribery or a high crime and misdemeanor [noise] which one of those do you think the president has committed [noise]\nI wouldn't like in the impeachment twins are there there is enough there to proceed with the ... voting of the facts\nAnd to make the best informed decision in the interest of this country and our future as you know under the constitution as a member of the Senate is a far different ... that is a trial with more coal where we look at the ... so we're not in George the outcome will do it for\nOkay ... well yeah what was the answer and she said to her credit pressed and kept moving ... kept pushing forward on it\nOr that's Dana Bash so to her credit she was you know she ... she was like well ... no he didn't actually answer the question she even reminded him she goes congressman or the question was about impeachment and you said in July the what is a member of the house right now go to impeach if you changed your mind\nAnd that's when he kept going on and then he 'cause he talked about he talked about Russia he talked about\nEverything but the actually answering the questions\nAnd then finally goes well but yes to answer your question or do you think there's enough there for impeachment and in fact I Would vote on it what do you mean enough there so he would he's he's but he said he was\nNeutral on a vote to remove but he would vote to impeach\nWhat isn't even mean because he actually said\nThat well I don't even know why you know to be removed yeah I mean I thought that was the whole point\nUh you can't\nThere's hardly any of this works and I'm Glad that that uh Dana Bash pin him down on us that was good uh because that he just was all over the place with his answers I mean he just he's not a good candidate he's just simply not as a candidate by the way he also said that his mom is a lifelong Republican\nSays she's not\nSo Eli she's not a lifelong Republican she's a a bronco bomber donor she donated to Brock Obama and she's voted in Fifteen of the Seventeen Fifteen of Seventeen democratic primaries\nOkay well um\nThat would make her not a lifelong Republican\n[laughter] that's not how that works she's been not a lifelong Republican\nYeah audio somebody to love and this is what he tries to say about guns listen to this\nSong we support the second amendment or don't want it to ... or anyone else's gums\nWant to make sure we the people at Texas where this extraordinary pro long tradition of responsible if the gun ownership\nFailed hunting for sport for collection for self defense that we use this for the point at our knowledge and experience to leave the national conversation for this country has been waiting for when it was thirty thousand over fellow Americans every year it's not even accurate developed country even comes close a third\nOf that actually that's not true either because there are tons of countries that ... I mean for crying out loud France had more than the United states\nIn terms of will never happen all the incidents of violence those sort of loose or develop third of the side this was a third of that with suicide number one and they could they purposely include those numbers and to make it look like it's a bigger numbers that she was a start yeah two thirds of\nThat as suicide they he purposely\nPut set in their ticket to make it look like the numbers are a lot worse but he's um he's lying because he again he's the line I don't know why he lives about this stuff\nUm he has said before when he talks about supporting assault weapons ban and again remember what I said about anyone who says that they support and assault weapons ban there these are people who say who are for banning semi automatic rifles\nThat I mean he's he's talked about that before um and that's not supportive of the second amendment I mean it's that he's talking about and he ... he he wants um a ban on what he calls high capacity magazines\nExcept\nThere is no such thing as a high capacity magazine I mean you know standard capacity he wants there to be a worthless UPCs\nWhich didn't work in Maryland and they didn't work in California and it would criminalize you know like my grandpa gave my son his first hunting rifle that would have been able to criminalize that\nI loved by the way the people who say well we're going to make private citizens have to undergo um uh they're going to have to have a a run the older stuff at the Knicks system but simultaneously we're not going to give them access to that system\nOkay what yeah\n... yeah he opposes a carry reciprocity he doesn't think that there should be carry reciprocity he uh is he likes the he likes the banning of quote unquote assault weapons so yeah he's not for the second amendment\nI mean there's just I mean that's just the other is to it he's not that he's not a Second Amendment guy\nSo I don't know what else to\nI mean he's just not we have more to get into the gas or will be joining us soon\nOutdoor limited dot com is where you can go and get your ammo it's where I get my you know and I like it because what they

also the founder on Dr ... thank you so much for joining us\n[laughter] it's great to be rooted in a thanks for having me\nGive us some perspective on this because I you know I I find it hard to believe that the crown prince of Saudi Arabia\nWould do decide to because he had hurt feelings over something that a ... you wrote about in his columns that he would carry out an assassination in broad daylight ah where his people and his inner circle would be caught on closed circuit TV entering the consulate\nAnd just over over the college I mean there seems to be a lot more here I'm ... is is that an accurate way to kind of view the situation\nWell there's certainly a lot more there and it is is just baffling to me to see the\nGyrations that the left media the legacy media is doing in this story which is all of a sudden they've taken a guy\nWho you know under any other planet or would be I'm surprised even had a resident visa ear and out of the Washington Post is lying I think him and making them into a hero and they haven't really looked at his writing then we'll get to that in a second but far as the Saudis are concerned they're ... they're they're Middle East dictatorship and and yet the President Trump was left with the\nObama disaster that had been so one sided to the Iranians that he's trying to resurrect sort of the twentieth century model of foreign policy which was a balance between Sunni and Shia so at the end of the day us are becoming unhinged about what happened to Mr ...\nIs going to end up benefiting the Iranian the Qataris and the Turks\nNow that doesn't mean that an ally has free will to assassinate a\nA columnist an activist so but we should not be a glossy glassy eyed on exactly what this guy was all about and what was the about well\nI'll remind you three or four months ago the Saudis put into sort of like the tension and the Ritz Carlton and all of the the royal family that was involved with the Muslim Brotherhood\nSo they took basically a trillion dollars that had been used globally for the last fifty years with the Saudis had been funding Muslim Brotherhood operations around the planet the last six months they put a stop to that part of the leader of that was tell all been will lead who owns a center at Georgetown has on the ... center at Harvard\nEt cetera which has been radicalized Muslims in the west well one of the close friends that will lead is ...\n... came to America a year ago there's no doubt that the princes folks want it to bring to show again for interrogation and another thing so odds are that went sour odds are like many other dictatorships on my only knows the Syrian along pretty well\nThey're pretty ruthless clubs and they may have just gone out with the bottom line is is this guy was part of the royal family that was pro Islamist pro Muslim Brotherhood anti American\nVery anti Israel the Saudis shifted and the last six months decided to become more pro Israel isn't real reforms is more pragmatic politics and this guy was standing in the way of that with a Twitter following up to three million we're starting to write more and more critical against this out and they probably wanted to contain it\nPay their Tony we made to the end if another work and school week with a now they're cold front that it's still stuck over metro Atlanta tonight giving us a few early showers otherwise

because housing keep business as well as with queen look in their best that's our business\nSo I don't want to blame this on the candidate who by the way he came out and said this ad nuts he represented a French Hill he has to last names but I like it represented a French Hill normally\nI Would be like I don't know if I can support a he came out and he completely just about the ad which obviously he was just like and this is nuts I Know somebody who is in Arkansas that or is it to see what the campaign and they're like this is the craziest thing that we've ever hurt who was in the world\nBut the problem with packed as you get these people who might be good with fundraising and good with money and they're like guys they got a great idea they think their ideas people too and so they they pick 'em up and they get a great idea for an ad and then because they're surrounded by people they run with it and it turns out to be\nAnd what you're about to hear so this path decided how can we help this candidate oh no let's run this ad that's pretty much racism defined\nI think that there are well I'm going to play the ad for you first and I just know that Democrats have done stuff like that in my home state of Missouri\nThere were robo calls like this there were mailers that went out that were similar to this before like Republicans are going to kill all the black people\nI hate it when they do it and I'm just shocked that this pact chose to do this it's a ... a sixty seconds spot and just listen to what just listen to what does that go\nWhat do you think about what's

[noise] doesn't mean that everybody has the best ideas and I don't know\nI don't know the pack I don't know anybody involved with it I just know previously when I Know that there have been races before where packs have decided to do something that they thought were held the was held by candidate and it's like no that does not help the candidate\nHere's the thing though I'm\nEverything that they're saying in the ad aside from the lynching because I don't think Democrats want to Lynch black people just like I don't think that the Democrats have previously said Republicans will enjoy
