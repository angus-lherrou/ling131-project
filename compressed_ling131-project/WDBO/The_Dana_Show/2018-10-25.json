gonna blow\nUp a but all of this this was the one that I think this was the one that was the ... and that was the one that was sent to to\nTo John Brennan the one that was sent to CNN I just want to clarify that it wasn't sent to CNN for CNN media it was sent to John Brennan at CNN mistakenly because the more on who did it I guess things that John Brennan is\nA contributor at CNN instead of MSNBC where he's actually a contributor\nSo that is this is the latest now some of\nThe eighties it was reported were packed with shards of glass\nAnd this making ten total they said they were rudimentary but viable devices although the one they keep showing the one that was sent to John Brennan at CNN that is the one that\nFor instance Johnny Jones him we spoke with yesterday and all of these veteran bomb techs are saying that's the one that looks like it isn't that it looks like it's a joke because you don't need as many ... I mean they got they've gotten very technical thing you don't need as many wires and if this would be this and all\nKinds of stuff and I'm like I have some great training that you can just look because I look at it and I'm like it also looks like a microphone\nSo I'm you know I'm not a bomb making expert person but um they ... and\nOf the things the judge said yesterday to as it doesn't matter how fancy it's done up and you can still be some of the side of the most\nBut the ones can still just be a very rudimentary so this is the latest this is what we're looking at a also this a little bit of the I have a couple of other 'cause I was looking at some of the X ray images that they all had of it I have to say\nI was kinda flabbergasted yesterday when I saw the statement that was released by CNN president Jeff Zucker that\nHas to do with that was in response to the bombings\nI just um it was really genuinely shocked\nThe statement that he released and at CNN put out on their official PR channel reads as us quote there is a total and complete lack of understanding at the White House about the seriousness of their continued attacks on the media\nThe president and especially the White House press secretary should understand their words matter that's where they have shown no comprehension of that\nReally what what what what by the way it is [laughter] he comes out and make this statement for news organization\nBefore any any other details are known while an investigation is ongoing and he immediately purports it's related it's specifically do because of the president\nI've never seen it isn't the kind of the opposite of news to make grandiose associations with zero evidence to support set association\nOne game it's bananas anyone I\nAnd the fact that he came out with that I thought this is exactly what we're talking about when people criticize the media this is exactly why people say what they say when they discussed the media and I want to get into a little bit of that because there were some really\nRich ironies that took place yesterday and ended up taking place this morning as well\nJust I I mean I I\nJust can't um it's kind of amazing to me it's the opposite of news and I said on Fox and friends this morning look I didn't go out\nThe day after James Hodgkinson shut up a ball field screaming about health care trying to assassinate Republican lawmakers and she was very nearly successful\nIt could have easily have said look at this look at a Facebook page people look at all the all the like city has look at the networks that he likes look at you read the media matters he reads all these things he reads he watches cable news he does he he worked for Bernie Sanders\nAnd in fact I don't recall any one of influence on the right St anything remotely close to that\n\nWhich is why I Am just flabbergasted that Jeff Zucker can say what he said and this statement would know anything to support his association\nI didn't go out and sell the rice and that was going to all these Republicans that well there you go Democrat I didn't go out and say to the destruction of all these Republican offices there you go Democrats didn't go out and say oh my gosh look at all these assaults and everything else that are happening in the streets look at it the threats that are there you go Democrats\nLook at the college campuses that we're burning look at the look at the lawmakers that are being hunted down and and some assaulted some are being docked there you go Democrat\n\nI ... and even when the doctor was working with Sheila Jackson Lee because that doesn't solve the problem there are people out there that are so that our show on ... ...\nThey will justify what ever ugliness they want to do to someone simply because there are a politician or they don't like their politics period and to say that it has to do with a B or C just associates responsibility from that individual\nBut that's not a two way street you know they were calling them ... really\nWe're going to talk about some of the media hot takes with this\nBecause while they pedaled assassination fantasies yesterday\nWhile they claimed to ... bomber and ran with that yesterday they were simultaneously lecturing everyone about tone and civility and lecturing anyone who would dare criticized depressed and I'll say this before we go to break free people have every single right to criticize their free press and we're not going to be gasoline from doing it\nAnd we're not going to allow a free press to make false associations and further inflame this nonsense by writing irresponsible pieces ... for making irresponsible statements such as Jeff Zucker has done\nCasting blame with zero evidence is zero association while simultaneously engaging in a very behavior of which they accused everyone else and as a free people we have every free right to point that out\nWe have um\nFlorida Man upcoming we have today in stupidity upcoming\nUh all of that

people [noise]\nWhy I think that that's obvious are concerned about this for a long time for about a life of a sudden it started in January about the president's rhetoric remember\nWe have a president who was talked for a couple of years now about imprisoning his political rival until the recording who is encouraged violence against the media or just last week talking about the assault on a reporter by a congressman in Montana's saying that he's kind of guy\nTo see this outside of the context of the president's stability hostility towards towards Mrs Clinton moved tried as we speak towards unity ... of course George Soros\nThe president and his allies they need to dial down to the political rhetoric they are making people less safe they are making journalists less safe and they were making law enforcement officers less safe\nFor we don't know who do this we don't know what their motive was for it but it's a very obvious thread or maybe it's measures that were it was but it's an obvious rode the Obamas acquaintance beyond brand and CNN um George Soros these are people and organizations that President Trump countries really apparently demonize recalls\nIf you post his policies you did so because you were a racist\nJust like if he didn't want to vote for Hillary Clinton you did you felt that way because you were a sexist it didn't matter if you were good enough to vote for her husband they'll take your vote but the second that you decide to do something differently because you're tired of being lectured to about pronouns and everything else than suddenly you magically turned into a a racist big it you\nWeren't raised as big a when you were vote Democrat but the moment you decided to exercise your free will and go somewhere else and you became a racist Democrats are racist or sexist I thought that\nWhen\nI ... it's all of the name calling and the vitriolic language I I I was called the ... to my face by people in media on television\nYou went to lecture me about tone incivility this is how Donald Trump became president because people were tired of being called name by the very people lecturing us now\nThat we're tired of having their characters and pick him simply because they didn't want to pay for your health care hard enough time paying for their own families premiums and keeping a roof over their heads and food on their table\nThis has been going on for so long and now all of these individuals who in deeply engaged in that when there is a Republican that doesn't really say anything differently than they ever\nThey lose their mind oh suddenly now it's Trump's America suddenly now it's completely different\nI'm not saying that it's good or bad\nWhat I'm saying is stop acting like this is something this administration invented stop acting like the amount of ridiculous an assistant disproportionate\nPolitics is always going to be polarized but people used to be able to coexistence each other as humans and not just issues\nAnd I'm going to tell you what I was at the one who stopped doing that I wasn't the one who ended friendships I was at the one who stopped talking to people because they thought differently from me or they voted differently from me or they believe things differently than I Do that wasn't me and it wasn't anybody that I Know\nSo we don't need to do a gut check but I definitely do see people um I don't know they're conservative or they you know ... all ... anybody supports Trump is a racist seriously\nI'm tired of it\nBeing better as a two way street and this has been going

collective safety and neither should the people of New York city I Want to reiterate as I did yesterday as I Do any time we talk about far reaching investigations of this nature of any other kind of nothing we do in law enforcement we do alone\nFor a joint terrorists taskforce comprised of professionals and the agencies you see here today and others were investigating all of this with great precision and that can say with certainty\nThat we will identifying the rest of the person or people responsible for these acts make no mistake\nNew York city's intelligence and counterterrorism kind of terrorism capabilities are second it on every day they are not just this week or detectives and analysts are constantly pouring up with a thread stream as we proactively deploy a resources around the city as needed\nAnd you're seeing that today too out of an abundance of caution I'll tell you that when we look at the events of yesterday and today\nI have a badge of pride incredible work the men and women are the NYPD to each and every day especially when it involves partnering with the organizations represented here today\nI'll conclude by reminding everyone and law enforcement professionals do not care about the politics behind these acts but we do care about is keeping the publicly serve safe\nThat's it that's the job fighting crime and keeping people safe and through the fall and billing partnership of everyone who lives and works in and visit New York city will make the safest large city in the United states even safer Mr Mayor thank you\nVery much commissioner I Want to express my appreciation to all the men and women and YPG who have done an outstanding job yesterday and today addressing this situation and to all of our partners federal and state partners everyone has been working together\nTo address this forthrightly now look one of the things that we emphasize the moment like this is that you're going to see a lot of police presence it's important that we proactively take steps to protect those who have come under attack\nClearly what we've seen in the last few days is an attack on media outlets an attack on prominent public figures\nOr we're going to make sure there's expanded the presence as long as we needed to show very vividly that New York city takes these issues seriously that we are defending people who are coming under attack that part of how we protect the Democratic process\nIs to show the threats like this not taken lightly so that and expect that presidents and I know that for those who have gone through this uh in the last few days that's a presence that they appreciate greatly\nWant to say that uh everyday New Yorkers have responded to this situation with the kind of strength and the kind of resiliency that the city is famous for it makes me very very proud of all eight point six million New Yorkers they have handled the situation", "year": "2018", "show_name": "The Dana Show", "city": "Orlando", "day": "25"}
