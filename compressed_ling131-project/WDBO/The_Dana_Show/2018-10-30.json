Brian is Ninety six point five ...\nThis is news maybe six point for you baby oh we'll turn first for breaking news twenty four hours in\nNow as the concerns birthright citizenship I there is a lot of discussion as to the founders meaning et cetera et cetera and I'm going to get into the weeds of all of that later on which Christian Adams because there's two arguments that are battling concurrently right now you have this very\nEsoteric exploration of what was the original meaning and intent what did the founders intent and I see a lot of people on the right arguing for that\nAnd then they're not mix looting that left from this discussion because we all know what they want\nAnd then there is this very\nLiberal playing were ...\nThat I see a lot of other individuals arguing and then of course there is a huge argument over even the creation of birthright citizenship and anchor babies et cetera and whether that was a John Brennan footnote from something that was entirely aside from any Supreme Court decision\nOr whether it's something that can actually be interpreted from the words that are in the fourteenth amendment\nThe ... and then there's also the discussion as to whether or not the president can\nUse an executive order to do this and those individuals who don't believe that he can't or the individuals who believe in the very literal as I understand what they are presenting a textural is argument of the constitution saying that he would actually have to go through the proper channels now Lindsey Graham\nSassy Graham in an effort I think to to have this or to go somewhat halfway a he has said that he entirely supports the president on this in fact he went on\nAh quite some time on a Twitter about it saying that he has has always opposed birthright citizenship that this is something that he has has a he thinks is insane\nAnd he has to the president's remarks introduced a piece of legislation already to that effect so for those who are going\nTo and I think he's doing that to just to hedge against ah the pushback from others on the right who sent into he's got to go through these channels to do it at cetera et cetera so it comes down to whether or not you really believe that the constitution is being bastard eyes or you don't\nAnd I think that's where we are and that's what I'm going to take up what Jay Christian Adams because there's none of the lawyers none of my lawyer friends agree with each other not a single one of my friends agree with each other\nThey're aggravating a living hell outta me today every one of them they're aggravating me not a single one of them agree with each other they're all arguing with each other I met a group taxed with a with a few friends three of whom are attorneys\nUm one is constitutional attorney one you know worked with a a justice criminal the criminal justice et cetera\nAnd it is it is incredibly frustrating because none of them not a single one of them agree with each other and they were arguing about this so that\nI Wonder if I Want to talk to a Christian Adams and other lawyer is that where he's not in my group ...\nTo have him walk through and he probably and I don't think he agrees with some of the other individuals that have discussed this out there\nI think the thing that that really um when he talks about doing this with an executive order there are some individuals who say well you know ... was a huge problem and so how are you going to go and and target jak because you believe that that was an overreach of executive authority\nBut yet you're going to attempt to change the constitution\nUsing an executive order is that not the same thing and I know some of the folks over at a high um have been a I in fact I was reading John you this morning who says it's settled law and he's one of those individuals who is\nVery much a he is seeing is very much against the president actually he thinks he believes that it is modifying the constitution without going through the proper channels\nUh and that's kind of he said that the Supreme Court has consistently ride the fourteenth amendment to grant birthright citizenship whether it's the United states ...\nUh which was an Eighteen Ninety eight ended up held the American citizenship of a child born in San Francisco to Chinese parents who themselves can never naturalized under the Chinese exclusion acts are also that he writes the court held that the fourteenth amendment affirms the agent and fundamental rule of citizenship by birth within the territory any allegiance protection of the country yadda yadda yadda\nUh then they he cites fly larvae do uh where it was the five before ruling that the fourteenth amendment equal protection clause require taxes to provide public school into children of illegal aliens\nAnd all nine justices agreed that quote no plausible distinction with respect to the fourteenth amendment quote jurisdiction and that's what we're gonna come back to can be drawn between resident alien Susan trained to the United states is lawful et cetera et cetera and we talk about a legion so we talk about jurisdiction because people are are wanting to\nDefine what do you mean by jurisdiction is that does have to have to do with allegiance to one particular country et cetera\nAnd so the and then there are individuals who absolutely do not believe that this is that this is settled law and they think that it's it's not a lot to the point where we need\nIntervention from the from the executive office a and that is that is what a lot of that is what again at a bunch of other lawyers are are and and pundits are arguing\nSo I think it old I I think it comes down to a couple of things uh\nWhether or not people actually really one thing whether or not individuals believe in the founders it seems to be like a founders intent and people trying to define or redefined words that's kind of what I think it's kind of falling down to and I don't know I'm kind of\nI don't support birthright citizenship\nI don't I just don't I just simply do not I think that um you have to go through a I mean everyone should go through proper channels and and by the way dean of the mind that you support lawful injury\nIs not being against lawful entry\nI mean that's the same thing birthright citizenship and yes that's what we were just talking about is when you have as I was just discussing and one of the cases that has been previously decided not necessarily\nOn where the United states stands on birthright citizenship but on this particular case when you had to Chinese Americans who were excluded from be naturalized because of the Chinese exclusion acts back in the late Eighteen hundreds and so as a result of that\nThey had a huge fight over their child whether their child could be considered a ... they would have citizenship through birth\nBut typically that's not really how this is being decided that's not how it's being determined I mean I was reading a story just the other day of how the tongue to a bunch of Russians are coming to Florida and they're having babies in Florida\nAnd then their children just with the hopes that their children can be American citizens and that's where of course you get the term anchor baby is so I don't believe that to non citizens can give birth to a citizen and the and I just don't I ... and people can I respectfully disagree with people who who think otherwise\nUm but to that point\nThe\nIdea that you are somehow bigoted or against immigration because you believe in an organized unlawful entry is the height of vulgarity stupidity and dishonesty and when people have to\nRefrain and a dishonest fashion and maliciously I might add and try to re purpose their opponent position so asked to give them advantage that means they've lost\nThat means that\nTheir argument cannot hold water\nThat's what it means so\nWe're going we're going to get into we're going to get into some of this because I think whether or not the president can do it\nIs that the big discussion can he do it is this something that he has the ability to do um there was um\nUh some there was there and they're also some discussion where people say that the draft or is of the fourteenth amendment that they did not the text of the amendment does not address the crux of this particular problem and that\nWhether this is revoked by executive order or legislative act\nI mean it it gets it gets into\nKind of a rock um some ironic territory in terms of living constitutional ism et cetera et cetera were going to talk about that with Jay Christian Adams as I said um additionally\nThe a\nAnd I was reading another piece in the wall Street Journal from a judge on the Fifth Circuit court Jim ... who ... specifically wrote\nAbout birthright citizenship and also cited Dred Scott or the Dred Scott case the judge Roger Cheney which by the way and my first book I have an entire chapter that looks at the at the racist roots of gun control because interestingly one of the very one of the very uh measurements that Chaney used to deny Dred Scott\nA full citizenship as he should have been granted is that because of the racist or gun control laws of the day because he could not possess firearms due to the color of his skin indeed the bigoted regulations that were in place at the time\nThat was one of the measurements by which judge Roger teeny withheld full recognition as a person as a citizen of the United states of America to Dred Scott\nVery interesting is that not let's always keep that in the back of our heads because in some aspects these issues are intertwined uh so we have um a lot more calming including a the story of the Jewish doctor who\nTreated the\nMurderer at the synagogue unbelievable story will have all of that uh and more as we work through work for the program a so as we could go in the meantime ... tactical systems makes a really cool product and the cool product that they make is the fastest speed letter over\nAnd it's um I like it because it just saves you time you don't have to spend as much time on administrative duties such as living max because when I

you know the fact that at one of the things that have really launched his presidential run on is talking about Islamic rattled radicalization and this president has radicalized so many more people than I ever did\nI mean the way he talks the way he ... he is that's just the way the way that he uh allows it to the way he wakes up and not to these groups the way he says I Know I'm not supposed to say it but I'm a nationalist\nWow that's Julia Ioffe who where does she run again\nShe is thank you I'm going to withhold my remarks on that it's going to take everything I have a ashes right for you to come there for her so she thinks that the president has and she was on CNN with Jake Tapper and everyone was just ...\nThere's only one dude who said yeah that's like really ridiculous that you just said that everyone else said no and then ...\nDo we have about because Jake Tapper apology he said would you like to apologize and then she's making a big deal this is somebody Nineteen she was asked a ... okay you tell me if you think this is an apology listen\nWe want to clarify that I've spoken with us in a very emotional and personally ankle time for me I think I exaggerate and I'm all for that\nBut what the point I was trying to play that one says that according to the ... the number of anti Semitic attacks has jumped by nearly ... percent and the first year that Donald Trump was in office without coincidence because even though the main danger is home grown\nQuite willing to let alone studies have pointed out this in this race and has a thought ugly shifted resources away for monitoring will go away for\nWhat's interesting is that the idea also surmise and and ah they they did a huge study and they looked at 'em threat given to journalists and pundits et cetera and and one of my ... one of my friends then who is a talk show hosts\nAs well uh they concluded that he was the number one singled out Jewish reporter\nAnd he happens to be a conservative so I kind of question whether or not truly understands what she's discussing\nThere I don't know if that's necessarily an apology or if it's just her trying to excuse the fact that it would it mean for her to say that it was a ... an exaggeration an exaggeration seems to be an underwhelming\nHe he said that the president's campaign attacks on George Soros ah we're all about anti Semitism which is essentially saying that any attack on me is just means you hate women\nLogically at the same we're going to completely nullify your actual concerns and make it all about identity politics though as to take you out at the knees and leave you nothing to stand on because see if they can if they can paint you as an anti Semite then you can't disagree with anyone anymore because you're tainted goods\nSo let's forget that he supports horrible policies and let's forget all of that if you you were going to cut you cannot disagree with anyone who is ADHD so by that logic anyone who disagrees with me hates women hate them and probably wants them to die than watch it [noise]\nSo this is basically what we're suggested to Joe Lieberman stupidly suggested to Joe Lieberman that anyone who criticizes Soros is an anti Semite\nAnd he was asked do you believe that there are those who perceived those to be anti Semitic dog whistles when you see one of the ads of his campaign or a John George Soros et cetera ominous pictures talking about the money and all of that doesn't that's into it doesn't that send a message\nBut Lieberman wasn't buying it and he says look he goes I ... the first thing I Want to say that this brutal murderer in Pittsburgh was really committed by hateful owner says a direct quote from the transcript who is probably more stimulated by anti Semitism and social media than anything else going on around him he was against President Trump\nBut more generally and all of us have to begin with the president a Democrat and Republican leaders people in the media conventional made it a more unconventional social media have to ask ourselves to what extent we're contributing to the division in our society\nHe was not having it\nFor him and got snarky a little bit but Lieberman wasn't having that either\nGood on him\nWe have a lot more in store coming up uh now the caravan is demanding transportation buses have arrived and it's already reportedly bigger than many American towns and

sell it to developers for a cut of the cash\nBut it's interesting how that doesn't come up in the New York times piece they realize what they're doing is they don't want this to hurt him this close to

point your baby oh we'll turn first for breaking news\nAnd he\nIs you know kind of having some problems in terms of you know getting a a he's kind of having some problems getting new work and you need that he needed a movie to be his like big comeback right ...\nAnd so he needs he has his last serious role was the title character in simple jak which I'm going to come back to him just a moment 'cause that's why we're talking and simple jak basically he did Sean\nPenn when Sean Penn played I Am Sam it with like that but worse okay\nSo well you can't say that you can't say that any more so his ... his acting was so bad and simple jacket got all these negative reviews and where to kill this isn't a movie Tropic Thunder\nSo then you have comedian Jeff ... who is you know a FARC comedian basically and he's also a huge drug user and then you have Kirk Lazarus played by Robert Downey junior he's a five time off to win a he's a British Shakespearean trained act a method actor and he completely goes\nFull method for every role right every role and so I Know he's not British she's Australia and so\nThey decide if we're Tropic Thunder yeah this the Vietnam War veteran\nThe rights this book um what's his name for at least pay back he writes this book and it's about them or is that his rescue during the Vietnam War and it was you know he lost both hands in it and it's like they're going to make it into this big war movie and so they cast all these actors and ah you know Ben Stiller's looking at it like a big comeback role\n... and they and they go through basically they go through this big budget war movie and they're supposed they're told that there's it's a new way of directing and they're told by the director who subsequently is killed accidently later on in the movie or that\nThere's hidden cameras all over and they're supposed to respect their lines and do all of this and so they're doing this but they actually come across them like a guerrilla fighters and who are real and they think that those are actors and so that's how the movie goes it's insane and they don't know any of that\nSo Kurt Lazarus the whole movie is about making fun of stereotypes and making fun of people who are so sensitive to political correctness is literally the crux of the movie [noise] people who don't get it these are the people who get ticked off over South Park for crying out loud and The Simpsons Kurt Lazarus in the movie Robert Downey junior ghosts\nMethod in this movie he literally died skin black black face for the entire movie he becomes a full fledged black man he gets rid of his Australian blond hair and\nHas made as short afro he he didn't say he dies skin permanently black okay he changes the way he talked so that he can convincingly\nPortray a black man right that's how this is going [noise] so are we talking about this right now well let's bring you up to speed it's Halloween right Halloween everybody dresses up and everybody's super sensitive about the way that people are dressing up right\nEverybody know Shaun White the snowboarder was it like a brilliant time gold medalist or something I don't even know\nSo he was that a Halloween party over the weekend and he posted a photo of himself dressed as Ben Stiller's character simple jak from the film Tropic Thunder now simple jak the character that\nBen Stiller played in Tropic Thunder was a he was mentally or develop it was mentally developmentally challenged pay\nAnd there was one line from the film and this is what Kirk Lazarus told him in the film so don't get mad at me he says you never he goes quote you never go full retired in ... is what he says to Ben Stiller he's like that's why you're rolling simple jak were so bad\nSo anyway Shaun White decides to dress up as simple jak from the movie and guess what happened everybody\nThought oh you dress up as Ben Stiller character from Tropic Thunder right I mean Ben Stiller never got any and nothing about it neither by the way did Robert Downey junior who went on to play Iron Man a and it's like a ... millionaire and had a complete resurgence of his career and he was literally in blackface run entire film nobody said in an air because everybody got the point right\nWrong everybody lost their mind\nMad and then I'll burn which\n[laughter] torches and pitchforks and torches and pitchforks we're all\nEveryone lost their mind\nAnd they all went after Shaun White\nThey went after Shaun White the Special Olympics when after Shaun White people never even seen the movie when after Shaun White\nNeeds that disability is it a joke and or is it a punchline were so mad that he went and this character from a movie that Ben Stiller play but we're not that have been Stiller for playing a character who played this character in a movie he was a dude who played another dude who is planning to do it in the movie\nLiterally also another line for Tropic Thunder offered by Kirk Lazarus who completely appropriated an entire ethnicity and accent and style of speaking that he perceived as a wide Australia and in order to method ask for this role\nSo everyone called him a real P. O. S. they went after him they just murdered him on line\nAnd so now he issued a statement saying quote I owe everyone in the Special Olympics community an apology for my poor choice of Halloween costumes the other night it was a last minute decision it was the wrong one the Special Olympics were right to call me out on it they do great work supporting so many tremendous athletes I'm Sorry for being insensitive lessons\nLearned just thoughts Kane you have some thoughts\nLessons learned but\nNobody really mad at Ben Stiller oh of course motives Matty literally played simple jak he was he was Shaun White dress up as Ben Stiller who was plain simple\nRight he was dressing up as a character who played a character which is exactly what Halloween is about actually um\nSo now are we supposed to I mean honestly are we supposed to police every thing that we do\nIn spite of the fun that's intended like Halloween is supposed to be fun Halloween is supposed to be dress up as something else as not you right that's really what it's about why are we even worried on the one day of the year that people dress up\nWater we worried about where we throwing the through the PC filter why are we doing that ...\nEither way I somebody just brought it to my attention that Robert Downey junior when he was in\nBlack face with the voice that fact Haitian and the short fro when he was dressed up as at wide Australian actor who was playing a black character anyone full method indicted scan he received an Academy Award nomination for best supporting actor\nFor that role in the same movie that everybody's mad about Shaun White for I just I Need to put that I Need to put that out there\nA Steve your thought you saw Tropic Thunder did you see did you see Shaun White dress up as the character who is playing a character and Tropic Thunder\nI Would understand ... sandwich but I Would understand if I'm there was insensitive us towards like a movie that made sounding censored but it was about actor in a movie like it does it I don't know every year we do this like the same time and there's always an overreaction in a comedy movie yeah seriously\nYet it was pretty crazy this is insane this whole thing is insane so that is where we are I mean it is\nAnd I liked the fact that still er and I'm Robert Downey junior and everybody like stuck to their guns on this because they're like we are making a movie people need to stop and people I think do need to just\nChill out why are you still mad all the time stop it leaves you don't see me ...

York Times best selling author of the book injustice and legal legal over at PJ Media joins us on this topic and we're so glad to have his expertise today Christian I was so good to talk with you\nThere high\n[laughter] so so I guess the first question is can\nPresident do this because a lot of a lot of the discussion that I have seen and I feel like the right kind of divided on this\nPeople say well the president was you know President Trump was upset when former President Obama was using executive orders on ... so with this kind of be that same formula but where it concerns birthright citizenship and then that said you know and obviously fourteenth amendment discussion but I guess the first part can he do that\nYeah I mean I'm not sure the tit for tat larger really works as a matter of constitutional law in other words well Obama issued a lot of executive order so we ought to get through to I I mean it doesn't work that way what what matters is what the constitution\nSays and how the constitution has been interpreted and there's a real serious question whether birthright citizenship\nIs in the constitution and if it is\nNo executive orders can change that and that's right probably some of the resistance on the right thing you hear it\nYeah that that that would take on a congressional action and and Senator Lindsey Graham said today that he's already proposed legislation to support what the president's suggesting all of that seems to come down\nTo how the fourteenth amendment is actually worried and I don't want to get to in the weeds with that because I mean I Know it would be very easy to do so but it's so for those listening it basically says and this is kind of the the crux of the concern all persons born or naturalized in the United states and subject to the jurisdiction thereof\nAre citizens of the United states end of the state where and they reside isn't the kind of the big fight\nReally focused on the fact that that whole subject to a jurisdiction a clause no one's ever ruled on that that there's a lot of ambiguity there and that's kind of why there's this debate\nRight and and listen to the subject to the ... of give you a counter example if there is a diplomat in the United states uh who has a trial like it's a British diplomat\nOr they're not subject to the ... the United states or the British ambassador and his new born baby or if there was an invading army or in some people consider this to be an invading army uh then they're not subject to the earth that she's not as safe as or for their foreigners

reports that the number includes up to ten thousand in the main Mexican caravan with anywhere from Fifteen hundred to two thousand more in a second Guatemalan caravan and an additional twenty five hundred planted to mobilize in Honduras and El Salvador\nNo Mexican national migration Institute cited by LA universal did not respond to ah they didn't they they were they were the ones who wish you the number for the the first group that's still going through Mexico\nUm this to this there's some back and forth as to what size it is a piece that it's the quote biggest migrant caravan ever a un

five thousand people so it's bigger than a lot of small towns that are coming\nUh if if those numbers from the migrant Institute and the Mexican media are to be believed and one of the uh\nThe caravan was asking for some transportation the Honduran can't advance caravan they they wanted to ... they're wanting to reach the Texas border they well I think it's the Tijuana crossings where they're looking at going for but they've been demanding that the Mexican government provide transportation for them as far as Mexico City\nAt what\nThey and remember keep in mind this isn't really about amnesty this isn't about it because they rejected benefit than amnesty from\nFrom Mexico already they've they've already rejected that\nSo according to the Associated Press the caravan that's going through southern Mexico is demanding that the Mexican government help it thousands of participants reached Mexico City\nEven as a smaller group of Central Americans entered the country presumably with the intention of joining us and Mexican Government has shown no inclination to assist the exception of its migrant protection agency giving some of the caravan stragglers ride to the next town over the weekend\nA one group supporting the care of and set it hopes to hold meetings in Mexico city with federal lawmakers to discuss their rights and the caravans future\nOkay well and then\nSome of the ah there have been some that I uh we've known that they've talked about getting buses before a meanwhile one of the ah things that was reporter by MSN is that there are seven hundred and fifty thousand pending cases before us immigration courts as is\nUs immigrated and here's this here's the other thing you don't have to march to like a border checkpoint to demand asylum or ... or ... or to demand asylum they were again they were offered asylum by Mexico I said amnesty earlier in Minnesota and they were offered asylum by Mexico and they rejected it\nSo it's not about asylum you don't have to march to a border checkpoint to apply for asylum you can do that in your home country so all of this I'm Sorry but it's theater\nIt's all theater because you don't have to march to the southern border to demand asylum you can do that within your own country and the these filings right so they say last year immigration courts got they received about a hundred and twenty thousand asylum claims\nFrom migrants are some facing deportation a four fold increase from twenty fourteen so now those filing to push the number of pending cases before immigration courts to seven hundred and fifty thousand which is like collapse in the system essentially Minnesota it's just insane\nMeanwhile uh James Mattis secretary of defense says that they're moving equipment to the southern border although the details don't nobody really knows the details quite just yet\nA U.S military has already begun delivering Jersey barriers to the southern border in conjunction with plans to deploy active duty troops according to us defense secretary Mattis us that he says this he said the Sunday according to Washington Post\nHe told reporters traveling within the details of the deployment are being worked out he should have them later on they will include exactly how many forces are needed\nI've heard anywhere from you know seven to fourteen thousand a day um\nI can because if they're if they're not going to be a parent temperament terms and we discussed that I mean by ... by unless they're all getting\nBust up marching up through there is um that's not going to it's going to take them like over a month to do that so [noise] but\nI think that you're going to need something more than Jersey barriers along the border quite frankly uh considering that they took down offense\nHaving you know oh and here's another story that are related to all of this I go to other things we've got to get that's a Fox San Antonio\nReported how border patrol got Bangladeshis out of the Rio Grande\nI didn't realize it Bangladesh was right there by the Rio was it that they they they rescued several people Monday trying to cross the Rio Grande an inch of the country illegally a and a two of them were from two of them were Bangladeshi or actually sorry for Bangladeshi nationals\n[noise] [noise]\nWell that was just one group ... so I'm just saying if we were to look at the metric\nWell I've been done are talked to a border patrol chief they say that as people think that it's just people coming from Latin America from Mexico other Latin American countries and it's absolutely not true\nAnd the president can have refused to accept any asylum applications he may do that I don't know I mean there is a time limit um I have to file within a year of your arrival and you've got all of this stuff so I don't I'm\n... and again Mexico offered asylum and the ... the caravan rejected it so I question whether or not I I you know you've got to kind of question what this is all about if they had rejected it you know you do [noise]\nMoving on here we got a quick five coming up outdoor limited dot com is where I get my ... and you can get ready for hunting season with federal fusion and all you can get up to

like I'm just mystified that's like the the the first place which they always go to um I still have this is well this was a piece that um\nThe cause of Florida given a foil racist and saying you have Andrew Gillum who's going up against former at Rhonda Santa and they have tried to really play every identity politics card possible and Andrew Gillum falsely accused\nA Rhonda Santas of quote offering a book justifying slavery\nAnd it was ... eleven book dreams from our founding fathers first principles in the age of Obama and I thought that that was a very disingenuous\nAn incredibly disingenuous spin on that I mean not even a than it was an absolutely horrific I'm\nA really really uh it was a book about the constitution and he was simply praising the constitution and for him to write what he did for him to say what he said about it was really particularly heinous\nUm because this here's the thing that I mean it was really bad nowhere in the book does does he does not he did not do anything in that book but condemn slavery\nSo I'm not quite sure Andrew Andrew Gillum gets his accusation um that was very I mean that was stopped I people need to stop falling back on identity politics is a way to try to discredit their opponents\nI just I that's really sad and furthermore this priest opposition that somehow you know if you support the constitution you support the creation of slavery the constitution and create slavery in fact the constitution weakened up before openly ending it altogether\nI mean that was that was the way that it it was going so I I don't know it was just yeah I'm speaking of Gillum audio somebody to this is what he had to stay I and again it's just red meat platitudes ... it's just a bunch of invective listen\nOf our president is sort of rising

really odd that Gillum is trying to lecture on tone when he specifically lied about his opponents saying that he falsely saying that he wrote a book where and he justify slavery I just I think that that does a lot to stoke division and maybe perhaps\nGillum could stop with his life and work to tamp down the division that he is joking by making these false accusations of the way to gain an
