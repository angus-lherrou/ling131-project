Want to thank you for training and again on this lovely Sunday Morning and you to listen to us every Sunday from eleven to twelve you are listening to back to wellness with Dr Jeff on news Ninety six point five WD bill [noise]\nBut one of the issues that we have is the tax laws change from time to time they just literally changed this year twenty Eighteen the tax laws are very different than they were in twenty Seventeen\nSo the reason that that we want to make sure it as a a private wealth management firm and and also doing this radio program that we're offering\nNot just financial services meaning showing people how to invest their money as efficiently as possible but we're also offering tax services the reason we have CPAs that help us out in the work with us is because it's very important not just to learn how to be as efficient as you possibly can in growing or money\nAnd all of our clients Doug they want the same thing they they they don't want the highest rate of return they can get rather just not willing to take a lot of risk to get it on their money so those are the types of\nPortfolios that we're putting together for clients and again all of our clients are either retired or very close to retirement so it makes sense they would be looking for that\nBut at the same time we have to be responsible with distributions and make sure we know which bucket to pull it out of and all of this goes into having a truly comprehensive financial planning dog I mean I I think a lot of people maybe they have a plan in place but they're not exactly sure how over time\nAnd then they do ask themselves that question while I I've got this Roth account I've got the traditional area count I've got this and joined account I've got this trust account got all these accounts\nAnd you know overall they look at it and and and it adds up to a nice number for retirement and they feel pretty good about where they're sitting but now they've got to take income where do you pull the money out of and financial planning and tax planning an estate planning can show them that\nSo literally for anybody who's listening this is what we do week after week after week when people come in and they sit down with us so if you're listening right now and you have concerns about your current financial planner you have some concerns about you know hey I Am I taking distributions from my ... am I getting it from the right place\nGive us a call we can sit down with you and we'll put together you know a truly comprehensive financial ... where we will look at all of that and will help you be\nNot only efficient when it comes to the investments sure how to get the highest rate of return you can with at least ... but also show you how to be as efficient as you can from taxation you know where do you pull the money from when you need income so give us a call in the next ten minutes and will do that for you complimentary\nVery important questions you need to have answered on your portfolio that comprehensive financial plan a Fifteen hundred dollar value so called within the next ten minutes\nAnd get involved with that Michael answer all your questions sit down with you and give you a great opinion and we joined a great way with your portfolio for oh seven to seven zero one thousand\nThat's four o seven to seven zero one thousand and you can find out more to add guarding your nest egg dot com\nTwo thirds of the people surveyed by nerd well I'd say they're not confident they'll have enough money to retire\nAnd are at this point in our lives Mike how do we find out you know where we stand\n... so it's it's a number right and how do you figure out what that number is so there was a commercial some years back from a financial company\nAnd the big tagline was what's your number\nRight and it was kinda it was cute yeah people carrying around this big number you know so for some people it's like you know hey if I can just set aside a million dollars for retirement you know that that's my number I saw that with a guy\nOr just the other day we were talking we had a great conversation and he's got plenty of money to retire but but his numbers five million ... getting close to that number and\nHere's the thing I mean we're we're looking at and I will I he he doesn't need five million to retire but but that's his number right\nSo the number can come to you in a couple of different ways\nYou could have established a number you know on your own in your head and you say hey listen I I just want to achieve this goal you know whether you're number's a million or five million or ten million whatever that number is once you get there you've decided we're going to walk away\nYou probably could walk away by the way a lot sooner it's just that she wanted to hit that number or other people are asking the question that they they are going I don't in my mind how the particular goal like I I'm not fixated on\nMaking sure I have a certain number before retire ... what they really want to know\nIs how much do they need to retire and when somebody asks me Mike how much do I need to retire what they're really saying is how much do we need to set aside for retirement so that I can walk away from this job never have to go back to work again 'cause that's not what they want to do in retirement\nAnd live off us money for the rest of my life right and so how do you take money that you you've been saving and you've been doing putting money in year after year after year and you're watching and grow and grow and grow and then how do you transitioned into retirement because retirement is potentially thirty or forty years of unemployment\nRight if you think about it because you're not going to go back to work so it's very very easy to go to work and and I'm not saying your work is easy but we get very accustomed to you know I I go to work I Do my job I get a check\nI use the check to pay my expenses you know and as long as they keep showing up for work every single week everything is taken care of and I've got a certain standard of living that I'm very comfortable with unhappy with but then when you transition to retirement you have to figure out where the ... going to come from\nSo going back to the question how much do you need to set aside for retirement well let's take a look at\nYour standard of living and what does it actually cost you to maintain that standard of living and then let's take into consideration things like inflation and things like taxes 'cause it's not going to get cheaper over time\nAnd if we incorporate all that into a financial plan and then we take a look at how you're currently invested and what are your odds of success right because it's possible you don't need a financial advisor if you've done everything you need to do in a financial advisor can't provide value but there's no reason to have one\nBut it's a financial advisor can provide value if they can show you how to get a higher average rate of return that you're doing on your own narrative any for you're paying them you know the permanent providing value\nIf they can do that and also reduce the amount of risk you're taken to get that return they're providing value as well so answering those questions like how I set aside enough for retirement or how much do I need to set aside for retirement\nThat's part of putting together a financial plan\nAnd then once we establish how much you need to set aside for retirement and we put together a financial plan that's efficient meaning\nHighest rate of return you can get another fees but also minimizing the risk you're taking to get that return you know then we found a good spot and that's where we need to be so sitting down and having that financial plan put together is really critical if you want to answer those questions so for anybody who's listening\nIf you'd like to come sit down for our comprehensive\nVictim is recovering RMC and we don't know the

One McLean gave his interview any ways to ask her about the the millions time\nWhat does that song\nAmerican Pie mean to you and and after answering the question a million times done explains it means never having to work again for the rest of my life\nYou can imagine running one song and that's it I mean there is you know just live off of that not that that'd be nice you know I hear that a lot from a bans over the years that became one hit wonders and they had that one song but you hear it again in commercials in movies TV shows\nAnd they make a lot of money each time for that so they can just sit back and you know collect the money off of that the royalties or whatnot but I'm sure they probably wouldn't have hits to three and four so\nCongrats Don McLean he's he's been going at that song for ah what forty years at least\nYeah a long time so I was kind of a little history and trivia facts about music so I I'm the music guy and Mike you are the financial guy given as great information about\nRetirement so you know we're talking a little bit earlier about before the segment a Mike how do you help clients achieve a dream of never having to work again so how do you do that\nIt's a process Doug I I think we need to look at where are you currently are right now how you picture your return what what what's your picture retirement you know what you think it's going to look like\nIt's different for everyone so\nThat there is no sort of blanket approach that we could talk about here on the radio that's going to identify every single person out there that side of their close to retirement or we're currently retired which is why again you know people hear us talk every single week about you know comes down\nWhat's doing analysis of your current portfolio let's put together a financial plan for you\nPart of it is that that that get to know you I Need to know who you are what is it is you you're looking to accomplish and just personality is a big part of it Doug people feel differently about certain things and it's all about you know where we begin where we're going in who are you where are we from\nAnd all those components go into a financial planet it it's not as cut and dry as somebody just sitting down with you having you fill out a form\nChecked the box so they can figure out what your risk tolerance is you know and then just dropping you into whatever their portfolio is based on the way you check the box is off\nIt's not that simple made people feel differently about different things and through these conversations and and the one on one get to know you and then putting together a financial planner able to do that\nThe only thing that I I the way I feel and what I Do know about our clients is nobody's looking for the hang in their approach it's very hard to deal with in retirement is not so bad\nIf you're working because your portfolio does not drive your quality of life you're not worried about never having to work again 'cause you're working that's where your income comes from\nWhen you step away from your career and you were probably doing it thirty or forty years or you're getting ready to step away from your career\nYou start looking very very closely at your assets and you start trying to figure out a way to make those assets you know last the rest of your life provide you with an income stream that you need adjusted for inflation and taxes moving forward but then also preserving the principal\nI never meet anybody who wants to just spend it down right and and people go every once in a while some bill say something like well hey listen if ah if my last check and balance right before I die that would be great\nWell yeah that would be great I mean I think all of us could agree but none of us know exactly when we're going to pass away so it's not a responsible way clearly to to build a financial plan so we build these al ... where we can show people listen if if if we invest the money this way right and if we get this average rate of return fees\nAt this risk level given the amount of income you need adjusted for inflation tax is moving forward this is how you'll be successful if we do it this way\nAnd it's very empowering I think to put that financial plan and people's hands and trauma exactly how it works because then it eliminates that that big big concern which is how do I get from point a to point\nYou point a being retirement and point me being you know I don't know age Ninety five or one hundred or whenever we leave this this world so that is a big part of that and\nAnd it's people look I mean we're we're private wealth management firm so people start to wonder well I hear you on the radio you're probably all of management from here to talk about portfolios\nYou know it sounds good mind but you know how do you accomplish that and there's a couple of ways we do that but as a private wealth management company one of the things that I Know dog is nobody wants to be the next victim of the next Bernie made off\nRight and then we don't we don't know where that person is but they're out there and we know they're out there somewhere and and there are people certainly that are perfectly willing to different people have their money\nSo the way that we you know make sure our clients realize that's not what we're here to do is we utilized custodians are custodians or companies like fidelity Charles Schwab ... so when people invest with us their money goes to the custodian All right\nAnd we don't have access to their funds we can't pull money out of their accounts we can't you know I can go to South America or some country without extradition right and take their money with me I have no access to their money what I have is limited authority to manage their account on their behalf as a fiduciary right\nAm legally required to do it in their best interest and so there is a complete separation there we can be a private will management company so I don't have some big corporation telling me how I have to invest client funds you know a lot of times I Know there I Would I Know is there a lot of people out there Doug sitting on a pile of mutual funds or something right\nBecause they're working with some company who believes you\nShould be a mutual funds and I'm not saying that's wrong but I don't think you can put everybody in that basket and say everybody should have a hanging their portfolio comprise a mutual funds I don't like that if I was retired I wouldn't want that\nAnd so I Can't promote that our clients and say hey you should hang in there and not worry about whether the market's up or down it just doesn't work I personally would rather have a relationship with an advisor that had a vested interest in doing well\nThe how's the how's life in the fast lane arms I don't know I Can't find the unwrap [laughter] every now and then and there was\nOne I remember he said they said no army and I said no how you doing today he says poor\nAnd like oh what's wrong normally goes no no poor as informed my beer\nThere you go and or something else kind of interesting you know we always talked about his wife veer off and she only appeared on the show briefly one time as a love interest for cliff cliff and but she was always\nYou know his real life wife who's who played vierra and she was always off screen whenever they had some conversations or she was nagging him or something like that so that was cheers I missed the show and but thank God for Netflix you can watch\nAll the reruns on there too so you are listening to guarding your nest egg with Mike Lester I'm Doug Harding in for a course in Charles our phone number here as four o seven to seven zero one thousand and the website is guarding your nest egg dot com\nNext avenue it's a website that focuses on baby boomer issues says it's practically impossible for the average person to intelligently navigate their Social Security system so making the only this onto so how do we figure out whether it is what we need to figure out\nAll right so when it comes to Social Security one of the issues I have with this dog is there's there's a lot of information out there and it starts to get really confusing\nAnd then companies or a financial advisors or insurance sales people I mean you've picked but but they're using Social Security and the confusion around it as a way to basically try to get people in their office or try to get people to a seminar or something like that and they're almost confusing the issue even more\nSo it doesn't have to be that complicated there is a lot of truth around the fact that there are certain strategies you can use\nTo get more out of Social Security but every one of those strategies involves you delaying taking the payment right and the fact is is if we all knew exactly how long we were going to live but we could probably come up with a really really really efficient Social Security strategy but none of us have the answer to that\nAnd that's why we need to take a look at Social Security and then all of the options that you have when it comes to Social Security as far as when you should take it should you take it at sixty two she take it at full retirement age which is for most people are I'm sixty six or six to seven\nShould you wait till Seventy right you see all this is already starting to get a little confusing and then if you're a married couple\nSome different strategies there if you are divorced but you were married to your spouse for at least ten years or something else there so I don't want to get this all convoluted what I Want our listeners to understand is that everybody's situation is very unique and there is no one stop shop or one best way for every one when it comes to Social Security [noise]\nIt is an important part of any financial plan which is why we include\nThat full Social Security analysis and missiles curry planning and timing strategies in every financial plan that we do\nIf you want to go to a seminar and have somebody to talk to you about this for an hour or something I mean that's fine I personally don't think it's necessary it's not as complicated as they make it out every single one of them Doug\nJust flipped on their computer and put your vision and that in five minutes it's bizarre all the information so it's not that complicated but again it is an important part of any financial plan we want to make sure that you're\nDoing what's best for you when it comes to Social Security and we will do that for you at our office we'll leave it at that\nYou know but we want to make sure we're doing what we need to do it's confusing but but we can take care of that and we do it in our comprehensive financial plan\nIt is kind of confusing Social Security maybe not the most exciting thing either but you need to know about your Social Security and you know how it benefits you are how maybe you need to change up your Social Security making his team at town wealth management will definitely answer their questions for you there are people standing by\nTo take your call their numbers for oh seven to seven zero one thousand\nFour o seven to seven zero one thousand and you can find out to more at guarding your nest egg dot com now Mike I wanted to bring up something since this show is all about retirement you have people coming in sit down with you and talking about their retirement and it's always kind of a\nI Would say sometimes a a stressing time in there by figuring out the retirement that eventually you're going to have to retire so how often are your clients that come in that they're unsure about their abilities to retire\nMean ability retire is a big part of it when you take a look at um ability I think there are a lot of people that feel like they are able to they don't have that road map for lack of a better word you know so so certain things have to be in place in order to to to transition into retirement so imagine somebody who\nDecides they're going to retire well they I mean let's say their their retirement date is the first time next month\nAnd they step out of their career well that means the checks are going to stop coming in some of the first things they have to figure out is well how do I start pulling money out of my investment accounts and how do I do it in the most efficient way possible because that's not set up I mean currently all he's been doing is putting money into it so one of the first\nThings that you would do even without a financial plan is you would just link your investment accounts your four one K. your eye or air or whatever and you set up distribution so you're probably going to want to distribution once a month and maybe one at the beginning of the month or the middle of the months you know everybody's a little bit ...\nThe next day you're going to be worried about his taxation you know how is that money taxed literally in order to to get those two components meaning how much money I'm going to pull out every month and then how much tax\nYou have to understand your budget right what is that number I Need every single month\nTo take care of all of my expenses simple things like should I set a little bit aside every month for those expenses that that are are it's not my mortgage or it's not my insurance or it's not my car payment or or what have you it's just discretionary items you know how much do I want for that\nSo that on a surface sounds really not that complicated but you still have to go through the process of setting up that income stream but then you start wondering well how much can I take out before I get into a situation where I Would run out of money right ... you have to have a way to measure that\nYou have to understand inflation's impact on your portfolio\nYou need to understand how taxes impact your portfolio we we don't want to spend you know or pay I should say more in taxes and we actually need to that's just a waste so there are certain strategies when it comes to taxation we talked about a little bit earlier in the program Doug there are are different buckets of money some of our money\nIs one hundred percent taxable on some of our money only their earnings are taxable if we have raw accounts none of that's taxable\nSo do we just pull out of one until something then moved to the next one or do we pulled a little bit out of each one you know how do we put all of this together\nAnd so it's really those moving parts and the individuality for each person as far

thousand eight financial crisis and people are wondering\nCould it happen again well of course that could end it might but nobody has a crystal ball that financial author Suzie Ormond tells CNBC it's important to remember that the market bounce back from two thousand and eight and a big way\nA fortune may starting ... thousand and I did just how if you hadn't sold if he didn't panic you in the city felt pretty today it wouldn't even be funny but they've got all that so they're starting to get nervous they get should I say I do this\nThey're forgetting to laugh and that the last ten years said have taught by\nMike let's talk real life here in Florida what's your advice or investors you might be getting a little nervous\nWell first of all I listen to that and I think that it's not easy to hang in there when markets were as bad as a way and I think the hanging their approach is is is very very hard for anybody to deal with particularly if they're close to retirement so it's one thing to say\nYou know now that we have a crystal ball and go on the radio or your TV show or whatever you have and go hey listen if you adjust hung in there you'd be fine right now\nIt's not that simple and if you were suffering at that point in time and losing money hand over fist in your four one K. or area whatever retirement account was\nAnd it was affecting your retirement hang in there is not easy to do a lot of people let emotions take over and and got out and then they didn't have a strategy to get back in and and and those people yeah they feel like they missed out but\nI guess I just take issue with anybody saying hey you know you should have hung in there everything it'd be just fine it's not easy to just hang in there when things get really really rough you know it's your money it's a ... it's very very personal\nSo the flip side of that as it is having a strategy and my argument against that sort of hanging their approach would be well yeah that sounds well and good and and and she's sitting there saying if you're just held on to be so pretty right now well\nIt wasn't that pretty for a long time you had to wait a lot of people you know five six seven years just to get back to even and now maybe in your portfolio you're feeling better about it but it took a really long time so the alternative that was well what if you're working with an investment adviser that has a strategy that's tactical right actively managed portfolios\nAnd we're looking at indicators and we say listen I based on what's going on and makes no sense to oh hold equities at this point in time so we're going to go ahead and get out and if we're wrong you'll miss out on a portion of games but our clients are individuals that are either retired or close to retirement so bottom line is they're more willing to give up a portion of games the narrative take big losses\nAnd that's essentially how we manage our portfolios but\nHad you done it at that point in time Christian you'd be much better off like what if I got out ... indicators weren't good and then I waited for indicators the get go when I got back in and will\nNot only would you not have lost a ton of money when markets crashed but you also would have had an opportunity to invest all that money that you saved by that losing it into a market that was lower and that's what they're not talking about their\nSlogan we promote working with a fiduciary and working with an a fee based adviser that has a vested interest in doing well we promote actively managed portfolios we don't want to hang in their approach and Christian I think we just have to add value if I can show somebody how to get a higher average rate of return\nThan what they're currently doing that have been easy they pay us there's no reason to work with us so we sit down with people week after week and we put together financial plans analysis to help them figure that out and put that financial planning their hands so if you're listening now and you let it

I think actually kind of an interesting question you like music I Love music when you Katie go to a concert whether it's just date I let you guys or if it's something maybe for the kids I don't know right I mean one of those folks that stay till the end or do you leave a couple of songs really be traffic\n[laughter] so depends a lot on who the who the band and okay it's because at this point with the kids right we do both so we do the Venus and bands at Kenyon I enjoy and then um we also do a few things that I'm like is like so\nAn example of something kids would be more interested than us would be I mean I was sixteen year old daughter so we and the and then also a nine year old daughter and six year old son so Taylor Swift is pretty big\nLike you know in that group yeah I wasn't particularly compelled to stay busy ... [laughter]\nOkay to do the nobody instill a swift but not your favorite thing ever known I Know my favorite thing and I'm sitting there imagining trying to get out there and everybody is trying to go so\n... early was I'm actually pretty great okay that situation but yeah we're we're totally open to hanging around if if we don't have anywhere to be\nThinking he might like Jimi Hendrix coming out of mind something iconic like that you know yeah I mean if we could do Crosby stills and Nash I mean clearly at this point you know I Would say till the end but that'd be really hard to pull off\nYou're right the kids do change everything and that's there with you you might need to head out of their cars that can be getting a little and say well we like to reminisce about things that happened in yesteryear that were a lot of fun and also just a part of our history and pop culture history and we also like to talk about how you can use active wealth management\nTo develop your own strategy that's personalized for you and your situation based on what you've worked hard to save accumulating invest all these years\nTo be financially confident now and in the future of your retirement and to have a retirement income plan\nHe's got questions about that doesn't guarding your nest egg dot com or you can speak to Mike or another team member here in Florida off the air force\nThere were seven to seven zero one thousand in a dream about retirement that's one thing it's fun to do it's an opportunity where you can dream big and\nStink of everything but pay for that dream is another thing might the tips that can help people get ready to leave the full time workforce and sail away toward their own dream\nTo transition them and we do talk about that are on the radio program certainly when people coming to visit a lot of the individuals that were talking to some of them heard the program one times I've been listening for years you know and they said hey listen I'm I'm looking to make that transition I just want to make sure I'm prepared\nAnd part of that is taking a look at exactly where they're at so they're very very typical scenario would be somebody coming in what you say it's a married couple he has his investment assets she has her investment asset so\nOf them have been working each of them have been studying money aside for retirement and uh both of them have been the matches and and they're just done a good job and they're trying to figure out how to make the transition the biggest issue with the transition\nIs figuring out I mean in in at least in individuals mines is how do I go from putting money into my retirement accounts for the past three or four years\nTo pulling money out of my financial accounts for the next Thirty years or so\nAnd not having that money run out right and the big question is how do I invest the money to make that happen now we talked earlier about inflation and and what interest rates were like in the early eighties and the math it'd be really really simple if we could just go down to the bank and get a CD for Eighteen percent\nRight I mean and what's in your ... retirement of you to fix Eighteen percent and most people go like hey I'm outta here you know as a whole take this job and show that kind of thing\nBut that's not the way it works we're not getting those interest rates at the bank were not likely to ever get those interest rates at the bank unless something goes horribly wrong along the way because that means we've got crazy inflation and the government's had to raise interest rates up to that point to um basically stop an even bigger problem\nSo what we're doing is we're we're helping people create efficient portfolios\nTo accomplish what their goals are and not everybody unless you spend a lot of time every week again we do this Monday to friday every week and we do this radio program on the weekends but not everybody knows how to take that portfolio and create an efficient portfolio by efficiency I mean how to get the highest rate of return I can get\nBut I also want that return with the least amount of fees and least amount of ... and most people right now markets have been good so they might look at their portfolio and think well you don't mind\nThe average rate of return pick a number of let's say you're averaging eight or nine percent per year on your portfolio over the past ten years and then this past year has been really good ... you could be up eight ten twelve Thirteen fourteen percent this year\nBut what's your long term average but then also more importantly once you transition to retirement how much risk are you taking to get that return so it was all process I I I go through as individuals and we're sitting down at the office and and we'll take a look at their portfolio and look at what their average rate of return is and\nLet's say that we look at it and and your average rate of return is about nine percent per year and it's pretty good to feel pretty good about that right because we know if we go to the bank\nUm we're not going to get that if in our brains are thinking well if I could just continue to average nine percent on my portfolio I'll be finding retirement that would be great\nBut then we do another exercise where we go ahead and test how much risk we're taking to get that return and what we're doing is we're measuring the drawn out what what would happen if markets crash on your portfolio which is essentially what people are wondering about but we can define that for you what would actually happen\nAnd we hear this all the time but if we had a crystal ball we would know exactly how to position it chances of them doing that right and twenty five million at risk and really really aggressive portfolio is to get to a hundred million is really really unrealistic right we don't we don't know exactly what's going to happen moving forward\nAll the crap it's definitely a wealthy family because they struggle al ... that's not real life but realizing that you work with all types of people over the age of fifty here in Florida with their investments and you have some pretty wealthy clients so some types of planning strategies the ways of going about this that you use with clients who has\nA rather larger nest egg\nSure all what we're working on and and what we've been doing for years is active management of portfolios and people hear me talk about that but but and unless you actually see it as hard to understand exactly what that involves a most investors are dealing with portfolios that are very static and what that means is\nThey aren't actively manage somebody has sat down and and hopefully done a good job of putting together a diversified portfolio but there's no real tactical strategy for moving in and out of stocks are moving in and out of bonds are moving in and out of real estate based on certain indicators that are going on\nAnd we want to follow that because it helps us be smarter investors as easy to easiest example I can give as if markets are doing horribly and the stock market is crashing and I mean we could use two thousand eight as an example\nHow many of our listeners we're\nIn a situation where nobody gave them any advice on what to do about that and they had to decide for themselves whether to hang in there and just write it down and then ride it back up or did they feel kind of alone and having to go in and liquidate portfolios and maybe doing it the wrong time\nAnd then maybe potentially never even getting back in I mean we do meet people who had that situation it's hard to do and you have to be careful and that sort of guidance is really where we come in and not because you know we're a bunch of rocket scientist over here or anything but because we literally work with this every single day\nAnd it's our job to not only protect or ... portfolios\nAnd then help our clients be successful and retirement\nSo you know strategies to helping clients with larger portfolios for smaller portfolios are the same right traditionally individuals who had more money\nTens of millions of dollars would have access to actively managed portfolios and very very strategic per fully utilizing algorithms and that sort of a thing\nWhat we've done is we want to bring that to everyone and we want to make sure that individuals who maybe not the and maybe they don't have tens of millions of dollars can still benefit from actively managed portfolios\nAnd if we're able to do that and just how people not only be more comfortable in retirement helped them participate in market gains help them not have to worry as much about market losses help them no you know they have an advisor that has a vested interest them doing well\nAnd putting all that together is really where we're at\nAnd that's what we're showing individuals' when they come sit down and if you feel like we're providing value what happens person as individuals decide to work with us if they don't feel like we're providing enough value then I don't get to work with us right and we don't have an expectation that everybody out there should should work with is right I mean everybody's got their own thing but\nYou know coming in and sit down and letting us helping with the analysis show you how to make your ... more efficient at least you're going to walk out of our office with a you know some ideas on how to make the portfolio more efficient um letting us put together that financial plan for you will show you how to implement that on your own if he honestly want to do that I don't have any problem with that\nBut a lot of people don't want to so we'll implemented form at any rate if you give us a call the next ten minutes we can do that for your complimentary\nFor seven to seven zero one thousand that's four zero seven to seven zero one thousand it's all about active wealth management and you can find out more by having making the team put together that comprehensive financial plan that the Fifteen hundred dollar value\nComplimentary if you'd call within the next ten minutes is it is to guarding your nest egg dot com and\nIt is officially fall one of my favorite times they've probably absolutely my favorite time of year now that I sang it out loud\nAnd it's all the time of year that most of us are making enrollment decisions about health care including Medicare my advice for people listening here in Florida who may be going through this right now because talking to some friends of mine that their phone is ringing off the hook if they are in this demographic of age\n... bringing us up because yes fall is a time when you are going to get bombarded because as what's referred to as open enrollment when it comes to these plans that cover expenses Medicare doesn't cover All right\nAnd so for a lot of people that's going to be a Medicare supplement or they're also Medicare Advantage plans I don't want to get too far into the\nWeeds on exactly the differences because there are a lot of differences between them and the different plans that they offer\nBut if your age sixty five are older and you're eligible for Medicare you were in the crosshairs you know for this marketing\nAnd I think what is going to build down to for individuals is making sure that they have the best plan that they can get right for the amount of money that they're spending\nChristian it you gotta be careful of things here or there are representatives who\nWill come to you every single year and try to switch you from one plant to another that's not a good thing it's not even technically legal if it's not in your best interest but the reason they do that is the commissions that they get first year out are more than the commission as they get if you just stay a client sort of feel like you're in that position\nTo be careful and then also the marketing in general there are a lot of regulations around it but I hate that individuals have to talk to maybe you know three or four or five different sales people just to get the information that they need to try to make a good decision which is why\nYou know I tell them all management and throw a radio program we have individuals that work with all of the different Medicare Advantage and Medicare shop on plans out there\nAnd in that way so for our our clients when the when they sit down and they have questions you know they don't have to go see five or ten people they can add on with us we can look at all the plans that are available\nAnd whether they've had a change in their life or whether they just want to you know maintain what they currently have we can do that for them of course and we can also do that for our listeners if you don't want to sit down and talk to again three or four or five different individuals or have to go to a whole bunch of different meetings to find out what health care plan is\nRight for you you could sit down with our Medicare specialist and they can walk you through all the options will be making an informed decision Christmas part of the overall financial planning process I mean yes we help people invest money and yes we want to help you get the highest rate of return you can get none of any fee\nBut at the same time if we're saving money on things like health care or we're getting you better coverage for the same price that's a big benefit we have CPAs that we work with Christian that are employed by us\nAnd the point there is we don't want our clients to pay more taxes than they have to\n'em and that's part of the financial planning process right it's not just about the investments we want to help you save money in taxes we also have attorneys that we work with because the state planes are really really big part of any financial plan\nWe have to understand our money works for us now but also eventually Christian as I say what's guaranteed death and taxes right you know eventually we're going to pass away so how do we make sure that our assets transition as as efficiently as possible to our beneficiaries we want to keep on call Sam\nRight out of our state we will try to keep the our state\nOut of our state and uh so stay planes are really really big deal so as we wrap up today's program we want to make sure we're providing our listeners with good information on how to be efficient when it comes to investing\nGreat financial planner successful retirement so give us a call the next ten minutes if you'd like to come sit down for that

gone to refresh\nUs you know that's a good that way\nI John you're on the air now Hi hey John you've you've been refreshed computers before\nI went to refresh computers last week for the first time I mean let's say on the radio for a long time [noise]\nAnd I had a problem the computer it was completely dead I bought it there they were wonderful to deal with it took it they told me to call me when they saw to roll with it they did that [noise]\nThey replaced the hard drive [noise] got all my information back on the computer and mailed it back to me just a wonderful experience\n... definitely

the show your experience with our listening audience\nYeah Thanks John and if you want to call in as well the number's eight for for two two zero zero nine six five so I'm Andrea\nWhat else about refreshed computers one of the things that stands out to me whenever you talk about it is that\nWhen when you clear computers when you're white people's data and if you're not just the leading stuff I mean you're using government set standards you're using standards that the government uses for wiping their computers and to me that's that's great because wiping data's really serious thing\nThat's right I'm One of ... any computer is brought to us from the different government these corporations educational institutions that we get them from or even from the general public we have a standard process that we go through a because we're in a a a one assets worse or find there are two eyes of fourteen thousand one and it was at Eighteen thousand one\nSo we have very strict stance comes to the proper handling of recycled\nAnd refurbished goods and so the very first thing that we do with any computer after we catalogue them into our system is that we remove the hard drives from the or any data storage me and from the system\nAnd then we have a special secure hard drive wiping room where all the drives are tested and wipe to a D O D level ... is our level seven standard at the very very thorough screening process which eradicate every little trace of information on the device\nAnd of course a lot of people don't necessarily know when they're playing their computers out on the curb or are in the trash that they're actually putting their data at risk because I'll take some bad guy\nLooking around saying hey well like ... year what kind of information guy potentially see from them and even there's industrial model printers too that sometimes even have information stored and head on them\nSo uh what everyone assets and refreshing beers I've been doing for many many years that we've offered a community electronic recycling initiative\nThat that anybody can and bring all electronic devices computers cellphones\nPrinters scanners anything that has electronics in it to our ... our headquarters which is also a recycling center out and like Mary or to our long which superstar refresh computers and I'll go and give those addresses for you\nOr the assets headquarters facility is a low believe are now when we launched this we started this particular facility as an eighty thousand square foot occupied space\nAnd then we just expanded into a forty thousand square foot space adjacent to it so now\nOur warehouse facility are recycling ... center is now one hundred and twenty thousand square feet he has got a lot of room yeah well I mean there's a lot of stuff in there I mean ... ... brim with that much amazing stuff\nUm and uh so that address is twenty four fifty to\nLake Emma road sweet ten ten in lake married that's our ah anyone else's recycling center\nAnd uh that's open Monday through friday from nine to five\nOr we also can accept smaller quantities at the refresh computers along with super store which is a twenty each state road for three four and that's and long wood and rope in seven days a week nine and seven Monday through Saturday and eleven and five on Sunday may times what happens is that people bringing their old computers that they're having trouble with that David originally Brian for trouble sheen\nAnd then they get a replacement computer we copy over all the data\nAnd then the old one they can just leave with us for responsible recycling and it's a ends up being a win win because you save a lot of money again your machine you get your data moved over plus you have the knowledge and confidence that you're ... got to be properly handled disposed of\nWhere we have a one hundred percent ... for all the different elements the males the plastics that I'll get broken down\nIt's a very very good process and that's why one assets is one of the greenest companies\nIn central Florida if not the United states of America and you don't have to buy a computer from refreshed get service there right that's right we always do free diagnostics seven days a week for any type of computer problem that you might be having\nAnd again a recycling drop off this free or data transfers free with the computer purchased there's so

P. business class phone service and it's a fail safe system mind you\nWill get back into that a little bit later but let's go hang into a big three tech topic let's do it so I talked about during our last show that there was a a security vulnerability that had compromised or the personal information of fifty million Facebook accounts\nWhen I came to session tokens regarding a feature to view\nAs another person a basically it's supposed to be a feature that would help you stay safe ironically by being able to see in control what other people would see on your profile but yet there was a security flower that function\nSo Facebook has officially published a page on their Web site at Facebook dot com forward slash help\nForward slash security notice and they go into detail about uh what exactly happened that Ninety million accounts were affected by the vulnerability has fifty that were confirmed to actually have been exposed\nAnd they have identified the of the fifty million exposed accounts that data had been ... sleek collected from twenty nine million of them which is more than half of those accounts\nAnd uh they have a if when you go to that page Facebook dot com forward slash help forward slash security notice\nThey will tell you whether you are one of the twenty nine million people that have been affected by this vulnerability\nOn they don't believe that uh any information other than what you had said on Facebook so they didn't compromise to actual credit card information on Social Security information or stuff like that\nThe information that was compromise would have been stuff like date of birth relationship status personal information you have strong Facebook Like address and a general stuff that you would have given to Facebook\nObviously they sick since fit that vulnerability but needless to say the repercussions with everything going on with Facebook we have a can bridge Analytica scandal and then uh it's just been story after story after story with Facebook and or their\nStock price has fallen even lower than from before the first scandal because they've had lower earnings reports and then this that and the other\nOne thing I have been seeing a lot of particularly over the past couple of weeks\nIs that a lot of my Facebook friends have been posting\nHey if you see a friend request coming from somebody that's me we warned did not me a scene and you've seen a lot of media outlets actually covering this says oh it's just a hoax such a male thing that people are falling for but\nIn actuality I always recommend every once in awhile look up your own name on Facebook because there are actual cases and in fact it did happen to semi Facebook friends\nWhere fake imposter accounts using\nHarvested ... collected information like in this hack\nWhere fake accounts were set up to impersonate the real user\nAnd then they use that to collect information about other people that might not necessarily be public to anyone except their friends or to potentially impersonate their friends to to post a scam like you know the scam where\nOh my God I'm In a situation please send me money right and they're not actually the real person so

freaky and sharing your thoughts on\nDon't wear landowners first for [laughter] for the viability\nReady and Brian kill me you know me from Fox and friends in the morning and the Fox news channel which you may not know is on the radio show right here I really respect your diversity is diversity of viewpoints your viewpoints and political position even when we disagree\nAnd I don't know how else you would describe again people who are blocking traffic and people who are uh openly calling for the harassment of government officials\nDon't know how you would describe it other than that other than this is a mob\nWell if you go to the playbook it goes like this if you got a group of people to come together and some are pounding on cars and telling people you got to go the other way and throwing bricks through windows\nYeah you have to report it was mostly a peaceful protest right other than just a few bad apples soon but you\nDo also have other people who are high profile names are in the Democratic party who are going out and saying basically well\nThis is the reaction you get a Hillary Clinton this was on CNN yesterday and boy okay\nYou cannot be liberal with a political party that wants to destroy ... which is banned for which you're paramount that's why I Believe if we are fortunate enough to win that ... that we can start your own\nSo when we when that's when we stopped right\nOr the ... what you're saying and that's exactly what she believes\nI thought you were all about anti bullying ... that sounds like bully supporting we're going to keep doing this until we get our way and we get the power right right\nThat the Republican theme to recognize angry that strength and you heard how the Republican numbers led by Mitch McConnell the president\nReally didn't mean to the confirmation process a filter can't not only a doctor for the women are speaking out\nMy gosh I hadn't heard that clip yet yeah\nThey were attacked on hawk or see here is that an\nUnreal level there that is really rich hills keep going\nSo when you're dealing with an ideological party that is driven by the length for power\nCorporate government debt and the ... river but you can't overcome what they intend to do this you win elections\nRight on man see when you get so many independents\nThat can carry a vote one way or another and they hear that they're going to go to the other side hills you know because this stuff doesn't make sense to them people are breaking the law doesn't make sense to your average Jane and Joe it just doesn't right\nWell and saying yeah well you can't be civil until we win elections I mean and and it's really and she blamed it on Republican she says Republicans have taken it way too far\nAnd certainly I think you can look at the fringes of both the both sides of the political spectrum and say that there have been conservative activists who've cross lines before or people who call themselves conservative activists newer crosswind there's no question about that but it did by turning a blind\nEye to what left wing activist have done right now and what's being encouraged right now is insane to me\nYou get cooks on both sides right okay part of being the same ones is calling out to coax you got to call out your own sometimes when it's obvious that behavior is over the line\nOn the media excuse all of it I mean they say no it's not it's you can't call it a mob you can't do that I mean look at it because they see it as extreme measures to go against a viewpoint they don't agree\nWith that is what it all comes down to\nAre you looking into that crystal ball and seeing the midterms and later that evening and the next day the media saying you\nKnow we really got to get out of our bubble [laughter]\nWe really we really misjudged this whole thing and um how I'm starting to see that\nMaybe I mean an end to blame as Hillary Clinton just did basically blame Republicans for all of this I mean look I mean I just want to go back down memory read from a viewer memory lane from a few days ago in Portland\nWhen you had protesters blocking mystery yelling at drivers to move along this was not civil oh I thought you met a couple of days ago and you had the vegan\nSandwich there [laughter] no no this was okay this was the same yes\nWhy aren't you going to\nBe\nYeah evil it's real civil is what that is\nAlready see you have to keep me up to date on the rules All right if you're a white person you can call another person Whitey if their political views don't line up with yours Whitey within what are you are you informed Whitey are you in lightened Whitey\nWilkie walk I don't know I think you're going to call you got a dangerously close to ... among other things some of the protesters in Portland that kind of makes sense yes it does okay so ... and then Whitey he's already got it right new rule all the time and then\nJust a couple of days ago yeah democratic senator Mazie Hirono saying violent clashes and and Republicans should be Stockton harassed because that's what they deserve ...\n... ... ... and all that kind of look for in our country from ... in our country that are the kind of uh after\nYeah that occurs and they're the same island log in to have a comment that\nOkay no there's no you're not allowed to call it a mob you shouldn't call it a mob flight driving into work today boy there are a lot of cars out on the road don't you dare call that traffic [laughter] don't you dare [laughter]\n'cause it's going to give a black guy to the whole region then people might not want to move here right
