I just find it incredibly ironic I did while he's telling everybody to not demonize people that he actually goes out and have demonizing entire group of individuals I mean I just I don't think James Hodgkinson was\n[noise] I don't recall him being um what radicalized to the right I I don't remember him being radicalized to the right at all uh that's not what I I didn't he because he wasn't this was on CNN now\nAnd I just wonder if a if there's a because I don't believe that there's I just don't believe that they're going to be any penalty for him saying something like that because that was blatantly racist\nI don't care where you are on the political spectrum I really don't care just be consistent that's all I care about that is racist would he just said and this is a network that's constantly saying don't demonize people to demonize people et cetera et cetera et cetera uh but yet ... did you just do what did you just do\nIt that that's exactly what you just stood there\nAnd I don't think that anybody is saying that there isn't\nThere isn't violence and play you know that there aren't people who are violent but and I'm not going to get into this I and I hate the fact that these I feel like people on the left are trying to push me into this argument as to who sides ... more violent you guys will lose that just so you know so stop you guys will lose it that shouldn't even be the focus anyway\nThe focus should be on on on on a mirror on policy and why is it that that that people\nCan't just simply agree to disagree\nAnd and when he talks about a Muslim ban that's a priest that position it's entirely false argument there was never a Muslim ban\nThey all they did was say hey we're gonna have to take extra time to make sure people who are coming from these countries and it wasn't just if they wanted to ban Muslims they would have gone after and banned travel from Indonesia and et cetera and they didn't\nIt just amazes me that people out there can be so ridiculously stupid and so petty and so politically partisan that they will say that taking extra time to vet people who are coming over\nAnd from certain countries with which we do not have relationships to that or that do not have an infrastructure or a system in place where we can check data\nUp to say that it takes more time to do that so we're going it's going to take an extra three months longer that's not a Muslim ban at the different because we have to double check things it's not a ban where the hell are people getting us I think that lying\nAbout it is what his divisive I think a line about it for the purpose of inciting people and to further divide the country and to agitate I think that that's incredibly divisive\nIs again all about how all getting into so insanely ironic and so incredibly ironic so this was last night\nDonald him and saying this and so he's he's again while I'm not going to demonize people but I'm going to demonize people I just I'm ... if he was on NBC I Wonder if anything were to happen he actually had had previously to that he goes I don't see Democrats killing people and then the skull east took some issue with that\nThey took they they they they they they took some issue with that as he should\nSo we also we are going to take a look at this it's Halloween or we're going to take a look this migrant Caribbean as well and continue to follow that because now apparently there are people that are ran I saw this report it on a daily mail in a couple of other places\nWhere they people who are indeed quote unquote care of and have some weapons and all kinds of stuff and there have been fights with police in certain parts of the areas through which they are caravan\nWill have that I'm also Kanye West\nNow there was all this controversy yesterday over Kanye West and uh because he's decided that he is he says I've been used to spread messages I don't believe in\nAnd I told you he can turn around the other day I mean I I always think it's great when people question the status quo I also said he could turn around the other day he could decide that he doesn't agree with any of this anymore and he's now he hates Trump and you know it's ...

as of yesterday you need to tell them just although you'd be called General Mattis up right now across the street I have to share the same with you there's I tweeted this out earlier there is a dude at a supermarket\nIn Chicago Mariano supermarket maybe I don't know but it's the soup bar\nIt was up learning to read it and demand this man is it the ... bar all he sample in the soup out of the late ...\nI mean there's it's a start yourself to bar they got this nice guard a and he was legit sampling at the person who took the video of him doing it reported him to security this is why I don't do buffet anything\nI used to love buffets I used to love golden corral\nNice all will kick in his mouth and sticking it in the chocolate fountain once I Swear to you and I was told that the temperature of the chocolate it's hot enough to kill anything like that is not making me feel better I just can't do buffets I also don't eat anything out of a kitchen Nineteen\nI Will not it is the thing I just I'm not about that life I've just I just don't want to mess around and get like seriously bad food poisoning and I just I don't know right I don't know maybe some people are freaks maybe they cook with their feet I don't know who knows what they do when they get in her kitchen\nBut I just thought there's video of this guy actually sampling and he and he's an older guy like you should know better right and he sampling all the shit out of this so far\nThat [noise] this is probably the scariest thing I've seen that following folks second hour and stay with us\n[noise]\nMaybe six points by ... family than those of us really a group\nAnd they are coming out of shall we will have been endorsed by every town which isn't as an organization Michael Bloomberg and flew down ... as well as they are proud\nTo have to go like all Bloomberg and others like him and awake and what happened in Pittsburgh support holding the way they are pulling which is the most popular\nEvery town support banning Arafat [noise]\nLet's be clear I'm not anti gotten my great grandmother taught me how to shoot when I was growing up in Mississippi highlight trash shooting I like target shooting I don't because I mostly chicken and that seems to me [laughter]\nHowever I Know for hospitals gun owners\nAre saying that they had the responsibility for the firearms and making sure that only responsible people have the firearms that's why I Believe in a background check\nI Believe in a three day waiting period I Believe that those who commit domestic violence and stocking should not have access to weapons I Do not believe that weapons of mass destruction like the A R Fifteen belongs civilian hands\nI've shot and they are Fifteen and I think you probably have to\nAnd while it's an amazing amount of power it also is an amazing amount of destruction and I was very little that can be done and I had retired vulnerable communities when they are Fifteen of president\nI Do appreciate your honesty and I have found that by banning it would be rounding them off the top of the gun in America ... around sixty one percent of all us civilian rifle sales will be the rounding them up from civilians and George I sit on it we\nHaven't had a ban on assault weapons before the United states and I think we should do it again I think there has to be a conversation about accomplish\nBecause we have to recognize that this is a national conversation but I Do want to push back on any notion that I Believe that the second amendment is not the law the land I support the second amendment way by my father rifles every Christmas and a gun cabinet was a gift a couple of years ago [noise]\nIt is possible to believe and responsible gun ownership and to believe that there should be regulations on that Anthony ... said that [noise] and we have to believe in a nation than when our\nCommunity is is it ... and and so she\nShe bastard ISIS clear there which I'm going to get into a as well but this idea though she called an A R Fifteen a weapon of war\nWhich is pretty amazing to me because uh you know I mean there are millions of our fifteenth out there and when she was asked whether or not\nYou know she wouldn't answer it she would not answer it I Love by the way to people who mock those who believe that it is\nThey ... they mock those who believe that it is easy to go round up millions of people who are here in the country illegally but it's totally feasible to actually go door to door to millions of household and conflict the millions and millions of firearms without it works the idea that it is somehow I'm\nFirst off it's not even it's not even an it's not even an assault rifle its civilian rifle and assault rifles and made a term anyway what people mean to say is that it's for military use for her to sit here define it as a weapon of mass destruction is insane because keep in mind we just had\nA bomb than some other things to fund his weapons of mass destruction uh it is not a weapon of mass destruction these people don't understand ballistics they don't understand\nAh how would it even actually works that you're not even it's not even guaranteed the right of fire is not even guaranteed because it's entirely on the skill of the individual who is in charge of the inanimate object\nAnd so it it's stupid it it's just it's it's just the the did did you hear people like say the ... the idea that and they also say that our fifteenth aren't hunting rifles\nThey're Fifteen is like any other rifle I mean it it is it ... I Know people who use it for all kinds of just like any other rifle it's a ... you can use it for for a varmint for pets I mean people use it for that\nAnd this I mean there's just so it's the most people don't know what they're talking about with is the fact that it's like actually a um that it's a weapon of mass\nDestruction or that or that it has some sort of a power a more so than any other semi automatic rifle is asinine\nAnd additionally the idea that this rifle is somehow the lead in and murder is not even accurate either it is the uh most demonize it's the most popular rifle in the United states\nUh but it is actually responsible for the least amount of murders according to FBI uniformed crime reports dating from two thousand twelve to two thousand and six team which are publicly accessible at FBI dot Gov you just have to look for you see ours in fact you can just essentially Google then it'll pull it up for you\nAnd you can see that hand feeding fist two to three times over actually cause more casualties over semi automatic rifles because that's how the FBI break that down and by the way I Want to know that these numbers that are listed in the FBI uniformed crime report some two dozen a total\nOf two thousand and sixteen these are actual murders these are not numbers that are inflated with suicides these are actual murders s classify that as the eye\nSo this hands feet incest or other implements actually cause more bring on more casualties than semi automatic rifles\nSo they're targeting and that's what they said that the when they say air Fifteen what they're saying a semi automatic rifle they want to ban semiautomatic rifles Stacey Abrams not only wants to ban semiautomatic rifles but the fact that she would not answer whether or not she would confiscate them and did this like super huge Olympics for of around that question\nTo me indicate that she absolutely believes in confiscating those rifles and people in Georgia have to make that determination whether or not they want to elevate someone who'd legit supports confiscating you're perfectly legally owned firearm and punishing you for the actions of criminals making you pay that bill whether or not those people feel comfortable voting for this individual\nAnd so this uh this is this idea that that there's so many Mitt\nAre that are out there there's so many myths about this there so I mean for crying out loud we can sit here and we could talk about the list if we could talk about different semi automatic rifles we can sit here and talk about different you know what what makes one because one's all black or one has Woodstock I mean honestly what these individuals cannot explain what makes one different won\nAn in front of the other they couldn't they can explain that they just think that oh because this one has some cosmetic things on it it must mean that but the ones that have the war on their okay that's what these people honestly believes it's crazy I mean it's there there's there's there's nothing the idea that\nThere's somehow super more powerful is ignorance as to fire a mechanic\nAnd this stuff is important it's not in the weeds and it's not a it's not I'm a you know a a slicing hairs here what this does is language is important because law regulates according to language\nIt is why correct terminology is important because the law that exists specifically regulates specific terms\nThat's why terminology is important and people who act like they care about this conversation are going to care enough to learn enough about the topic to use proper terminology so as to be so as they can properly referenced the respective law for that specific term\nAnd anyone who's the chair and says it's splitting hairs they don't care enough about the argument they they don't care enough about the issue period\nAnd that's the ... that's that's that the fact\nThe idea that I mean it ... it so it is so kooky some of these I mean they sit here and go oh my gosh it's just\nCrazy the amount of ... it it's the crazy the amount of power that says it's not actually\nIt's ... you know good heavens but\nWhen she says and I want to pull this up because she mentioned specifically um the a very\nI mean he pulled us up I have so many things in front of me so give me one moment when she mentioned ... she entirely bastard iced a Scalia and I discussed this\nUh uh back some time ago when people began trying to cherry pick what he was stating a people were trying to provide the meaning of the second amendment and specifically in his opinion as it relates to Heller a with misinterpretation um in fact people were saying that um well because the Anthony Scalia\nBelieve that there were some prohibitions on possession of firearms that they're meant that there are open for full regulation\nAnd he believed that their worst them\nUh he you know he believe that there are some things that um that that support prohibition et cetera what Scalia was actually stayed in is that because the second amendment is and I have this other Dana radio dot com and it's also if you look on my Twitter stream at the last I have it all I had the link up there and it's awfully sided\nWhich was actually discussing is that because it is a natural right the only people who can\nWho can take natural rights or the very same people who bear those natural rights I you have to forfeit your natural right through\nA some sort of horrible uh aggression behavior et cetera that is ... ... federally regulated\nOr whether you're a mass murderer et cetera\nUm you if you prove yourself to be a you know an entirely dangerous person who's murdering people then yes you're going to forfeit you're right there are things that will cause someone to forfeit their rights\nAnd that's what he was specifically citing a where it concerns common UC also disgusted that as well not just in Heller but also when he was discussing separately colonial era friday which I wrote about in my first book hands off my gun\nIt's like the second or third chapter a because at that\nTime anything that was considered to be an unusual weapon was something that was not carried around by everybody at the time like if they had a head act\nAnd that's actually the exact example that escalated gave at the time uh but he ... there there was a there's a strict reason why the founders didn't say must get because they could already see the progression of firearms in terms of technology and uh the way that uh uh of rifling et cetera\nExpressed VPN cost less than seven dollars a month

I think it's a lot tighter than what people believe or what people\nAre even comfortable uh with\nAnd these are these are some of the ah these are some of the Senate the some of the Senate stuff the ended up going down the line here\nWe're our CPA shows that thirty two of the house seats are are classified as a toss up I mean it could go either way a hundred and eighty nine ... G O P two hundred and four till Democrat\nAnd\nGoodness it's going to be you got to have two hundred and Eighteen to get your majority it is going to be it's gonna be tight sort of a lot closer than people realize everyone needs to go out and vote\nAnd this um [noise] I mean again the\nSignificance of losing a house I just can't\nI Can't I'm a emphasize enough how important it is\nTo make sure that you that you go out and vote and that in that particularly with your with your um uh for anything else other than the house races I've just been looking at all of this data here because it is I mean it is\nThis is going to be tough there's so much there's so much at stake I just think energy I think of it remembered half controls power of the person there is a ... there's a lot there or additionally\nDemocrats I mean if people are already wants to become speaker of the house that that'll again that'll be a fight on the Democrats' side\nAnd if they\nEven pick up one seat in the Senate\n[laughter]\nDon't try to build your you'll you'll look at an impeachment they'll try to find something they won't even have to have anything the whole point is just law there they'll find something they'll do something all the gains that we have received\nJobs more of your up more of your taxes refunded et cetera all of this stuff or you're going to see rolled back and it'll be disastrous it will be absolutely disastrous\nAnd so that I mean I'm just I'm telling you what [noise]\nSo I Hope that people uh I Hope that people\nReally are paying attention to this because it's a house that both on impeachment Senate conducts but house that's an impeachment so it is and that and that's what they've all promise to do these are just their words their words very important midterm race\nBut ah the Arizona ones most the ones I think that concerned me the most Arizona Nevada um I find concerning uh those out of the Senate those are the most those are the ones that that concern me the absolutely most\nAh\nAnd ah oil and Holly McCaskill as well so far they are that's I think the closest I've ever seen this race um everything that I look at in terms of all of the aggregation of polling shows them shows it to be incredibly tight right now and\nUh it's yeah it's going to be it's gonna be tough\n[noise] and all of this roof\nAudio somebody Nineteen by the way McCaskill I sometimes I don't think that speaking of senators I end this close race I don't think that she quite understand um her voting base listen to this\n[laughter]\n\nMm yeah but that's the problem that I don't I don't believe in term limits and here's why\nI was having a conversation with this I don't I absolutely do not believe in creating a law for term limits do you want to know why because voters that your responsibility you are the term limit vote them out you were the term limit why the hell would you would you give up your authority and power\nYou are the term limit you are you you you\nI'm so tired of people feeding their sovereignty over the process to more government\nBoat I term limits are literally the big government response to stop you don't like\nAnd I think she's a career politician\nAnd should be a negative thing no one should be taking their ideas of a career into serving the public but this it was always supposed to be a temporary thing and then everybody as many people as possible citizens the United states get involved in this process and that's that's what was the intent mhm\nMm I completely I completely agree we have more to touch on we also have a today
