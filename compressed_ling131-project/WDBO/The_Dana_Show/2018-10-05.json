cannot stand all of the the people who think that they're going to move votes by creating these bot accounts on social media\nAnd then aggravating the hell out of people over it what what do you think that somebody's going to be convinced by calling them or on Twitter over just seriously stop\nGood heavens [noise]\nAnd\nI I'm just and Lisa Murkowski's cupid mine now mainly ridiculous asinine excuse for why she's not supporting Kavanaugh\nDid you did you hear what he ... let me just she writes\nI don't know how to David right now because I did not come to a decision on this until walking onto the floor of this morning I've been trying to\nKnow what is fair and what is right and the truth is that none of this is fair it's not fair to judge but we need to have institutions that are viewed as fair and the people who are victims people feel that there's no fairness in our system of government particularly within our courts and we've gone down a path is not good so I've been like wrestling with this is literally I'm writing a\nI've been wrestling with whether or not this is about qualifications of a good man or if it's bigger than the nominee\nLaw that says she says that he's innocent that he is qualified but it just might not seem to look fair\n\nThat is the dumbest thing and you know what else that you know what else women who make false accusations against him and that also stocks I think those women I think you they should I think when you are found to be doing that you should be tried and convicted I think that's going to have\nTo happen so there is mine and it's the only way to stop that it's the only way to stop it\nThey only way I Am so coming up apparently\nSixty nine percent of millennials have problems defining socialism\nOh my gosh prepare it down\nAnd then that that will hold out because it gets better apparently a bunch of them don't even know what it actually as so we'll have that for you a little in Kaiser until the FBI she felt pressured by

Dramamine ... oh my gosh dream of eating is acquaintance I don't know dip hen hydro ... yes\nThey're paying high dreaming which isn't over to ... oh my gosh lewd would not have been added a punch even if they were crushed into a powder it would make the punch tastes ... terrible by the way quite lives were also available as a positive or I I never ran across any thank goodness oh boy no longer do drugs\nStraighten Claire I being string clear headed is better than drugs all the drugs may make me feel better than normal part of the time but you also feel worse than normal part of the time no thanks God Bless your listener I appreciate that reference ... ...\nWhat's the answer there was a supposed ... yeah yeah what does that I was just because that way by is that what that is will go by the Urban Dictionary stuff in the show a new so yeah you wouldn't have like throwing that\nIn the\n[noise] that would not have ... that would not have work that that would not have worked that way\nNo no it's not [noise] I just\nGet so this it it makes it is so frustrating it is so ridiculously\nRidiculous that's all I Know so\nWell Susan Collins is expected to give her vote and then I'm Lisa Murkowski said she was going to vote no because it wasn't fair\nSaid that the cat but he's just not the right man for the court at this time I read the statement that she had her earlier that she said I mean she literally went through all of these she said I Believe he's a good man but she's going to legitimize this stupid\nSalem witch process\n[noise] I'm going to tell you what the\nHell don't mention they have to be the deciding vote I Love you Joe right now we need to understand me up I'm going to spend like some ... or something or some he's a he I'm for to Joe Manchin right now come on\nThe ah one reporter was asked as to whether or not\nMentioned which which has vote on the floor and a source close to him says he's never done that before he does not want to have a John Kerry problem [noise]\nOoh who's a\nBurn so and Collins and Murkowski era where we're talking earlier this morning I don't know I just I I don't know I think I don't know what Murkowski thinking but that was the dumbest reasoning I think I've ever heard\nIt was like if you it was drunk party girl\nLogic I even know what that what kind of logic is that well he's totally qualified and they believe he's innocent\nBut it's just not fair for like people who want to see fair miss so\nYou're going to bend and needed a rage mob what the hell's that ever solved you horrible person don't do this that's horrible reasoning come on Senator Murkowski let's do this\nGood grief that's just horrible reasoning [noise]\nI just don't understand what motivates her this um [noise] oh my goodness\nI uh\nYeah I don't think she was paid off I think that what she's trying to do is maybe run a third rail like an independent maybe and maybe at one point of Democrats end up taking the Senate she would\nCaucus with them she wants to go with the power is that's the only thing I can think of that's the only thing I can think of a\nMarco Rubio is that earlier today that a no vote on Kavanaugh would be logical interpreted as your ... your presuming that he was is guilty of the accusations that were made against him and that's what a no vote as a\nHe's qualified he's attacks journalist all these accusations um that have been made against him are they haven't been proven so what else that's what all of this is about\nAll of this\nThis is about all this is about\nSo everybody's basically Susan Collins has the Senate and hold because now\nWell we got like what forty five minutes and then she says her vote oh my gosh what if Manchin what mansion is fighting vote I'm going to tell you if he is the deciding vote and ... days on that do you realize that Democrats are going to come for him\n\nMan alive he's not an extremist Democrat\nHe's that were what did I say Cain during the primary\nIf Democrats were smart and they ran someone like a gym Weber Joe mansion they might actually be a successful salute her I said go back and look in a pod cast archived I said that if they were if they wanted to be successful they'd run somebody like a Jim Webb or Joe mansion and they'd be successful\nSo and he's actually I think he I mean he he and Trump have a relationship they're friendly\n[noise] man alive just as I feel like this is I don't know I just I don't know I don't\n[noise] so this uh and Donnelly of course not Donnelly a\nShould be\nShould be and will is there are two totally different things to totally different things but uh yeah Murkowski\nSaid I value and respect or my colleagues have come down from their support for the judge I also think we're at a place where we need to be thinking again about the credibility integrity of our institutions what about the credibility and integrity of the people who are asking the questions how about that\n\nWhat about the the credibility and integrity of people who who say that they're not going to vote for somebody before the dang testimony before the first one even took place what about those people out of his own account then account for real\n\nI I'm just so just disgusted\nSo fifty one forty nine Collins will announce her decision at three o'clock eastern\nAnd\nIn the meantime Leland Kaiser told the FBI\nIt sounded like Ford sprints we're trying to bully her into revising her statement\nTo corroborate Ford she told the FBI investigators Cleveland Kaiser told FBI that Monica ... that's the retired FBI agent who worked with a Preet Bharara who is a big time pro Hillary anti Trump\nA dude and a friend of a forward a McLean different to forge ahead she had urged Kaiser to clarify her statement Kaiser said look I didn't know anything about this I've never heard anything about this stop I've never heard anything\nAnd Kaiser for describe her as our best friend and Keyser was saying no I and she was a and apparently the family was mad because for they say for through her into the bus during the hearings because she said well she has health issues the family are saying\nThat had nothing to do with our memory they haven't been to parent her memory\nWould you agree with\nSo I I in\nReally just fascinated by all of this so we're going to see we're gonna watch it uh and uh in the meantime

I mean it's like a whole ... story and it came\nTo life after one woman um there was a a woman who lost her life in this clinic and went and they because they had first responders that couldn't get to her because the doors were barred and and they had done in front of on and then they go in there and they find out not only is everything discussing Les dirty but there's actually like no doctors there and they just have a teenager girls running the place and\nHe had a collection of aborted fetuses and ... and he was doing some super\nSuper illegal super late term stuff\nIt was horrified I run and then when the grand jury\nWhen they when they had that people who were testifying before the grand jury knows reading their testimonies I couldn't even get there is some of them and it was so heavy and so I have a lot of respect for the people who came together to put together this movie that is coming out on October twelve guys now the trial of America's biggest serial killer because\nThey were working from actual fact from what was happening in this case and it's horrifying enough just a glimpse of that you get to that\nBut you know they had to really roll up their sleeves and get into it and I God love him for joining me right now is international film and TV star Peabody Award winner next year the who directed this really horrifying film neck welcome to the show\nAnd thank you so much for getting my introduction right now so many people\nThey know not everybody is as good as we are and we we really take care of our people here that's the way how it works by weight congratulations on his film at a really fantastic cast media dean king Janine Turner ... and obviously you\nDirecting at this how hard was this for you to do because I Know everybody I think most everybody you know we caught him up and most everybody remembers the awful horror this horrifying story how difficult was this for you to to tackle as a director because this is some really heavy stuff\nYou know um when we started working on the script eh we all kind of agreed that what we needed to do was just tell the truth about this and not try to surmise about it at all because the fact that the case here so horrific Internet cells\nThat we didn't really need to offer our opinion about it so that's really how we approach it we approached it it's like we were telling a true crime story and\nJust in this state killer happened to be an abortion doctor who was killing babies after they were born and it was it's very grand subject matter but the movie itself it costs about the genetic\nCatching him and convicting him it's strangely uplifting in a way it's not and gory and it's not disgusting it it's actually a gay test screening people people really love the ...\nAnd that's a lot of talent to be able to to to get to do that and and I know that\nYou know reading some of the testimony that I Know that this is you know you showcased this aspect of it in the film as some of these women who you know they had never been pushed to speak out about what was it about this stuff until some of the more horrific things happened and they were really brave and and that they were speaking out but just the abuses that this guy\nIn this in his clinic I mean it's horrifying and I love how you said the facts are bad enough that they can speak for themselves I mean there is there really isn't any room for pontificated in this film because he is such a his evil it's such a presence in this film\nAnd how it taught me a little bit too 'cause I Know this was it was a labor of love for everybody who was involved and it took awhile for this film to come together\nUm what what did you find to be the most challenging aspect of putting a real life story about a topic that is normally not accurately portrayed and not honestly discussed by Hollywood and pop culture what was the biggest challenges he ran across you know and and directing an end to bringing us alive\nAnd well the the most challenging aspect of it really was a way to present the story that that it would it would still be accessible to a wide audience I mean we came out of the movie with the PG Thirteen lady
