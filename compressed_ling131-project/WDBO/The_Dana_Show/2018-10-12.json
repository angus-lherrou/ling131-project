bad start to that we get it all if you're jumping out of work early no rain to worry about will take a look at the interactive radar coming up which you know what some call temperatures are finally coming our way\nBut first start job story it's still not safe to return FEMA's administrators saying today about much Florida's panhandle have this type of destruction there's gas lines that are there there's power lines that are down as they\nContinue search and rescue operations all across the southeast and they're working with telecommunications companies to get the infrastructure back in place get power back on at least a Lebanese debts have been confirmed today because of hurricane\nOoh mhm\nYep yep you're right that is that's a lot that's a lot [noise] so are\nThey needed to desperately go and that's a huge win and this is why McConnell is really good at navigating the Senate he knows all the parliamentary rules he knows everything\nAnd\nHe was well he said he was willing to hold senators in Washington through Christmas remember that\nAnd he said he do it again oh my heavens so that is hugely significant and this is what was happening as everyone was screaming over cognac\n...\nYeah awesome just saying I'm just saying so this\nSo you have a twelve lifetime circuit court judges Twenty one other executive nominees this is huge\nAnd ... similar some activists are mad because Democrats didn't fight enough\nAnd a\nWarrant goes well I oppose the deal but she went ahead and did it because she wanted to go back and you know they're just they're willing to sell you all out for her to be able to get back home I mean let's let's be real that's what this was they wanted to sell everybody out so they could go home\nSo that's good news right all of those I mean those are lifetime appointments wasn't that didn't you hear that by the way with with\nUm Kevin ... it's a lifetime appointment\nOkay so Seth thanks guys are on the scene of a\nFist teen of them now as we switch over to Saudi Arabia because this story is\nReally this is really insane uh and I I see this really awful media spin on this to a which is unfortunate but you know uh\nThe situation with this is that a reporter who uh\nWas he had been critical previously of the new roller the new leadership and Saudi Arabia\nAnd had written a a ... a bunch of uh Jamal attest Augie had written things about the crown prince of Saudi crown prince and he was a legal resident of the United states have lived in both ... and in London and so he was in Turkey\nAnd he was apparently visiting the Saudi uh the uh embassy or they're constantly there he was visiting the consulate an inch assemble and then he just disappeared\nOff base of the earth day just disappear and\nTurkish authorities say well he was murdered and they said they had recordings proving that he was murdered and there were some pretty gruesome rumors going around about how and they were blaming some Saudis that had entered turkey\nNot long before a democracy soggy disappeared and then they left and they think you know the Saudis say no it's not us we didn't do it so it's kind of going back and forth and\nSo this is the ... because this now could affect two different alliances actually three different alliances the U.S Saudi Arabian alliance the Turkish Saudi Arabia alliance and the United states in Turkish alliance\nWhich you know I don't I have my complaints about art on particularly when he beat protestors so [noise] but ... the fact that this guy was a legal\nResident of the United states changes things\nAnd he apparently like the only thing that he did that would have invoked the Saudi crown princes\nThat is to have written about him in a negative light and so the Turkish officials said this is why he disappeared\nAnd so there you go so you have there are some senators that want a an investigation and in fact we have some audio here because had an hour it was was asked about this\nDuring a a press conference and they don't really know a whole lot more than what you were reading in the press apparently and it's you know do you believe the Saudis do you believe turkey um and this is Heather Nauert was the is the state department spokesman on this uh this is when she was asked about\nTwenty Seventeen\nThen earlier this week or the vice president has talked about that the president has talked about this we are all concerned about his whereabouts we don't have any information on his whereabouts right now for what happened to him\nAs you can see anytime you turn on the news you open the newspaper there is a lot of speculation and there are a ton of rumors out there we're making determinations and watching the fur facts we don't have the facts yet and so we're going to hold back on our comments until we have\nConcrete information that the U.S government can share\nWell which is and that's true so now there are some senators and it's a bipartisan group they want the Saudis sanctioned and because they believe that they are complicit in his disappearance Rand Paul wants to stop arms sales and military assistance to Saudi Arabia\nUm and in fact over at Brookings they noted that the royal Saudi air force is entirely dependent upon on American and British support for air fleet of our fifteenth Apache isn't tornado aircraft pieces of either Washington or London halted the flow of logistics the the royal ... Saudi air force it'd be grounded\n[noise] and then\nYou also have to take into consideration how Iran would benefit from this because it hasn't been one of the things and I think this is a really good point to make 'em that that Matthew Continetti over a Free Beacon noted and I hadn't thought about this previously but it said look what Iran it you know they haven't really been brought up in relation to trauma democracy Augie but\nIt's a factor because they are pressing up against the Saudis on multiple fronts they fostered share rebellion with the kingdom itself and in Bahrain\nThey've armed into bed who ... who have been going back and forth with the Saudis are and they're ... its proxies actually are on the cusp of victory in Syria basically control in Lebanon and they've shown chaos in Iraq Iran's European allies are attempting to create a financial lifeline that would provide relief from us sanctions\nAnd Saudi Arabia has been the lynchpin of America's Middle East strategy for close to a century\nBut that relationship has not been without costs Continetti note what would it cost the if the alliance fractured the Saudis would be imperiled in Yemen potentially endangering the free flow of traffic and the Gulf of Aden Iranian victory would extend a Shia crescent to the south and accompany the one running through Iraq and Syria and Lebanon\nShow\nTrump said that Saudi Arabia would last two weeks without American Sport\n\nAnd it says it and and Continetti notes the middle east and live on our already filled with examples of state failure is America prepared to risk another Saturday melt down would deprive the United states of a counter terror ally it would royal energy markets and create pockets of instability in which the hottest an Iranian backed militias thrive\nAnd it would also make of that for Israel to show they say to forestall such a disaster the Saudis like others before the my turn to Russia or China for support\nThat then would accelerate the waning of American influence in the middle east and boost the very autocracies we condemn\nSo\nYou have to weigh evidence and consider how you would punish them if it turns out they acted like Russia or China or North Korea or Syria or Iraq or Iran this is it's not as cut and dry\nThe new ones but nuances dead so for a lot of people as black or white\nOne or the other one or two air be\nBut there are there's a lot to consider I'm not saying that it ... what ... isn't happening as an awful but for those who are staying wallet are through this you need to realize what happens\nIf you do a B or C and choose your own adventure\nThere's the different ... there is a different result and consequences for each choice\nAnd the same as with is\nGot to get going because we've got a more in store a we have coming up quick five you don't want to miss it that some good headlines for your car shield is a program well it's a it's a extended vehicle service protection is what it is and um you don't want to get hit by an unexpected repair bill\nWhen you have extended vehicle protection from car she'll you don't have to worry about unexpected surprise us because they will they'll help you out nothing simple or really inexpensive about today's car repairs car she'll makes the process of fixing your car for recovered repair easy you can take it to your favorite mechanic or the dealership to do the work\nYou get twenty four seven roadside assistance in a rental car while yours is being fixed\nAnd if your car is five thousand to a hundred and fifty thousand miles doesn't mean you have to pay higher repair bills car shields administrators have paid out close to two billion in claims and they're ready to help you save yourself thousands and future car repairs and get covered by the ultimate and extended vehicle protection called eight hundred car sixty one hundred mentioned ... or visit car she'll dot com used ... to save ten percent\nCar she'll dot com ... eight hundred car sixty one hundred mentioned ... deductible may apply [noise]\nThree three ...
