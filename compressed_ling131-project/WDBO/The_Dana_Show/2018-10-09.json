oh they're investigating her flight from a citizens for responsibility and ethics in Washington crew which is an organization that investigates only Republicans and they ignore the lower grades his actions by Democrats I'd be really fair I think in that description\nThey wanted to look at a they requested the state department's I look at the flight that she acknowledged already in her twenties Seventeen um\nFinancial disclosure report it was that there were seven flights between New York DC\nAnd South Carolina and they say they're worth tens of thousands of dollars this crew group and they want to know whether um they're basically they want an investigation into it but that's nothing so that's not really that's not a thing either um she's not going to challenge the president\nUm grand see the ... with their previous speculation as to whether or not grand would end up taking Sessions is spot if sessions leaves after Mitt terms and grand steps into his\nSeat and she could take a grand state granted that has always said that he'd have it has no interest in that he doesn't want to be a ... and to me it seems as though the ... the more obvious thing is that she was you know she's got a kid is\nShe wants to spend time with her kids and she also wants a little bit of a break because she's going pretty hard at it for for quite some time and so\nThat and and the way that the president by the way I'm ... ... when he\nSpoke of her at the press conference that they had just a little bit earlier I mean he was a few sit with his praise he said glowing things about her it it sounded as though that it was something that\nHad been I think plan for some time which would go into what I've been hearing that only like a tiny group of people including the president were aware but it definitely wasn't any kind of bad partying at all whatsoever\nSo I think you know maybe it's an all comes razor still sort of thing I mean she she\nLeaves you with a reputation that has been improved she left on her own terms she has maintained a great relationship with the president so I think maybe my ... and it could be\nYou know maybe she is taking a break right now spending some time with her kids because she knows she'll be campaigning for ... coming up and then maybe twenty twenty four maybe she's gearing up and just taking some time right now before\nShe runs the nose or we're gonna I'm gonna ask Stephen ... it's about this coming up later on in the program he worked in the Bush White House and I'm I'm I'm\nI'm curious to see\nHow a I'm curious to see his reaction to this so that's a that's ... that's the top story she would have to primary ... oh my gosh this is really where we're going [noise] so she resigned yesterday did you guys\nThat's the official swearing in of a justice Kavanaugh did you guys the the swearing in of justice Kavanaugh\nJustice capital to see that I watched it had a beer oh did you I went to an October fest and had a beer I had a beer for Brett I'm Sorry justice Brett justice Mr justice Brett Kavanaugh I Know I'm not going to stop saying it I have um\nFirst off I'm sure that you also the protesters right everybody saw the everybody saw the footage of the protesters people or yeah imagine what they're going to do for the next\nAppointment just saying if President Trump were to get another appointment I [noise]\nI don't want to say that there would be violence on the part of the last I really hope that they grow up a little bit and that some of their elders and butter kind of take a hold of the rain because these people are crazy just some of the protests that I've seen\nAre pretty amazing Corey Booker was out there saying that they they're looking they want to impeach cabinet and I thought are you working secretly with Republicans\nSeriously I'm just real question are you\nWorking with them because it seems like it seems like that that if\nIf you're trying to work with Republican Party and increased voter turnout\nAll day and that's the way to do it oh my word get everybody to think that if Democrats take control of the White House that you're going to impeach the guy that they all that was like one of the top reasons that people voted for drunk oh man that's just the not the way to do it\nSo all the protests we had the uh really awesome ceremony yesterday the president when he and I ...\nI have a bear with me I got a lot of things up here when the president\nWhen he uh when he actually uh when he spoke and was just and was was discussing a having a he apologized he said you what your family has gone through\nAnd he apologized for a campaign of political and personal destruction which is true\nUm that's absolutely true\nAh audio soundbite tennis is what some of the president's actually you know what let's I have a couple of soundbite let's start with ten because this was when he was a a actually sixteen I'm changing it I'm Sorry this place because this is this is that exact quote this is when the president apologized and before he introduced him for his remarks listen\nI Would like to begin to nudge proceeding differently than perhaps than any other event of such magnitude on behalf of our nation I Want to apologize to ...\n... family for the terrible pain and suffering you have been forced to endure [noise] those who step forward to serve our country deserves a fair and dignified evaluation\n... and he's true\nIf he's in his remarks are true uses it he's absolutely he's absolutely right and it was by the way Hillary Clinton responded to that she was livid\nOoh speaking of which I just saw this flyby represents a there she and bill are going on tour live nation actually tweeted a like a a little bit ago they're headlining an arena tour I don't know if it's me too movement but it is somewhat funny [noise]\nBut she criticized the swearing in ceremony she said what was done was a political rally that's what she said she was ... she said what was done was a political rally and she had said that I you know I don't and I have the audio hair she said that it was a political rally\nAnd its undermined the image and integrity of the court it saddens me uh she I mean she was saying she didn't she didn't think that he should have been a ... I guess that he should have a policy I don't think that Trump should have had to apologize I think that's then it's the the Democrats in the Senate should have had to apologize\nTo be quite honest they were the ones that that ran him through that they were the ones that did it audio soundbite Fifteen Trump again hit on you know you were you were he says you are proven innocent a lot of people went after this remark listen\nAnd with that I must say that you should\nGo under historic scrutiny were proven innocent thank you [noise]\n... yeah\nThis I don't know if he was he was never he was accused but he was never proven guilty I\nDon't know if you can even be proven innocent if you were never proven guilty that's the only thing I Would take it that I Would ... I don't have I mean he wasn't wrong he was saying that he was innocent and but I don't think that because he was never proven guilty\nSo many times I hear well this was a job interview and it's not a trial and that's what Democrats say\nSo that they can they don't have to meet the high bar of proving the baseless marrying accusations that the law but individuals whenever they opposed their their ideology or whenever they just oppose them even if they're nominated by someone who's ideological status they oppose\nAnd that's what was obviously what was happening with the cabinet situation but for them to say well it wasn't a trial\nThere they're what they're saying as we can say whatever the hell we want we can we are him as being a pedophile or however a gang rape is it cetera and we don't have to prove anything because it's not a trial\nWell if it's not a trial and he refused to bring forth any evidence bye Felicia now he's justice Brett Kavanaugh see that didn't really work out in their favor did it as smuggling smarmy as they said it\nSo now he's justice Cavanaugh I'm I have some of his excerpts from his remarks last night because they were great uh and coming up John mayor wants to create a new mail contract regarding masculinity I have your pop culture round up including\nTaylor Swift finally vows to the mob and speak out on politics she said that she's a feminist and she can't she doesn't want to support Marsha Blackburn but yet still support the guy\nWho actually was against a who actually as it is against the gay marriage and also supported Kavanaugh so I don't understand what her point is there will discuss all of that as well uh I watch us the over the weekend and I cannot believe what I thought we have to touch on that because dude and some people are getting some things right by the way\nAbout I'm a ... they're getting it completely wrong as to who started what so we're going to revisit that 'cause I was\nHeated I was up on Twitter and I had these

point and I want to play I I I mean we're going to talk more about this but I\nHave all this stuff I got a lot of ... um to this point yeah me the the other idea where she was saying you can't be civil\nWith people she um which is interesting she was asked about um the Kavanaugh\nEt cetera et cetera this has hurt literally telling people to stop being civil to one another listen to listen to what she says here\nYou cannot be civil with a political party that wants to\nDestroy what you stand for what you care about that's why I Believe if we are fortunate enough to win back\nThe house and or the Senate that's when civility can start again and so then the only okay oh I'm gonna come\nBack to that later I Am I'm Amazed at that because she's essentially saying you don't have to be civil to people because of a straw man and that's what she's doing here the simple existence of disagreement with her platform\nIs considered destroying that's how they that's how they exaggerate it\nThese individual people like Hillary Clinton and this is why you saw the Portland stuff which we're going to get into and of course the crazy protest over a cabin on the stuff that was taking place last night even\nIndividuals believe that when our system is utilized in the manner in which it should be by individuals who simply have greater numbers that that somehow you're destroying everything in which I Believe you're doing your it said et cetera et cetera et cetera\nCan we ask more from all of our lawmakers and the stupid red meat crap what does that\nMean when she says you're destroying every they're destroying everything that you know you believe in what can you define that please how what what is it that you believe in and how are people destroying it\nSimple answer how in the world are people destroying what you believe in you she believes in abortion the last I checked it legal and it gets ridiculous\nAnd I think the fact that it's taxpayer funded I think that no one should have to be forced to buy taxation as fast and then people are stealing\nDollars to go and subsidize an organization that spends money against a for a political party and what you do not support so we are forced a under penalty of jail to pay the Democrat Party to continue campaigning let's just be real that Planned Parenthood the middleman 'cause they get federal dollars\nSo our federal dollars the I owe those flavors and I choose to be healthy as hail over that you're damn right I Do\nAnd I think they should I think that I think it should stop and I don't think anybody should personally I think it's a joke as long as we're forced to fund things with which we disagree I could go on for three hours about that\nBut I digress see that that to me it's more of a step of destroying something in which I Believe because I'm being forced to subsidize it I don't force you to buy my animal although I think as long as we're paying for people to abort their babies as a form of birth control than you should purchased Lana [noise]\nUh but what does she when she says\nWell the the things in which they believe are being utterly destroyed\nAnd what manner and what manner how how is anything she believes in being destroyed so she didn't lose so her dream of being president\nAnd having just because simply Americans didn't want her ... party didn't want her which was why she had to cheat new superdelegates in order to steal the nomination from Bernie Sanders her own party didn't want her\nSo why I'm you know just how I just think that stupid to say\nAnd it really\nExaggerate is it the right word it's hyperbole of the worst kind she simply say that the existence of another opinion is threatening to her she finds that threatening the existence of a different belief she finds that threatening\nWell I'm not sure I'm comfortable with anyone like that in elected office because the United states has made up of a multitude of different beliefs and thoughts\nAnd in order to dehumanize your opposition you wrongfully pass them as people who are oppressing you and destroying your the things and what you believe in simply because they win elections and they exist\n...\nAnyway we got a lot more to get into including oh wait the protests in Portland I don't know how people live in Portland proper and I work as a beautiful state said gosh this is

everything else scratching it up everything and the guy actually stopped his car to look at what what did they did on my car and he was an elderly like el legit elderly do and he gets out of his little car and he's trying to look at what's happening and these stupid dogs run down the street and attacking\nAttacking insane\nThey did three thousand dollars worth of damage to one one car um they ah they were threatening to assault other passengers they it I mean it was awful absolutely awful\nAnd there was in the video you can see some of the police as they're hitting cars and screening how they're going to beat the blank out of out of these motorists a ...\nThere was some all I saw a couple of officers in the background that were there just watching\n\nI I've never seen anything like this one the habit I mean to where you know you have police that dinner in the background I'm watching the video but right now I Can't play any of this for you because literally every other word is ... and you know et cetera et cetera but I'm watching this and I can't even believe what I'm seeing\n'em that I mean they are it's just bad it's just so bad\nWhy I mean and and you can see the officers there and I have them if all this up because I I just I um was rather shocked I couldn't believe that then they said that uh the officers\nWorld there they were trying to do um they were trying to make sure that they they didn't um they didn't uh infringe or or get in a way of these protesters and their First Amendment rights well what about the rights of these people who live in Portland just to get to their destinations\nWithout having without being assaulted her having their cars beaten up what\nAbout that\nI I mean I just I don't care what you were protesting for that crap is ridiculous you immediately will you immediately undermine everything you stand for by the hating like that absolutely everything you stand for\nTell me how you're going to sit here in protest injustice while you attack an elderly man simply because he's trying to get safely to point a to point B or how you beat up another person's car causing three thousand dollars worth of damage\nThere was a woman who was driving through and again the big fat tasty white dude who was calling everyone else Whitey\nSeriously the guy was pale as as just literally assaulting cracker he was so pale I thought it was a ghost in June ... genes\nIn short he had the big baggy shorts and the chain wallet like he lost his dog and and what he was screaming at this woman I keep it in and they were all yelling like I'll be ...\nTo the one who is just like he just wanted to get to where she\nTo go oh nobody was the antagonizing are provoking these these dogs they just they they're already provoke because they just they just want to go out there and that's hard\n\nI mean and they were rude I couldn't even believe that this was allowed could not even believe that this was a loud and there's some people were saying well Ted you know the mayor out there um whereas ... who runs the city\nWho runs the city I was never\nA it was awful and so I you know I don't know I we've been to Portland before what'd you think\nThe people in that were really cool if it were amazing there's some there's some good a great time very resentful there though often but they were cool that when we met we are cool but just like California there are ... and not have taken kindly to somebody telling me know\nCan you imagine if that happened we were there because we were driving downtown in Portland and can you imagine because if it was it rich that was Dr ... he would have ... I wouldn't have let him turn either yeah I think he would have just kept going\nYeah he just slowly go because that's not illegal\nIt's my right of a ... that's my ride of a\n... for them to be in the street without a permit like the un blocking traffic that is\nAnd I would have filed charges and then I Would have tied them up in la fair until they all had to sell everything that they had in order to continue to fund their fight the ... people need to be pressing charges against this stuff one day they're going to mess with the wrong person and they will take them to court and they will bankrupt them\nDo you measure that old man was armed and he was being chased by this\nGroup had every right you would have had every right to be able to they went out and they put hands on him\nThat's what I think they need to start thinking about in regards to their quote unquote civil protests\nYeah now I your coach now I just I I just I was just crazy just craziness just craziness\nSo I I just that made me so mad I was just watching all of that stuff people have tried to do that in some cities like in St Louis they try but then they they get them off the highway\nI you know I don't know I don't know if law enforcement refusing to get involved\nIf that was one if if it was an instance of like how in Baltimore nobody wants to do anything anymore because they're always afraid that they're going to get called up for doing something and then they'll have to go to court so I don't know if it was one of those situations or what\nIt comes from the top but comes from the top we knew what the Baltimore mayor was all about\nWell yeah you got to give them a safe space but you know what I mean like afterwards police didn't want to engage they would rather just respond as a as opposed to just you know what I mean because they ... everything that they do a second guest even it even know it was a predominantly black law enforcement demo mean predominantly black officers everything that they do\nIs is just\nWrong before it's interpreted correctly yeah and so they don't they don't want to police basically they just they will react and there have been studies on this and who would blame them and I don't know what we saw in Portland with some of these do just standing in these officers standing to decide if that was you know one of those one of those instances\nBut I um\nThis is the Republicans don't have to work to cast anybody's anything like that Washington Post these they\nDon't have to because the left does it themselves so I wanted to pull this uh this is a story I Want remember Sheila Jackson Lee that guy uh the unpaid they were trying to say hey this guy was an unpaid intern\nRemember there's the staffer who worked for Dianne Feinstein and um his ah Jackson Cosco he was doc seen putting private phone numbers of the wives of senators and everybody else I'm he was actually even going to uh put the medical records of their children on line yeah well\nHe wasn't just an unpaid staffer he was actually a fellow and he was paid he was paid by an outside institution according to a couple of different reporters and they're trying to figure out what outside institution paid him but he was paid he was a paid staff or for Sheila Jackson Lee and\nBy the way I've never seen anyone actually I'm no Democrat has denounced any of that by the none of them not a single one\nNot a single one meanwhile I look at\nAll of the the the violence like how we we had here this this a Democrat staffer paid staff or for Democrats\nUh was posting private information even ... about the wives of the senators spouses of senators their children young children or they were going to uh he just got Cosco was going to publish a their Children's Medical records as well\nAnd and one wanted to encourage violent you have people you have Hillary Clinton saying telling people\nWe played that audio you can't be civil to people anymore you\nMaxine Waters saying go and find and make them uncomfortable I've been seeing this in a number of different places there are other actual elected officials that are doing the same you know the kinds of essentially saying the same thing go and find and you got to make them feel uncomfortable et cetera et cetera um\nBut I\nI don't really blame for instance\nRand Paul's wife she gave an interview recently\nKelly Paul where she says she feels frightened because the Democrats had been so hostile remember it was a Democrat\nWho first tried to kill her husband at the congressional ball field and it was a Democrat who attacked him in his yard and tried to kill him up put him in the hospital with life threatening injuries and she says I sleep with a loaded gun by my bed and we have three dead both on every door\nThey had to upgrade their ... and I say Democrat because it's accurate\nBecause there is a political ideology that has gotten so hostile it's accurate check yourself\nThirty six point five ... do you deal with waste any

replacing a conservative with a conservative this was a kind of a more moderate than they're replaced him with the conservative\nThe next appointment or will be insane but this failed horribly for Democrats Democrats have not yet realized that what\nSyria\nIs completely antithetical to the way that the rest of America operates and the way that the rest of America talks to each other and the things in which they believe\n\nAnd all of these people all around the country I was looking at independence I was looking at some polling data on how independence thought this was handled and they thought Democrats handled horribly I mean by pretty huge margin\nThey they always they always do the self ... this to themselves every single time\nAnd you know something else I thought of this and I'm going to tie these two things together I thought of this one I saw a Marine Le pen over in France [noise] she was saying that she she distance herself from Steve Bannon the ban and spin he's decided I guess that he can't get any more work in the United states that he's\nDecided I led by the way I Will about who nobody\nWhen it comes to criticism a ban and I'm like everyone else I actually know him and I've known him for years and I worked with him so everyone else can learn from me as opposed to me learning from anybody else on that\n[noise] um\nBut he's been over in Europe trying to get I guess some work or something and I try to act like he is I guess\nHe he uh wanted to create this Brussels based foundation called the movement and uh apparently he was slammed by Marine Le pen who I guess is trying to get into good graces of and I I ... I wanted to go back to something that I heard Chris star well he'd made a brief remark\nAbout it uh\nBecause well everybody has had disagreements obviously I Know I have had disagreements with Mitch McConnell and Lindsey Graham\n\nI think it was Mitch McConnell's understanding of the some of the parliamentary\nProcedures of the Senate that helped with this and grams as well but if Steve Bannon had his way the biggest defenders\nOf um a\nJustice Kavanaugh would\nNot have been there to shepherd this through\nThey would not have been there if if Bannon who is completely politically tone deaf would have had his way they would not have grand wouldn't have been there McConnell wouldn't have been there a number\nOf these cats wouldn't be there to shepherd this nominee through to a final confirmation\nSo again probably why he's now trying to convince people of his political ac human in Europe because everyone here in the United states knows\nBetter so remember that\nThink also by the way and looking at the right has been United and all of this\nAnd that's one thing that the left did not count on the right has been United and us\nUm\nAnd every faction working to gather everybody from the Bush is the Bush Republicans to you know the the\nThe Trump supporters to the independents even the never Trump all of that everybody worked together I think\nThat this is a final finally let a vacation of the right in this and that's something that the less did not count on they did not count on they were ... it just which is\nI'm a I'm interested in seeing how long these alliances last how long the unity last hopefully it'll go past\nMidterms but it is a\nI had been fat has been really interesting to watch uh all these individuals come together just to accomplish the the school\nSo coming up we have Steven and someone asked him about Nikki Haley maybe perhaps what's next we also HAVE QUICK five and a a bunch of other stuff still to touch on our good friends over at Cal Tech and cocoa Florida they make some really\nCool stuff they ah whether it's the already be the already be as their top line they have the already be asked for survival it's basically for whatever Mother Nature dishes out it shorter and more compact for easier carrying in rugged terrain had penned a downward case of Jackson adjustable stock the best factory ballpark trigger out they're\nPerfect for people who just want to run out in the wilderness it's just it's it's a fun it's a fun firearm\nA war they also have the new dish a new addition to the cash gee line to catch the twenty five the longest Cal Tech stock and barrel at ... magazines thirty eight inches overlook overall in length of short of the most twelve gauge as\nA and it has the same pat did kill takedown Rochelle objection empty shells out of your line of sight it's true it's ... it's ... it's an extra shock on and it has not ... vertical grip send a ...\nA vertical grew up in the ... which is called check 'em out till type weapon dot com K.
