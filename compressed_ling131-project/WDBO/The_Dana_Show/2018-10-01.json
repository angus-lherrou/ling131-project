Orlando and the newly expanded colonial ace hardware in coy town shopping center\nHe gave cover to the Murkowski Collins is who Murkowski in college apparently were wavering but if they ... they didn't have the bottom line is that they didn't have\nI don't think that they had the votes unless they made some sort of arrangement like that because the vote friday was to just move Kavanaugh from committee and then get him to the force that they could open debate and so he we were successful in that he was moved from the committee so that's a huge success no matter how you want to paint that he was moved from the committee so there is going to be a debate on the nomination there's just no doubt about it\nThat was the big hurdle to get it out of committee and\nAnd saying that he would go for a limited to one week FBI investigation you or you could look at it as the flight compromised\nOr you could look at it as though he made a move that is going to give cover to the Joe mansions and the Joe Donnelly because remember I had some pretty harsh words on friday for Joe Donnelly because Joe Donnelly was saying I just don't know if I can go and and support Kavanaugh cetera et cetera which\nIs ... was completely opposite to what I was hearing from voters in my WABC market\nAnd everybody all over Indiana voters are pretty upset about it because that's a state that Trump took ... you know heavily\nSo he ... in that\nKind of now donnelley's back on the fence he's waiting to see what the investigation turns out before you consider the nomination so they may get Joe Donnelly to support them they may get him to support cab and I was the nominee a Joe Manchin has signaled that he would be supportive of that Heidi Heitkamp has signaled she would be supportive of it so you're stripping away\nSome of these more moderate Democrat into supporting the nominee which could be it depends on how colored your perspective is if you remove emotion from it and you just look at it as a way of strategy what it does is it is it shut them up and it and I'm going to argue just do it it shut them up and it opens it up to\nTheir true argument because they're already moving goalpost me ... let me open us up for you to Chris Murphy tweet a guest of course there should be an FBI investigation but whatever they find does it change the fact that cabinet especially after his performance as the most dangerous Supreme Court pick of our lifetimes\nHe doesn't matter it was never about one week that was just a bunch of hogwash it was never about one week that was such a lie it was never\nEver ever about one week ever\n... this it was never about that this was all about just stopping him period it doesn't ever about a week\nAnd then you have this piece in Politico this was a real headline I'm about to share with you in terms of moving goalpost now they say quote why the FBI should investigate both thing\nIt's a real you don't believe me I'll put it in flat so you can see what I'm Talking about I Swear to you\nSwear to you it's a real say look that look at it it's a real headline I had a I had to convince cane that there was a real thing because that's how stupid at us [noise] yeah\nIt was never about one week so again I'm telling you there's two ways that you can look at this at the at the at the Jeff Flake thing now this is the one way I'm going to tell you the second way to look at it here in a minute the first week of look at it is he's giving cover to these moderate Democrats\nCamp Donnelly mansion and mansion has already signaled that he would be interested in supporting Kavanaugh\nGives cover to the Murkowski than the columnist who come from kind of purple districts anyway it gives them cover to support this nominee and just you know bulldoze over opposition on the floor when it comes time to open debate for the nomination right\nSo that's one way to look at it and at the same time it also shows that it was never about the FBI investigation and it was never about one week\nSo you could look at it that way or you could look at it the other way\nWhat changes\nWhat changes what is it what is the seventh FBI investigation going to find that the six previous ones didn't what does another FBI investigation gonna find particularly after he was nominated to the federal court years ago what is the seventh one gonna find\nI mean it it is even deflate for tiring he can he's just worried about his legacy what is what is it ... what do they know there was going to find\nThat the other big question here's the thing\nI don't think that this is a you could do you think that Jeff Flake was is it is a total compromise run that he screwed over the GOP also this is the second way to look at it\nBecause this whole entire thing priest opposes that Democrats are in any way acting in good faith this whole thing another week of investigations priest opposes that they're approaching it from a a fixed point of good faith\nDoes it seem after watching the last week unfold two weeks of old that anything these people dont have done it in any way indicative of good faith with holding a name withholding that an accusation instead of if it was so serious why did they sit on it for six weeks\nIf you're acting in good faith do you sit on a serious allegation for six weeks almost two months do you keep it from your colleagues\n\nDo you do not refer it to the FBI for an actual investigation or when you finally do send it over because you're you're staffers are bickering do reject enough portions of the letter that it's completely irrelevant including the name\nAnd a number of of of significant pieces of information is that is that do you think that that's acting a good faith\nDo you think that it's acting in good faith that for two weeks people sit here and go but we need to have another FBI investigation we need to have the FBI look into this and then now that the FBI looks into this they're\nSaying well they're they're not going to have to find anything in one week so wait a minute it was important enough for you to say that you want to be a better look into it but now you're down in the FBI's ability to actually look into it\nDoes that sound like it's in good faith you any of it because the none of that stuff it sounds like it's in good faith to me\nAll of this it was serious and not only to bring it up now was it serious enough to report it to the authorities when you've got the accusations it wasn't serious enough to bring up back in two thousand and six when he was first nominated to be a federal judge\nIs that it because that's not in good faith none of that is in good faith do you think it's in good faith to leak it to the media because it doesn't sound like\nLeaving it to the media is acting in good faith so that's the other way to look at it you can look at it like flick compromised to a bunch of people who have no interest in acting in good faith that'll whatsoever\nSo these are the two ways that you look at it I actually think it's a bit of both I think that they both can be true and maybe not equal parts but I think that they both can be true I think both of these things can coexist and both be the answer\nThat is um\nThat I and I think that's the situation here\n\nBut the ... and just this is this week we're going to probably hear even now everyone's focusing on the drinking which we are going to talk about a moment the goalpost are moving\nNow it's well you know really can't be because the investigation is only supposed to be limited to what is public and it's not supposed to last any more than one week Rosenstein apparently told flick that it's going to completely the costs are going to get it done within a week\nOf course they will I had a question to that I had asked\nEarlier and I haven't gotten a good enough to answer to it um I was I was curious as to whether or not um I was curious as to whether or not Dr Ford is going to release to the FBI her therapists notes that she has refused to release to the Senate Judiciary committee\nBecause see this is what's happened when the FBI investigate this isn't a criminal this is just back another background check if they\nFind anything guess who they refer it to the Senate Judiciary committee\nSo why would you not share therapists notes which is the key part of what you claim is your ... the cooperation of your story to the Senate Judiciary committee how would that how can you have a full investigation when the ... year therapists knows where you say you first told you first mentioned Brett Kavanaugh\nFrom back in ... well when you won't make those public when you won't make them available to the individuals that are investigating the situation and come into a determination based on the available evidence\nI don't know how do you hope to have a fair and and real investigation when you're withholding pertinent evidence\nI don't I think there's I think the investigation is a sham until she gives up or therapists notes and the questions to the polygraph\nIf it if they were in good faith interested in a real investigation those things would have been made available to the Senate Judiciary committee immediately\nFirst and foremost the whole damn accusation would have been set on for two months all of that would have been available to the Senate Judiciary committee and the fact that it was it makes me question any good faith effort from this party and it undermines any credibility that anybody may have\n\nAnd that is not the fault of the Republicans it is not the fault of Grassley it is not the fault of of of of Lindsey Graham it is not the fault of Brett Kavanaugh it's not the fault of anyone in terms of how that was handled\nSo I think it's a bit of both was a lot of not good faith movements and then we have\nThe Mitchell memo believe all women except Rachel Mitchell were going to discuss that because Rachel Mitchell doubles down and says there's not enough evidence there even go to court with that there's not enough evidence there to substantiate even an investigation\nWe're going to talk about that as well coming up and can you expect\nTo James

pretty good will take a look at the interactive radar coming up first started top story we're breaking news this hour\nThe suspect to city at a gun is dead after the police standoff with her window regional medical center this morning news is that where he's been identified as thirty three year old Brian Baker who apparently made aggressive movement stores officers this morning\nAgo about it that we needed to prove the Republicans and Democrats can get along that ah I'm literally ... myself on a deserted island in the middle of the Pacific with Martin Heinrich\nDemocrat Senator from New Mexico and we went with no food no water to survive for a week so we we managed to do so we got back here went around to talk about bipartisanship and how it's needed wide needed this was in twenty four team\nAnd a Steven Kobe or rent a clip on his show of us are trying to spear fish should start with these that\nJeff Flake and Martin Heinrich prove once and for all Republicans and Democrats can get along if death is the only option so for what it's worth we've been directly showing that uh the compromise and working together can work there is just far too little of it in the ...\nNow you you did not very publicly you did not support President Trump did not vote for him um\nWhat does it feel like right now to be somebody you know the Republicans aren't happy with do a lot of Democrats aren't happy with you I mean what does that feel like it'd be kind of the man without a country\nThat's what it feels like [laughter] it does I Know I I I could never warm to the president a\nLong before he ran he talked about a President Obama not being a citizen I thought that itself is disqualified\nUh view cannot do that and then talked about John McCain in a derogatory way and then talked about a Mexicans in a derogatory way that I just think that we've got to do better than that we uh\nWe can't referred to our opponents political opponents on the other side of the aisle as losers and clowns we have two big issues to solve in this country than to just be partisan all the time\nWell I don't think again I don't think anybody would disagree with you so the question as we're looking at audience people who are under thirty a they had the nothing but government dysfunction in most branches of government looking at them what could you tell them about why they should have any faith right now and US government\nWell I I think that young people have to engage when you look at some of the big things the issues we got to solve\nA Social Security health care is the thing that young people need to be concerned with\nBecause a Social Security maybe around for me but it certainly won't be around for you if we don't solve it\nSo it behooves all of you to be involved all that you can as a Republican I look out and say\nWe've got to broaden our appeal\nIn two thousand twelve after Mitt Romney lost the presidential election\nWe did what we call the autopsy of our party and its policy and determined that we had to appeal to a broader electorate and not just drill down on the base and uh unfortunately I Do not have been arguing W garbage yeah we've been driving down and drilling down on the base and that only takes you so far\nThat there are a lot of never Trump Republicans who actually are actively rooting for the Democrats take control of Congress are drawn to break the fever or the GOP what's your take on a\nBy I think that that is the case a there is a big concern among a lot of Republicans traditional Republicans who believe in limited government economic freedom free trade strong America American leadership and they see the policies that come out of the White House and say you know\nWhere's our party this is nuts and and they're looking for ... for\nA more decent politics for people to to get along and to compromise were needed stand for your principles yeah but understand that compromise is not a dirty word\nSo what's the future for the Republican Party what's the path\nI think the path forward is to return to that model\nWhere you saw a lot of it and we were\nMind it of it to in the past couple of weeks with John McCain's funeral and a two to share about how he and John Kerry they just talked about it [noise] ah worked on the Vietnam I'm In my time I've worked with Democrats to uh engaged with Cuba\nFixing the hey if we want to bring them closer to democracy we are to engage with them and show American values there instead of shun them so on a number of issues but on the really big issues we need to solve [noise]\nThey were the kind of even watching Senator Jeff flake of Arizona is the town that is very interesting well he clearly does not care [laughter]\nOh my goodness so oh well that is a look\nI I look at it like this\nHe wants a fair FBI look we had six of them I'm sure I I'm I'll be fascinated to see what a seventh can come up with that the sticks Pryor's did not um but the thing is is that Democrats are already trying to craft a move of the goalpost\nThey they've spent two weeks saying we FBI destination although we've had fixed background checks if you want to criminal investigation file a police report but their local pd where and the occurrence is alleged to have happened\nAnd you know when the uh here's the other the kicker if the FBI were to find something you know they do right they referred to the Senate Judiciary fraction\n... Senate Judiciary committee that's at work so\nI I they're moving the goalpost now trying to say that well it's because of drinking you know he was in you know with this and then they want sweat neck the crazy woman who her she's completely not credible Adel whatsoever and the first thing that you don't the first thing that you don't do if you're trying to be credible is go to the porn lawyer I have an idea and have him represent you\nBut so we were going to talk more about this are coming up because it is a ...

basically the argument was what are your prize more stability or liberty\nI think that's a false choice however\nAnd this and this particular situation I don't think it's so much an interest in it an issue of stability I think it's particularly as it relates to flake it's a ... an issue of truth or lie\nI think that's a that's a false comparison I don't think that it's and it's a false choice I don't think that it's it's an issue of civility versus liberty I think it's an issue of do you believe truth or do you believe wise because this is it comes down to you either believe what the evidence you go with the evidence goes you go where the truth goes or you just want to have a political witch hunt and you'll ... anything\nAh create anything I Choose anything as as as a way to make up for some sort of whatever you lack politically substantively\nAnd that's what this is\nThe oldest of civility and liberty can exist together truth and large don't you just know how it works but you can have civility and you can have liberty together that is absolutely possible but truth in laws are what oil and water don't mix\nIt said that the two women who apparently engaged with like in the elevator who confronted him were a part of the center for popular democracy which is a George Soros group I mean literally funded by George sources open society foundations which is what the Kurds\nCalled [noise] so it's not you know we're not saying like you know it's not a Chicken Little thing but I don't know if it was him so much as it was a Coons talking to him I kind of wonder if it was maybe perhaps ... was\nThat the media says the White House no has NO PLAN B if Kavanaugh sport I think I think it would be a bad strategy if they admitted that they had a plan B\nThen that would that the the media is not interested in whether there's a plan B the media wants to go do you believe enough of our claims to have a plan B because of plan B signifies what not a lack of confidence in the end they're processing and cabinet going for so I think it's incredibly smart but the media\nAnd shame them for not having a plan B I think we all should be shame for making accusations with no damn evidence but hey you know we don't live in a perfect world I guess can't wait to accuse your husband's and sons and brothers and uncles and fathers\nOne of the things I like about Trump is that he doesn't do that with military stuff or with anything he's strategic above your do\nYou mean he doesn't like give everybody everybody's ...\nHow did you know a large amount of why we were successful overseas with those relations but yeah I'm telling you this is what I liked about Trump not showing his hand because he doesn't have to have you shouldn't\nKnow I mean I should at all\nSo I I I think that and I'm going to tell you I Hope that Republicans don't I've heard some conservatives say we should move on you know what that down\nShame on you\nWhat's fair weather patriots like you we don't have the queen and our currency\nShame on you\nDefend your process and don't be a coward all these people bullet they love they love blood pumping at this and they love than all those red meat platitudes but\nWhen the going gets tough where they go\nMhm that makes me angry this um gosh can you imagine the next Supreme Court nomination [laughter] [laughter] oh my word\nI mean look at Ruth Bader Ginsburg what this could really happen in the next handful of years I'm not kidding\nAnd she doesn't get tired of everybody I think she's I think she'll stay in that seat\nJust to prevent all of this from happening again\nThe goal of the health care that the Democrats know about will be shoved in her a man\nDeeper living got I got lover I think well and I think she's very sensitive to the fact that it's become so polarized I mean remember she was a close friend of Antonin Scalia so\nShe showed that you know you can think different things and so we civil to each other and I loved you know the stories of her friendship ... um but ... and she and from what I understand and just some of the ... the statements of public statements that she has made a different events she is none too pleased with this and how this process has gone down\nUm but no of course everyone loves to try to ride as the notorious RPG but then when she said something that they really should listen to oh no then all of a sudden they just the ... they can what that's what that that's a sad about all of this\nBut um you know ultimately ultimately I think that\nWith all of this there is no evidence there is no reason why he should this shouldn't go forward\nAt all and the session opened without that seat being occupied now you always are you you're kind of have to wonder what some of these justices think they're a very very small club and while there were objections to Sotomayor into Kagan and others\nI've never seen it instead of my ... I thought we had the she was the most revolutionary and this is a woman\nWho was empathetic towards ... and she was definitely very much a far left progressive and you could have raised in pain or some things that she has said previously um and things that she has believe and the people with whom she has associated a and very very divisive and very very\nExclusionary and but Democrats focused but Republicans rather focused on the process\nAnd I just wish that Democrats have the same courtesy they keep wanting to sit here and scream about Merrick Garland but there's no basis to there's no substance to their protest stations over Garland there just simply is not and it was right before an election and by the way you know Democrats have done this before cetera et cetera it's just plain and if they're using that as the basis for\nProtesting this then that just shows you that it's actually not the interest of the country for which they profess to care it's just complete and total partisanship\nEvil can really wear a mask a virtue quite well and and so can just division can wear a mask a virtue incredibly well and and it's it's awful pettiness can wear the mask the virtue incredibly well\nBut you know I I just find it all it's all sad it's just so incredibly sad but\nWell we have we still have a lot of conversation yet to have about an animal coming up Senator Ted Cruz will join us as well uh and then we're going to get a we're going to get living on because they have a lot of other things to cover it in the meantime Purple Heart foundation a great organization that helps all\nVeterans not just those combat limited and they have a huge range of support and advocacy programs through their national service officer program they also offered grants and scholarships they provide care and support that our veterans need badly undeserved\nThey also a system and making sure that they get the benefits that they are oh through the VA the Purple Heart service foundation wouldn't be able to do any of this at that support from people like you\nOne sticking point for Canada was a nap to dispute resolution clause that allowed for trade dispute to be brought before an expert panel the Trump Administration to push to get rid of it but ultimately agreed to keep it mark ...

pleasure to have you thanks for your time today\nDay and it's great to be with you thanks thanks for what you're doing each and every day defending our liberties\nOf course well and we appreciate the words that you shared with the Senate Judiciary committee as well it was a very very tough\nFew days last week and I have to ask you about your colleagues Senator Jeff flake because he said his decision to call last week for an FBI investigation he intimated that it was done out of a higher moral duty and do you do you believe him how how do you feel about about his call for an investigation and to that point is the FBI capable of a fair probe\n[noise] well I'm not going to second guess his motivations I'd yeah I'd like our objective needs to be to move this ... this nomination mood expeditiously and and and and confirmed judge Kavanaugh and I think we're at doing that uh and that Jeff said for for him to go forward that he wanted the FBI\nOr to conduct background investigation into these allegations that that that is happening now and and and uh we we\nRequested that the FBI complete that investigations ... in in no longer than a week and so on friday we asked them to get get the results are no later than this coming friday there they're engaged in that investigation now I think we will get results I think\nEveryone expects the results\nOught to be very similar to what what what we found that the euro uh I I think it was right\nOr that that that we gave doctor for that she had a full fair opportunity to tell her story I think it was also right that judge Kavanaugh had a full and fair opportunity to defend themselves and and and at the end of the day\nI voted yes confirmed judge Kavanaugh because when you have conflicting testimony from the both of them uh to to resolve that conflict you look to other corroborating it than all of the corroborating evidence in this case\nA conflicts with the allegation that and and so we'll wait or the FBI a background investigation but but I think the expectation or above senators is that is that it will be a very similar to the testimony we've heard already\nDo you think that there's any chance this goes beyond one week\nIt depends what\nSaying that that the FBI or investigation obviously it if if if that investigation uncovered a uncovers thing that er or concerning that that that could delay matters a but assuming the FBI reports are consistent with the sworn testimony you know the ... witnesses the doctor for it identified\nA she named ... potential back witnesses all three of them\nGave statements to the Senate Judiciary committee under penalty of perjury under penalty of five years in prison if they were lying\nAnd every one of the fact witnesses to share that with a disputed her story including
