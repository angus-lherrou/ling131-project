I Believe\nAnd you know overall they look at it and and it adds up to a nice number for retirement and they feel pretty good about where they're sitting but now they've got to take income where do you pull the money out of and financial planning and tax planning an estate planning can shown that\nSo literally for anybody who's listening this is what we do week after week after week when people come in and they sit down with us so if you're listening right now and you have concerns about your current financial planner you have some concerns about you know hey I Am I taking distributions from my ... am I getting it from the right place\nGive us a call we can sit down with you and we'll put together you know a truly comprehensive financial plan where we will look at all of that and will help you be\nNot only efficient when it comes to the investments sure how to get the highest rate of return you can with at least ... but also show you how to be as efficient as you can from taxation you know where do you pull the money from when you need income so give us a call in the next ten minutes and will do that for you complimentary\nVery important questions you need to have answered on your portfolio that comprehensive financial plan a Fifteen hundred dollar value so call within the next ten minutes\nAnd get involved with that Michael answer all your questions sit down with you and give you a great opinion and do we joined a great way with your portfolio for oh seven to seven zero one thousand\nThat's four o seven to seven zero one thousand and you can find out more to add guarding your nest egg dot com\nTwo thirds of the people surveyed by nerd well I'd say they're not confident they'll have enough money to retire\nAnd are at this point in our lives Mike how do we find out you know where we stand\n... so it's it's a number right and how do you figure out what that number is so there was a commercial some years back from a financial company\nAnd the big tagline was what's your number\nRight and it was kinda it was cute they had people carrying around this big number you know so for some people it's like you know hey if I can just set aside a million dollars for retirement you know that that's my number I saw it with a guy\nOr just the other day we were talking we had a great conversation and he's got plenty of money to retire but but his numbers five million right he's he's he's getting close to that number and\nHere's the thing I mean we're we're looking at and I will I he he doesn't need five million to retire but but that's his number right\nSo the number can come to you in a couple of different ways\nYou could have established a number on your own in your head and you say hey listen I I just want to achieve this goal you know whether you're number's a million or five million or ten million whatever that number is once you get there you've decided we're going to walk away\nYou probably could walk away by the way a lot sooner it's just that she wanted to hit that number or other people are asking the question that they're going I don't in my mind how the particular goal like I Am not fixated on\nMaking sure I have a certain number before retire ... what they really want to know is how much do they need to retire\nAnd when somebody asked me my ...\nMuch do I need to retire what they're really saying is how much do we need to set aside for retirement so that I can walk away from this job never have to go back to work again because that's not what they want to do and retirement\nAnd live off us money for the rest of my life right and so how do you take money that you you've been saving and you've been doing putting money in year after year after year and you're watching and grow and grow and grow and then how do you transition into retirement because retirement is potentially thirty or forty years of unemployment\nRight if you think about it because you're not going to go back to work so it's very very easy to go to work now and I'm not saying your work is easy but we get very accustomed to you know I go to work I Do my job I get a check\nI use the check to pay my expenses you know and as long as they keep showing up for every single week everything is taking care of and I've got a certain standard of living that I'm very comfortable with unhappy with but then when you transition to retirement you have to figure out where the ... going to come from\nSo going back to the question how much do you need to set aside for retirement well let's\nTake a look at your standard of living and what does it actually cost you to maintain that standard of living and then let's take into consideration things like inflation and things like taxes 'cause it's not going to get cheaper over time\nAnd if we incorporate although it into a financial plan and then we take a look at how you're currently invested and what are your odds of success right because it's possible you don't need a financial advisor if you've done everything you need to do in a financial advisor can't provide value but there's no reason to have one\nBut it's a financial advisor can provide value if they can show you how to get a higher average rate of return that you're doing on your own none of any fee you're paying them you know the permanent providing value\nIf they can do that and also reduce the amount of risk you're taken to get that return their preventing value as well so answering those questions like how I set aside enough for retirement or how much do I need to set aside for retirement\nThat's part of putting together a financial plan\nAnd then once we establish how much you need to set aside for retirement and we put together a financial plan that's efficient meaning\nHighest rate of return you can get another fees but also minimizing the risk you're taking to get that return you know then we found a good spot and that's where we need to be so sitting down and having that financial plan put together is really critical if you want to answer those questions so for anybody who's listening\nIf you'd like to come sit down for our comprehensive financial plan\nWill put that financial plan in your hands you can take it to your current financial advisor if you want will sure how to implement on your own if you want or if you want us to implement it for you that's fine too big gifts going next ten minutes and will do that for you complimentary\nSee where you stand to come in and get your comprehensive financial point of Fifteen hundred dollar value sit down with Mike and his teammates

never having to work again for the rest of my life\nIf I can imagine running one song and that's it you know just live off of that not bet\nThat'd be nice you know I hear that a lot from a bans over the years that became one hit wonders and they had that one song but you hear it again in commercials in movies TV shows\nAnd they make a lot of money each time for that so they can just sit back and you know collect the money off of that the royalties and whatnot but I'm sure they probably wouldn't have hits to three and four so\nAggressive Don McLean he's he's been going at that song for ah what forty years at least\nThat's been a long time so I Will the NASDAQ and I love little history and trivia facts about music so I I'm the music guy and Mike you are the financial guy given us great information about\nRetirement so you know we're talking a little bit earlier about before the segment a Mike how do you help clients achieve a dream of never having to work again so how do you do that\nIt's a process Doug I I think we need to look at where are you currently are right now how you picture your return what what what's your picture of retirement you know what you think it's going to look like\nIt's different for everyone so\nThat there is no sort of blanket approach that we could talk about here on the radio that's going to identify every single person out there that side of their close to retirement or we're currently retired which is why again you know people hear us talk every single week about you know come sit down\nLet's do an analysis of your current portfolio let's put together a financial plan for you\nPart of it is that that that get to know you I Need to know who you are what is it is you you're looking to accomplish and just personality is a big part of it Doug if people feel differently\nAbout certain things and it's all about you know where we've been where we're going you know who are you where are we from and all those components go into a financial planted it it's not as cut and dry as\nSomebody just sitting down with you having you fill out a form\nChecked the box so they can figure out what your risk tolerance is you know and then just dropping you into whatever their portfolio is based on the way you check the box is off\nIt's not that simple mean people feel differently about different things and through these conversations and and the one on one get to know you and then putting together a financial plan were able to do that\nThe other thing that I I the way I feel and what I Do know about our clients is nobody's looking for the hanging their approach it's very hard to deal with in retirement is not so bad\nIf you're working because your portfolio does not drive your quality of life you're not worried about never having to work again 'cause you're working that's where your income comes from\nWhen you step away from your career and you were probably doing it thirty or forty years or you're getting ready to step away from your career\nYou start looking very very closely at your assets and you start trying to figure out a way to make those assets you know last the rest of your life provide you with an income stream that you need adjusted for inflation taxes moving forward but then also preserving the principal\nI never meet anybody who wants to just spend it down right and and people go every once in a while some bill say something like well hey listen if ah if my last check and balance right before I die that would be great [noise]\nWell yeah that would be great I mean I think all of us could agree but none of us know exactly when we're going to pass away so it's not a responsible way clearly to to build a financial plan so we build these out to where we can show people listen if if if we invest the money this way right and if we get this average rate of return fees at this risk level\nGiven the amount of income you need adjusted for inflation taxes moving forward\nThis is how you'll be successful if we do it this way\nAnd it's very empowering I think to put that financial plan and people's hands interim exactly how it works because then it eliminates that that big big concern which is how do I get from point a to point B point a being retirement and point me being you know I don't know age Ninety five or one hundred or whenever we leave this this world so\nThat is a big part of that and and it's\nPeople look I mean we're we're private wealth management firm so people start to wonder well I hear you on the radio you're probably all management firm I hear it I could talk about portfolios\nYou know it sounds good Mike but you know how do you accomplish that and there's a couple of ways we do that but as a private wealth management company one of the things that I Know dog is nobody wants to be the next victim of the next Bernie made off\nRight and then we don't we don't know where that person is but they're out there and we know they're out there somewhere and and there are people certainly that are perfectly willing to different people have their money\nSo the way that we you know make sure our clients realize that's not what we're here to do is we utilize custodians are custodians or companies like fidelity Charles Schwab ... so when people invest with us their money goes to the custodian All right\nAnd we don't have access to their funds we can't pull money out of their accounts we can't you know I can go to South America or some country without extradition right and take their money with me I have no access to their money what I have is limited authority to manage their account on their behalf as a fiduciary right\nAm legally required to do it in their best interest and so there is a complete separation there we can be a private will management company so I don't have some big corporation telling me how I have to invest client funds you know a lot of times I Know there I Would I Know is there a lot of people\nAnd her Doug sitting on a pile of mutual funds or something right\nBecause they're working with some company who believes\nYou should be and mutual funds and I'm not saying that's wrong but I don't think you can put everybody in that basket and say everybody should have a hanging their portfolio comprise a mutual funds I don't like that if I was retired I wouldn't want that and so I Can't promote that our clients and say hey\nYou should hang in there and not worry about whether the market's up or down it just doesn't work I personally would rather have a relationship with an advisor that had a vested interest in me doing well\nWho was not just going to leave me invested in stocks all the time because I Want to be invested in stocks when they're doing well and I want somebody to get me out of stocks when they're doing poorly are likely to do poorly that type of relationship I wouldn't be looking for which is why that's the type of relationship that that we have with our clients and that's how our portfolios work\nHe said they said no army and I said no how you doing today he says poor\nAnd like oh what's wrong normally goes no no poor as informed my beer\nThere you go and or something else kind of interesting you know he always talked about his wife veer off and she only appeared on the show briefly one time as a love interest for cliff cliff and but she was always\nYou know his real life wife is who played vierra and she was always off screen whenever they had some conversations or she was nagging him or something like that so that was cheers I missed the show and but thank God for Netflix you can watch\nAll the reruns on there too so you are listening to guarding your nest egg with Mike Lester I'm Doug Harding in for a course in Charles\nOur phone number here as four o seven to seven zero one thousand and the website is guarding your nest egg dot com next avenue it's a website that focuses on baby boomer issue says it's practically\nImpossible for the average person to intelligently navigate\nTheir Social Security system so my only this on here so how do we figure out whether it is what we need to figure out\nAll right so when it comes to Social Security one of the issues I have with this dog because there's there's a lot of information out there and it starts getting really confusing\nAnd then companies or a financial advisors or insurance sales people I mean you pick a but they're using Social Security and the confusion around it as a way to basically tried to get people in their office or try to get people to a seminar or something like that and they're almost confusing the issue even more\nSo it doesn't have to be that complicated there is a lot of truth around the fact that there are certain strategies you can use\nTo get more out of Social Security but every one of those strategies involves you delaying taking the payment right and the fact is is if we all knew exactly how long we were going to live but we could probably come up with a really really really efficient Social Security strategy but none of us have the answer to that\nAnd that's why we need to take a look at Social Security and then all of the options that you have when it comes to Social Security as far as when you should take it should you take it at sixty two she take it at full retirement age which is for most people around sixty six or sixty seven should you wait till Seventy right you see all this has already started to get a little\nConfusing and then if you're a married couple\nSome different strategies there if you are divorced but you were married to your spouse for at least ten years or something else there so I don't want to get this all convoluted what I Want our listeners to understand is that everybody's situation is very unique and there is no one stop shop or one best way for every one when it comes to Social Security [noise]\nIt is an important part of any financial plan which is why we include\nThat full Social Security analysis and the soles curry planning and timing strategies in every financial plan that we do\nIf you want to go to a seminar and have somebody to talk to you about this for an hour or something I mean that's fine I personally don't think it's necessary it's not as complicated as they make it out every single one of them died\nJust flips on their computer and put your vision and that in five minutes out all the information so it's not that complicated but again it is an important part of any financial plan we want to make sure that you're\nDoing what's best for you when it comes to Social Security and we will do that for you at our office we'll leave it at that\nYou know but we want to make sure we're doing what we need to do it's confusing but but we can take care of that and we do it in our comprehensive financial plan\nIt is kind of confusing Social Security maybe not the most exciting thing either but you need to know about your Social Security and you know how it benefits you are how maybe you need to change up your Social Security making his team at town wealth management will definitely answer the questions for you there are people standing by\nTo take your call their numbers for oh seven to seven zero one thousand\nFour o seven to seven zero one thousand and you can find out to more at guarding your nest egg dot com now Mike I wanted to bring up something since this show is all about retirement you have people coming in sit down with you and talking about their retirement and it's always kind of a\nI Would say sometimes a stressing time and thereby figuring out the retirement that eventually you're going to have to retire so how often are your clients that they come in that they're unsure about their abilities to retire\nAlso an ability retire is a big part of it when you take a look at um ability I think there are a lot of people that they feel like they're able to they don't have that road map for lack of a better word you know so so certain things have to be in place in order to to to transition into retirement so imagine somebody who\nDecides they're going to retire well they I mean let's say their their retirement date is the first time next month\nAnd they step out of their career well that means the checks are going to stop coming in some of the first things they have to figure out is well how do I start pulling money out of my\nInvestment accounts and how do I do it in the most efficient way possible because that's not set up I mean currently all he's been doing is putting money into it\nSo one of the first things that you would do even without a financial plan is you would just link your investment accounts your four one K. your eye or air or whatever and you'd set up distribution so you're probably going to want to distribution once a month and maybe one at the beginning of the month or the middle of the month you know everybody's a little bit unique\nThe next day you're going to be worrying about his taxation you know how is that money tax literally in order to to get those two components meaning how much money I'm going to pull out every month and then how much tax\nYou have to understand your budget right what is that number I Need every single month to take care of all of my expenses simple things like should I set a little bit aside every month for those expenses that that are\nAre it's not my mortgage or it's not my insurance or it's not my car payment or or what have you it's just discretionary items you know how much do I want for that\nSo that on its surface sounds really not that complicated but you still have to go through the process of setting up that income stream but then you start wondering well how much can I take out before I get into a situation where I Would run out of money right and you have to have a way to measure that\nYou have to understand inflation's impact on your portfolio\nYou need to understand how taxes impact your portfolio we we don't want to spend\nYou know or pay I should say more in taxes and we actually need to that's just a waste so there are certain strategies when it comes to taxation we talked about a little bit earlier in the program Doug there are are different buckets of money some of our money\nIs one hundred percent taxable on some of our money only their earnings are taxable if we have ... none of that's taxable so\nYou just pull out of one until it's tempting them outta the next one or do we pulled a little bit out of each one you know how do we put all of this together\nAnd so it's really those moving parts and the individuality for each person as far as how much money they've set aside for retirement what their sources of income or going to be in retirement how much they've set aside for retirement and how is that money invested\nIn we compare that to everything that's available to them because if we can show them exactly which money to access and how to access it shouldn't exactly how to save money on taxes and then also show them how to be as efficient as possible in that portfolio right we all want the highest rate of return that we can get but in retirement we're just\nThere's no reason to take lots of risk\nFor no other reason than it's too hard to recover right we can't afford a loss like two thousand and eight after we've had all this growth and we need to transition into retirement and understand our financial plan is going to work\nFor anybody who's listening if you want us to put that financial planning your hands if he wants to do that complete analysis for you and find them if we can make you more efficient and your portfolio\nGive us a call and the next ten minutes and we'll put all that together for you complimentary\nMake your portfolio efficient the comprehensive

the exact well guarded value will be captured were actors will be traded or liquidated the same day the wealth die he was reading through the time of day and or marketing restrictions [noise]\nThis is news Ninety six point ... how do you think we do it turns worse for breaking news\nFour hours a day\nWants to do is Ninety six point five W ... watching for rain radar checking hasn't been a top story we go down to the Supreme Court justice sooner than later and protesters are getting arrested on the ... the capital right now pending any last minute surprises Brett Kavanaugh seems assured of

capital it's a mix of opponent\nOr if I'm not retired yet at least I have a plan in place so that I Know I can transition into retirement and so for anybody who's listening if you'd like to sit down and that was put together that comprehensive financial plan for you an answer those types of questions I'd be happy to do that just give us call it the next ten minutes and will do it for your complimentary\nForce there were seven to seven zero one town than that for the seven seven zero one thousand\nAll within the next ten minutes and that kind of come in and sit down with Mike had him and the team at talent wealth management goes through that comprehensive financial plant that's Fifteen hundred dollar value by the way that there is no charge if you'd call within the next ten minutes find out more to at guarding your nest egg dot com\nSo this generic advice that we hear we need to be careful of that is why we need to come in for comprehensive financial plan\nUnless you're a generic person\nWe don't have generic 'cause I think now that I\nTalk about what it's like when someone comes in for the first step of that comprehensive financial plan what kinds of questions do you usually ask in that first meeting with a new clients someone you've never met before\nSure will first thing that we do is somebody and again we we aren't all over the state doing seminars or anything so people right radio show and they say you know what I Would like to sit down and have you put together a a comprehensive financial plan\nSo first thing we're doing obviously is I'm getting the contact information but then we're going to email them with the confirmation of their point of renting emailed them a workbook\nOkay and it's not math questions is not our guys on right now that's our hair and they were not testing anyone we we just need certain information in order to build a lot of financial planning it's easier if we give people at work but so they can prepare that information\nSo other than going to do is they're going to bring in the U.S the information that we need including investment accounts statements that sort of things we can do analysis 'cause well the first things that we're going to do is do a complete analysis of their existing portfolio because it's entirely possible Christian they're already on the right track\nRight nah it's entirely possible that either the really good at planning themselves that they've got a really good plan or maybe they're not good at planning they just got real lucky with the allegations that but it is possible that you don't need an investment advisor huh not at not everybody needs one okay so we do\nThat how you make a living and you're saying that sometimes people may not mean\nHe is a pretty big pond and there's a lot of flood of people that a lot of fish out there so to speak so there's plenty of people that need help and there's a lot of people don't need help and I'd be the first one to admit that everybody needs help and if you don't need help we're not going to try to a shoe on ourselves in there I mean that relationships work you know\nIf that makes sense they fill out that information before they come in us that some things well yeah ...\nSure so uh so that they've come in and were putting together the analysis foreign and uh they're also getting the information we need things like what are your goals what do you want to accomplish in retirement\nUm if you're not retired when do you want to retire how much income do you need to maintain your current standard of living you know all of these things and and and so literally people share with us what they would like to do in retirement or how they vision their own retirement\nAnd then we build that into a financial plan\nAnd so through the analysis and then through the planning and the planning and clues certainly you know taxes and\nAnd all that were to get some answers for and so most of the people that we sit down with Christian they they've done a really good job of preparing for retirement and I'm able to say hey listen you're you're on track but if you tweak this little little bit that a little bit you know your portfolio will be more efficient and if you're getting a higher rate of return while at the same time taking less risk to get that return\nCommon sense dictates you'll be more successful and retirement and obviously with more information which which they're getting it's very helpful so that's what we're doing and so by the time we've done all this planning what they're going to do is they're going to walk out of our office with a financial plan and their hands okay and\nWhat I encourage them to do is take that financial plan and put it to good use so maybe you have a current financial advisor and you really wanna keep working without advisor I Would recommend that they take that financial play it over to that advisor and say hey this is what I Want you know can you please implement this for me [noise]\nSome people Christian they for one reason or another they don't work want to work with a financial advisor or they they feel confident that they can implement the strength who's on their own and so what we'll do is we'll show them how to implement it themselves right\nAnd save the advisory fee by doing it on their end of the Christian ... you know there's a quite a few people they liked the idea of having somebody that has a vested interest in them doing well oh for short after and take care of their portfolios were produced Sherry's and Murphy based advisors showing our clients to well we do well on our clients to poorly we do poorly\nSo we have a vested interest in our clients doing very well because if they're doing very well we'll do very well and also Christian it's great to have happy ... actually refer their friends and I don't know for sure yeah yeah so so all of these things go into the planning process whether you work with is or not we just want to provide value\nAnd that's why we put the financial planning in everyone's hands but what I'd say is for anybody who's listening if you'd like to come sit now find out what we're all about because of that financial planning process walk out of her office with a financial plan in your hands just give us a call and the next ten minutes and what is it fair to complimentary\nFor zero

different places I Begin to really kind of worry about what's on the other side of that phrase one hit wonder was really in my mind\nAnd that's a scary thing for musicians obviously they overcame that had many hits after\nThat people tend to pick some of their investments the same way and say you know what I'm at the top of the chart right now I'm going to hang in there with that you know just put all my eggs in one basket if you will but here's right ... that could be a one hit wonder could be a one time thing maybe it's one stock this just done really well for you just don't know\nWhy things change things change for corporations and we can look I mean right now we think of these companies that are doing really really well\nAnd um you can look back and go well jeeze if I if I had only known apple if the if in the eighties I mean you know when I saw everybody carrying around that bag with the big multi colored I'm On a you know if only I had known they were going to do this whole thing involving iPhones and iPads and I pause and all this\nAnd I know what I should go to ... and it kind of ... do you go back a little bit further and you look at companies like Kodak right and um you know there was a time where you know ... was on top of the world\nThey were doing it you know not just doing stuff that we know they're doing I mean they were actually had contracts with the government to do and develop all the the photos from satellites them and everything was going great I mean I actually knew a guy\nThat was an executive with Kodak and um he retired with a phenomenal pinch and that\nWas and his pension was like there was a little like five hundred thousand dollars a year was his penchant for eight different yeah oh yeah good for him well guess what worst Kodak now I mean that's not it is a basically the you know they're out of business so who knew\nThat the digital camera would come out and put out of business a company like Kodak that develops film\nThat had it in my godfather to he develops would also manufacturers film but right right I'm just saying he had a similar retirement working with Kodak and that was pretty high up there and that kind of all went away\nAnd it went away so there are lots and lots and lots of stories like that at some point in time it's just what happens I mean I think Apple's a phenomenal company or they always going to be on top probably not right because we live in a country where competition is encouraging\nAnd innovation is encouraged so we we just we need a plan for all of that and if we could just know what the next great thing is going to be you know I guess we'd all be fine\nBut it's probably not bitcoin you know I get questions fell that men and here lately I think the newest thing or the cannabis stocks and everybody really getting into that there's a monitor that thing out there's always something right we would all like to um\nI guess I have a windfall at some point to some really exciting the problem is that's not good financial planning I mean it just isn't and waiting for our\nAre being paid to come in isn't good financial planning and good financial planning is well listen it takes discipline it takes saving it takes sending money aside in investing in lending and grow over time and the people that we work with every single week are typically are those individuals right they're they're calling up because they did make sacrifices and they did set money aside\nAnd they have had money sitting in for one k.'s and for all three ... and you know if you work with the government of ESP account or if you work you know for the state of Florida enough for us accounting and they've made sacrifices along the way and now they're just looking to make that transition\nThey need to know how to transition into retirement bright or as they're getting very close to retiring they need to know how to make sure that they protect that mistake because\nAll remember what happened last time markets crashed the well and the individuals that didn't have\nActively managed portfolios unfortunately they had to write it down and and and if they had the the fortitude to hang in there which you know a lot of them did they wrote it back up but but not everybody has a foreigner to to do that and they got it all at the wrong time at this those types of things that can wreck retirement and we need to find a way to\nMake sure that that we're investing money responsibly but but again particularly close to retirement or in retirement how do I invest these dollars\nSo that I Want to take advantage of market gains but I also I I Can't afford it takes huge losses and so what I Know about all of our clients is they want the most that they can earn that with the highest rate of return they can get there just I wanted to take a lot of risk to get there\nAnd so all of our portfolios are built that way away from our most aggressive investors were most conservative investors were putting together financial plans to help them accomplish their goals but we're also explain to them that these are actively managed portfolios we are ... advisors we have a vested interest in doing well\nIf you lost half your money in your portfolio\nIs going to affect us to miss a really big problem if all of our portfolios lost fifty percent we lose fifty percent of our revenue over the same period of time\nSo building out of a financial planner showing people how to be successful and retirement not only is it rewarding for us right but we're also putting people in front of investments that they probably didn't realize existed to start with\nRight that's true and that's also really important because most people are are most familiar with their ... with their current financial advisor or whatever situation there and\nSo you know going back to not being a one hit wonder right or not just relying on one particular investment to make things work for you\nYou can give us a call if you want to sit down and we can show you what the options are but having a diversified portfolio is actively managed I don't care how you slice it it's gonna beat betting on some particular position doing really really well for yeah some people are gonna get lucky\nBut I don't want to be lucky and retirement right right you can't just rely on live I Can't afford to rely on luck I went to a good financial plan a smart financial planning I don't want to rely on that\nAnd it's important that you have all those things in place so that you can feel confident about other things in your life and know that you can live your life without\nAll that university ... did you know eighty percent of all those insects for over ten years old [noise] let's see the water features update yours teaching

have seen the attacks on judge Brett Kavanaugh we have seen the feminist send the Democrats send a women all over the country\nWe believe her never mind if they even get the facts of the story we believe her that's like saying Ted Bundy mass murder uh that's like saying uh Charles Manson another mass murder\nWe believe we believe he's innocent we believe him or we believe it before you even\nKnow the facts I mean there's just like women saying are men would be saying I Believe Ted Bundy is innocent he is innocent never mind\nAbout looking at the facts never mind about looking at the case in this country we have a justice system that you are presumed innocent until proven guilty that's what makes us different than other countries around the world especially dictatorships before former Soviet Union look at China\nOh you have to do is say yep you you're guilty you're going in the Clinton Gore and the former Soviet Union you're guilty you're going to Siberia for forty years of hard labor doesn't work that way we're all of a sudden if you don't like someone or like something you say he's guilty throw him and put them in Leavenworth and we'll take throw away the key\nWhat has happened this hashtags me too movement has gone and transcended into hash tag every man is now guilty to movement\nAnd what we saw over the last a week ten days going on with the Senate Judiciary committee\nEspecially the Democrats going after capital I don't want to make this political but the fact of the matter is it has become political it has transcended now the feminist movement into politics and do unabated attacks on men\nInto this nonsensical term toxic masculinity every way we look as alpha males as men as a as boys\nWe're all under attack\nBy a relatively small percentage of women in this country and feminists\nAnd what we've witnessed this week where people stopping up and down and crying and marching and and and and and walking into restaurants in elevators look at me when I'm Talking look at me I suffered I was sexually abused well my answer is I feel badly that your work but this has no your tastes has no bearing on what we're discussing\nJust because you are sexually abused or you were in some way shape or form attacked that doesn't mean that every man is guilty we must look at it as a case by case basis now as you know\nI mean for most authority an alpha male pleasure maneuvers and of course says the alpha male and chief I make sure that our voices are collective alpha male voices are heard I stand up for men I stand up for males\nAnd what I've seen the last couple of weeks is just ludicrous people women have lost their minds even men I'm seeing the results of the feminist movement on these was defied Nablus boys and men boys that start off is what is the five boys and become ... adult men\nAnd we're seeing them jumping up and down and rallying\nAnd we must believe her and we must we this is a tragedy we must believer\nWhy do we have to believe someone let us look at the evidence and the evidence that has been presented and my feeling was that I stayed at this I think last week of the week before let's hear what Christine Blasey Ford has to say she's making this accusation great she also stated that she had witnesses let's hear what they had to say\nBy the same token Brett Kavanaugh has the right to defend themselves to stand up for himself to refute the chargers are the allegations being made against them and it's very simple the fact is that for people\nThat Christine Blasey Ford was the Ford however you want to\nTalk of any kind of like in ... Florida who come [laughter] [laughter] I have four witnesses but I mean maybe maybe they forgot they were there\nWitnesses all said no we don't remember Brett Kavanaugh we weren't at this party did not happen but that's not good enough for the feminists not good enough for the Democrats because this isn't just about toxic masculinity that nonsensical statement this isn't just about the fact that\nThey want to go after cabinet oh this is about they disagree with the fact that President Trump has the right to nominate the Supreme Court selection of his choice\nAnd they the Senate Republican controlled Senate can go ahead and approve there could provide their consent and vote on allowing Kavanaugh to become a Supreme Court justice they don't want the court tilt their shift period that's what it boils down to\nWhat we're seeing now is an owner baited\nOutrageous attack on men when the feminist movement began fifty years ago\nWhat did they say the first thing they said is we don't need a man we don't need a man we want equal rights now granted here we are fifty years later\nCan anyone really say that women are being discriminated against let's look at the empirical evidence\nThe majority of college graduates are women the majority\nOf graduates in post a a post undergraduate degrees master's degrees PHD's doctoral degrees attorneys lawyers\nAre women women today\nYou know companies become CEOs there's no limit on what they can achieve nobody's keeping them down nobody's saying you have to stay around but in the white picket fence in the house you can't leave the house nobody saying that\nThere are more opportunities for women today in the broadcasting industry in which I'm involved I Will tell you there are more women today that are running radio and television stations and in major executive positions\nThan ever before probably more than men\nI mean there are two major broadcasts companies that I can think of two of which struck a broadcast companies measly broadcasting and cumulus media\nWe have affiliates on both of those both those groups both run by women CEOs are women no problem\nNobody saying oh we have to put a limit on how many women can that can service she goes nobody says that nobody says I'm not going to vote for a woman because ah she's a woman nobody says I'm not going to go see that position or go to that story because she's a woman that's nonsense and it's complete\nUtter ridiculous nonsense women today are the best position they've ever been in there are no limits there is no glass ceiling that is nothing more than a fabricated term that the feminist need to continue their their crusade which is exactly what it is against men\nSo they've gone from we don't need a man to now we must\nHave straight men we must do a mass killing men\nThey've gone from we won equal rights too we want superior rights and that's really what it boils down to today I\nAlways get a kick out of out of a ... ... especially feminist they all are ... we want equal rights we want to be treated the same\nYou take a woman out I've never I don't take off a nut case feminist\nThat I don't do but I've got friends of mine said oh yeah I took this woman out you proclaim for the whole dinner she was a radical feminist blah blah blah blah blah and I'm like well why don't you just end the date right there he said well but when the check came\nAll of a sudden they weren't feminist anymore they wanted me to pick up the check no more equal rights no no no no I had to pick up the check meaning they had to pick up the check so what the feminist movement has gone from we don't need a man\nTo basically we must cash great man\nWe won equal rights do we want superior rights and what they want to do is essentially now they want to wish to fight ... fight every American male that is born period and every male ... adult male\nThis transcendent it has gone from an equal rights moving down with the politics of the justice system and now all of a sudden when you see these people that are jumping up and down and these protesters there was a protester earlier this week in the capital and she was wearing a shirt T shirt with the slogan men are\nTrash now think about that for men are trash\nThat's a blanket statement all men are tracked this is how radical how ludicrous how nuts they are\nIt is absurd can you imagine if men said all women are trashy horse what what happened this is outrageous how can you do that but when this woman wears a shirt that says men are ...
