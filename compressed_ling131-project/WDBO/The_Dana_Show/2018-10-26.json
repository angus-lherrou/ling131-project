least of all I'm I'm very glad that they cause this person a and I believe it's the very beginning of the investigation I don't think it's over yet but my main comment is the rhetoric\nThat has been going on primarily from the left since they lost a trade or been in the last thirty eight years one of the things that you\nDo is look for a root cause in failures\nAnd I truly believe that there's been several contributory factors in terms of first of all Saudi ... expectation at a whole segment a very large segment of the U.S population\nWas told by the media Bob polls and everything that they've already said that Hillary Clinton was going to win Hillary Clinton's go away because it's going to win and all of a sudden just what she didn't win and the expectation from that that\nGroup they just couldn't take it some of those people I Believe and\nWe're taught to lose they never knew how to handle losing and because of that because they were so low they couldn't handle it it becomes exponentially when you go and look at the media the liberal media because they were ...\nHow do they say face they're on television they're on radio they are broadcast every day yet they were wrong so where do they do they bash and they continue to cash if CNN was prohibited from speaking are saying that word Trump will one day put on their ... world history it has nothing to talk about\nI think that last dog is taking place here\nIt's been conditioning of the population and you keep hearing ... where leaders political leaders high level political leaders older when they go low we kick them Hillary you can't be super with them\nIf I was in high school it take him out back when\nI was leaders are talking to their base to their group who lost you can't understand while they lost then fire which of course and I'm not gonna do it it's still wrong thing to do you should never get into a fight because of politics you should argue those things out like you're supposed to do so those are my comments where today and I think that the public\nNeeds to relax a little bit uh just like you can't fix stupid you can't change crazy and that's what we're going to have to deal with\nAll right mark um gosh I I I have so many places I Want to go with all of your comments in in all of\nThose ... brought up Maxine he brought up Hillary and he and he brought up\nA guy that was that was that holder
