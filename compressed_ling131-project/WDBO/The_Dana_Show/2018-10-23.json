of the same and other very very low here like I'm not saying that it's a bad thing but it's just you know what I mean I mean they have a very different kind of demeanor about it but I'm a huge I mean the whole arena was packed and I saw so some ... suffer ... media\nGoing oh there's a couple of juicy shut up and just sit down and then I heard people say well fifty five thousand people went out to sea bass into why don't you be right about it why don't you be accurate because Willie Nelson was their people went out to sea Willie Nelson they did not give a rat's backside about beta they went out there to see willy Nelson\nCome on\nFifty five thousand people it was like the time when they were literally giving away free beer and bras in Germany remember that one ... spoke in front of the gate and everyone's like oh and they had a free concert yeah when you're giving out free beer to\nPeople you're bound to get some folks to show up really isn't rocket science for you people do people really need crushes to follow the logical path on that seriously what is your mental damage stone this\nAh it was a good rally last night that's you know let's just look at it as we are going to wait we have a ... term stuff that we're going to get into\nUm the mob is to reach the mob of illegal immigrants that's\nMarching through Mexico is too they say they're going to reach the U.S in a week because they're getting on\nBuses I won't put that out there because you\nDid the math yesterday what'd you say we're going to take like how ... considering the twelve hundred mile trip and it covers somewhere between Fifteen to twenty miles a day which is kind of reasonable ... we're looking at sixty to eighty days\n... foot so\nPeople are like wait a minute or so after midterms right we're going to change the yeah\nAfter midterms sure yeah but it looks like it's going to be before midterms because it really I think can be which they're going to get on buses somebody was figuring 'cause they think it's going to be like fourteen\nThousand now I think well you got the other Caribbean that just started here's the thing that no one's talking about uh you know they were they rejected\nAmnesty in Mexico right you all know that right [noise] yeah yeah they were offered ... they were offered amnesty and Mexico and they rejected it tell me again how badly they went amnesty\nThey just want to go it's just all about ... that makes me think\nIt's organized and especially the fact that there I don't know getting on buses makes me also think that it's organized and the fact that there is security that's walking with them every step of the way makes me think that it's organized and the fact that you have\nYou know the federal is just kind of standing to the side and letting them walk through almost as if it's protecting the march makes me think that it's organized and the fact that not a single damn Democrat at all has said anything about it makes me think that it was organized and the fact that they rejected amnesty and Mexico if you were really looking to get away from Honduras and you were wanting amnesty somewhere else\nWell then that would have solve your problems so apparently that wasn't the problem if it was rejected and they're still walking through which makes me think that it was organized\nIt's going to lay out I mean because it's true no one's discussing that\nThat's what they think they're going to they're going to reach in a week now that a lot of buzz it I don't know how many I don't know how big buses you would need but if it's you know it's over seven thousand right now and if it gets and if it meets up with their other caravan what it's supposed to be fourteen they're going to get on buses and make the truck the rest of the way and also think about where\nWhere are you stopping for food and snacks and to use the toilet you gotta have seven thousand people just taking a ... on the side of the road I mean let's just for real like I mean these are questions that one must asked\nWhere in the movies these aren't things that we just don't think about like why are for any of the characters in the restroom or why is it that when there's a big breakfast spread put in front of the characters as they go to school in the morning no one ever actually eat the food have you noticed that in every movie that is true and nobody actually it's the food\nThe one that infuriated me the most was the birds because those eggs look really good and not a single one of those damn kid's eighth and eighth and eggs and they'll just say well this one kid in that movie but he left and instead that knows the neighbor came in and everything but I noticed that like how he didn't even need the eggs so this is real reality so we have to ask these questions which again suggests to me that maybe it's organized\nBut it is it's mob seems to be like ... word of the day but if the lord of the month\nMob and it and it was a big time all the people that\nYou could you could call it cutie it'll terms like Caribbean all you want to use a cheeky it's not it's not a caravan caravan sounds like a bunch of dead heads following you know the Grateful Dead around or what do they they they do fish now is not right that if all the fish around\nThe same difference so caravan suggest that it\nIt's something fun and they're getting ready to do some fun things you know it's among the people that are walking up and they're\nThey're going to try to set up establish a confrontation at the border and time for midterms because Democrats policies sucked out loud so but I'm not being divisive they suck you honestly ... are you going to sit down here with a straight face to tell me oh ...

I don't know what this is actually what is actually given to kids\nShe said were based baby named like thunder or impressed offer a unique window on to our culture I got to stop right there ... name than their babies this\nReally that's one thing if you're you know you have a normal naming you want to change your name when you turn into an adult like that one dude who changed his name to trout fishing in America I get it I mean I don't but you do you but apparently\nSome of the new names that people have been naming their girls are a lower paradise Christine ... tour tulip gracious\nAnd gorgeous and I just think that these people need it'd be shaken they need some shaken baby syndrome the adults do because if I ever I'm I'm I'm I'm too honest if I meet somebody came and they're they have named their baby I'm Sorry could tour you deserve to get knocked\nBut pristine\nGorgeous and so these are all like adjectives right like why would why would\nYou name your kid an adjective\nIf

telling you\nSaid you know it's equal opportunity there because it can get a real court yes please uh all the women's names or the girl's name sound like perfumes and all the boy's name sound like superhero that's where I ... yeah yeah well I don't\nThink that rage necessarily sounds like a superhero I but I [noise] and who names are baby chaos great value superheroes [noise] apparently somebody on Facebook and their baby tyranny\nI liked that one the other World Wrestling federation with\nI mean not even I'm just that's just when you set\nIt up in the backyard Sally come on people listen I did a survey the second hour on the way we've got some mid term stuff that I [noise]\nBecause there are a couple of people out there that were ... again I just don't know I just and I I'm kind of [noise] I understand what you're saying but you're wrong sorry get over it in a different country or for self\nYou got to look at it that way\nYeah it and then of course there were some there's some out there who I don't know what the point of these people all these people's existence I don't get it well he was\n... took a cruise or was he was he was never Trump he was in a primary you dip why can't people stop that with the stupid primary you know the you know what what a primary is other people who are on an aunt\nMagical thing where you had numerous candidates that run and then you have a\nPrimary ... actions in America\nDon't work that leave I I Am I going to be able to plant who\nAre bouncers shut up you can't say what I really want a sex came with yell at me in hover over a dump button let you get the idea but I like that I liked that Pocahontas quote because that was\nRefunding now a new NBC Wall Street Journal poll out\nShowing that Trump is going to have some coat tails you remember the well maybe don't ah this was twenty ten bronco by my head zero co tales\nI have and in fact I remember there were even some of the friendlier to him cable news talking heads that we're saying wow I mean there were other democratic presidents previously at this point and they turned that had way longer there that had a greater ability\nTo affect down ticket races more so than Obama that a bomb that he had no hotels at all not at all\nAnd now in looking at it voter enthusiasm where it concerns Republicans has been increasing which is exactly what Democrats needed to not happen\nMeasurable let me tell you something I Want to go early vote try to I had to leave I might have to go back because the line was out the door I have never seen for a mid term election a line that law\nOut the door guys\nAnd I was talking to a friend of mine who voted yesterday\nAnd she went maybe three or four hours after I tried going and she waited in line for like forty minutes long was it was still really long line so this wasn't just you know one part when everyone is going to work this was all throughout the day\nRepublican enthusiasm is out of the park right now and it's increasing water dynamics coming into play the cabin all factors various tablet ...\nIt was an absolute catalyst for voter enthusiasm where it concerns Republican voters and and it has not subsided it has not subsided\n\nA one poll showed ... well this this uh this Wall Street journal NBC poll showed Republicans a with a Fifteen point advantage where it concerns the economy never before have Republicans have had had they had such an advantage number wise or in any poll in the economy at this point\nThat's pretty good\nNow this is where Democrats are struggling because what if they've been making this election on a Trump I think as accurately framed it insane it's job not mobbed\nPlus Fifteen and that's just an NBC Wall Street Journal poll when you go when you look at others that have been taken recently and when you look at night and among ago when you look at the president's job approval or economics or plain heavily into it\nHeavily into it and I want to look a generic ballot because I think that's the closest a with a lot of stuff\nThe um\nSo for generic ballot Democrats at one point had a certain point lead and it has dwindled down to single digits they are screwing themselves\n\nAnd we have an even this by the way I don't even think any of this this this uh the the mob of people that are coming from Mexico I don't even that hasn't even registered\n\nIs all just residuals from Kavanaugh the caravan that hasn't even registered yet\n\nSo this is where we are at this moment and that's a pretty huge deal there is a Washington Post ABC poll huge huge huge GOP enthusiasm\nA ton better than ... where he said where he was looking at the national generic ballot and if you want to follow one that is going to more accurate well and I there's a caviar to this if you want it to more accurate accurately reflect where the nation is heading look at the generic ballot\nBut he says he says there's four points here this is Tom Bowman who's a proprietor real clear politics in terms of midterms Democrats are plus nine actually today plus seven\nSo he had said there plus nine is actually plus seven and generic ballot now remember what I said they used to be there used to be plus Thirteen this is all the Kavanaugh bumped\nIt's like a ripple effect needs to throw a stone go away for those ripples to hit he also notes and house battle grounds and I'll listen to this the generic ballot is tied in battleground districts for house\nNow here's the third point the Trump approval rating is the highest of his presidency and it is one of the highest of presidents right now now couple that in with this they're all this in a pot mix it together\nSo what we're doing we're we're bacon were were were baking a cake number four and they just told you Republicans had the largest lead on the economy in the history of polling\nHe says these do not those do not sound like the components of a blue wave and he is correct now we're still what a couple of weeks out wait\nTill that caravan started and wait until people start pulling about that and people start looking at immigration what\nIs\nActually I don't I don't eat as you want me to tell you what the number one issue was for moderate Democrats voting for Trump on election night let me just latest on an election night when I sat and I because I was at Fox election night November twenty sixteen and I got to look at all the raw data polls taken across the country\nThey do they do three sweeps and I was looking at the raw data and it breaks it down to a number of people this is none of this is it's all raw data\nAnd in places like I'm trying to remember the top three um I Know\nA Pennsylvania a Pennsylvania Missouri\nI'm In Pennsylvania Missouri I think Indiana Wisconsin and there were a couple of other states that normally Republicans Missouri Republicans haven't struggled in that you get the idea but for a moderate Democrat and I made note of this I'm On air at the time\nTrump was not converting Republicans he was attracting people who describe themselves as moderate Democrat\nWith the one issue would you like to know what that is immigration the second issue jobs slashed economy how do you think these people are going to poll\nWhen the caravan heads\nDemocrats think they are going to get this optics of this mob of people standing at the fence and a militarized border and Trump's going to look bad\nBut do you know what really is gonna how that's going to look Trump is going to turn around and tell drama crafts what should we do do you believe in open borders\nThey're playing a very dangerous game but it is not going to work out well for them and it's not going to and this was organized I Believe it was after everything is insane I don't know how you cannot\nAs we move on here we have Florida Man later on in this hour additionally\nMore B L E W wave even Bernie Sanders is saying it's not going to happen\nWe have a lot of stuff to touch upon and something really crappy that some people did to Adam lack salt who is a Republican gubernatorial candidate in Nevada I got a couple of wars on that and will a touch on that here momentarily in the meantime\nAs we get

report\nKept saying that voter fraud is very rare in this country very rare\nNow a friend of mine Eric and he was over at the research and and he is an a or affiliate in Atlanta which had noted I'm a piece in the AP about fifty three thousand voters and George I who were put on a pending list\nWhich made all the social justice where you are ... people mad the\nPress and to what you wrote about this as well noted that it's it began as a human interest story talking about how Marsha ... as was a show in a college student she teaches how to check on might have to register to vote when she made a troubling discovery despite being an active Georgia voter who cast ballots and recent elections\nNo longer register she says I was kind of shocked she thought she had she believes she had successfully changed her address on voter rolls\nShoot she found herself when she says on the pending list which the a P said it's predominantly black but now the Georgia secretary of state who's running for governor completed a review of the list and this is what he had said a to Erickson\nBecause the paper in the story October night claiming they were fifty three thousand registering voters in Georgia who are put on a pending list the Georgia secretary state completed the review hired an independent review or and they said the ... list\nAs of October seventeenth was Seventy five thousand one hundred and five people nine thousand two hundred and twenty four are pending because the person is Seventeen and a half years old [noise]\nTwo thousand nine hundred and thirty five people use to fake address three thousand three hundred and Ninety three people are pending because their citizenship could not be verified\nFive thousand eight hundred and forty two are pending because they match another active voter file and after you remove the under age and the fake addresses and the duplicates and the non citizens you have about forty six thousand people pending on the list not fifty three thousand\nAnd Seventy five percent are on the list because they failed a Social Security number verification\nA and there is a a Stacey Abrams is group New Georgia project is responsible for twenty three percent of those or approximately eleven thousand twenty four voters\nAnd those eleven thousand twenty four voters had their registration filed and twenty fourteen by the New Georgia project [noise]\nNone of those eleven thousand twenty four voters have ever attempted to vote or contact or local board of elections to provide the so the correct Social Security number\nSo in other words he had edited Seventy five percent of the people provided the wrong last four digits of they're purported Social Security numbers and twenty three percent were actually filed not by the voter by a group that is associated with Stacey Abrams\nSo every while the media saying that Brian Kemp is bringing the election against black voters that's this is actually the truth of it\n...\nSome fraudulent stuff of foot but ... and this is why people don't trust the media\nHas the media\nIs not going to tell you about this they're running with this bunk narrative\n[noise] so Stacey Abrams cheating and that's there's an affair to beg the question that she is and there's enough there goodness\nNow for a couple of other things here\nBecause one of the other headlines we have or that Republicans are outpacing Democrats in early voting which I kinda figured that because of voter Republican voter enthusiasm is so high\nA there is ever so everybody's trying to kind of walk back or modify the blue wave things Arizona Florida Georgia Indiana Montana tendency in Texas ... affiliated voters have surpassed democratic affiliated ones in early voting\nIn Florida it's insane uh a lot the top two state of Florida Georgia\nUh only in Nevada had democratic affiliated voters exceeded Republican affiliated voter so far in early voting and these are all some close races\nOr this or Florida we have now send against Scott for the ah\nSenate race this they said forty four\nPercent of early voters had a Republican affiliation versus thirty eight percent would a Democrat affiliation in Indiana we got Joe Donnelly fifty one percent early voters had a Republican affiliation compared with thirty nine percent according to NBC News it had a Democrat affiliation\nUh in Montana Jon Tester the Democrat he's up for re election this is a state that Trump won by Twenty one point you get forty six percent of voters have had Republican affiliation twenty nine with Democrat\nAnd Tennessee where you have a silver president going up against Marsha Blackburn just filled Bob Corker Senate seats sixty three percent of early voters had a Republican affiliation thirty percent at a Democrat and in Texas\nWe have incumbent Ted Cruz going up against Robert or fifty three percent early voters had a Republican affiliation forty three percent had a Democrat affiliation\nShow and then in Georgia fifty two percent of Republic of voters at a Republican affiliation\nNow owned by the way this is in Georgia this is how the NBC News remember I was telling you about ah the the Stacey Abrams and that New Georgia project and the questionable how you have a lower eleven thousand people that just didn't get the last four digits of their Social Security number that run a pending list and they didn't um\nAh ever
