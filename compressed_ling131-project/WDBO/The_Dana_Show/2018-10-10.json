aren't him right and whether or not by us is involved there but see this is him he was accusations towards\nHim and of course he would defend it with biased because it's him so this has no correlation

mean even if we interior part of the hotel a lot of them are in the hallways here and I you know a which is the smart thing to do they have been following the advice of people here in the hotel and managers and when they were told us that the the safety in the hallways they did\nAnd we should mention that you know this morning\nWhich is a few hours left we heard from the administrator at FEMA they had a famous saying that the time to leave was over we heard from Rick Scott who said\nThis became can kill and in fact we know it already didn't long before it made landfall here in the U.S before a dozen or more deaths on its way here let's just hope with the with what we have witnessed here today which was quite frankly and uncovered them many of these hurricane something I haven't seen before and then you can say we\nMassive it's going to take days and weeks [noise]\nOh there's no doubt in the hotel\nIt's important for folks who are watching this unfold at home that we have not forgotten about Alabama\nAnd Georgia they are in the path of this storm next the hurricane is going to be moving very quickly unlike what we saw in foreign and there was a significant worry that the powers that be out for days or weeks where this hurricane is headed next even when it's done um\nWould it's damage right here in the Florida Panhandle which is just extraordinary I should mention I Know you shared it with viewers on the earlier everybody here on the team is a ... that's one thing I was really happy to see what I got to the stairwell Georgia's that she tweeted as well that she said but\nYou know we're all watching those images on social media the way you are too and to see a that home lifted off its foundation and carried with the storm surge not far from where we were just a stunning sight to see unfold here this morning to our house\nDon't Okay David I Know we're going to sing attended special edition of world news tonight from Panama City beach our coverage is going to continue all day long on line at ABC News dot com hurricane Michael has made landfall category for a hundred and fifty mile an hour winds have a good afternoon\nThis has been a special report from may be seeing news [noise]\nHe's\nSix point five ... oh you were just listening to some ABC special coverage of hurricane Michael as it\nMakes landfall all along the Florida Panhandle\nNear Panama City was the direct landfall sustained winds hundred and fifty five miles an hour as they began as a category ... storm congressman deal done from bay county says it's unprecedented decision\nI'm In awe of you right now we're standing those wind conditions or get inside get dry [laughter] we'll check back with you later maybe is Rob ... that right there in Panama City Florida let's go now to Kenya Graham he is the director of the national Hurricane Center or are you there with us [noise]\n... are you able to hear me this is David right\nUnfortunately we can't go to him right now but to recap just a little bit\nThis is now the third strongest storm on record here in the United states the strongest storm in fifty years since Nineteen sixty nine that's when hurricane Camille\nA hit the Florida coast uh we are now in the ... the early stages of this hurricane making landfall\nOne hundred and fifty five mile an hour winds as it made landfall in Mexico Beach Florida or let's go to a kind of ... ... he's a FEMA headquarters Kenneth I\nDavid Hey David I'm Still thinking about my friend Rob there yeah it's dry inside here they're no strong winds but there's still a flurry of activity inside the nerve Center for FEMA headquarters is really\nReally watching a and monitoring this massive storm and really stayed in contact with state and local officials this is a massive federal response here and there are a number of concerns for FEMA first and foremost the people making sure that people really hunker down\nAnd that they know that if they need help and they call nine one one it may take some time for them to get that help\nPeanut butter straighter Brock Long has been briefing the White House and President Trump\nWho I mean when a traitor about those who didn't have the means to escape this storm in a timely fashion because we know that it was a fast approaching and people couldn't get out in time\nBut the amount of straighter short the president should the president there\nThat tied they're staying in touch with state and local officials and make sure they can get to those people as fast as possible but next priority making sure that the state and local officials have the resources David really have on what they need to have the military response as well as they coordinate this massive federal effort to make sure they can clear the road because\nWe do the main concerns downed trees downed power lines FEMA preparing for some areas to be without electricity for weeks other concerns again that power infrastructure building but we're not built to withstand category anything above a category three\nUm that were uh maybe I didn't have a certain codes a circles won't put into effect until about two thousand one in Florida\nAnd when there are a lot of buildings in the panhandle in Florida that why we cannot withstand those categories three when so that's a concern for the you might as well we often or they're keeping a close eye on those toxic waste sites the Superfund sites that are can really be vulnerable when you're dealing with\nA storm with intensity and the wind um of one like hurricane Michael but again do we know that ... really in touch with the White House other federal official they really mobilized or inter agency call 'em just about in a couple of hours ago where they spoke with officials are in the southeast state and local they also had\nPeople from the coast guard on that call to make sure they all coordinated and all ready to respond and mobilize as soon as possible\nAnd Ken as you say this Florida is basically the front edge of this storm right now\nBut the thing is going to march like general Sherman's army across the south basically that's your ... areas where as you say uh they're not accustomed to hurricanes as they might be in Florida and we've also heard a number of our reporters in the field talking about the possibility of tornadoes in the wake of this yeah how big a concern is that\nA big concern that's why FEMA has put three thousand people in the southeast and very strategic spots are in the states that are going to be impacted by Michael and so we know that in Florida they've got shelters that are open they've got a number of cruise I'm female workers who are down there but also they're looking at\nWhat happened the next day why does tomorrow friday and so we know Thursday late Thursday late tomorrow friday that Georgia this back pain\nYeah I'm a structural damage or we know they're expecting a lot when it comes to dealing with that storm and so that's why you have those workers who are there and in certain areas they're safe we're being told by FEMA but there are there in those areas that they can respond quickly to those places in Georgia\nAnd I ... in the southeastern part of Georgia as well and then friday\nHeavy rain and they really expected to impact the Carolina as we know the Carolinas they're still dealing with the aftermath of Hurricane Florence a number of those rivers I'm Still have not proceed it\nThat's a concern um after they crafted a couple of weeks ago and so FEMA says it's ready to respond to those hard hit areas and we'll see even more ... flooding possibly by as you mentioned David it is good news that we can say good news is a pro\nNot a con that the storm is moving fast because they're hoping that the sources to move quickly over the safe that are already doing with all that flooding\nVery interesting kind of stay with us if you could please just for a few minutes but I Want to bring into the conversation Tom Boston is standing by in our D.C bureau and I gather Tom you have had some experience with these kinds of storms how bad does this look\nYeah David unfortunately that's true and let me put it in perspective a twenty million people right now are under some watcher warning of some type either hurricanes flooding or tornado warning\nAnd so as we watch it sometimes hard to understand how much\nOf the country is really at risk twenty million people you've ever taken so all the preparedness that we do and all the government action that we take at various levels of our I mean is appalling federal and state governments\nAre important but it's twenty million people having taken some degree of personal uh you know a accountability and steps on their own that kind of mass scale events very difficult to them a recovering respond to after the fact\nVery interesting so are you concerned that not enough people heated these warnings\nHere to be honest I really am a a number of things happen here we've reported it very well morning\nOr the speed with which this storm materialized and intensified and made landfall it's moving very very quickly forward so\nUh I've said just before the people it's a little bit simple but think of this storm moving quickly forward not just the speed that it's moving and wind speed that we talk about pets also moving forward and such a way that if you move your hand through a bath tub you could imagine a big wave in front of your hand\nAnd that's the big storm surge shall we focused on that but now I think Sam Champion and others have really pointed out to us throughout today's coverage\nBut it's going to continue not just with storm surge\nWhich will kill people unfortunately or at least has the potential to but it'll continue with wind and turn addict events and flooding events all the way up\nInto your points are marching across the south so I'm worried that not everybody in one form or or other risk has is heated the appropriate warnings our head of the time to do so and so I'm I'm looking for and hoping and praying against loss of life of\nOur prayers are with yours there how does this compare with I mean we've it seems like we've seen a ... a a couple of devastating hurricane seasons are in the past couple of years are these things getting worse or is this a just a roll of the dice every year\n... I don't I don't know how to how to you know develop a large scientific trend here um I can tell you that the last time I served in government recently or we had a big\nBig twenty Seventeen natural disaster season each storm is different though a Houston had a lot of rain and not a lot of drainage and so we saw a great deal of flooding\nBut Hurricane Harvey slow moving storm\nThat this is a faster storm and we're seeing a much different set of dynamics we just discussed\nLast time I served in government a long time ago in two thousand three and four I saw for category major a three and four major hurricanes make landfall the United states and six weeks\nSo back then we were talking about this being a trend as well and then we saw a little bit of a love of hurricane impacts to the ten years in between so trend analysis is a outside my scope right now but um I can tell you this one's intense it's unique to this particular area of the world and uh I Am very very worried that um\nYou know think of it this way earlier Sam Champion talked about why this storm is unique from a meteorologist perspective that's very important but from an emergency managers perspective all the people that maybe hunkered down right now that might require assistance after the fact\nComplicate things like the provision of emergency medical services the distribution of commodities kind of that retail level distribution of aid and help and so I'm looking for a very very difficult challenging and frustrating a period of weeks I said\nI Know and you're listening to ABC special coverage of hurricane by go right now wall to wall as ... made landfall near Panama City we will continue to bring this will have the latest updates resume or wall to wall coverage here in a bit going to take a break though I'm Kevin rape use tonight scene at news Ninety six point five WTO\nHi Jamie progress is number one number two employees leave a message pay Jamie Jamie this is your daily pep talk I Know it's been rough going ever since people found out about your archipelago group Matt harmony but you will bounce back I mean you're the guy always helping people find coverage options with an enterprise tool it should be you giving me the pep talk\nNow get out there hit that high note and take Matt harmony all the way to national this\nCasual the insurance company and affiliates Russian coverage match limited by state law\nFor you so bring from E.

S.\nDuring October so really powerful storm\nI was actually going to be my next question 'cause everybody saying it's a record setting storm and I wasn't sure what to record it was so it's the most powerful storm we've seen in October\nCorrect yeah the continental us and its author in October and it's also I think the biggest storm ever to hit the panhandle is that correct\nCorrect yeah it's whether you look at whether you're looking at it by maximum wind or it's you know the pressure both both of those that were the strongest storm out on\nThe Florida Panhandle hadn't actually had fallen category for before and so this one obviously it was on the high end up before so I'm almost ... so it was really powerful storm in its pressure was also very low on and so we saw obviously seen a lot of storms search on that and it's a fairly large and I start to so it it's definitely having significant impacts\nEven you know he went away from the center of the circulation\nAre Dr phil ...
