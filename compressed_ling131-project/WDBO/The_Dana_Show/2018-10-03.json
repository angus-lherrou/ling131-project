McLean\nAnd he said that as I was\nMy understanding that McLean was interviewing for jobs with the FBI knew us attorney's office I Witness Dr Ford help McLean prepare for a potential polygraph exam Dr Ford explained in detail what to expect how polygraphs work and help McLean become familiar and less nervous about the exam\nDr Ford was able to help because of her background in psychology he also detail that they live together they would she moved to Hawaii around Nineteen Ninety eight a and he said when visiting her in Hawaii we travel around the islands in a propeller plane she never indicated if you're flying she never express express the fear of close quarters tight spaces or places with only one exit\nA and he I mean it is a\nDoozy of a letter um and apparently also there in a bowl credit card fraud and he said because when he ended their relationship he discovered that she was he discovered she was unfaithful while they lived in Hawaii after he broke up with our he says I took off I took her off the credit card we shared but nearly one year later I notice she had been charging the card and charged about six hundred dollars worth of merchandise\nWhen confronted she said she did not use the card but admitted\nTo the use after I threatened to involve fraud ... a prevention\nHe said uh and and he says I don't want to become involved in the process but wanted to be truthful about what I Know\nWell dang um in addition and we're going to go to the press briefing here in a moment in addition um this is it also\nCame out yesterday and this is the Paolo Alto building permits apparently she was inconsistent\nWell according to the ah the people familiar with the matter and a lawyer who analyze the situation they say she just outright lie uh they said that the second door remember how she said that apparently the second door came up and they went to marriage there apparently the second door happened way before they ever went to marriage therapy and additionally it was the second or was added because\nIt was she was running a business out of her house and she wanted a place for customers to enter separately and it was a rental space for air being be et cetera and had apparently nothing to do with our fear of spaces in close spaces it was because I mean at least that's what all the records show\nShow\nNow back to the polygraph I think that I\nActually think Republican should pursue this because if she lied under oath I think she has to be charged and this boyfriend so she lied under oath\nI mean you heard Rachel Mitchell and I'm really curious as to how Rachel Mitchell she don't want them this is nothing which is why the left hates her the left hates nothing more there's nothing more than they have more than an informed woman\nAnd\nShe asked her direct question was have you ever given tips or advice to someone who is looking to take a polygraph test and Ford said never\nWell\nThey ought to interview the friend and now to interview the ex boyfriend and I asked her request and Dr Ford about it\nBecause I think that that's a perjury case if she lied under oath\nDon't you think that's important it's an important detail\nI mean she's she's a psychologist and my friend Dr Holland is a psychologist and she said the second they've written reams about it\n\nSo the letter by the way\nThat was sent by the ex boyfriend that it was a dated October stuck into September twenty seven was the testimony\nHow did the I'm just really curious did Mitchell knows this allegation\nDoes she know disinformation when she was questioning them\nBecause this is data is the letter was dated October second September twenty sevens was one Mitchell question that's why I said it was an odd least specific a very oddly specific question\nAnd whenever you get a specific questions like that in many instances it's not because of the person asking the question is looking to find out more information it's usually because the person asking the question is looking to see if you're going to be truthful about the information that's already know\nAnd so I Am\nFascinating I'm fascinated about all this in his campaign ad I mean I think you bring up a good point too maybe she knew in terms of she being Rachel Mitchell maybe she knew that in a psychologist not that so much that they are trained in it but that they're familiar with it because their field by and large hates it\nI I mean I'm\n... now and it starts to make sense I thought it was oddly specific I'm like where did that come from I mean she she's acting like she had no idea about a polygraph why would you live and ask I mean that's what my line of thinking was and I actually thought why would you ask her that I ... I thought that in a day to my mind\nAnd when I was talking about some of the weird things that happened when Mitchell was asking for it but I was focused on the flying and I was focused on um as well her changing a number of people that write the party and you know their names et cetera et cetera but I mentioned that but it didn't stick out to me as much as the other ones but I think this actually now is the is the largest\nOne because it was a specific question do you think do you think she was aware that she just knows this issue so well she just inadvertently hit on it\nFor the the letter is probably more true I find that fascinating yeah it really is and I think that when when she made the testimony [noise] excuse me um she was pretty emphatic about it and it was it was one of those situations where Mitchell knowing her back room\nProbably knew she was somewhat familiar with the polygraph\nSituation and probably just asked the question is you know one of the maybe it's a standard question because she has a history of a sexual abuse and in those instances where ... are used\nTo help people come forward you know what I mean with with their claims but it is hard to believe she knew this weird\nYeah yeah it's super we're so that's that's the that's the one big thing so here the other developments that we have um a and I do think I I I think that it's not begging the question\nTo ask if she committed perjury uh where I Want to discuss the second door because apparently that was for renters and that would mean if she said that the second\nDoor which for something other than what it was for wouldn't that be perjury also\nI'm also ... and they put this up ... uh I got more stuff\nThere are [noise]\nTo several people everyone wants to talk now\nAnd\nThey said that ah Chris Coons has a guy who wrote him tad\nLow I'm Sorry but I\nI just can I just say something I saw a commercial yesterday where the guy's name and the commercials deck strawbridge and I thought if ever there was going to be made a name it's deck strawbridge\nSo had low\nTad low you think I'm just saying he said he was an undergraduate when Kavanaugh was in New haven and that he says I was an eye witness to a shocking ceremony taking place a inside the a decay fraternity house involved a cheering frat brothers watching a a\nA prostitute essentially and he says I Can't say for certain that judge Kavanaugh was\nPresident but he was killed during that time okay and\nWhat the hell and then senator Coons publicize is this an act says oh well look at this he literally said I Can't I don't know that he was there but you know he was at Yale wow good\nHeavens that's one of the stupidest things I've ever heard oh and then Michael ... new accuser says that Brett Kavanaugh I'd put quite loads and punch and I'm like\nThat's not how quickly lose work I don't even know anything about ... but I Know they're in pill form right I think you would notice if they're floating in the punch wouldn't you you'd be like what are these pills here for citizen for it\nI don't know so we're going to discuss that as well and then um we also ... we all are also going to take portions of the White House press gone are the press conference a jumble now he's talking about the uh the decision to pull the United states that have the Iran treaty\nAh but I'm also you know Sarah Huckabee Sanders is going to be taking questions on Kavanaugh and we will roll with that\nSeveral New Yorkers have filed the lawsuit claiming they shouldn't be forced to receive the alerts under their right to free speech Sherrie Westin ABC News\nPoint five guilty db Orlando turns burst for severe weather I'm gentle Ninety\nTo Raul just rusty ... lower chance for rain today what will that do for temperature\nYou know coming up good afternoon I'm jumping reviews cool it off as we take a look at the interactive radar got a little bit of er got a couple of pop up showers I should say scattered all across her window what a book right over Winter Park one over downtown\nGot another one in the Conway area but much cooler though today will be in the mid eighties all across our area for Dana shown for a minute [noise]\nWe weren't team coverage and Fifteen year old student in Lake County been charged for bringing a knife to school so mode reporting hearing ...

O. J. inspector general but he wants to see that happen\nQuickly what just quickly mean are we going to see these documents before the midterm elections I\nI'm not going to walk for a timeline but we are continuing to work through that process and we have an update on it will certainly like Alex\nOr what is the earlier this year that Michael Cohen\nA you know I'm not going to get into a back and forth that the issue for the president's out that counts I direct to their answer John\nUh impact convening\nOr the undecided voters critical to the nomination\nAny of them between now and next week\nI think one vital perhaps flame is far\nThan I Am not aware of the specific scheduled call but we certainly been in close contact with a number of numbers and will continue to do so up until about ... was\nStuff and under of California are running under indicted there are rules of the actual Republican\nFor members who are under indictment says the president's tools for both\nCan't get into a lot of details one up for hatch act violation but also with an ongoing investigation I'm not going to be able to comment on that\nSide here feel like they just freezing was\nThe background investigation\nForty right now the FBI has an interview just how it all or doctor for the White House has given investigators we're\nAs we said several times to presidents indicated that whoever the FBI deems necessary to interview he's fine with that\nBut he's also after the Senate be the ones that determined the scope of what they need in order to make a decision on whether they do Kevin all up or down on I can also tell you a book Kavanaugh judge Kavanaugh and Dr Ford or question in the most public way possible\nUh by the members of the Senate who are ultimately the ones who have to make the determination whether or not they vote for judge Kavanaugh if they had additional questions for either one of them they had a time and an opportunity certainly to ask the White House\nOr no you're saying because you have a nation of the nation I\nPresident Trump talked a lot to me about this issue of the time about men\nSeems odd guilty\nAnd his idea to process but\nFive he put out an ad thinks we honestly\nWhat he had been found can be even after they were exonerated still um\nIt's ugly said that they may be guilty and even if you talk about\nUm presided over rallies working they lock her up talking about Hillary Clinton so\nBetween when the president is interested in doing that for some but not for other\nAll the president actually encouraged a the Senate to hear Dr Ford testimony in the same way he encouraged them to hear a judge Kavanaugh says he is simply stating the fact that we are a country of law and order we are a country that still believe that you're innocent until proven guilty and we want to see that process I go through in its entirety and it should be on a fair playing\nField are simply they only plants like okay yes on the field and he said he feel that now back of the specific day but that's\nAn enemy because if the president has taken this morning when president has taken the moment to say that he's\nTo cover and um that's the thing that makes me angry so about this just come back to a for a minute\nThat it infuriates me it's an inconsistency an absolute inconsistency ah before\nWe get going today oh I just lost my today at um is actually going to be in about what twenty minutes\nIt as the presidential alert system it's going to mark the first test of the national wireless alert system it's expected to happen at a to Eighteen eastern time one Eighteen central time\nAnd it's expected to reach about two hundred and twenty five million people the federal government's requiring to test these alert in systems every three years it's the for the first ... the first wireless emergency alerts were sent twenty twelve\nUm and so they've had forty thousand plus original alert since then and it'll stay a presidential alert to test of the national wireless emergency alert system so you're going to get a tax from the president basically\nPresidential alert system and they use that in case of you know attack new nuclear attacks things of that nature that's what it's going to be used for so they're testing this out and through this scene is going to send this wireless emergency alert to cell phones with wireless providers that take part\nIn this uh the the emergency alert system DAS and the wire wireless emergency alerts W E a\nSo that just so that's what you need to know and that's going to happen about to Eighteen eastern one Eighteen

conferencing\nRachel Mitchell as to whether or not she ever give anyone tips are coached and he went through a polygraph and my very good friend Dr Helen Smith who is a well respected psychologist I'm In forensic issues and um she's shape blasted that saying what the what kind of psychologist doesn't understand anything about a polygraph she's like at the entire field\nAnd has written a dreams on it and they you know they they think that they're completely unreliable\nOr been to that point she didn't buy that Dr Boise for Christine Blasey Ford\nWas aware of it uh and didn't know how to do it especially when the ex boyfriend submit some his testimony written testimony under penalty a felony to the Senate Judiciary committee alleging that a Ford coached a friend on how to get through a polygraph test\nAnd then he he personally witnessed it and it also gives her a credit card fraud so I that I Would think needs to be investigated here's the other thing that really is fascinating to me\nSo her ... her story keeps changing and it and it changed it changed\nOn the number of people at the party changed as to why she got her door another door in the house it changed about the fear of flying remember it was Blumenthal Who Lied about serving in Vietnam who had the audacity to say you know one line means that there's bigger lies essentially\nSo she at least she actually in her opening remarks and I'm not going to play because they are rather long she talked about why she needed a second door because she didn't want to feel like she was trapped and so she wanted to front doors but\nReal clear investigations which is they did a fantastic job of looking into this they found the renovation records\nAnd they completely dispute her account\nReal clear investigation says that real estate and other records under cut a key part of Christine Blasey Ford to count as to why she finally came forward with charges of attempted rape against Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh after some Thirty years\nShe testified last week she never revealed the details of the attack until twenty twelve she said the memories percolated up as they revisited a disagreement that they had had over her insistence on installing a second to front door when they remodeled their home in Palo Alto California\nShe testified that her husband didn't understand and she wanted the door to alleviate symptoms of claustrophobia and panic attack because of Kevin that's why she was apparently remember afraid of flying because she was claustrophobic because of Brett Kavanaugh\nAnd so the\nSenator Dianne Feinstein had asked her point blank quote on record is the reason for the second door front door is claustrophobia correct she replied\nShe never actually specified real clear investigations knows when the renovation took place so it gave everybody the impression that uh that it and the therapy session happened around the same time but documents reveal the door was installed years before as part of an addition and has been used by renters and marriage counseling business\nAnd attorney familiar with the investigation and at the renovation says quote the door was not an escape route but an entrance route it appears the real plan for the second front door it was to rent out a separate room\nNow real clear politics real clear investigations notes that the discrepancy raises doubts as to whether or not a ... a forged credibility and other inconsistencies and all of that whether or not they'll comes into play\nBecause remember she initially refused to submit to an interview with the committee because she was afraid of flying than investigators established that she has taken a number of flights baton for those of individuals who say well yeah when I take flights I get over it really easily\nThat irrelevant and you're being deliberately stupid she was her claim was that she was so terrified of flying that she couldn't fly period not that you just get over it and you take some value in where you get over and you take on it and whatever you take to get over you know your anxiety about flying I don't know she was saying that she didn't\nFly that's the big difference so those people would that specious arguments and shut up a and she after\nAll the remodeling including the new bathroom was completed notes real clear investigations by February twenty twenty [noise] the only additional permit issued to her were for solar panels on the roof\nOr hot water system and an electric vehicle charge station for the driveway and that was all issued after twenty twelve and other documents including health care provider registration records reveal that a marriage counselor list at her home addresses her place of employment and they use the extra ... they use the extra room in the door for the clinical practice\n[noise] ah so\nThe since the second front door was installed that has been used by the entrance as an entrance by a a students from local colleges who've lived in the additional room a for Google interns or for the business et cetera and the attorney says the tenants call into question her plans as to why she is extra ... installed the door\nI mean they I mean clearly it was there for business purposes so that you wouldn't walk to her house and you would just go into the addition through that door\nSo\nI it just doesn't just doesn't make sense um\nAnd they said that property records show that foreign her husband bought that bought this uh bought the beach house in two thousand and seven this is a because she they purchased um\nThey have a second home and write on the beach must be nice\nThey have a second home where real clear investigations says they installed no such escaped or\nTheir five blocks from the beach or they installed no such second door and she even apply for permits to build a front porch of new decks at the home\nAnd there was no application for a second front door and the reason permits are the only ones apply for since two thousand in seven\nNo other evidence emerged of other exchange or construction either of her homes authorized or not\nAnd the one of the attorneys familiar with it he spoke on the condition of anonymity said if she rents out the room to Google employees how does she get access to the second door to escape or perceived attacker renting out the room is completely contrary to her stated reason as to why she wanted a second front door\nHuh so interesting\nNow here's the other thing um\nAs soon as you do share a spokeswoman said fourth lawyers they again they've never provided the therapist notes or the names of the committee the committee chairman they gave it to the Democrats on the committee but they refused to share it with the Republicans on the committee and Democrats would would not will not share the therapists notes\nThey won't share and remember how they weren't even gonna share anything with the polygraph they still wouldn't share of the questions as it relates to the polygraph which is incredibly important to be able to establish that because Kavanaugh was named in any of it\nSo\nThis back and forth changing there's a really good piece by the way up by Margot Cleveland that USA Today on this I Know\n\nThis was a listen to this because I thought this was great when Christine Blasey Ford\nTestify let's say before the Judiciary Committee America witnessed a haunted woman recounting a devastating trauma but putting aside for emotional performance and focusing instead on the professors testimony reveals numerous inconsistencies and her narrative that Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh sexually assaulted her sex crimes prosecutor questioner Rachel Mitchell\nShe's well she's position to know when she sees it but rather than the Ford is a victim of sexual abuse by cabinet missiles are her as a witness lacking credibility and this conclusion comes from an expert who knows that there are reasons many reasons victims delay reporting sexual abuse\nMitchell also recognize that victims may not may legitimately not remember certain details related to an attack but the problem for Ford is that she doesn't remember everything is that everything she remembers changes that her convenience\nForward testimony that the assault occurred in the summer of Nineteen eighty two when she was just fifteenth conflicted with both her therapist notes and the text messages she sent to the Washington Post\nAccording to a reporter Emma brown at Wal though for claim she'd been assaulted in the mid eighties and the therapist notes dated for to have been the victim of an attempted rape and her late teens but by that time Kavanaugh was attending Yale so Ford's recast the attack to the summer I'm Nineteen eighty two as suspect\nShe re told the the alleged sexual assault uh in in several conflicting accounts and the number of individual I I like as to the number of individuals are at the gathering\nThe therapist note stated that four boys had attempted rape her and then or therapists confused a number of boy she says for claims her therapist was confused which by the way the therapist is confused how how can you trust the therapist number one on a detail like that\nShe uh there was another change wherein she testified about the location and that's when there was a big discussion with Michel she said it was right by the country club\nAnd Mitchell revealed the math and it was about what she said the country club was twenty minutes a twenty minute drive from your home she changed the description of the layout of the home she changed where this where they where everyone was\nUm the notes did not name her attacker\nAnd the final three contradictions that she has in there um it's it's she altered her story only after cabinet and Senate investigators had obtained evidence to prove her original\nTail a for instance USA Today notes investigators had obtain statements from Kavanaugh and the two men and one female lifelong friend affords and they all denied any recollection of the gathering\nI mean it goes on and on and on it it's inconsistent that doesn't really jive with credibility\n\nWell I got my I got my presidential alert you get yours came [noise] everybody get their presidents alerts\nYeah\nEveryone is putting a yeah anyway everybody's got their every

this was going to pull this up a Chuck Grassley sent this to a doctor for lawyers yesterday\nAnd he wanted he he wrote I Want to renew my request raw material evidence relevant this this October second relevant to allegations of sexual assault maybe your clients ah Christine Blasey Ford\nDuring the hearing last week I renew my request I went notes from the therapy sessions\nOr he goes and and I'm so glad Grassley is doing this this is so great he says uh because this is what we've been asking he says they renew my request for the notes from the therapy sessions in which four to discuss the alleged assault a blah blah blah Washington Post as they got the notes uh they're highly relevant to her allegations they've been repeatedly cited as corroboration\nEven well written Thirty years after the alleged event and it's a ... and an apparent contradiction of testimony other public statements regarding several key details of the allegations including the alleged attack on an outsider cetera\nSo that's good uh he\nRenews requests from all um he went ... audio video recordings produce during the course of her polygraph\nAnd this is the this is this the the key choice paragraph you listen to this\nThe full details of Dr Ford's polygraph are particularly important because the Senate Judiciary committee has received a sworn statement for a long term boyfriend of Dr Ford stating that he personally witness Dr Ford coaching a friend on polygraph examinations\nWhen asked under oath and hearing whether she'd ever given any tips for advice to someone who is planning on taking a polygraph Dr ... replied never the statement raises specific concerns about the reliability of her polygraph examination result the Senate therefore needs this information\nI mean I Know that they want everything on record right right well maybe all of a sudden they don't she like second that they'd like we're regarding asking for this kind of curious ... very interesting\nNow I um\nYeah just very interesting look at that [noise] so uh I I Hope that\nThey just need to that they just they just need to take the vote ABC and CBS News busters noted that all of these media entity is completely ignored the ex boyfriend a letter to the Senate remember that the letter that where they said just to what Grassley was stating their that how I'm In this letter he personally witnessed her\nYou know helping this individual with a um a polygraph et cetera et cetera that seems like that's important\nAnd why wouldn't why wouldn't they cover any of that why why why aren't they I mean where the hell the\nMedia what we'll do damned jobs that people do\nAsk you questions or how can we get to ...\n... I mean you guys are all up all over the story but not all in asking these questions\nAll in asking questions about the renovation did you perjure herself with a story about the renovation and second door because records are kind of indicating that that was the case is you perjure herself with the polygraph because a sworn statement by an ex under penalty of felony kinda indicates that she did\nBut wait a minute this isn't a trial right you don't need any kind of it you don't have to worry there's no due process that she doesn't have to worry about due process and there's no innocence until proven guilty so she perjured yourself prove prove us wrong\nThat's how it works your your your old guys know how it works Dana oh you don't like her what rules working oak arch so tough for you\nSo this um yeah [laughter] Mm Mm Mm Mm\nI yeah I'm just I'm fascinated by all of this so hopefully we can get day a um\n\nA some sort of a update on the FBI because there are just about done with is that there aren't all ready and I for one definitely want to see I Would I I\nFor one that I definitely would like to see that take place\nI Want to I wanted and I'd like to see the nose and I hope that they are made available to the public I Hope they are I Hope they are now here's the other thing I wanted to share with you so Michael ... who is like the local lawyer who comes out and he's desperately trying to make a name for himself like if a if they use the gym sock\nGained sentient and was able to pass the bar exam it would it would be Michael ...\nSo he uh hang on let us up so you all he's got a new statement because sweat sweat Nick is a train wreck she completely torpedoed her credibility\nAt but she completely a torpedo her credibility with her interview you saw that that was just a hot ever loving\nMess that was a mess and\nSo now and they pulled us up I got this here so now Michael ... says another users come forward so she's prepared to meet with the FBI today so I'm looking at blah blah blah I'm it's anonymous nobody knows who this person is of course it's anonymous and I\nSure that I'm sure it'll be the first guess both on MSNBC okay here's the big thing\nDuring the years Nineteen eighty one eighty to this is from Michael ... new one named anonymous person I witnessed first can Brett Kavanaugh together with others by the punch it has to parties they tended\nWith ... or a grain alcohol okay the sentence structure is bothering me so bad because of the way that the sentence structure is the way that it's worded it makes it there is no agreement here with birds in subjects and so it makes it looked like she attended the party was quite lose and grain alcohol when in fact she specifically talking about\n... and ... alcohol being the variables with what she's accusing Brett Kavanaugh's biking to punch but whatever could help\nBikes punch with quite lizards I met a drug person I've never I've never I don't know what a quaint little looks like except that it's a pill I Know that much now all my drug you friend I'm kidding but now I have some friends who know some things they say yeah he don't even\nYou don't expect stuff liquid like there's this is this gonna flip cars are pills that the stupidest thing I've ever heard actually asked a friend of mine who stiffed shockingly lives in California and shockingly\nMay not or may or may not have had anything to do with legalizing marijuana and part of part of all of that I'm just saying you can be friends with everybody\nThat was like you're the expert on this I don't think you can spike stuff with pills and the response of this I Can't just say it verbatim on air because there are some words that the FCC wouldn't like they're like this is a blank you know do the ... thing I've read nobody spike blank with blinking ...\nAnd that was that hope you're well how do the fans [laughter]\n\nAs my expert I mean right I mean I think that that's not how that's how that happens [noise] Mm yeah I don't even I wasn't that like it was it that was like our parents did\nSo that wasn't even it was that even an eighties drug cocaine was the eighties drug right I don't know was that\nSomething The Cosby was using too from what I I don't know I've no idea but you're right if you're going to buy ... you know how to dump pills into it [laughter] look at me biking this punch although\nTheir doors so maybe they didn't know I don't know\nIt's just strawberry trucks guys it's All right yeah it's bonus so I don't know I just but I and then grain alcohol so\nYou can taste it so you're totally taste it why the hell would you put grain alcohol in there that's so stupid oh my gosh come on this is ridiculous anyway so\nThat's what here and you know what honestly I think some of these people say this stuff and ... and ... and and they'll be like oh under penalty of felony the only people who have rest care\nAre Kavanaugh\nBecause do you think honestly and I and I believe that Democrats in and people like Michael ... know that I think\nThey realize that they can I think that particularly ... you can put\nForward people who will lie because there's no way that Republicans are going to run the risk of the optic of going after legally someone who perjured themselves in a statement to the Senate Judiciary committee\nYou all know that's true we have quit five
