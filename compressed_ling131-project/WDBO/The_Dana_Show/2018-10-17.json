I Am a contender and then I Am better than the Kamala Harris isn't the Spartacus says well I'll do this I Will I Will walk so far down this path to a certain ... certain point and do this\nAnd I think also there's this perception amongst Democrats that whoever can go toe to toe with Trump and vanquish him politically\nThat the savior of the Democrat Party and I think they're all trying to audition for that in various ways and that's what I think all contributes to why Elizabeth Warren did what she did and with this stupid DNA test\nAnd that is ... I mean that's that's kind of the that's the way that\nSo she was doing this because she needed to get her name out there and she also wanted to be seen as the person who could think wish Trump\n\nBut it kinda backfired it totally backfired\nAnd it looked absolutely ridiculous I mean you have oh Cherokee Nation which cannot you have a bunch of ... there was a Democrat socialist there had to call them out I don't remember where 'cause I don't care enough ... they had a column I were they were criticizing her I'm not going to kill my brain cells reading some barely legible Justin ...

despite being more than halfway through October\nLike look at the interactive radar coming up sick of the kitchen so our job story President Trump says he's requested audio and video the turkey claims dabble but journalists being murdered at the Saudi ... show he disappeared about two weeks ago and Saudi officials denied that he was murdered in college so I Want to find out what happened\nAnd\nKind of I scratch my head over that because isn't that the opposite of of ... the ability to make a choice yeah freedom of association\nIt the idea that if you are X Y or Z you immediately think like this well guess what not all gay people support higher taxes gift what no black people believe that the government should run your health care and guess what not all women\nThink that policies of increasing the individual tax rate is good for America\nBut you're not allowed to have those viewpoints that's how it's always been presented\nYou're not allowed to have those viewpoints because all you need to know is if you are a woman or if you're black or Hispanic or gay or whatever\nRepublican hate you and you can't vote for them\nWell that's not true but that's what Democrats run on\nHave to run on that because they know if they told people well guess what guys that's what this is our platform or we want a police state and we wanted the police to be a federalized in DC all in one area run out of D.C we want higher taxes\nWe want to increase uh the tax rate to a forty percent are up we want to Jack up taxes on businesses so they have less capital with which to expand and hire more people we want all of your health care to be just like the VA\nI mean when you when they tell you these things that doesn't really endear anyone to those ideas right so they have to stay well you know maybe you don't like our ideas that Republicans want to kill you\nThey hate you that's the stuff they say\nIt was just insane to me and a lot of people aren't believing that that's why the whole economy thing that's what this was about telling me what about ... kinda was a culture war that's what I was about it was less about the optics of ...\nAnd really more about here is a very a very powerful very successful\nBlack businessman in the public eye who's very vocal who weighs a ... carries a lot of influence and he's saying things that don't go with the narrative of leftist ideology and that is dangerous and that's why they went at him so hard\nThat's why they went after my from Bruce Carol [noise] he was he is a successful businessman he is\nRespected in his community\nHe is a day conservative\nAnd you're not allowed to be those things you know a lot to be gay and conservative you're not allowed to be gay and a Republican you're not allowed to be black and a Republican or black on a conservative or a woman in a conservative and I think who are making these rules if you're not allowed to associate freely\nAnd ask questions are you free are you there\nYeah that's the that's that's what you have to ask are you really free\nAnd the answer is now\nAnd a lot of people are waking up to that and that's one of the reasons why now you see this this is more than people waking up to bad politics were not at the point yet but we're getting close\nLike how I said Kavanaugh was a watershed moment it was one of the first times that I remember aside from twenty sixteen election that was more about the people making that decision has an all was the entire right\nAnd independence libertarians saying enough is enough and they shut down the road rage mob first time that has ever happened everyone work together\nAnd they showed look your tactics don't work they don't work here\nThat was a watershed moment [noise] and I feel as though we're approaching yet another one where people who have been told that the color of their skin or their orientation or their sex\nThat determines what party they vote for\nAnd Democrats will say well we're the ones who are really not protections for you will really what are you doing in terms of protections\nYou do a couple of things about bathrooms and you support like pronoun usage but what are you doing for their businesses what are you doing for their health care\nYou're making it harder for them\nYou're you're increasing their taxes you're making it more difficult for women business owners\nBlack unemployment's at an all time low that didn't happen under a black president I'm just\nI mean you could argue when it happened all you want to it happened after tax reform\n\nAnd you were thinking that would have been wonderful to see I don't care who's president I Want lower taxes period\nI Want a healthy economy period but the point is for all of the discussion about catering to specific demographics\nThe party that\nParade that as their identity the most do the most harm to those demographics economically in terms of foreign policy\nWhen you're really you're really gonna work\nAnd and give money to a country like Iran to execute people for being gay\nUh come on\nSo this is what I've always you know I and I look at my friend Bruce and now here his social media accounts and that's the privately control public square and it's kind of a weird for anything but he was suspended because honestly I think it's because he's a gay conservative\n[noise] because he does not say I mean there are people

detail\nNow\nThis I mean it gets bad\nWe would have if I mean if he was behind it why would you use people from your inner circle that's the one question I have 'cause that's probably the dumbest thing that I've ever heard\nWhy would you use people easily identifiable from your inner circle\n\nAnd why would they think especially in Turkey that that would not come out\nI you know I don't know\nMike Pompeo went over there to discuss and here's what I find really just ... ... from some of these I mean the whole thing's nauseating but I just add to the knowledge ah or some of these journals 'cause my palm pale went over to get answers\nAnd\nYou have some reporter saying the pictures of palm pale grinning and smiling and laughing with the crown prince as if this journalist wasn't murder it's remarkable it's embarrassing it's bad policy et cetera\nIt's indefensible I didn't realize you were a diplomat who the hell are you again I didn't realize you were a diplomat maybe he's trying to get answers and if he goes over on hold a gun to his head he's not going to get answers that way I Do want answers or do you want optics\nGolly and how they got mad at Heather Nauert because of the photo that she posted a when she was in Riyadh\nBut\nOne of the didn't didn't Saturdays they had come out and saying that it was it was like an interrogation gone wrong and that we could have been rogue agents isn't that one of the things that they had put out there is there a possibility that\nThey didn't know these guys did it I don't know that's what I think I Would I mean there's a possibility I don't know if I have I don't know my level of difficulty believing that though\nI mean if they are I I don't know\nI mean and they said that it it it just um [noise] to say I just I'm not sure I just don't know if I buy that so\nIt's a very you know it's a very precarious situation between the Saudi Arabia and the United\nStates and Iran loving us they're loving it do you think that the the crown princes that's stupid over there is he fiercely this dumb\nThat's why I'm like it would it be rogue agent because for a guy who was able to get into power and kind of neutralize those who opposed him jailed other members of the family I mean he seemed to be pretty smart and doing that this would be\nA tactical this is taxable idiocy to do something this stupid\nWhenever something like this I was thinking about I'm not I'm not saying that he's not capable of this but I'm just saying it kind of out of character but there's an option to look at that you wouldn't before and that is\nWho would want to frame of these guys like who would want to frame him oh anybody in Iran you know what I'm exactly\nSo there was a love for the state would love for this to spill over into a result the end of a relationship with those is open up more questions we don't really know yet and neither does well according to what we know from the president we don't really know yet right we can't really draw any conclusions yet there's only possibilities\nYeah what I don't get and this was something that does Stephen ... brought up the name\nWhen how he said that he recorded something on his I watch and send it to the iCloud before he was that's not how that works well like I say I watch is the work that way yeah no it does not work that way I haven't I watch and just no other way around with you to do the yeah yeah it does not work that way at all um I\n[noise] so what we're hearing about the quote unquote audio recordings is that true like we don't even we can't verify that yet because you have to believe\nTurkey you have to believe the country run by or the one who is beating up Americans in the street when he came over here to visit so it's like jeeze\nReally transcripts right is what we have so we really have no audio prove we have no physical proof of any story any conclusion right now\nRight I mean there's I I don't think that there is now Trump has asked for audio and video he wants he wanted to be able to um\nDetermine and see that which I think yeah absolutely who should you know a show he's asked for that the thing is um\nThere was that there is a really good piece that Jay Jay McCullough wrote about the maturity of the the leadership and Saudi Arabia and he says a mature society would be able to handle a moderate dissident like them all ... the Saudi kingdom apparently could not the consequences seem clear he\nSays the reality is Saudi Arabia will remain a U.S ally regardless of how deep and disturbing Riaz involvement in the murder of journalists ... is ultimately revealed to be as Matthew Continetti recently emphasized there are certain geopolitical realities in particular a Cold War with Iran that make the Saudi American alliance a cornerstone of U.S foreign policy no matter how appalling their human rights record\nGet but what it does is it makes it harder to defend that's you know essentially what he's getting into and I just want to go back to what a Continetti had said a as well because he was talking about how what the and you have to consider this I mean it's just\nIt you have to consider this\nPrudent is the right response to all of this is what he had stated which I you know I think so\nUm this I'm a ...\nBecause of all the players involved because of ... because of Iran because of\nUm uh the\nAll the applications and the consequences that could result that could be a result of this\nUh it'd be a legal resident of the United states who lived in London and instability cause a symbol cause show the\nSaudis deny everything except you know maybe it's rogue agents and interrogation gone wrong Turkish authorities say he was murdered\nA and\nThere are so many implications of this and I see so many people in media who just want to skip over all of this and not employed ... and just go out guns blazing which is the wrong way to handle this we're going to talk more about it but we've got to
