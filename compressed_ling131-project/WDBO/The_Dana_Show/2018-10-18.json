know anything about it I'm sure drones fault why did took Trump just probably one of their cut him up in itself I mean we're almost to that point and I that I mean and that has been kind of what I've seen sort of over and over and over a first\nOff this I mean like I said this is nuance but nuances dead so it's like you can't even have an honest conversation about any of it I'm ... I I look at it like this if the if the Saudi prince\nWhich don't annoy by this guy why do you feed the trolls man why not just ignore him although I Do think\nWeird it's weird to me because the show he reportedly was alliance or says you know with the Muslim Brotherhood and Saudi Arabia hate the Muslim Brotherhood and I remember in Egypt before the revolution Hillary Clinton was totally behind the Muslim Brotherhood and Muslim Brotherhood had been banned there for a long time 'cause they were extremists\nAnd they didn't want anything to do with them and then when Hillary Clinton got involved and endorsed one of the guys that have been a little weird you know what I mean they've got a little sketch\nSo she's that was under the Obama administration they're completely just messing everything up I Will say that this administration is nothing like the previous in at the previous would have already been over there to try to do something to get behind you know ... trying to really have some sort of effect\nUh and get involved in metal and foreign policy that's why I think it's so hysterical some of the criticisms that I see on this administration because for crying out loud this administration back a dictator and Honduras\nLike they tried to really disrupt ... government and Honduran election let's not forget about what they did in Libya let's not forget about what they did with Egypt and how they back previously banned Muslim Brotherhood creating all sorts of hell and contributing to that ...\nOh I could go to I mean in theory I could go on and on and on so they have in terms of uh any kind of I mean it's sort of a joke that that the previous president received a Nobel Peace prize which was apparently as I understand it predicated on the fact that he got people from different countries to talk so bit will be at just due to and nobody cares but\nLook how many wars and she started in countries where you served in government CD stabilized in the process by the way when they could have went and got involved in something like Iran the green revolution and they pretended that wasn't even happening as the Iranian National Guard was or [noise] excuse me revolutionary guard which was was shooting people from rooftops\nAnd they ignored when Russia annexed Crimea so\nIt was just weird how it's almost like the people that\nThis balance of power had tipped away from up on the interest of the new administration it's almost like they're trying to get it flipped back see there's a lot of stuff going into this so and there's a lot more about the the ... the situation and oh here's a guy who wrote for the Washington Post that was murdered possibly murder by Saudi operative a\nAnd there's a lot more politics and activism and all kinds of stuff there that's that's involved with it but the thing like I said that that I think is\nIs asinine is if this Saudi prince this a crown prince was really bothered by this guy the way that you don't do it is to be really public can do it in Turkey because\nTurkey would love nothing more than just the Saudi Arabia screw up you definitely don't do it in a sample you definitely don't do it with people that are in your inner circle that are easily identifiable because they're seen with you whenever you travel including to the United states and within that\nSecurity would\nBreaking it with this red

traffic to do one two three two I'm Jackie O'Brian spin a news Ninety six point five red alert traffic advisory\nThe they're they're one in the same essentially because of the deals that they had the trade deals that they have with each other and Russia has Iran's back so do the same way that he does with a ... year Russia has a ... back in Syria so\nIt's all a power play Russia wants to be a kingmaker so that they can have control over the region meanwhile the United states has been allied with Saudi Arabia and they really would love to see this reformer made out to not be a reformer which is why he\nDoesn't himself zero favors if something like this happened right\nThen at the same time what how I mean we're we're we're ... alliances he um was a legal resident of the United states lived in London and and uh as simple as I understand that went to the Saudi embassy in Istanbul which he was there seven minutes before it was it was reported that he was killed\nUm he had previous alliances with the Muslim Brotherhood apparently angered the crown prince as well and he wrote things are undermining ah what the ... or or criticizing with the crown prince was doing\nSo there is it it's not and then that you know Mike Pompeo goes over there to have a conversation and you have the media that lives has there ever loving mind because like Wallace here because they think he's being used as a ... he's a damn diplomat who is representing the United states and going over to have discussions with someone to find out hey did you kill somebody\nOr at least people think it's going to happen on pay are going to go over there would be like hey crown prince you're cutting up what's up did you did you drop him off over and it's doable how ... how did it happen\nI mean diplomacy it's why it's not meant for ... ... it's it's an art I could not be a diplomat do you know why because I don't like blowing smoke A People's backside than I can only be nice if the one I don't lie for so long I mean I'm going to be real with you it takes a lot of energy for me to politely smile\nOh shock shut out of it you see what I'm saying if I can never be a diplomat a lot of these people can be a diplomat because they're simply dumb and it's just that's the bottom line\nThey were talking about his last column mil Jong because she'll she'll be the Washington Post his lifetime with the Arab world needs now is free expression and our media over here has they're really they're pushing the story because they're looking at at it as a way to indict Donald Trump\nThey're pushing the story because they want to say that the Saudi prince was inspired by Donald Trump word were in he's dead fake news is the enemy of the people and then the press lie to but to everybody and said oh no he said the president the enemy of the people\nAnd then they present these these you know botched soundbites where he you get half of it's not even half of a full sentence because they're desperately trying to make it out is though he declared war on depressed\nWhen ultimately it was the price that declared war on Donald Trump and as I was discussing this morning on Fox and friends it's really a lot of the chattering class that has declared war on the people who support this administration\nHe simply said fake news is the enemy of the people I think fake news is the enemy of the republic and\nAnd do an insane that he accurately called them up for what they're doing but I made the mad because they don't they don't want to deal with that so here we are\nSo they're trying to blame this on him they're saying the New York times says the president has cow town into a mad prints I don't see how and waiting for details to come in\nBut this is how this is what they're pushing they're trying to make this the focus for mid turns instead of the care of and that's gonna that's coming up from uh South America and we're going to talk more about that we also have a quick five on

Jeff light Kamala Harris who she's wanting to abuse her power to investigate journalists and I thought everyone\nWas supposed to support a free press I thought everybody supported a free press\nApparently not though apparently she doesn't well we're going to\nI Hope somebody asks come on media summer you had to give me the names of the people that are monitoring this debate tonight\n\nOr looks like we have Judy Woodruff of PBS NewsHour um you have St Louis Public Radio's Joe Manning's you have five on your side local anchor Mike Bush and then a question from the audience will be taken and be part of the debate as well and that will be facilitated by Ruth is ill of nine network\n... well the one of which I I guess I Am a fan of his uh I like Mike Bush I grew up with my ... my listed the whole thing with that guy who got killed in a plane crash\nThe other guy Mike what's his face not like Bob ... Bob Richards that guy dang that's old school I remember when it happened I was a kid and I didn't quite understand exactly everything that's going on it's on Bush has been around he's like a he's like a fixture in my home town but I think he'll be I think he'll do decent job 'cause I've always seen him very professional very buttoned up\nAnd you don't really know which way he leans so I anticipate he'll do the job and I kind of stay the same for the others after him and he's might be afterwards but after that Mm\nBut in civil fashion slick leaning left type organizations that are moderate is it only an hour\nTo be honest with you I don't know they need for people for an hour for moderators for an hour\nWill three moderators in one facilitating be the crowd is part of moderation but\nYou know we got PBS NewsHour it's not necessarily in the left leaning but I Would say ... is left of center St Louis public radio left of center\nI'm you know the nine network definitely left of center so that's usually how we see these debates go as far as moderators are concerned yeah um it's rare that we see like a conservative moderate or do these things yeah\nI agree I agree ah\nAnd I and I don't like I said I don't even know Bush's conservative and my question is can tie or not I have no sign of a journalist I yeah I shouldn't know that's the thing if you're doing your job I should know you all should not know where they lean\nOr you should be confused about it if they're doing their job and that's the problem because real reporting like that you got to be a little cells list you know you have to be selfless with it no one gives a crap what the report or think they want to know about the facts involved that's it and uh\nUnfortunately as you've seen which in the cost of too many are interested in in in starting their own viewpoints and their own opinions and their own biased into it and those people are celebrated so it's like a just a vicious cycle it just you know it it rewards that so they want to do it again\nAnyway so we'll we'll say oh goodness meanwhile MSNBC is trying to prop up desperately beta O'Rourke Robert or work he's got that CNN town hall the night listen to this ridiculous headline beta or Rory\nCampaign has transcended politics to become something of a political cultural for not phenomenon Mm [noise]\nLike his car transcended the road when he was driving drunk and almost killed a bunch of people and then try to flee the scene according to police the record that he denied and the previous debate that none of the moderators question him about\n[noise] wow\nI uh they're trying very very hard to making the thing to make them happen\nI just I I I don't know he seemed so a fake not a ... I mean they're Democrats than I Do like he's not one of them he just seems incredibly fake I I just you know\nAnd you know and that makes me think of Claire McCaskill\nI think if she wasn't so focused on retaining power she might be nice\nI think she has the potential I think she's got it without that you would that you would you know that you think she might be nice you might get along with her\nBut my gosh just sit here and go well they just committed fraud well what did they do they recorded me saying things [noise] was it ... yeah okay so how was that fraud they recorded them okay we'll Missouri's one party consent so what was friday went about it\nDo they miss represent you know they record it exactly what I said and presented it wholly accurately\nHow was that fraud well I didn't like what they did\nThat doesn't constitute fraud though the Republicans I don't even think James has a party affiliation Josh Hawley did it Josh how it doesn't actually I don't even think know James but I think that they would probably prefer you don't get in office so again I come back to my original question how was that fraud aside from the fact that you didn't like us that are\nCrickets maybe some of the media can ask her about it like an hour on the way for the [noise]\nThe point five day be with him or led by new sound window solution because\nAnd week to say that\nPeople who go to Trump rallies all of the Trump supporters that they support him because of racism or sexism or whatever this has been attacked higher talking point that Democrat he is every single election because their policy sucks so bad and they're still demonstrably just awful for the country\nThey have to fall back and go well if you don't like our higher taxes and us wanted to take your gun well then maybe he'll vote for us because the Republicans are all white and they'll kill all the black people I mean there's just the way it is that he's going to vote for\nYou gonna vote for the people who are going to bring back slavery and then you I mean people have actually said that the crazy thing is I'm not being not exaggerating people actually said this\nSo I you know I just think ... I it it to the people like this talking had slam\nAll Trump supporters as being that you must be nice for you because all those same people Trump expanded the Republican Party now they created more Republicans but by bringing some of those moderate Democrats and they would have retired that if they didn't support lockstep to last them in a straight and then they racist or something or if they didn't appreciate Hillary Clinton fully they were\nIt is or something I mean it's constant it's always with these that's always when I hear from progressive and all of those moderate Democrats were going to have to vote for Clinton all of those years but the moment they decided to switch it up and support somebody who's actually talking about jobs and trade the economy and immigration\nWell then are immediately called racist says oh what they weren't raises the whole time they were voting for Clinton thoroughly racist now because they're voting for Trump because he's not telling everybody what pronouns to you\nHave a million seat I just I find that to be the weakest form of commentary it is so weak and on entertaining it's victim payment that's what it is I just can't\nAnd I love by the way the conservative that quote unquote conservative who found themselves a little ... cottage industry by trading on the identity of a Republican or conservative while simultaneously ... bashing every conservative principle or Republican Party platform so as to sell books and get contributor ship deal good at figuring that out but everybody sees through it\nThen it's just it's stupid not as dumb as this though oh boy let's get ready go can you play for me that oh my gosh this is the stupidest thing ever played for me to quit that quick here and I was saying\nYeah here nightly basis or daughters watching Disney Princess movies because of the negative stereotypes toward women [noise]\nThirty three year old actor says three year old lady with her husband James writing it as a real movies including Cinderella and the Little Mermaid have been banned from their house or because of the way they suggest women or nothing without the prince charming\nSpeaking during an appearance on the older generation show on Tuesday or job within the here's a Cinderella fan because she waves around for rich ...
