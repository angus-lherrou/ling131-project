I don't know who the check was that she was talking to and I don't do we care no we don't care\nThat was a train wreck of an interview she completely she changed her story all I I I like the media it's like well she's walking back from Clinton in ... babies let's do it for one second girlfriend did not walk back claims girlfriend changed our whole story so audio somebody twenty this is just a bit of that\nInterview that was a that was ridiculous listen to this\nAnd wondering if one of those people with cats\nI cannot specifically say that he was one of the ones who assaulted me but before\nThis happened to me at that party I saw that catalog there\nI saw mark judge there and they were hanging about the area\nI started to feel disoriented\nWere three was and where the other boys were hanging out\nLaughing ... so she is changing some of her story already um and there was even more of this because she was she started walking things back she started changing and things and it just\nIt just it didn't do her any favors whatsoever I'm audio soundbites I'm On the ... yeah yeah yeah that's because I have so much a this is when she because remember she repeatedly talked about like much listen to this one\nThey just said Brett Kavanaugh you spike in a punch a hole I saw I saw him given red solo cups to quite a few girls during that time frame and their ... parties and\nWould not take one of those glasses from\nWork out at my work catalogs say I saw him around the punch\nI won't say bowls are the punch containers I don't know what he did but I saw him by them\nWhat what [noise] way I'm Sorry what [noise] what I saw him by him which is just like raping people and spike in their punch\nThat is not in any way accurate that's not accurate\nThat that's not that's not a ... that's not that\n[laughter] [noise] I'm I'm I just what\nThat is a completely different because she said she actually she saw him\nPreviously so how does this way I Will how does this change\nHow for real does is ... how you change your story that much 'cause we run or claims when they first came out okay so um\nThere's more yet and there's more with the purchase the laptop you get a bonus laptop for when you just want to solve the vegetables into pieces\nSo I have so so so much but yeah we're at there's yeah there is even more so as she was talking with MSNBC this Julie sweat neck oh by the way ... case that was Kate Snow I don't know if she had NBC's Kate Snow again this is one in BC was like well we couldn't corroborate a single thing and\nWe reached out to people who say they've never even heard of this woman was just in\nOur face what we want to do here is lay out all that she said her story our report and we want to be very transparent because these are very serious allegations Kavanaugh\nHas called Julie sweat next story nonsense as far as the president today question her credibility and NBC News for the record has not been able to independently verify her claim there are things that she told us on camera\nThat differ from a written statement we've been trying to independently to reach out to anyone who remembers attending parties which are with what they can Brett Kavanaugh and we've been asking her attorney for names so far we've not found anyone who remembers that\nYet I haven't found anybody remembers literally anything [noise] [noise] yeah they they sat down with the accuser but they couldn't verify any over claims wow I don't know why it is that people don't believe media wow Cain I don't I don't understand why people do not trust the media\nSo shocked much wow [noise]\nI mean how dare they how dare Brett Kavanaugh gets upset over smears that the media is pushing of him I mean how dare he do that the way he reacted to that made up story\nAnd his indignation well that just shows that he's unfit for the Supreme Court I mean you should be able to come they react to stories and that are made up about you and accusations that haven't been substantiated and have your family dragged through the mud and your daughters attacked with death and your wife threatened that your good name ruined I mean come on out there you get mad\nNot very judicial to get mad when we're like making stuff up about you and then pushing on substantiated and uncorroborated claim I mean\nCome on and humid and we uh what is the stigma\nSwimming um her her lawyer of nodding yes he's claiming that his clients the guy who you are dirty ... come to life exactly cut their payments him trying to explain was quoted backtrack on the whole point oh this was my favorite yes yes yes listen to this this is a ...\nA shaded and the declaration I understand you are used different\nOne of her friends in foreign Kerr\nOf what she just put in the declaration of what was accustomed to in the declaration and last night at ten forty to you I had a telephone conversation with a woman who will go unnamed who lives in Florida who told me directly that mark judge\nAnd ... which by the porch with great uncle ...\n[noise] [noise] [noise]\nI think I saw ... a a grand alcohol and Cleveland open up for justice are tall back\nIn the day you know I when I I don't know when do they tore it opened with the snake nicks that's right yeah yeah exactly yeah drink that punch was the song um\nI just don't believe any of that and by the way when you're trying to seem super credible\nI just think when you're sitting down like how can I make it to where people can believe me you know let's go to this guy who's so far hasn't really had a lot of game and his clients are students getting tossed out of court his last client I feel like Michael ...\nI feel as though he actually exploits women rather than help women this is a guy who I mean can you be successful on his own or does he have to have a woman to exploit in order to to push out there and get his name out there so he can do press the ladder\nI mean that's ... ... it's like he praised up on those situations and then exploit women\nTo get his name out there\nThat's what it really seems like and anyone who disagrees with me as a sexist no I'm just to play his game but that's I mean it really it seems a lot like that right and why can't you just do is you know do a thing on his own\nAnd then he goes on to say how ludicrous with his claim that his client has no credibility what it's ludicrous\nIt's ludicrous to think that someone who came to me Michael Evan id ... lacks credibility I and the most credible person in the United states of America that's ludicrous it's coded loving you want to hear that we've got to go to break because I Want to make sure we get quick that I've been I've been cheating everybody who do\nIt's ludicrous for his first of all one lawsuit was filed it was almost immediately dismissed claims by her ex boyfriend I mean who doesn't have an ex boyfriend or natural friends of mine said bad things about him\nOh my gosh I'm not going to make it there that's okay I really tried there's a difference between saying yeah she was kind of a bitch and yeah she tried killing my kid she's psycho and she threatened my wife and child\nThat's a huge difference huge difference\nApparently there's a paper trail ... okay let's let him today I I just couldn't like it in stride again\nThis case was also immediately thrown out dismiss there was no education or determination relating to the validity of any of these play I'm\nSorry I got to this I got to come in again one more time the you're telling me that what his ... the ex boyfriend of his client he claims she's nuts and tried to kill people or or threatened at least his wife and child he claimed she did something but that's not true but whatever the hell she claims totally true\nReally I mean can you just tasted irony or your lawyer that\nI Know irony I Need the beautiful thing if you had a magical dictionary where you open it and then an experience would manifest to define the particular word for what you were searching it would be this one for irony\nIt really would is there more than I let him finish [noise] although it's thank heavens I'm like I Can't I don't think I can

abolishing it from his cup that isn't that something that they like I don't know I this is just [noise]\nSo [noise] ah to other things too I have a couple of things here that we are when they get to I have the this is news coming out of Houston two people were hospitalized after a\nWhite substance was sent to Senator Ted Cruz is office oh the ninth floor of the Phoenix tower was evacuated the evacuation order was later lifted but the hazmat team they said it was a a they tested negative out earlier in the day or the Pentagon got some rice than\nThey were sent right then\nAnd what is it there were a ... and ... out of cruises offers to people\nApparently were taken to the hospital I don't know if it was out of precaution or what it was a but then with the Pentagon the uh they said that there were two pieces of mail sent to the facility and they tested positive for rice in and of course now they're investigating the origins of the male\nSo that's kinda dang wire people send and stuff like that to senator Cruz's office\n\nOh with because they probably don't like his politics and that makes it acceptable oh but throwing ISIS wrong shut up can't deal I Can't even deal a list I Am kind of gone I'm not really following my surprise aren't really following my I'm rundown but\nSo the uh Robert or Rourke this goes along with the ice thing\nHe says he is a shame that he I apparently I guess he got wind that there was going to be this article coming out about him that I don't know I'm just assuming where he talked about Broadway actresses who's quote only qualification seems to be their phenomenally large breasts and type but hawks yeah\nAh yeah you're in I'm Sorry you're not appointed and so he apologized of review he wrote of the will Rogers Follies he says there is no excuse for making disrespectful or demeaning comments about women\n...\nHe's a pilot and so if he was not a Democrat he would not be given a pass number one and I think everybody everybody are all knows that he would not be given a pass\nBut he did this Broadway he did his review of a Broadway musical while he was a student at Columbia University in Nineteen Ninety One and it was the will Rogers fall as he wrote it for the Columbia daily spectator under the name Robert or Rourke\n'cause that's his name not the other one he's tried to appropriate and he said that the show was one of the

glitzy and tacky one cannot help feeling disgusted throughout the show he's carrying in the lead role is surrounded by permit smile actresses who's only qualification seemed to be their phenomenally

democratic attacks on the judge on\nCorroborated unbelievable money\nWhile top Democrat Charles Schumer said the credibility of Kavanaugh is an issue\nThis man does not belong on the Supreme Court Republicans\nOr they just actually ended up walking it back literally as well I just saw that story hit as we were on break show what they did was they were trying to suggest that Kavanaugh was reaching out to a classmate about Ramirez because he was he had guilty knowledge of what was happening but that isn't true in fat\nOr his own public transcribe the now public transcript completely dispute this but it shows that the friends uh it ... they added and they didn't add more to their excerpt until later today\nBut they said that a Kevin all this is how they said Kevin all claim that it was Ramirez who was quote calling around to classmates trying to see if they remembered it end quote adding that it quote strikes me as you know\nWhat is going on here when someone is calling around to try to refresh other people is that what's going on what is going on was that that doesn't sound that doesn't sound good to me it doesn't sound fair it sounds like an orchestrated hit to take me out\nBut this is what he said verbatim they didn't even get his quote right quote\nThey couldn't the New York times couldn't corroborate the story and found that she was calling her on her classmates trying to see if they remembered it and I at least and I myself I heard about that that she was doing that and you know they're just strikes me as what's going on here when someone is calling around trying to refresh other people is that what's going on what is going on with that in ...\nSo he had heard that Ramirez was calling around from about in that same Senate testimony or that they were calling around trying to get people to refresh her recollection about something he had no idea what it was but it was about something\nAnd so he and he's\nQuoted in the New Yorker story additionally the one that Ramirez came out and saying that he had no idea about it prior to the publication\nBut nobody I mean\nNobody mentioned that and then NBC had to go back an update their story they did so without any any editor's note any acknowledgement or anything about how his testimony in a New Yorker piece et cetera completely contradicts the claims that were made\n[noise] um\nAnd I and NBC admitted that Ramirez was calling mutual friends for weeks looking for dirt on him and that and the transcript they um they\nAdmitted or they ignored the fact they didn't include that in the original story they made it sound like it was cabinet that was calling around looking for stuff when in fact his friends had said something is going around she's calling around all these different people for weeks looking for dirt they didn't even mention that\nWhile I don't even know why they didn't even mention it they wanted to they wanted a Russian and report it and they didn't even get it they didn't even get it properly so to now my point um the New York times finally just um\nThey because they've had they've had so many poor pieces so now that was just recently changed and then a story that came out Kavanaugh was questioned by police after a bar fight Nineteen eighty five\nOr the woman who wrote that Emily ... she is a partisan who had tweeted ridiculous stuff about Cavanaugh I'm essentially accusing him of being a gang rape best all this stuff I Believe in all of the claims that came out and and basically pronouncing his guilt or at least that's what she intimate intimate and so\nUh now it looks horrible that this that the New York times is big story about the ice thing and how it's apparently a bar fight\nOr that now they had to come out\nBecause it was her big scoop they had to admit that it was wrong for them to have this writer\nRun with this story because she's proven herself to be surprisingly partisan oh no no joke Sherlock right do you see the media is
