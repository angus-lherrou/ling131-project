they're not they're not skipping Mexico right they're not skipping Mexico\nAnd this is going to be a big issue and and here's the thing is it a big issue at the right time for Republicans Trump's going to be a ... you know Trump's going to be in in in Arizona\nFor the big mic Sally lot of people are thinking potentially that he's going to make a announcement\nWhile he's in Arizona that they could be sending troops or something there but this comes at a time on the back of of of Kavanaugh\nAnd all of a sudden this this excitement and enthusiasm wasn't there for the Republicans came out of nowhere and kind of backfired on the Democrats and now they're enthusiasm is at the same level or higher now all of a sudden you've got another caravan coming here and some people are saying if\nIt's if you will the enthusiasm and this is is hitting at the right time and may cause even more excitement and enthusiasm\nFor Republican voters this election as a wife and the struggle with a left wing movement which ones to radicalize America you know you're happy\nThat they're more people to work two people off of food stamps event there were no longer dependent on government so if you're a left wing Democrats has actually bad not good I have a production view I think two words are going to define the names of two thousand Eighteen election and then I was one is kind of an ... and the other is caravan\nYeah absolutely\nAbsolutely because you know I've got friends who are over progress of this ... this guy's texted me talking about you know as we had ... people talking about oh this guy's to walk away and his friends as liberal friends won't talk to any more 'cause he walked away from the Democratic party and stuff I have plenty of friends who were progressive\nAnd you know they're saying they they love other cultures but they don't want to open borders\nBut they love other cultures but at some point in time we've got to start dealing with this in a real way\nAnd we're not and both sides have failed I continue to say both sides of failed but is this the perfect storm that will keep the enthusiasm because like everything else people get excited remember how big Kavanaugh was two three weeks ago none narrow word any more narrow word\nIt's kind of slowly but surely dissipated and now people are talking about the fact that there may be a lot of voters would stay home on both sides of the Iowa amid terms and it's not going to be the excitement that people think there's going to be out there and and all of a sudden you've got this happening and it could be ... be a\nHuge perfect storm to energize potentially both parties if Trump handles it wrong but really I think the opportunity here for Trump and the Republicans to handle this is right in front of them\nCombination of anger over how the left smeared engaged in character assassination lied used bullying tactics was judge Kavanaugh is going to be one part of this and the degree to which the left his anger\nTo have three thousand people have caravans across the American border break American law recognizing that if that happens next caravan will even bigger than their parents are going to have so that will be even bigger\nYeah and where does it end and what do we do at this point in time both sides need to start figuring something out sooner rather\nThan later and I don't think any side really wants to take it on or Mitch McConnell days and you know I think we can take on Obamacare I think we're going to really he he's he's trying to stoke some enthusiasm people that that ship sailed as far as a lot of people are concerned and you've lost that opportunity and you've failed when you had the chance to do something\nAnd and he came out and even went as far as saying there's no way we're going to get rid of some of the aspects that people like an Obamacare like preexisting conditions there looking for something to keep the enthusiasm going and this may be that storm that lands\nAre opportunistic late in the lap of the Republicans it's a possibility\nIt is but it is a frustrating thing because these are human beings whose lives are being you know a centrally used their pawns in this game of politics\nThat they it sucks it absolutely one hundred and ten percent sucks it sucks for us as Americans as residents of taxpayers of people have done it the right way\nAnd it's also for them that both sides are using them in a way that they don't quite understand because what they're looking for a lot of them is just a better opportunity in a way of life because their countries for all intents

passenger seat and apologies if it gets a little uncomfortable but how does it feel to be at the mercy of someone who thinks a random taxed and more important than your life someone who takes their

land turns first for breaking news twenty four hours a day\nFrom ABC News\nMean you think that we have this person has been let go you got to distance yourself from that if you're I guess you would think so yeah so here is a ... reaction to the whole debacle ...\nInside of terrified I I thought you know how could that happen how could come in like leaning will cut out that publicly on you know I kind of walk around in everyday life on like a people when they look at me that they know what happened in ... and\nOn for now line\nWhen I Walk around and I know that they know that you know like a little traverse the rest of my life I'll have to hold that that that title at a survivor and that wasn't my choice I never I never made that choice in the first place right now I'm getting a little bit\nOkay just as an observation her reaction what she's observation here the other way she's reacting to this is what you would expect from someone that didn't want their name out there that all of a sudden\nIs out there yeah that's why I think it was curious to a lot of people Dr Christine Ford did not have the same reaction that I wasn't I've heard that this ... this has come out I Do not want to just to be and I'm very I Want to know how this happened\nI see what you're saying yeah you didn't see that much it's curious yeah now what you're saying no one from the campaign has reached out to her no one has tried to apologize to her nothing like that and she doesn't know\nOh what they could do as far as making it right even if they could ...\nYou know what kind of already and gang on any that get put out there already air sat around and we can't really [noise]\nIt really is it's a horrible thing that someone goes through I mean it's one thing when you're talking about it with a counselor you're getting help but then to have your name out there for everyone and all of your neighbors know yeah everyone you work with now knows and you didn't want that information out there because it's painful\nAll for political gain right that's freaking disgusts\nMe in a lot of these people they don't they don't care about women they don't care about survivors they care about using them as political props that's all it's about it's true and\nI'm not saying Republicans never do something like that I'm not saying that mhm okay it's politicians in general but yeah certainly happens a lot with this particular party yeah gash dang okay and more on that a little bit later on the big migrant caravan is on its way oh yeah caravan\nOf migrants making their way to the U.S border has swelled to four thousand people\nA lot of kids are they're traveling with or without parents and there are two groups now they split into two groups and they are well they're they're moving on into Mexico up to the U.S border\nAnd there is a lot of I Would say ... about this whole thing about their expectations once they get to the U.S border and why would that be because we've been inundated with the message that the U.S has to take in anybody in the numbers are up\nOh the actual illegal immigration numbers yeah that was a new report that came out I saw an interesting criticism saying that this is the president's fault and I I don't understand how you could possibly have that take because the president I mean there were clumsy attempts at points\nTo enforce immigration law but the president's been adamant about trying to do this\nBut Democrats are the ones who are out there banging the drum saying abolish ice what's were for a border patrol what's let everybody and if you say you want to enforce our borders your hateful you're anti immigrant you're anti or racist all of these things yeah they've led to the red carpet getting rolled out\nThis is if I'm running for Congress right now as a Republican I'm banging the drum every single day is that Democrats have made this issue worse\nBecause they've made it clear they sent the they've sent the Warner ... they've sent a signal out there that says we're open for business come on it\nAnd we're not going to do anything about it yes I mean and this was what you I think we're referring to earlier David talking about the expectation from people in the care of and oh yeah you and I saw this this was again on CNN yesterday yes\nAnd then they man who's making the journey with her four children believe should be allowed in terms of us\nAre heading to the United states we're going to arrive with Donald Trump he has to receive that kisses he received the Americans over here they will have to accept us over there\nAnd the thing is where does someone get that idea you have to receive us You're not understanding how this works that doesn't mean people don't have compassion for the situation that you're in it and what you're running from\nAnd there are a lot of people that give the causes to help people in those situations\nBut you have to have an immigration system you have to have borders there has to be a legal way to get through and seriously when you're talking about everyday hardworking Americans the open borders thing does not make sense\nThe Democrats are totally out of step with that if I'm a part of the Republican Party that's what I market in my ... do you want this you won't open borders I Would be showing\nVideo of antifa you weren't law and order if you do here's your party if you don't here's your other party this this is what you're inviting\nI totally out of step so we'll see what happens there because a lot of the media are covering the caravan in a way of we should let them all in you know there should be open borders that's that's\nAlso crazy carefully forgetting how few years ago well now one of the favorites of the Democratic party would be Joe Biden actually went down to Central America and said don't send your kids to the border\nYeah you're not going to get in oh the messaging has changed so much in just a few years right now that far left as really they don't get over the party it's it's pretty wild [laughter] okay go ahead and say your catchphrase you can't wait if you don't play Jamie\nYeah about my catchphrase which is true talking about mega millions of them do what it over nine hundred million dollars yes and you're not you're not interested in spending a dollar on a ticket you can't get addicted if you don't do drugs either go right ahead [laughter]\nI don't ... I don't think I I'm not an addict to it every once in a while I then I fully admit I pay my idiot tax that's what it is\nThe first step to knowing there is a problem and I don't care if anybody plays a lot of I don't you know I don't every time though I'm\nYou know it's like the the lead of the today show they're talking about it so what would you do with the money it's like people are throwing away a whole lot of money on this that shouldn't be throwing it away\nBut hey hey but the dollar you're not throwing away a whole lot of money yeah but we all know that do that are dropping twenty ... you know that really can't afford it\nHey go ahead get wind if you don't play that yeah that's really it you know what you need to do if you've got the office bull what's that get it in writing all absolutely how many times have you heard that story of you know somebody goes in\nA way of either the office or a friend of theirs are a couple of friends and then the person who bought the ticket runs off with it [noise] it\nSo there was a whole piece in USA Today talking about the dirty dozen twelve co workers at Peter Pan old world bakery in Chicago heights won a hundred and Eighteen million in two thousand twelve they were ecstatic\nAnd then everybody else was like hey it while I was a part of that it took three years in six law firms to settle the dispute wow ... got six million a wild six others then split Thirteen point eight\nBut as the story goes no one got a penny while the fight was tied up in record and they say the simple lesson and you're like you said it's seen as so many times you've got to get it in writing\nBecause there are a lot of people pooling their money together now to play you know and get the jackpot they said only participate in a lottery group with people you know and trust so of course\nIf you got twelve people you work with are you ... for all of them\nI don't know I guess it also depends on your relationship with the co workers yeah I mean I Would never went to in turn off his poor I wasn't the guy holding the winning tickets [noise] I Know that well if it's a ... I Need to be made whole you know I don't I don't like to not be whole eight people\nYou'd be like hey I'm not playing unless I hold the ticket now that would probably make the other is a little bit nervous [laughter] but they also say and make sure that if you do happen to when you don't tell a soul\nYeah don't do all the people will come out of the woodwork and all that and I that's the ... or if you do tell anybody or of your name winds up in the paper because in most states you you wind up you know being they wind up being publicized you are you just learn the phrase no is a complete sentence [noise]\nIt's harder for some people than others\n[laughter] well I just want to give them a little just a little help and hand it seems like this business venture they're asking but he's really going to be successful I mean what's twelve million dollars that hundred million dollars right well it'll be interesting to see where it all goes uh we also got to get to the big controversy in
