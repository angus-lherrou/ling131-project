you could see that as I Do love hearing from you're talking about civility throughout the\nDay and and you know some of things I think we need to do and and and it is we need to push forward as a nation and start demanding that our leaders started to act in an appropriate way we've heard you know everything from yes or a kids I'm going to say it from you know we're gonna we're gonna go low\nRight that that's what\nEric Holder came out and said you know and and ... and he said you know no no offense to Michelle Obama but you know we're not going to go hide anymore when they go low we are just going to go alone this is the new Democratic Party and and I just sit back and I'm thinking how do we get to the point where we can start having civil dialogue because why should anybody want to have civil dialogue\nWith anybody\nIf you're looking at the people that are supposed to be your leaders right they're supposed to be the ones who are studying the example and the tone and there is no tone anymore and the question is are we setting the tone or they setting the tone and they're just ... and we're following them are they following us\nRight who's following hey\nThat's a very good question who's following who is at this moment in time\nI Wonder that I Do I Wonder are they taking their cue from us\nBecause they're looking out there and saying wow look at this look at look at look at what's going on there and and I think and here's the other thing to part of it is is our tribalism right our tribalism that we have right now where it's the reds versus the blues right it's the right versus the left it's a conservative or is it the progressive\nThis this that the social justice warriors are out there you've got the alt right crazies that are out there you've got all of these things that are going on out there and I think in many ways politicians are taking a bit of a cue from us and they're afraid they're afraid\nBecause\nSocial media has now given everybody of voice and where they may want to reach across the aisle the fear is me reaching across the aisle isn't going to look good me reaching across the aisle isn't going to be good for anybody\nMe reaching across party because even though we've got to build that we want to put together even though we've got something here because you voted yes for Kavanaugh or no for cabinet this that and the other me seemed to work with you is is is conspiring with the enemy and that isn't good at all\n\nIs it it's not good at all and we've got this situation where you've got people like Eric Holder coming out and saying\nBrazil always and these are all over you know you don't when they go low we go [laughter]\nGo low we [noise]\n\nWe don't even more disturbing people are ... clapping for that like oh yeah that's right that's what we do that is exactly what we do\nThat to me is is is is just\nAs sad as saying that and I found it to me you know I didn't like the people are texting in and saying you know what about this you know what I didn't like it general perfect example she waived her finger in front of President Trump's face when she was on the tarmac I didn't like that I think it's a better way to handle that\n\nI think there's better ways to handle certain situations that we've had in the way we treat each other but I also think that we are now painting politicians into a corner that we're not going to allow them the opportunity to be civil anymore to one another because the fear is if you do something when a primary ...\nWill take you out if you don't do urban this group here I mean Susan Collins gave an impassioned thoughtful speech last friday about Kevin why she was going to vote for ...\nAnd she was destroyed for it right she was absolutely just destroyed for it and that was

they feel like you have to pay the price now for going against even your own time and that is insane that doesn't help anybody as a push any conversation fourth and I like civilian conversations I don't know when we we I think conversations and debate is a totally lost art for\nWho they totally lost art form sitting down and talking to people has become a lost art form of just being able to have a conversation with one another that doesn't end up and people screaming at one another but\nI I think the question is it is is are they taking their cues from us are we taking their cues from them and I think a lot of ways\nThey're taking it from us and they're afraid their justice frayed of their constituents that voted them in any more as they are the other side the vote against them because they know how vicious their side could be three two three\nFive three twenty four twenty three ...

Trump day they had lunch and a and it didn't date when we're talking about civility and the lack of civility with our politicians and with each other and the tribalism uh it it it is very interesting but one thing I Will say about that is the one thing that\nPeople forget when it comes to people make things in the cheapest place possible is because consumers want the cheapest products possible rarely do we want to spend more money for something\nSometimes you've got money and you know they look there's certain things that you're not going to skimp on right you know there's certain things

talk about the hack it was something about when I put\nOff and make you feel like Superman\nOur favorite\nThere you go made him Superman the favorite superhero [noise] so I don't know what's going to come out of this day but the reality is that I think in a day when we're sitting here talking about civility and we need to talk more and more about stability that\nWe absolutely have to start thinking to ourselves how do we start treating each other in a better way what is it that we do how can we improve the situation\nIs it us that is causing our politicians to follow our lead out of fear of the reaction we may give if they dare talk to the enemy or we following their lead\n\nOr we following them I don't think so\nI think it's as much give and take as it gets because I think there's a lot of people out there that are putting pressure on politicians and just like CEOs of companies are terrified\nOf anything that might come in any way that they might get destroyed in social media I think politicians have gotten to the point where they're terrified of the same thing\nSo they've got a one up themselves I see what the social justice warriors it's not you you can't be progressive how progressive or you will you think you're progressive well I'm going to be more aggressive and I'm going to be more of this I'm going to be more of this and I feel that's a lot of

doing heading into next year one thing for sure is Medicare and courage coming out\nOf people get confused by this uh it it can be a very stressful time for people joining us now is Dr least McAdams acting regional administrator of the southwest regional office of the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid services so uh what's different about these cards here ...\nSays the new Medicare card that people will be receiving in their mail by the end of October I'm no longer has there's such a Social Security number on it a deal with Medicare will be receiving a brand new number a in an effort to help a voice fraud and protect their identity\nIs that was it was at a big issue is that's why they're they're switching out of this because the fact is I wouldn't want\nMy my Social Security card I don't know if I Want my ah my Social Security number on anything [laughter]\nYeah that's true it it it is an issue that we've seen a an increasing\nA number of issues with identity theft\nAnd where people take your Social Security number and use it to open a bank accounts or or credit cards and your name\nAnd said we really want to avoid that for people with Medicare a and a and one way that we can do that is to get the Social Security numbers off of their Medicare cards on and give them a a brand new number that doesn't identify with their Social Security number at all\nWhich is a very good a thing and I know but a lot of people are are asking and this is something that goes I was talking to somebody about this the other day\nBecause anytime something changes right you know even though it is changing for a reason to protect her identity and things of that nature the big question is is is this going to change my benefits how is this going to affect me 'cause people a lot you know when you don't have the information you allow things run wild and your head\nYeah it can be confusing but people with Medicare should understand that their coverage isn't changing their benefits aren't changing 'em all that's changing is the number on the card on the court also has a little bit a different look to it so they shouldn't be surprised by that\nUm that once I get it they can take it and use it just like they get their medical card before\nWith their doctors and their providers\nWhich is a very good thing talking to Dr Lisa McAdams ah she's the acting regional administrator for the southwest regional office of the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid services\nOr so people can be seen as how many are going out because and and do a lot of people even know about this because I think that's part of the problem is when I started talking about this ah people didn't quite understand why they were doing this and again there's that fear factor of of trying to figure out why and some people who thought oh this is going to be a fraud so I'm not going to take this Medicare card\nYeah well in the state of New Mexico we have four hundred thousand people with Medicare will be receiving a new card across the country they're sixteen million people with Medicare and so we've been sending these out and wave\n'em and for a New Mexico the wave is now a so they should be receiving their card by the end of October\nDo they need to do anything in particular so does anybody need to call anything or is this just going to be done on their own and then they get ... what do they do with their old cards\nThere is not anything that they need to do\nUm they don't need to pay any won a we won't be calling down intact Medicare will never call a unsolicited people with Medicare I'm so that they do get one of those calls they should call one eight hundred Medicare number and report that immediately because that fraud\nUm and then once they get their new card they should destroy the old one that old one that has a Social Security number on it um and when I say destroy I'm an cut it up\nInto little pieces shred it burn it something that makes it impossible for somebody to see that Medicare number that old security number on there any longer\nYou know again that's in this day and age with the whole Social Security thing and having your number out there like that fraud how how ramp it was\nThe fraud [noise] um well it's it it is a growing problem um with the Social Security numbers bang out there um fraudsters are out there they do tend to pry on our senior citizens\nOn and so we want to do everything that we can to help prevent that and protect the identity at our table with Medicare\nAbsolutely so let's just say for the sake of argument you are listening to this right now are they there podcast listening to live and they want to figure out exactly how they go about checking to see when their cars going to get there what what's happening what

freak out of this and you know it was going to happen right because President Trump can't do anything right in the eyes of some people here he just made so so so light of this very serious catastrophe that hit\nThe Florida Panhandle he's just calling it a speed stir there's no empathy\nThought he was talking about prayers and thoughts with people and we're going to do everything possible know do whatever they need and will spare no expense\nAnd how dare how dare Donald Trump hold a rally in Pennsylvania last night while there are people under the gun right now in Florida\nSo I guess I

they clearly for some people on the panhandle of Florida words to evaluate you certainly president doing what emergency authorities are starting to many didn't weren't those warnings\nIt wasn't red meat was clam chowder [laughter]\nYeah and his point that he made was that Trump went after Obama campaigning after Hurricane Sandy and it's like All right Chris if you are so upset by this let's bring out the tapes were you took Obama to task\nFor the same thing okay there aren't there aren't any yet by just died on it out there just in case here um and you know Christmas just worried about anyone who might be in the storm's path right so this is why he has so much empathy and then they go live in the field to somebody standing on the beach okay\nThis storm is expected to me that I'm

putting people in harm's way [noise]\nLook I mean the whole thing is a joke just let it go yeah but I'm not surprised not too many people are paying attention you had coordinated or just a couple of years ago coordinated terror attacks in Europe and Obama's doing the tango\nAnd nobody says a word about it if you ever criticized for that\nYou were called well you're just a hater and possibly a racist because you're going against Brock Obama the chosen one\nYes I mean listen there is hypocrisy in all of us I mean we talk about this I can remember about being at the ball game and I was so fed up by that time I forget what else was going on but it was it was like optics do rarely\nThat was that was the coordinator terror attacks I think that was in Belgium I think that ... there were several terror attacks and he's taken in a baseball game in Cuba\nCow town to a communist regime while the world is burning\nAnd nobody says die or nobody has a thing about it\nNow and a lot of people were like he should have been on the phone ... but at that that was a different thing so I mean if there is a pie crust the other way around I Will admit that but stop at Chris Matthews\nGive me a break with that yeah so President Trump by the way was asked about this uh after you know after all the criticism came out or he was on with uh what's your name Shannon brame on Fox News last night asked about the criticism okay\nWell it really didn't go they would also criticizing the problem I imagine and there's this was set up a long time ago we had ... people lined up\nFrom yesterday I mean literally they say twenty four hours and sometimes more than that to go to these rallies they like him but you probably saw the pictures on TV Tonight thousands and thousands of people outside after the arena was a big arena but\nIt was a whole and we had to have\nYou have a third deplorable you know\nBeing or beyond that thousand people outside and so you had these people waiting for hours many hours man and I didn't go that would have been the wrong thing to and more importantly than anything we have people in Florida we have people in the White House everything's set up an air force one\nI was in total communication in fact I spoke with the governors of Alabama or the governor of the you know Georgia I spoke with Rick Scott we were in constant communication rally and\nPeople at him and just think timers are very important rally to that but it would have been very unfair to have people waiting for ten and twelve and more than that hours say by the way I'm not going to be there and I would have been pretty of\nHow much criticism is really out there and how much you know just like far left I guess are we talking is this going into the mainstream left me too\nI mean you do have again Joe Scarborough you have ... out there now I just had this thought yeah is all the people who are criticizing Donald Trump today for going to a rally last night when Florida was getting pounded or by this hurricane all of these people also say that Donald Trump is most incompetent man to ever be in the White House so\nFollowing that line of logic I'm not agreeing with him I'm just saying what followed outlined a logic wouldn't you want the president to not be involved\nIn the storm recovery if you think he's just totally incompetent\nAnd an idiot and all that stuff wouldn't you want him to be as hands off as possible and let the FEMA people do their thing\nNone of it makes sense it's just he's going to get criticized but it doesn't matter what he does have before we move on I I
