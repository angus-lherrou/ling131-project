it reminds me of when there's a police shooting everybody wants to know what\nIs the cop white was the guy black\nThere's a mass shooting was it and they are Fifteen was it a terrorist do they have political affiliations\nBecause we want to start getting in our tribes like we're getting ready to fight like we're warming up or our guys just get our tribes let's all begin here's time to get in our

is a good do I've been out of the ws being more than a few occasions a great guy works ah ah you know been very nice to meet and he's been a number Trump or by the way he let me tell you how bad it was for him in the world of Trump\nHe was kind of never Trump or what it was first starting it's kind of the ... the coined the phrase and he wasn't a huge fan of Trump he\nHad to have\nPeople watch over him and his family security and police for days after a contentious ah\nInterview that they had and it was not good so it's not like this is a guy who was like hey by the way Trump's my best friend in the world\nBut the rhetoric that's out there everybody's got a part to play and what I see is the media wants to say they've got no part in this right at the media wants to say they've got no part in this they're they're on the moral mountain above everybody else on the mount Everest of moral mount\nThe Republicans are the only wants to blame the left side of the ones who say they too are on the moral dilemma Kilimanjaro the moral mountain next to him the case in the right there looking over saying we've got no part to play it is only the Republicans I call fully\nProtesters chasing people at a restaurant so I think both sides need to calm down which is one reason I think it is not very helpful for those who started at both sides can say the other side did both sides need to stop turning the base over to the fringe and the angry mob and actually return to the better angels of our cells that actually try to get things done\nI agree with I agree right I absolutely agree\nOne hundred percent with all due respect\nThere and I think that everyone has to take responsibility for their own accent than they own their own way in which they respond to the President's Day et cetera\nAnd I I don't I don't condone anything that's happened to 'em and Collins or Ted Cruz or anyone getting yelled at a restaurant I think that's important um but I Do think it's pretty clear when you're talking about the toxic political environment that it didn't start with [laughter] with ... with Donald Trump and twenty fifth Amy [laughter]\nNo it didn't we like the people who are politicians somehow\nNever said a bad thing to one another somehow never argued one of the somehow never ginned up their base now Donald Trump doesn't in a way that nobody's ever done it before that I Will concede and the difference\nThough is what has happened since that twenty fifth teenage even a little bit earlier than that what has started to happen is\nThe people\nHave access to information instantaneously can put things out there instantaneously can react instantaneously and they can allow their feelings\nTo flow in their emotions to flow with very little repercussions whatsoever\nThat's a huge thing I mean I don't I I agree\nWe need to definitely talk about the fact that social media plays a massive part in the inundated of information lies BS real stories fake stories have throughs uh you know stuff that that that may be true but it's definitely you know pushing the envelope of just trying to get you emotionally to react to something\nAnd both sides done it and so what's happened over the last four or five six eight years is\nWe've ... we've become so tribal as both sides have started to move away from each other the fringes as especially not that you saw that center the exhaust image or the middle that we are but both sides have started to move further away from each other and is that it started to do that\nThey've gotten louder and louder and louder and louder and louder\n\nAnd instead of us going I'm a Democrat or Republican that's argued da da da da da da na what it is is I'm a Democrat you're an enemy I'm a Republican you're an enemy that's\nHow things have really started changes we don't look at each other as as you know frenemies if you will we're strictly just enemies\nBright and now I Am about going out of all known dog and gun to a knife fight or none of is that it ever since ... running around and I said is around ... and other politicians and other than Donald Trump say I'm so proud or or or or or are given kudos to another politician\nWho body slammed reporter\nHave you ever heard that from anyone else other than Donald Trump\nListen how she's just breed breed breed what do I always say though don't let Donald Trump live rent free and it doesn't say that but\nThis is what the left wants the left wants to be able to say the things like that that they want to be able to say that we're we we're we're above reproach\nKnow everybody's got a part to play I've said it over and over again I Want Trump to ... to do to tone it down is not going to do it he'll probably get louder he's tone deaf in a situation like this he's playing to his audience he's playing to his base he he he's he's going to do that over and over again\nOkay I mean I I I'm an aspiring criticized because it drives me crazy but to act as if\nHe's the only one that's completely disingenuous\nThrows a is a symptom of what's going on in this country of your your blood pressure went over to over right now as my\nYoung protests have advocated violence or or say more he'll bring on another\nLayer and we're the mass shooting against Republicans last year you have ... Democrats say the Republicans were killing people um both sides are to blame if you're going to say it's just so from what you're going to do is you're going to have fifty percent of the country saying you know what she's not really interested in a solution\nYeah you know I just I just I I Want us to be genuine and say there's plenty of blame to go round but for whatever reason we all want to be able to say\nIt's not my guy it's not my person I get a trophy because it's on you as if and and that is so sad\nThat we live in a world we're celebrating it somebody else that's that's that's caused a problem and I said today do you know because it gets I I've been inundated with conspiracy theories which by the way if you send them to me I just put them side I don't care they want to hear about it on mute you\nAre on 'cause I I just don't care but somebody said well I just don't want to be blamed for all these kinds of things because I like Trump's policies and I said that's the issue right there if you feel\nThat you're getting blamed for some don't let it worry you just get on with your life who cares this guy's nuts the guy that did this\nHe's got issues he's got real real issues absolutely one hundred percent issues he lives in a van they arrested him and his man and\nWary of everybody with bumper stickers to that extent three two three five three twenty four twenty three I had been some shows your Twitter you can tweet at us you should be wary\nThe Boston Red Sox won another world\nSeries Boston down and the Dodgers five one in Los Angeles to complete a five game world series win over the Dodgers\nSo Boston Red Sox are celebrating here on the field with their first world series championship since twenty Thirteen their fourth world series when since two thousand for this is the second time in less than a year the fans here at Dodgers stadium to watch the Dodgers lose a World Series\nYou was November first of last year the Dodgers lost in the world series here at home against the Houston Astros\nABC's Alex Stone at Dodger Stadium\nIndonesia's lion air reports it's flight J.

when I criticize then they go wild and screen it's just not presidential its\nPresidential but I don't think the way they treat you as as as a respectable they've treated other presidents so there's blame to go around for everybody the good news is\nThat got the guy at least the person they believed to be the guy right they're pretty\nSure that they have the guy Chris Wray FBI do you have the guy\nWe do believe that we've got the right guy a but we also know that this is an ongoing investigation and there's a lot of work still to be done\nThere you go so and it's going to take a while this is going to be one of those things are that are going to take well you don't if some people have been saying who were like oh\nWe're these even really\nBombs like somehow they're doing everything they can because they ... their their their their Trump\nLoyalist and supporters and\nAnd I would say this I talked to several people who are huge Trump supporters they weren't really into politics before and they've said afterwards they probably won't have anything to do with politics afterwards\nIt's Trump Trump Trump Trump\nAnd but they're worried oh what these even really bombs they weren't good bombs but could they potentially exploded I think it was the you know could they\nEven if the devices and we're still trying to determine whether or not uh they were functional as they say they were doing all kinds of analysis on that to make a definitive determination but they did contain\nEnergetic material or which is subjected to the right combination of heat for shocker frictions or could be dangerous to the public and the public should treat any device like that of course\nThat's the only one hundred percent it's over it's done with as far as what they believe they've got the right guy and uh he is a well you know he's going to see I have a feeling when all is said and done a ... if this is the guy\nThat he's going to see a mental institution potentially\nBefore he sees a day in prison 'cause I just don't think he's all their family doesn't really think he's all their the coma lost soul in some of the stuff I I apparently he's made up about his family fighting communism and doing all ... it's just really potentially out\nAnd the ... they're going to come hard for this guy and Jeff Sessions talked about it earlier a you know about the political violence this is a law and order admitted\nAnd we will not tolerate such lawlessness especially in a political violence\nThere you go there you go so a good riddance uh that they caught this guy and hopefully he can get the help\nYou need to be as sick and I do and and my my opinion my my dime store opinion from five thousand 'cause it's really an miles away from where he currently finds himself\nIs I don't think he's all there that's just me he took the rhetoric that was being said and he ran with it and didn't quite understand the he wasn't in on the joke and the the arguments and understand that that it's not all it appears to be\nAnd I think he's got issues I really do speaking of issues it is a precursor in many ways to\nOur bill of rights and our constitution is one of the most watched and that is absolutely ridiculous when the most famous things in the world documents in the world and an idiot tried to steal it\nA forty five year old man armed with a hammer has been arrested alarms were activated after an attempt was made to smash the glass box surrounding them by the guard staff were immediately alerted and police were called in\nAs to the actual document it not been damaged it's the best surviving copy of one of Britain's most influential legal documents dating from twelve Fifteen it's regarded by story and as the foundation of constitutional liberty and the English speaking world\nYes it is it is it is incredible and\nWhat they tried to do back in these days are in those days long ago a twelve Fifteen was essentially they were trying to broker a deal between the rebels and the royals and\nAnd it it kind of started setting up rules and it's one of just like our constitution they the politicians site it today it's amazing there's I think there's four copies we got one\nCame on tour when we were celebrating one of our\nAh ah they loaned us what\nThe Brits did they learn this one is pretty amazing to see you know ... for a while you can use it if you lie and you know I was going on too but I was talking to producer Phil\nAnd I said let's just let's let's play fun here for a moment right\nSo you managed to steal it or you managed to steal the Constitution's\nFor whatever reason are more than you know let's go national was that national whatever it was such a movie with Nicholas cage national treasure\nSosa stay for the sake of argument that you managed to now she wanted to use it for something else but let's just say you're not going to use it for something else so you have one of the most important documents in the history\nCelebrating the golden Arab cartoons for the sixties to the Nineteen nineties Joe Garner and Michael actually joined us now by the way guys just let you know uh my love of cartoons issues as a kid growing up\nThat would I played soccer but my dream besides that was to be Mel Blanc does butler I got to work with dogs ... so it was you know when I say it it's just incredible and I was reading this book and seeing all this stuff in here it just it it brings back memories\nOh that's great but I think that we wanted to uh we wanted to remind people who are old enough to experience which is basically younger I mean I'm older actors and younger uh a baby boomers um this a magical time but I mean Chad as you recall we waited all week for\nSaturday mornings and yeah they just don't know what that experience was like so hopefully the book will give them a taste of that\nYou said it right we waited all week and I just remember guys that you know it was one of those things where\nLike we do now with football a Sunday was Saturday morning was owned by the cartoons and depending depending on how old you are what was your favorite cartoon all of these things we don't have that anymore because we're inundated with it and when you start looking through this you realize a lot of these characters\nThat you just absolutely love it became a huge part of America\nYeah that's actually why matter what your age or not or what you're\nLooking for was ah when I heard this recording or something like ... people and they all are clearly judge Joe ... all the critical care and we want to let that go a climate where everybody was replied by ... we can all agree special carbon that we want to cook that with this book\nAbsolutely talking to a guy with the other couple a book that's amazing call it Saturday morning celebrating the golden Arab cartoons in the Nineteen sixties Nineteen Ninety Joe Joe Garner and Michael actually joined us here\nWhen you started putting the stuff together and you got some of these amazing pictures and the thing I Love about it is it's not just the the pictures of you know the people who created these characters and and the artwork itself it talks about how long they were on their what network how many episodes\nBecause like the Archie show you look at something like that you think well they are two shows on forever Seventeen episodes but in our mind it was on forever and then you also talk to you have the character voice actors all of these things\nIt's incredible the way you guys break this down because like I said it's part of America we think to ourselves wasn't it on for like twenty five years or like no it was on for Seventeen episodes you're like oh\nYeah it is surprising when you look at some of these classics like a Johnny Quest very very short run but it just is testament to the artistry and to the characters that they created that they've really stood the test of time\nThat smart got a good run guys two hundred and fifty six episodes is a good run plus they've had several major motion pictures when I look at this though one of the things that I think kids don't understand is like I was trying to explain the other day to my son Jack\nWho's eight years old jak you don't understand the transformers mirror cartoon they became a movie bumble bee was the cartoon first and the guy beat her colon who voices in the voice of the original is also the voice in the transformers these were really cartoons first before movies\nI mean if you look at the ninja turtles that begin in Nineteen eighty nine and we'll go that that on an old movie well what are you a clue what it was weighted around the the first or Second World war when there was actually a adult\nYeah as I was going through the book a bunch a it's called the Saturday morning celebrating the golden Arab cartoons in the sixties to the nineties Joe Garner Michael actually joined us you know one of the things in here for all the cartoon stuff one thing you guys do have an IRS you have the we play house which it wasn't strictly a cartoon if you will but it was a Saturday morning staple for a lot of people\nThat's exactly right and all that Michael speak about that because um it was actually a bit of an arm wrestle between the two of us tend to be honest with you because\nIt's about twenty or age difference between the two of us and so I grew up with the sixties and seventies and part of the seventies live action was said Marty cross you know the ...
