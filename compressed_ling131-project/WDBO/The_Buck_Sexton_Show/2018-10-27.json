H R pop and stuff and uh I was over ruled on those but what they one possible exception being ... but for great reasons which Michael will explain\nOr yeah they actually do you think about the ... on a few ... it was the cartoons the teacher little quake really tiny strive to talk about all the stuff that gets you know that for that matter the kid like their parents the boys were Booker school how to make coke and awake harm and what kind of a a cartoon character himself cookbook without having ... than it\nThen we moved to the nineties 'cause I was Seventy ... growing up at a lot of it as much I loved the cartoons it was a male blanks with a dog Butler's was the voice actors I've always wanted to be like several friends who are big time voice actors and ah\nUm banning I just love doing the same ditch the most amazing staff [laughter] what do you move into to me one of the great ... which I think a lot of times gets overlooked but one of my favorite cartoons and even when it comes on and flip around at night sometimes I'll watch picking the brain and I love the enemy acts and picking the brain and all of those things\nWe look at the Knight showed like enemy act all we're I'm going to work but we all kind of all the lead of the show like Simpson another girl just let them know what the costs of actually grew up a lot of ...\nYeah they really really did it's called it's Saturday morning celebrating the golden Arab cartoons the Nineteen sixties Nineteen nineties I put you get guys coming our last question John for both of you know before you look at cartoons cartoons are so much different South Park are those guys revolutionized are so many things in the way that they've taken stuff on\nFamily Guy the same kind of thing where do you see cartoons going in the future because I still love I watch Family Guy in a regular basis in fact I'll be honest I probably watch at least an episode of day because it takes my mind off all the politics in the ... are moving forward\nDo we still see a lot of those great cartoons not only for kids but like for adults there's plenty of them out there and did you think they're going away anytime soon\nI agree with you hundred percent first of all of that\nWas a ritual of mine um every night to watch an episode of Family Guy with my son we just ... it's just\nYou know it brilliant brilliant writing first and foremost and the characters are so well defined but um yeah no I I see cartoons animation or having a nice healthy life you know well into the future especially with all the creativity that's coming out of Pixar and you know they they just seem to\nKeep trying to out out performing out do each other and they'll always sort of near\nA our culture as well which is what they've done and if you really look at the writing of these cartoons just what they've done a throughout their entire history\nAbsolutely absolute guys I appreciate it Saturday morning celebrating the golden era cartoon from the Nineteen sixties\nTo the Nineteen nineties Joe Garner and Michael actually appreciate your coming on the book is amazing and tell everybody out there\nThan his style Jill alone just going through some of these and also the craziness of finding out that you thought something was on for forty years which it was but they only did like twenty episodes and you'll be amazed to find out how many episodes really appreciate you guys coming on today Thanks very much for taking time with us they all\nHad her she ate it that you had been to chose your Twitter C.

anything like it since the night Abraham Lincoln was assassinated\nYeah but when you've got your then\nCandidate on the left calling half the nation deplorable\nYou have to look forward to find enemies because guess what you were calling them enemies to everybody's got a part to play and this is the thing that drives me crazy as there's nobody who wants to stand up and said you know what you're right now I don't like what Trump does I told\nYou that you listen to the show trying to be a level hadn't as real as possible I think that the stuff that he says at times is absolute crap\nHe says it he he looks through the crowd and he says whatever you can to rub the crowd out but he doesn't realize that that's going to go elsewhere not just what's happening there and that some people don't quite get what he's saying he's putting it a little mustard on it if you will and some people take it to heart\nBut\nEverybody on the left acts like they're they they've got no part to play in this and we're trying to figure out who started this it doesn't matter who started it why we're still fighting you know one of the funny things on a British ... you ever watch Family Guy when when the giant\nRooster and Peter fight oh yeah that's incredible and they'll fight for like five minutes and they forget they'll stop and go why do we start fighting again that's exactly what this is both

you said that that was awful one hundred and ten percent\nOne hundred and ten percent\nAbsolutely but you know all this is going to be ... ... is the left going to come out and say it's\nAll your fault all your fault all your fault all your fault all your fault all your fault\nThe rights going to come out and say he's crazy which is probably there's some truth that the van alone says a little
