want this I got it everywhere else and so I somebody can jump up and say yes and by the way it doesn't have\nTo be an American we seen the stones they're not American right we've seen all these bad that it promotes it doesn't have to be so there you go other people like I don't care what color cabinet gives a chance that for a billion people see me and a half time I'll do it every day\nDoesn't doesn't have to be so we'll we'll see who it is I'm just trying to like you know you're going to have to uh\nYou know even though they've announced but you didn't you know there's gonna be other

get soy you drive him crazy thank you darling\nThe driving them crazy and well everybody ... you see the media now they're flipping out about this\nNow and what that does is it does shine a bright spotlight on exactly how under the rug everything else has been swept\nRight I mean you have rights and scares and that's a ... story but not all that big of a story mhm you have people going after Republicans because they supported Brett Kavanaugh with death threats and all that but none of that really matters\nYou have elected officials and party representatives from the Democratic party talking about a harassing public officials in restaurants not letting them go to the grocery store not let him go to gas stations and we're not supposed to call that mob mentality now the president comes out and says something like that again I Wish he hadn't set it\nAnd now you have a freak out by doing that is what he did was once again expose a exactly how the media culture is yeah and now they've they've picked aside that's and I just wish they'd come out admitted they're not going to admit it's\nIt's the lens they see everything through they think they're on the side of good and this guy is bad for that see he's inciting violence they're also saying he is the one responsible for the journalist and you're going to be\nBill yeah the the Saudi journalist who was at the consulate in Turkey who was killed your marks Jody I Know I've seen that take over and over and over again that somehow\nAnd it's becoming now or a fever pitch yeah as far as takes go this morning on cable news ... they're all ... ditch Trump's fault\nYeah Trump's fault because Saudi Arabia never did anything underhanded before Donald Trump became president gave me a break with that there was a congressman walking Castro who came out today as well and suggested that ah to show the was on one of Jared Kushner's hit\nList so that too and this is this is twisted\nAnd Trump has said look we're gonna we're going to give them time to sort some stuff out we're gonna we're gonna get to the bottom of this and there might be harsher penalties\nTrump has said that yeah um and to go down the road though that somehow he has prompted\nThe government of Saudi Arabia to maybe ignore human rights issues is to completely ignore recent history when it comes to Saudi Arabia\nWell do you go back to last night you know if I was right in his speech what I've got tough and not put of all the things to worry about it was very tongue in cheek that's the way I took it last night you know their\nBodies lay it worked

Air forces yeah was apparently among the Fifteen member hit team that landed in Istanbul into private\nJets from Riyadh and then headed to the Saudi conflict where the job he was killed mhm uh he died in a car accident\nBoy that's a crazy coincidence is one of those weird things you know I mean the roads are dangerous thing can be a dangerous place\nThat's how it happens that's how fast the thanks for a guy to get whacked\nYou very much so yeah it seems like they are trying to maybe tie up a few loose ends\nMe crazy but that could be it\nI Know one thing that guy's not talking no such but know that they don't want your word I Know we're all\nRight and I know that that's absolutely a\nSo they're saying that yeah print smart the crown prince Mohammed bin Salman would do anything to get rid of the evidence and maybe that's it you know you're getting rid of people who might be talking ... um yeah clearly Donald Trump's fault right I yes clearly he's the monster in all of this people need to get a grip\nYeah because you know a radical Muslims never kill any journalist before our president sitting president out said the other the enemy of the people he ... he created the whole thing right

black lives matter talked about you know systemic racism in black people are proven or are considered guilty until proven innocent yet that narrative that they're hopping on again to kind of it's it feels a little heavy handed to have it the way it's presented\nWell sometimes and messaging David you really gotta you\nKnow no home there's that show room for subtlety here a and there's\nMore yeah why Democrats will be Lincoln black folk ...\nOkay\n[laughter] you see what I mean about the heavy hitters miss yeah these folks [laughter] about us as subtle as a grenade\nLauncher [laughter] that is
