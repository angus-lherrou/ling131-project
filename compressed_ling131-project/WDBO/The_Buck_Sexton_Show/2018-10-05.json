not checked\nOff the list seems like they talk to everybody who was on the list of people who could possibly corroborate these this story absolutely that's the point but anyway\nWe are reiterating are called given how limited stuff\nThis these documents were and how limited the scope of this investigation was [noise] we are reiterating our call\nThat the documents with proper rejection be made public why shouldn't all of America see\nWe are reiterating our call to make the directives\nThat the White House and counsel McGahn sink to the FBI\nBecause we believe it greatly constrained the investigation\nThis the get go okay whatever the fact that they want to jump in there for a hundred senators is another example of constraining\nYeah Bill itty of all senators and the American public to see the whole truth and nothing but [noise]\nBut you sat on them for a long time to talk to your buddy Diane right\nYou could have gotten the FBI involved a long time ago if you were really

friend that was there and you said was there has no recollection of it and says she doesn't know Brett Kavanaugh that's a huge problem mhm there's no evidence\nSo what are people supposed to do it's kind of like it's an unfortunate situation and yeah maybe the guy drank more than he let on a but there's nothing to say that he\nAttempted to rape her and there's no proof so what are you going to do right but they missed that the party miss is that the media misses that I Do\nAnd the coverage of this has been so incredibly one sided\nBut you have so many people thinking okay or we've been saying that one person's word against another now has more power even without evidence ... whether it's male or female that's jacked up that's not what the country is built on\nI'm not surprised to hear those political numbers yeah\nSo that's what the report says from the FBI there's no crop rotation\nAnd I don't think a lot of us are surprised by that and one of the big things that you're hearing
