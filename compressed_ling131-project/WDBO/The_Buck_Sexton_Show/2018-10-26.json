means\nThis is a total idiot which people have said this does look like an amateur job all the way around then you're asking well how long has it got to take to find this person do you think maybe not that long it will be the week after the midterms oh you are going conspiracy now when all the way the I'm\nJust throwing it out there I don't just you know we're all ... nobody really knows we don't I Know right no or why and you know maybe the intent left or right let's forget about that whole\nConversation maybe the intent was to scare one way or the other and not actually to kill anybody because it isn't believable that not one of these things have blown up at this point it's pretty tough\nPretty tough to believe so\nUsually like everybody else get more information as it comes in and then you get the reaction from both sides right\nBy the way what Trump said it wasn't enough right\nThey knew this just right just to refresh this is what Trump said just I mean as the story was developing he's at a press conference or a press event I should say uh and he says well this is unacceptable mhm\nWe have to unify we have to come together\nAnd send one very clear strong unmistakable message\nThat acts for threats of political violence of any kind to have no place in the United states of America disagree just conduct is abhorrent to everything we hold dear and sacred has Americans okay\nWhen he says the first part of the statement\nWe have to unify we have to come together right\nIf you have some people that are rolling their eyes they're saying look at everything you said and tweeted right I\nGet where that comes from ... but at the same time\nOkay you also have the media involved and plenty from the left as well we can't\nRest while this other parties in power right\nThat all of a sudden when one eighty pills Oh yes we have to unify yeah come on it's what we call it all out not just one ...\n... and that's that's why I had to I took such such exception yesterday to the left dragging ... guy like Chuck Schumer a guy that I don't see eye to eye with at all\nBut it came out and said all of it needs to stop everybody needs to calm down 'cause that's actually a unifying message what Trump was talking about is a unifying message but what it seemed like so many of the president's critics really want is they want him to go into public square and forgive himself\nAnd beg for forgiveness\nRight instead of actually just saying okay we're going to try to have a clean slate as much as possible here we don't agree on a lot of things but\nObviously sending bombs is a bad thing well when Schumer did try to have a unifying message his own people ripping the crap out of them yes where you got your rep and um and that's a big role for me when I see all that stuff you know and the same people in the press who are saying he needs to provide unity are now saying we'll do stupid ... didn't go far enough\nBecause nothing's ever enough or you're the rundown of some of the reaction here\nI thought it was the absolute bare minimum I thought it was ridiculous\nIt no longer okay to say I don't like a ... a lot so\nYou don't have the testicular fortitude to mention the victims and there's no way that you actually stand for unity\nFor the president in the primary proponent behind the course of the American political wish you could have been some other things\nI just wish you could have said some other things is what he says [laughter] okay nothing's ever know that this is what if\nYou don't want unity\nYou want him to sit there and beg for your forgiveness yes that's exactly it that's what you want and that's not a unifying message\nYou said he was trying to be nice last name Wisconsin [laughter]\nHe said look it's time to tone it down a little bit is what he said\nWe should not mom\nPublic spaces for destroy public property [laughter]\n\nIs one way it is there a lot of disagreements go peacefully at the ballot will we\nGreat country we're going to get
