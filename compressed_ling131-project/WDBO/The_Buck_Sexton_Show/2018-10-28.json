{"month": "10", "state": "FL", "station": "WDBO", "content": "You you you get a lot of information out for a website and I urge people to go there Salvation Army Orlando dot org but we also would welcome people to come on a tour we had a whole city block\nAnd we would love to give you a tour because if you see first hand what we're doing you're going to be motivated to give away a program for veterans that are given veterans back on their feet we work\nOn a regular basis with dignity and helping the homeless and other people get their id without an id you can't do anything hay and with our senior programs\nMonthly we are having programs and weekly we have programs for them as you said educating them on resources or they need and playing syrup community that can enrich our lives\nAll right I Am speaking to captain Ken Chapman talking about the salvation army and I'd like to tell us a little bit about the people you served and you know how to put a face on it the kinds of people who are coming in using your services or the folks were volunteering and let us know what their experiences are like\nThat well thank you for allowing me to do that because so many people stereotype the homeless and yes you know there are some homeless who are have mental issues and mental illness is a big factor there are some people\nWho try to work the system there are some people who are angry but the average homeless person that we deal with the person who is on the brink of homelessness are people who are trying to keep their lives together who are trying to hold on\nBut a a a a small thing like a flat tire could send them into into poverty because they have no way to get to work then in no way to fix it um [noise] so\nThey have barriers ... other people don't have to deal with the ... when you can put a face to it it makes so much more sense and you have much more compassion because most of them are so appreciative and grateful that someone cares enough and we can't do it without people\nGiven to us for people give to us so I called the people are donors are the army behind the army and then of volunteers are the same way once they come in and have hands on with one of our programs\nThere so for life because they know they see first hand or the benefit of helping someone out of darkness and being alive in a dark world\nYou know I mentioned you usually by this time had all of the volunteers you need your help things from the heart and the reason is because people year after year want to be a part of that are there some other volunteer opportunities that maybe people aren't as a way around that you'd like to promote\nAbsolutely we um you can always be a big brother big sister kind of mentor to our children in a homeless shelter you can help us with the character building in life skills programs and bring him special program from an idea for them um we always have people\nTo come and sit with the elderly and read to them and just be the ministry of presence there are many ways to help and our shelters were serving food and ah even cleaning up our facilities and helping us reorganize\nSome places and uh make things Heather where we guarantee we never have a lack of opportunity for people to put their hands on it\nAnd immediate sense you certainly need people to volunteer to ring the bells after the candles and team to help all that so once again let people know how to volunteer\nAnd that's our number one me right now is is hundreds of people to agree to ring a bell fourth and you can go to Salvation Army Orlando dot org and get information you can call our number which is four\nO seven for two three five eight one and talked to someone and they will direct you to have a sign up for that and it would be a tremendous help not only to the salvation army but you would then be helping the community and make in Orlando and Osceola county to send me a better place to live right\nI Want to remind people as well about angel tree and the fact that ah those names are going to be up on the treat real soon go out with the family shop a little bit\nCan teach your children a great lesson on how we are so blessed most of us\nAnd how if we share our resources or the other people you've changed their lives and make it a better place for them so I encourage families especially to do that was so grateful let me just say we are so grateful for those people who sacrificed part of their\nHoliday and part part of their Christmas to help others and we're grateful for the donors as I said earlier you're the army behind the army and without you\nWe will not be able to what we say the salvation army of marching along in Orlando by the way twenty twenty will be the centennial year we celebrate a hundred years of serving Orlando the salvation army in Orlando\nSo we have a special celebration coming up real soon too so I'm gonna get you back on the show I Hope for that captain Chapman I Want to\nAnd I tell you if you if you're really nice to me I might be some donuts when I come\nNot All right I Will be nice [laughter]\nListen I Want to ask you about the area of which are the commander\nBecause you have orange in Osceola do you see some needs unique to each county or some special ways that you have to\nApproach folks based on you know just the needs and may be really you think of downtown is being so accessible maybe and maybe not in Osceola or or what I mean is there any distinction between the two counties\nAbsolutely in orange county the government is working very diligently to solve some problems of chronic homelessness especially\nAnd and there's some great things happening with the commission on homelessness to raise the bar and in Orlando will eventually be a leader in the nation for dealing with some of these problems and uh we've been named as the third\nWorst city in America for homeless that so they're taking it seriously the government and all of the shelter providers and all the other people who help in that arena or joining hands in the way that I've never seen a community do and that's that's wonderful\nFor Orange County ... there's a huge problem uh with poverty and a ... in both counties\nThere's very little affordable housing we are in need and I feel in orange county have ten thousand units of affordable housing and that is the number one problem that we all have to put our heads together with him to try to solve that that very difficult problem in central Florida\nAlright well so good talking to you any final thoughts\nI I Am grateful to the media particularly a radio station who who gives us information out and helps us get our message and I'm grateful to the donors and I say I really believe that our land those one of the most magical places on earth and I'm

I was like well I don't know very open like ... like ... ...\nSo you got a Thirteen year old you would want to have that money at what age\n...\nTen years from now [noise] okay so I'm going to give you some crazy suggestions okay Oklahoma you're ready for crazy ...\nBecause I'm always nervous about putting money in a kid's name because as precious as our kids are when they're young we don't know exactly how mature they're going to be and responsible once legally they have access to money\nSo now is a Thirteen year old seven year old and one is going to be one soon you are in a position now with custodial accounts you get to make all decisions\nBut once said she was considered to be adulthood which is actually often before kids mature enough to make good decisions with money if they find out the money's there they have the ability to take control of it and spend it on things that you've worked hard to save you might not be able to control\nSo wrong you're ready for my weird suggestion I recommend long right you've heard me talk about Ross IRAs ... is that something that you and your husband do\nWhen you go out right now on hold out we didn't have any any old back at war and what's not back now finance and keep it that way right on white kids now ... point where um [noise] yeah I Can't go there for a house gets quite being ... by about ...\nAll right so let me tell you the beauty of using the raw says the way they're safe for your kids\nYou control what now and in the future and everything the accounts earn they earn tax free so your intention is to give a decent amount of money to each of your children are sounds like and maybe mid twenties\nOr I went on for a long ball um well I feel like they're ready for it\nRight so you maintain a hundred percent control if you and your husband each fund Ross\nUp to age fifty or each allowed to put in up to fifty five hundred dollars a year into these after age fifty sixty five hundred each but anyway you can ... soccer away enough money over these years moving forward\nThat you can fully put money aside they will meet what your goal our goals are for these three kids but see here's the beauty\nYou can only give them what you've contributed to at the earnings stay behind with you\nAnd stay there are all grown out till you would need\nThe money and retirement so it becomes like a partial retirement account for you we've completely tax free growth you maintain complete control all the money\nAnd when you're ready for them to have the money you've contributed on their behalf you can give it to your Thirteen year old ten or so years from now and have it be a completely tax free event\nIf you don't think you're a Thirteen year olds mature enough at that point you want to wait a couple more years you wait a couple more years but you completely are in charge because it's your account your money\nSort of the loop hole with a Roth is the money that is earning a Ross has to be left to side ... year fifty nine and a half or older but the money you contribute to the raw you're free to use for any purpose at any time\nBomb well often well now I'm I don't know what I'm about ... ...\nAnd on if you work on Clark dot com I have a very simple guide for you to set up a rough and you'll know exactly what to do math fused with us on the Clark Howard show Hi Matthew\n...\nGreat thank you you got a question for me about the stock market\nA year or so I'm a college student and I had taken out some money from much alone that subsidized loans and places like Mark it into a some well known stocks\nAnd um was wanting to use that money to um\nI guess have access to David in\nA way to those games and so I Want to know what your thoughts on uh is is too risky um you know for a college student and a ... I mean whether it be a better place or for that money for that to loan money\nSo you have the ability to borrow a under the federally subsidized loan program where there's no interest paid until six months after you graduate interest starts right that's correct so\nThis is free money but the question I Would ask you if we had a ... a tough spot in the stock market you've put this money and the stocks that you borrowed\nAre you prepared to deal with the consequences if that money's not there when you're out of school and you've got to pay it back [noise]\nUh yeah yeah it's it's not it's not too much to where I couldn't handle band that back um plus my education right now\nI'm I'm expected in school for another uh two years\nIf you are comfortable with the risk and you wouldn't lose any sleep if you lost the money\nMan this is essentially borrowing money at no cost\nOkay but\nI've had this question I should tell you over the years I've had this question at least half a dozen times from people who have borrowing authority that they don't need to use under the federal student loan program\nYou got to really do check with yourself that you're going to be OK if let's say you put a few thousand you do in a few thousand each year and the stock market\n[noise] right right like uh I've just started that um and I've\n... I've I've a bar lovely four thousand dollars\nAnd have invested those and to um like I said there was well known stop\nOr I Would say let's just say we have a a real serious decline in the market and four thousand two years from now is worth only two\nAnd you're going to owe the four thousand are you gonna hate yourself or you say oh well it's okay I knew what I was risking and I'm willing to cough up the two thousand is I'm going to have to\n[noise] um I'm thinking that as a year's progress\nThat they would be a good idea for me to kind of started saving a for a case something does happen and by the end of that I'm a program\nRight so let me tell you the way I always look at this and that's what's the worst case scenario would have been worse that can happen is am I prepared for that if you psychologically um and practically\nHave a strategy that if the market does not do well there you can handle the borrowing you're doing because in the scheme of life it's not an enormous amount of money you're talking about borrowing for stocks even though borrowing to buy stocks always makes me nervous if you've really thought through\nPeople wounded included for police officers six total forty six year old Robert Bauer is from the suburb of Baldwin faces twenty nine federal charges including federal hate crimes ABC's chief justice correspondent for your time is on why they hate crime charges were added\nUm state sort of a statue there is one that is taking quite seriously because it was all at the oil is based on race or ethnic background religion is the kind of climate in which don't was killed simply for who they are\nReports also shows bars was making anti Semitic posts on social media Bowers was armed with an AR style assault rifle and three handguns a vigil was held near the synagogue Saturday evening President Trump has ordered flags at all federal buildings to people and a half staff taught in the NBC News\nPunch any do Bre or Washington watchdog and this is where Orlando turns personal breaking news weather and traffic news Ninety six five W TBO [noise]\nWhat do you bike to retired auto service Sunday Morning fifty seven degrees that pool start your day in the afternoon and Seventy five and a lot of sunshine in near perfect day\nBent on Monday another cool morning will return it to the eighties and we'll start the work week dry and very nice from gentlemanly way the news that many around just George while the\nSecurity triple team traffic\nStill looking at that crashed into the turnpike north on the ramp to for twenty nine that off rape is closed causing a bit of delay also gonna crash ... east on the ramp from four thirty five that right leaning is blocked Tripoli traffic I'm Rick you were so on news Ninety six point five W db oh\nDid you just look down at your phone you did it again then you know you find down the road in a three ton hunk of steel\nAnd attack takes your eyes off the road for an average of five seconds at fifty five miles per hour that's long enough to travel the length of a football field and cause some serious damage\nTurnoff trust me\nIt is you'll live\nLearn more stop tax stop rex dot org ... by the ad council and the national Highway Traffic Safety Administration\nChannel nine I went to the new t._v. de ... says where or Leno turns first for breaking news and drive a nice point five W ...\nKelley joined me for Orlando's morning news every weekday morning starting at five just ask elects at a set an alarm and wake up to news Ninety six point five W.

you make\nA big push coming out of Washington [noise]\nTo require drug manufacturers in these crazy TV ads they do for\nDrugs to disclose in the ads what a prescription actually costs for the drugs and the pharmaceutical companies are going crazy like what in the world are you thinking why would we ever want to tell anybody\nThat those beautiful models running through the beautiful setting where the backdrop of magnificent mountains are lakes or oceans or whatever they're smiling year to year well their commentator says\nMay cause your right arm to fall off or may cause you to have a really sad suicidal thoughts or whatever\nDavid Lazarus or the Los Angeles times\nHas written recently about the proposal from Washington vet pharmaceutical companies post prices and what's your perspective on this about having to disclose that those smiling people are taking a drug that would cost you two thousand dollars a month or whatever\nWell first of all it's a little credit to the president for at least\nBy lighting up prices as something that he's concerned about and indeed since the campaign he was repeatedly return to this and even the drug companies are getting away with murder when it comes to placing but that\nSaid he has offered no significant new rule whatsoever to lean in drug pricing and he got out of the administration last week along with all those crazy side effects it listed what we see at your prescription minutes on TV [laughter]\nDrug company also has to include\nThe list price of the drug in the intent here with the the administration says it's to shame and the companies to bring these prices down because so many of these places are in fact\nIndefensible oh there's a bunch of problems to this first of all what price would they put it in the list price which nobody pays the actual price of the wholesale price that's a clear ah but the bigger problem is the drug industry to look at that said we don't think\nSo and then they turned out the first amendment and said you can't compel us to say things we don't want and I put out so called to some constitutional lawyers to say what was that true I mean they've got a list all the side effects can't they also be forced to list the price and the lawyers say now it looks like\nYou can make a case from the government's point of view to Cold War speech if they were the public interest or public health or safety involved and that's why you do get the requirement for all the side effects\nBut it would be very difficult for the government to argue that there is a public interest in simply shaming these guys with the scarlet letter of having to publicize their prices and so the lawyers are saying you know what the drug industry is going to take this all the way to the Supreme Court where they will probably win in Citizens United environment where drug oil\nBusiness has never had more rights and more power and the upshot of this is first of all this is a fight there for the government isn't the way to win and second of all if the drug industry has forced to litigate guess what they'll just pass those costs on us\nAll right so let's go to the core or something and this is something I've heard from several doctors\nMan this is very frustrating to them with the with the ads for these pharmaceuticals on TV because they all have patients come in\nAnd they're already pre sold dog I Want you to write me a script for blah blah blah but 'cause I saw it it's going to do all these miraculous things and suddenly I'm going to look like those people on the TV and addition to curing white males me\nAnd so the perspective I've gotten from physicians is that\nWe're the problem more than anything else and that we're allowing ourselves to be to influence by these ads running on TV\nYou know I've heard the same but it's also it's important to remember that at this point in the U.S health care system it's all about turnover or Catholic Haitian in healthcare terms\nWhich means they've got to get you into the office and out of the office as fast as possible so if a patient is digging in his or her ... who says I Want drug X Y Z and I'm not gonna take no for an answer [noise]\nA lot of doctors will simply write the script just to get things moving along and that's kinda\nWhy the drug industry now puts more money into marketing does into research because they know what's affective they don't

service\nIn Eighteen has been a pretty good and busy year um I was recently changed jobs and made some good improvements there are just bought a house or do you see the baby but my question is\nThe job I have they offer a decent ... yeah I can kind of micro manage myself through one of the major providers for four one K. and I was kind of wondering\nWhat kind of direction I could go in you know without kind of putting the gender and so on the things I mean I'm thirty six I'm not really like had a four one K. until now so I Want to do what I can\nKind of got a lot of new responsibilities on you all at once\nRight yes I mean with a new job things are going well I'm not really in a bind at all I'm making more money because of the new job I mean I'm not saying you know late by any means but so I was just wondering what I could do\nWell if there's if you if this is your starting point of saving for retirement you want to do as as much as you possibly can stomach financially to end the four oh one K. did they offer a match where you've gone to work\nOr they start off at six percent and then they\nBuild from there I think I Can't remember right now with a cop out is but I Know they start off at six percent of whatever you say\nAll right so you want to put in as much money as you can to pick up all the free money they're going to give you write and do you know are you offered the option of doing what's known as a raw four one K. or as anybody mentioned that do you are you're only allowed to do traditional four one K.\nThey give me all kinds of options the traditional operator off our a nurse and I think\nActually show a rough four O. one K. so yeah yeah yeah yeah so am I thirty six I Would go a raw four one K.\nMoney the employers matching will be a put down the traditional side that money you contribute goes on the wrong side and if they keep raising what they'll match based on how much you put in\nI Want you to go as far in as you can putting money into that Ross four one K. C. you pick up every single dollar the employer will throw at you and if overtime they'll throw more money at you you increase what you contribute\nAnd end the plan there will be if I'm gathering investing is new for you is that right\nYeah I had just basically started with a ... program before I transferred into my new job so I've only ... you know only dabbled with just a little bit or I you know with my employer now they seem like they're offered a pretty good deal so I wanted\nTo see you around and around every bit of it that they're giving you free money and then as far as an investment choice at least it first keep it as simple as possible and one of the choices you'll likely have as soon as a target retirement fund\nAnd based on your age of thirty six you would want to look at uh twenty fifty find that that would be the year there would be your target for retired ...\nOkay and so you just put all the money you're going to contribute ended at twenty fifty and they'll handle how it's invested for you in a variety of things that would be appropriate\nFor you being at this stage of saving for retirement so congratulations to you again on Nora and best even this new
