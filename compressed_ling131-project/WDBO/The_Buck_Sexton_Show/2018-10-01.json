four vote for up to but not more than one week uh in order to let the FBI um continue to do an investigation limited in time in ... ah to the current allegations that are there\nThat is Jeff Flake uh so what took place today so yesterday where the epidemic Dr ... for it up there she spoke about her experience\nAnd she was with with a hundred percent certainty that it was\nThen Brett Kavanaugh who tried to sexually assault and rape her on a night that you can't quite really remember a and it was him no for sure\nThat we had him speak and he was defiance in his defense of everything\nAnd then today they were going to take a vote which they did but the vote right before he was supposed to happen you could tell there was drama going on I got a couple of text messages and said something's going on here and Jeff Flake who who is the ... you know he's ... center of Arizona\nWho is not going to be centered anymore but ... is going to uh be the new senator\nAnd the fight is on there as we all know\nHe he was not a fan of Trump\nTalking I guess what Susan Collins and a few other Republicans\nIf my Republican colleagues are serious about investigation and they should be for their own faith will include X Y Z four and two other\nBrave courageous sexual assault survivors February and what\nUnfair well those things are you're reaching their and here's the thing this is one thing the Democrats wanted but didn't want because the fear factor is that this is going to be found out to BBS\nAs far as him not say her her situation is it'd be asking that she's a liar but it's coming out that maybe potentially that there isn't anything to die to this guy and what you need is you need Collins\nYou need Murkowski you need flake right mentioned potentially it's just in case you lose one of them and they didn't feel comfortable in doing this especially the two Republican ladies now\nYou've got this opportunity here what do I think will happen\nI think they're going to go and I think they're going to look and I think they're going to find nothing there's an interview his buddy mark judge\nOr I don't know how much ... real credible witness he's going to be because the body's own admission and through the books and stuff that he's written and it's well documented on top of that his addiction and his alcoholism\nAnd his issues that he's had a that how credible he can be either way and then you're you know other people have already signed affidavit and\nThey're going to go to them and there's only so much they can do there is no crime scene so there is no let's go for fingerprints there is no hey we've got\nDNA kids now and we've got this DNA back has none of that stuff and I'll tell you why I think this is good\nBecause\nIf and when and I do think when this emergency like if they find something then it it's good that we know and we move on right\n\nIt is if they don't find anything and I don't think they will but I've been wrong before nobody wrong again but you never know based on all the things I've seen it's just still too hard to say he was there\nFor he wasn't there\nYou're just you're just going at each other's words right and even some of the witnesses I mean it's it's you're you're it it it's still going to be he said she said in the end but if the Republicans play this right and that big word is if they play this right\nYou have a lot of independence that are out there who are watching this\nRight I'm not talking about you the partisan tribal red and blue I'm Talking about the independents will sway these elections in a few weeks in one direction or the other\nWho are watching this unfold and while they are looking going well you know they treated Dr Ford pretty well\nOr the Democrats they they they didn't treat\nKavanaugh's nice what we saw was a man fell with anger even re and health is yeah\nI Would agree to by the way will touch on that in a minute but if you play your cards right\nYou have a chance here\nTo energize your base because the left has been doing it you have a chance to take back a bit of the conversation and you have a chance\nTo to really get some momentum in the last\nFew weeks to to do for all intents and purposes little pie in the face of the Democrats if you do it correctly and if the show's nothing\n\nAnd the again big word if because as we all know the Republicans are always\n\nGreat at capitalizing on bad situation somebody just tax in and says what does it matter they're not going to vote yes this is about the Democrats voting yes how many times I have to say this this is about the people like Susan Collins is a Republican and Lisa Murkowski who's a Republican who don't feel comfortable\nAnd I've already said and talk to Jeff Flake before all of this that they weren't comfortable moving forward and they would like to see an FBI investigation so if you want to move forward your vote today go ahead you're going to lose\n'cause you're gonna lose\nThree two three five three twenty four twenty three and she had been some shows your Twitter Lee what's happening\nHey how's it going good mental to make a quick point all noticed that about five hundred years of English common law got thrown out the window of doubt about it but it's a sign of starting\nA kale Republican independent all Democrats really need to wake up and look around at what's going on\nThe ticket lost ... yeah you know look a lot\nYeah so we lost a lot yes we can we just be honest with ourselves no matter what side of the aisle you're on we lost a little bit of respect the world is watching us and they watched that debacle yesterday and that that that crazy pantomime\nTheatrics and the ... was it was\nIt was awful it was it was it at one time it we're watching somebody who was having an issue who's who's having a real struggle and I think she is a I think she's a very\nUh I think her issue that she had whatever it was was very real I've never called her a liar I'm not going to color a large ... too many people text me she's a liar she's a blanket ... that would\nEver go away or what I Do think is I think she had some issues\nAnd the second thing with him I think you know you're watching a an execution at least an attempt by the Democrats of a man in his life and that's why he's pissed an angry and if somebody called you a rapist if somebody said all these things about you if somebody brought up all these allegations and I would if you\nIf you didn't yeah if you work past if you weren't emotional\nThat would scare me more every body out there ... I I'm surprised\nI would've you know as somebody said well for instance I said who is who we've left that I just I don't know it's it's just uncomfortable how angry was and stuff and ... and then he looked at me goes but in saying that if that was me I'd probably do the same thing and I'm it\nThat's it right that's it it is a\nSituation if the Republicans played right I think they've got an opportunity here but that's a big if they play it right\nAnd to continue to answer the question that people will say why do we care they're not going to vote yes it is not about the Democrats it's about making sure that the Republicans that you need to vote for unsure about\nIt is and already said they would vote no without an investigation getting them to vote without them boating you lose is the way they're looking at it so what do you do\n\nIt's about flake it's about Murkowski it's about college\nLike she was she she hurt us [noise]\nUm [noise]\nYou know there's no predicting but I'm\nThat she will do the right thing and take this opportunity to slow the process down\nSomebody text and they need longer there they they don't need longer\nThere's not a lot you're going to do you're going to sit down with three four people have already signed ... under the penalty of perjury should should they lie a felony and they're going to answer questions and it's going to take it it's not twelve weeks it's not fifty you could probably do it I mean the Anita Hill thing was three days\n\nThere's not copious amounts of material and and crime scenes and and and and you know people to talk to\nIt is a small select few that you either have somebody from the if they're in a different state you have them go to there is somebody in the FBI office\nFly out there and meet somebody from the local office and they go and investigate and they talk and that person may say look here's the deal I was Fifteen I was having a few bruise we were hanging out a\nAll summer that year I was Seventeen I don't remember any of what she's talking about or yeah I remember being there I remember\nWhat happened that's it I don't know what else anybody wants them to do is like yeah we needed there is no file cabinet in the corner with some sort of special like you know filed it as oh here it is a cold case there's none of it's just a few questions\nRight and then and then if you have to hug somebody down and the big thing is people are asking the question how did you get home who drove around\n\nThe question could that person to be the key we can't stop forever if Anita Hill\nWas only three days I think seven days is long enough for this especially because we already know the people that we need to talk to three two three five three twenty four twenty three ... shows your

them it might be a little awkward but believe me you know less\nLearn more and stop tax dump rex dot org ... by the ad council in the national Highway Traffic Safety Administration\nShow Kelly from Orlando was morning news we get you the news and information every\nMorning as your hobby into the car\nFor nine o'clock Brian kilometers actually talking to the newsmakers and that's what's so great Joe that's what I have a chance to not only do you what I think's going on but you can tell me what do you think's going on from your perspective I feel like we have a\nDialogue the Brian Sylvie weekday nights 'til noon news to point five double the TV [noise]\nHave they have the votes have the vote okay this is getting ridiculous and you know what as the Democrats have already said if if he's confirmed and we find out\nThat these are credible sources and we know that he did these things\nWhat did they say\nImpeach him yeah well okay so you already have that on the table if all of this just proved but it's getting to be silly season with this\nYeah they've already said that no matter what\nThey plan on investigating him if this blue wave happens mhm so at this point I think you're right I mean Republicans have I think done a lot to try to especially with Dr forward to allow her to come out and talk and give her side of the story and all that and the goalposts kept moving all last week but now it will be fair\nNot just the goalposts David but what you just said the story keeps changing right and all these I mean none of these would get a day in court because there's nothing there and as far as credible have the vote and then oh if he is turning out to be this horrible guy\nThat you say he is well then you can impeach him yes but I think we all believe this is what it appears to be a desperate attempt to keep this guy from the Supreme\nCourt so at the Ronan Farrow story no one else who was supposedly there has confirmed this including Ramirez his best friend but they ran with it anyway and George Stephanopoulos had the follow up on that\nBut hey wait a minute what about this though you don't really have anybody else corroborating\nAny moment as you were writing the stories is close to the nomination did you sort of want to push the pause button to say are we sure this is the right thing to do [noise]\nOrange I just want to stress very clearly we take reporting that type of really serious evidence or a basis for the number of witnesses you were told at the time I saw it in excess of what we typically see in this kind of a investigator for the\nMeal with sexual assaults assault claims it very often that there are multiple people willing to say they went to sit in the room and the individuals who were most primary tests are people ... were egging Brett Kavanaugh and those are the ones who signed that statement that you talked about\nHer best friend was there ... her best friend nobody seems to remember nobody who was supposed to be in the room\nIs saying that they heard about it anyway James ... a mayor total wrote this story ... this was this is one of the most astounding clips you'll hear all day\nShe was on CBS this morning talking about the story she's asked about one will be quote unquote corroborating witnesses that they hinged this entire story on\nHe remembers it from from he was in the same dorm same same little building on ... campus and he remembers say clearly I asked him you know before it even ... careful no I said he heard it from someone who was there and as long as I said I'm\nWe interviewed him and I said to him are you sure it was Brett Kavanaugh said I Am a hundred percent sure that he was not at the party\nSo he wasn't at the party but he remembered hearing about it at some point in passing I mean in other words I think we know where this goes\nKnow it was a surprise to me was the\nOrioles were all humor thing I thought when I hear this lady on the radio this morning saying well no he wasn't in the room but he remembers hearing about\nThis going down ... at the time\nYeah what are we doing here [noise] ridiculous\nSo someone pulled a knife on Mr hand it was ... no that wasn't it\nAgain man or trying to go along with that we talked about it all last week if there is a victim they deserve to have their story be told get that the timing of all this really ...\nAnd you can't find any one that was there a dorm party that you know you're playing drinking games but no one else remembers it not even the person that's alleging is their best friend ... come on please\nBut anyway we go on is this some sort of left wing conspiracy or what [noise] when you say that it sounds goofy yes\nBut this kind of sounds like a luck and when she does it not\nNo I just think you are throwing out these types of allegations without anybody backing it up\nAnd it it certainly does look like there are some motivation that are beyond just quote unquote getting the truth out here and all last week I mean as it pertains to Dr Ford all last week I was like I'm willing to hear her out and I'm willing to wait to see if any other evidence that whatever may have happened it happened\nBut when the story keeps changing and then even the other woman who was supposed to be at that party says we can't remember she she can't remember a party ever happening where they were all together right I don't\nThe credibility disappears for me or I think most people reasonable gamble\nPut it that way Kellyanne Conway also on CBS this morning to react to the new cabinet allegation\nStarting to feel like a ... pei an air time answering a gathering of people I mean the last couple of trying to verify\nThey ... they couldn't go forward with every importing because they're supportive of President Trump's Supreme Court nominees that because they had ...\nAnd they have come forward and in taxpayer times also running for it for ... asking people off a memory and counting ... shore\nWow and you do wonder is really all this about roe v Wade is that what this comes down to is that while the freak out of desperation\nThat they don't like this guy's ... a policy positions and that's why they're going so hard after him right now yeah could be talking about Thirty years I mean certainly one of the Democrats or who has been leading the charge against Kavanaugh Mazie Hirono of Hawaii [laughter]\nI mean set over the weekend and we'll get to it a little bit later but said over the weekend basically ah I Know I don't trust his policy on abortion and therefore I don't trust his word when it comes to sexual assault\nI mean she said that so because he has a different world view than me\nI don't think he's telling the truth yes okay that's the take All right\nOkay well we'll also get a little bit later on the Washington Post a story how they sandbag a story that could have cleared Brett Kavanaugh on um boy it was a big day yesterday the world of sports not just all the football upsets\nTiger Woods I Know you don't care about David is there any part of your going hey good for him yeah sure why not [laughter]\nNo I really it's not that against tiger it is it is cool if I sit down and I watch some of the coverage I can get sucked into it I admit it 'cause I like a good story but I'm just I'm so agnostic when it comes to\nJust Gulf in general I understand I don't really care I'm and I'm a golf nerd you know I admit that it was just something to see this guy come all the way back and and I mean\nI Know all the experts today are going to be ... trying to change their story\nYou know what I mean and say man I I could see this I could see it coming because a lot of people did\nNot she's not ever going to win another term what the Bible was for the call his whole\nCampaign showing up at these tournaments day pretty much knowing that\nGoing to be there to short game is going to his house is gone the next ... Tiger Woods say the least the I'm retiring by of considered him now for the last five six years of form\nUp all your ahead retire with\nOkay to all those guys but I just want to say my God I'm tired of being right thank you [noise]\nOn that a little bit later um we also have to get to the story of I guess this was two thousand seven\nSpread Kevin on tiger tokens [laughter] that's just breaking a also news this okay well there's a whole lot to get through coming up on the marching band came\nOut [noise]\n... children are dying in cars and the Orlando area a mother accused of leaving your one year old in the back seat on friday is out of jail still no charges after a four year old boy died in an odd carry in orange county the same date\nCounsel to President Trump telling CNN she's been the victim of sexual assault UCF wind up a point to the a P college football pulled a number of twelve the gators make twenty two\nAnd make sure that the FBI can investigate initially Connell\nJeff Flake and John if\nDo is we're Orlando term for\nBreaking news news Ninety six point five W de Vito\nSeventy percent off that train court furniture than than her campaign Seventy percent off new retail price and she was from a wide variety of previously means furniture Andy calling from your home or on a cell phone from one Ninety nine Ninety nine bedrooms that's from three Ninety nine Ninety nine\nDining from two Ninety nine Ninety nine ... items are coordinated by guaranteed stock value for delivery aren't you take home and make us my county and did that one of our five okay sins and again the Oregon line at the heart clearance furniture dot com mentioned radio twenty ... twenty percent off\nYou want women to be able to come forward and tell their story but does that automatically mean that guy is guilty [noise]\nGet to that much more coming up on the marketing banking [noise]\nDid you just look down at your phone [noise] and he did it again then you know you find down the road in three ton hunk of steel\nAnd attack takes your eyes off the road for an average of five seconds at fifty five miles per hour that's not enough to travel the length of a football field and cause some serious damage\nTurn it off trust me\nIt is you'll is\nLearn more stop tax stomp rex dot org ... by the ad council and the national Highway Traffic Safety Administration [noise]\nThis is news Ninety six point by having your baby to Orlando turns first for breaking news\nMe I just sort of you Deborah Ramirez Gail\nClassmate of Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh and be secular three women accusing him of sexual improprieties in the past a source tells ABC News she provided a list of witnesses to her alleged ... ah to her allegation that Kavanaugh exposed himself to\nHer the fact is that judge Kavanaugh's behavior back then is being called into question because if he had a drinking problem or if he had a number of drinks to where he blacked out then the question is when he blacked out did he forget the fact that he may have committed some kind of sexual assault\nFormer FBI special agent Steve Gomez is an ABC News contributor saying it'll mean free markets in fair trade the U.S and Canada announced agreement on the basis of a free trade zone including the U.S Canada and Mexico\nIran's revolutionary guard announced it launched ballistic missiles into eastern Syria targeting would've called militants believed to attack the military parade last month killing at least twenty four people Richard camp to ABC News\nWith twenty five percent off on new NFL Seventy percent off previously refreshing you really need a better reason a party when things house how new correspondents are clear and interact with more than nine thousand square feet at NYU and previously in these furniture and acorn for your home and not so fast timeline Ninety nine Ninety nine bedrooms some real Ninety nine Ninety nine\nDining out some Ninety nine Ninety nine animal I presented prizes and find all weekend long ... clearance are wondering nine point lead Jackson memorial highway weren't on line at ... dot com\nBeauty knew all in one hair color can make it easy killing your hair at home\nEverything in his column for the the routine things out\nBy professional open to everyone Sally beauty [noise]\nProgressive present yet but we should be doing stuff\nOut of your budget Boston\nSchool when you want to pay for insurance and hope you find out something that you're going to get you get out and you don't you don't you don't mind\nOh wait that's just those kids laughing at me\nDown and of course the casualties address company that's prices have limited by state law\nOr clients deserves a program that is unique personalize it customized just for them no one size fits all off the shelf big box programs here getting ready for a new instead of you\nIn bed or Leno dot com is a thousands of people in central Florida and we can help you to take the first step today a buck five eighty nine T.

[laughter]\nThat stormy Daniels' lawyer Tucker Carlson lovingly refer to him as a creepy porn lawyer yeah he is making so much more serious allegations against Brett Kavanaugh and already suggesting that I should say and I will say man he'd better have some evidence of this otherwise this is a new low\nEven for this guy I agree\nI totally agree him as saying something because he claims that he has another credible accuser of bread cabin I wrote a letter to the Senate Judiciary committee saying that he's got quote significant evidence of multiple house parties in the Washington DC era\nOur area rather during the Nineteen eighties were Kavanaugh mark judge one of the guys involved in this all this stuff\nUm and others would quote participate in the targeting of women with alcohol and drugs\nHave an Audi included a list of questions for Senate investigators to ask Kavanaugh including did you ever attend any house party during which a woman was gang raped or use for sex by multiple men\nOkay\nFirst thing that jumps out to me this story is that everybody says he has another credible accuser [noise] ah I don't even know what the word\nCredible means right now I thought I knew a week and a half ago yeah but we keep hearing credible but now we're learning the credible can mean also without any evidence\nAnd with the changing story as as the case of Christine Blasey Ford yes so obviously you take this with a grain of salt yeah\nUm you know and that's the thing\nI don't know if you happen to see this yesterday hotter with keeping track of it that a Wall Street journal reporter was going through you know the different details of what transpired and the changing story and\nSaid you know the Washington Post sandbag the story that might have cleared Brett Kavanaugh\nBecause\nAs we heard first from Dr Ford there were four guys at this party right yes\nBut then we find out it wasn't there was a woman there um but this woman says ah one\nI didn't know Brett Kavanaugh do I was never had a party like the one describe\n\nThey could have reported that the Washington Post yeah\nThey did not know and that story seem to get buried in the weekend news cycle poison that going on in our house and then ... I I was seeing some of the reaction to this because what's her name it's a legal in Kaiser is that right yes ah who is the friend\nWho says that she was a lifelong friend of a doctor forward also says she believes what Dr Ford says\nBut cannot verify that this party ever happened so a lot of the people who have been coming out and saying Brett Kavanaugh is a terrible human being banned he should not be on the Supreme Court even though we have no evidence was saying that well I mean part of what she is coming out and saying is that she believes her friend so that should be proof enough\nExcept you're also trying to establish that they were all together in the same house not talking about whether or not there in the same room because I don't think you'll ever prove that one way or the other\nBut if you had woman and I was in there yes they have right now you have one out of the five people only one out of the five people\nWho is saying that this party ever happened if this were any other situation any other news story you would say I'm having problems\nBelieving that this person is credible the person making the accusation right\nBy the way all those people Kaiser and then there was Patrick ... mark judge Brett Kavanaugh yeah they've all denied the incident ever happened under penalty of perjury right the only person who was not made a statement under oath is the accuser Dr fourth\nFifth right I mean so at what point do you do you sort of give up on the credibility thing\n[laughter] I mean if you're just trying to take the evidence as it is right now but I Know that gets in the way of the narrative and", "year": "2018", "show_name": "The Buck Sexton Show", "city": "Orlando", "day": "01"}
