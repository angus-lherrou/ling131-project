he goes to Pittsburgh in the wake of Saturday synagogue massacre but not everyone's happy about the visit\nSo there's one progressive Jewish group in Pittsburgh saying the president's not welcome it totally fully denounces white supremacy their response to that the White House or the president has repeatedly denounced bigotry and racism in all forms\nAnd Sarah Sanders said the president is going to Pittsburgh to show support for the Jewish community and she pointed out that the rabbi from the tree of life synagogue has said that he is welcome\nABC's Jonathan Karl showing solidarity with Pittsburgh numerous interfaith services were held nationwide in Los Angeles city council member above blooming field we come together\nThat tried to get into the black shirt and church and then went into Kroger the whites the premise what do they have in common\nLoser loser\nSomebody else's fault it's not my fault the reason that I'm the way I Am is because of X Y and Z it's not because of me\nNow because of my choices it's because other people collectively have gotten together whether it's the scientist regime that is the puppet master just pulling the strings\nOr it's the fact that people are coming here from different nations who are what they're taking our jobs are taking our livelihood they're destroying our culture they're doing all of these days oh my God it's raised in I live in a hotel by myself and I have no friends\nCheck check check check\nLooser that's what this guy is if you look and you draw parallels to all of them it's like serial killers right we kind of know what we're looking for was serial killers\n\nWith these type of people we know exactly who they are they're withdrawn loners this guy found a place to have a platform in an echo chamber with other losers very similar\nTo him who are pitching whining and moaning about all kinds of things that have gone wrong in their life and it's always somebody else's fault it's always somebody else's fault it's never\nTheir fault never their fault\nSomebody else's fault and I think if we as as I've been watching\nIn the news over the weekend first of all everybody's looking for a place to place blame right there it is it's from because of his rhetoric you heard a lot of that this weekend but it it in a different way you they looked at the bomber guy they kinda\nThey they really tried to tie everything together it's tough with this even though some have been trying to tie it together because Trump's Trump's son in law\nJewish his daughter for murder Judy at his grandchildren Jewish his love of Israel\nThe Israeli ambassador to the United states came out and said look there's been nobody friendlier and better and a bigger supporter of Israel then Donald trumps of even try to draw a parallel\n\nThat somehow he takes some sort of blame for this and he's the cause of this but what you're not going to hear and what you should be hearing is he's a loser\nHe's a man who's failed life who's looking around at his failures and the only thing he can come up as it's\nNot my fault that I didn't get a promotion it's not my fault that I couldn't get a good job it's not my fault that nobody likes me it's not my fault that women won't date me it's not my fault for these things\nIs a collective conspiracy theorists mind of\nHim sitting around with other people in the same situation getting ready to figure out how we can blame this on somebody else and that's exactly what\nThey did his act was evil pure and simple\nBut if you really look at it it's a simple thing to understand this guy is a giant loser but\nHe's got a three bedroom two bath house with a wife and kids or a business or a great job or even a decent job he's got any of these things put together\nGuess what he's not it's not really a loser\nAnd when you're not really a loser he got nobody to blame because life seems to be okay so you're moving on with your life what he's seen as people across the board\nGet ahead and he has\nSo there's got to be a reason for that right it's got to be a reason I'm not putting sooner field for the Yankees because a high school coach hated me and totally ruined my life 'cause I was the man\nLosers absolute losers but never let a situation like this\nGo without the opportunity to get a few jabs in at the president and in some way tired somebody semi back to him\nI have to understand that there are words matter I don't think anybody should know Donald Trump or why responsible for what happened [laughter] Pittsburgh series you know you have learned sex on our society or who are loose with guns [laughter]\nBut I Do thank you very special responsibility first of all sorts of things one of her social responsibility for the moral tone of the country what are we expect our presence Lewis partially in times of crisis to bring us together as Trump has an effect on a leash than the dogs with her those country [laughter]\nI Know some I look look the reality is some people feel emboldened because of Trump in the attitude yes that's true\nRight but the media plays a big part in it to\nWrite because hate is business and business is booming on both sides of the island there and and and and and and they like fighting and they like arguing and it's more entertaining than sitting around and being bland and so they'll focus on these kinds of things and it's great right like it's it's business\nBut for a guy like this he he wasn't living in a world of of you know he didn't care about Trump and what he had the same if you read some of the stuff that you wrote he couldn't stand Trump thought Trump was was being used essentially a puppet by the scientist you know Israel and Jews that were controlling him and\n... I wouldn't be caught dead in America had I mean this guy is he was no fan of Trump this guy was singularly focused even the nurses just of the of of of of of a level that is is different than the\nGuy that thinks he's the bees me in his life has great this guy's what was the was the nurses just of the loser kind\nOne guy thinks he's God's Gift to the world and he's got a lot going for that's what keeps him from being a guy like this this guy is a nurse assistant thinks the only reason he's not that is because older people have kept him down\nYou can't latest at the foot of Trump or the people who feel embolden become the Trump someone I Would assume yeah right absolutely there there there was some some people out there that feel emboldened but you can't hold somebody's ... him responsible for this guy's actions\nThis guy's actions are all on him and this guy's action started a long time ago with his belief that he was being held down by whatever reason the Jews that people bring coming from different countries all of these things\nAnd that they were destroying his world to get ahead and because of that he couldn't have friends because of that he couldn't get a real job because of that he had no wife no girlfriend or boyfriend do no job no career no no prospects for anything he was a giant looser\nAnd when he's a loser of that size you look to find out\nWho can I blame the sun and after a while you Janet up so much inside of your head and you're getting the echo chamber like he was with other people like him\nAnd they feed off each other and they poison each other and finally something snaps and he thinks he's got to go do something and this right here is going to give him credit to a certain extent and because of that he won't be a loser at least in a certain circle of people know you're a loser\nYou always were and if you didn't do this over the weekend you were still a loser because you're a loser three two three five three eight twenty four twenty three at you had mentioned shows your Twitter tweet at us love hearing from you\nA Mac is amazing you know people are going to get you out what the Mac okay a Mac association which are American citizens but this is what they're doing so you've got Medicare open Roman is coming out here they partner with my ... with me and their first of all the stuff they're doing\nIs incredible the way they go out there and advocate and a half or a lot of things that you believe in as the conservative alternative to do something like our\nRight but they don't want government run health care they won't healthcare done better\nThey don't want a you know just a a ... immigration for they weren't real comments at the immigration what they do all this but they've got all these kind of benefits one of his is the Medicare open the Roman so let's say you're over the age it you know you're you're over the age of fifty you can join for free today I'm so you got to do that but\nHow would you like to have your own dedicated person who's going to help you with important decisions regarding Medicare\nThat's what they'll do for you you're going to get your senior resource network a person there to help you with us and they're going to give you the membership for free for a year so you get all these benefits retail restaurant hotel discounts you know travel discounts discounts to movies this counts the theme parks all of these things that there's so many of them but on top of that\nYou're going to have somebody working with you advocating you're half it's incredible oh you have to do to join for free today doesn't cost you punish but a Mac dot US sports last chance\nThat a Mac dot US Ford's last year the year membership free they didn't want your credit card am a C. dot U.
