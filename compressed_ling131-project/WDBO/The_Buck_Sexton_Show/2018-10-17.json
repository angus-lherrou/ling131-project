couldn't be their voice and that was a pain I'm sure in the Saudis that\nThis is all the beginning of both a cover up and separating the crown prince from the accent because the blowback of the ... I think the Saudis and the crown prince a grossly underestimated the kind of international or program that followed this act [noise]\nYeah I don't think they thought they saw I think they thought they were getting rid of somebody who was a pain that the world wasn't going to pay attention to but journalists now\nRight\nHe had two million plus\nTwitter followers he was an\nInfluence or and as we see in the world of influence there's when it comes to on line ... ... they're not going to go quietly and\nWhen you do something like this in the way that it's done in the heinous way that it's done and you know this is here here's something\nIt's his fiance that for all intents and purposes raised the alarm because without her being their imagined if he would have went there that day right so he goes there that day or says I've got some errands\nAnd he goes to get the piece of paper so they can get married and then he's\nNever heard from again she was outside waiting she raised the alarm\nIf it wasn't for that\nThis may have been just say you know hey turkey it's crazy place aired on all of this stuff you never know journalist we we understand it so if there is some issues here and now how high does it go\nDoes it go to the highest meaning\nDoes it go up to the king and the prince at all does it go up to that level in Saudi Arabia and their knowledge of it\nTurkish intelligence is already let it be known that they have ... we have at the sense that this was plotted and ball personally the crown prince [noise]\n[noise] that's not good and that's where Trump is going to have to decide what do I do in a situation like that how do I approach something like this because I Need to do this in a way that you know he's trying to walk\nA line of I don't want to throw away everything for this and at the same time I can't let this be something that's the norm on my watch or anybody's watch\nAnd if I Do decide to step away from this and all of a sudden six months or a year from now you see the middle east starting to really this domino effect of craziness goes on over there you've already got issues with Saudi Arabia and the Yemen nice and and the huge famine that's going on there\nAnd it it there there are some serious issues there\nThis is why being president it's all about this is absolutely it and it may be out of his hands because you may get Congress to comes out and said you know we're not doing any deal with them will get through sanctions on them and there you go take\nThree two three five three twenty four twenty three ... mention shows your Twitter you can tweet at us where did your segment coming up a little bit cold what I said what you heard\nBecause no matter what I say at times people hear different things and it just [noise]\n... has frustrating you know it's not frustrating looking good rarely do I look good but today a look pretty damn good thank you bomb fell now when I when bomb fell ... to say we want to dress you and I said\nOK\nCannot horrible dresser I just I'm a jeans and T shirt kind of guy like that's my thing is that we really want you to look good you do more stuff at the TV and all these campaigns much outside\nSo low and behold today I got this amazing shirt on credible pants they fit amazing I get my own style is a bomb fell you will to hundreds of thousands of men are finding out this is the way you shop and they have the best brands and your style is mine's everything about you\nYou know not only what your sizes what your style what do you what are you looking for you or your casually business casual do you want to look dressed in the night and then they supply you with the absolute most incredible clothes and I will tell you this when you put something on\nYou can tell the difference between something you bought somewhere cheap and something that's really made and it is it is amazing here's the deal right so they send you stuff\nRight you you you try it on if you don't like it you send it back to him this free return shipping get paid for what you keep and when you buy multiple items you get up to twenty percent off\nHundreds of thousands of measure or shopping this way you should do the same could a bomb fell today that's B.

until proven innocent\nWell and he can play in this arena really well you're trying to figure out okay what's the truth because those against from all of a sudden like there you go there's this zinger mhm take that they're taking it very seriously one one thousand\nOf Native American heritage but that's the story that comes out later in the day of the sea and so yeah\nYou heard the name is Mike Lee ... is there room one window into one of my own or here's a country or the ...\nOne one thousand I don't know how they certainly wouldn't want to say you know what I mean ...\nWhere are you going to have my servers Italy will not be something I enjoy that [noise] [noise]\n[laughter] by the way [laughter]\nWere they were surveying hurricane damage in Florida when I was asked and so there's going off and the theme of last week how dare you ask about Elizabeth Warren's DNA test when people have died in the storm\nThis is not the most important thing for you to be asking the president about but they thought there was a gotcha moment and while rabid how dare Elizabeth Warren talk about anything other than the hurricane\nBecause she wants to run for president if he wants to poke honest thing to go away obviously yes so the story there's a Larry's Cherokee Nation\nYeah well they're not happy about no nation secretary of state check Austin based out of uh Tulsa not thrilled by Elizabeth Warren's publicity stunt with the DNA test a he was on with Jake Tapper on CNN to attack\nThe problem with the DNA test is that it proves nothing relevant as to whether a person is a citizen of the Indian nation and they were an Indian nation DNA as best you can give you some indicators of some markers that indicated that you're\nRelated to somebody who lived long ago that may have lived in North and South America and maybe the native peoples of those continents um is irrelevant to what it means to be a Native Americans in this country that just holier than helpful or for any national leader to a claim to DNA to determine or or to the tabloids\nThat their Native American in this country and\nIt doesn't quite fit the bill what this test is\nDoes she not think this would get found out in a hurry this has backfired\nIn a massive wave your ads well and I think if you come out with the with the result of a DNA test and you don't have the same kind of fanfare about it I don't think the the self own is quite as devastating\nBut the fact that she made such a big\nDeal out of it in a five minute long campaign style video where she's talking about I got my mom is great and my daddy's Bob I'm or whatever you're going all over talking to different people talking to your family members about how Trump is terrible when hates Native Americans which is ridiculous\nAnd then you actually have again Cherokee Nation secretary of state Chuck cost and say oh Hoskins rather saying no this doesn't mean anything and in fact what you're doing is deal legitimize ing us as a sovereign nation [noise] yeah\nI saw you know I still here in my head what's that the first clue how\nI call her goofy she is I don't know if you go and see\nWhat's going to get brought out again and again\nBut it is I mean I I at the back and forth over this whole thing has been kind of silly any way in when you have this come out yesterday it takes it to a whole different level of comedy\nYeah so in that and tapper interview he's like coming back saying well she says she's not claiming any tribal citizenship right cheaters backing up the claim that she's had\nSome native heritage and dude from Cherokee Nation is pushing back on\nThat it's not particularly helpful the Indian country I'm for this kind of debate to go back and forth we have a lot of issues we would rather depressing United States and Senator Warren focusing on things that affect us housing\nAnd healthcare yelling water clean air there's a lot of issues that we could use their leadership on but we don't think it's particularly useful to have them in the back and forth about DNA test in the name calling and that sort of thing\nBut it's more on that we want to get to but another story out there involving Trump totally different story is Stormy Daniels yeah and the defamation suit\nFederal judges tossed this defamation lawsuit against President Trump now this is one of a couple of different legal battles that Stormy Daniels and Michael have an Audi are involved and against the president a but a Daniels had sued Trump after this tweet about her story of a guy threatening or\nYou know and remember that whole thing where there was the police sketch that kind of looked like Tom Brady yes just a little bit and he said well no that actually looks like your husband\nAnd so at any rate he tweeted out or retweeted an image making fun of her a little bit they sued for defamation judge says no no there's no defamation here in fact you're going to pay his attorney the whole well\nBecause of that for the president is feeling pretty good about this is a this is a obvious when for the president and cause these protected under the first amendment\nYes everybody wondered how this wouldn't\nYou know why this whole lawsuit whereas this go and they haven't thrown out like that you remember seriously man when\nThis got filed it was in the top block most of the today show every news outlet right you see in the city where today\nUh I saw a little bit about it but again this isn't the main lawsuit that has been covered so breathless way there's what sort of this was a separate idea or a separate lawsuit\nYes it also got covered yeah but you're not seeing much joy what happened today\nThey got here there were blurbs about it but certainly it's not wall to wall news today no better judge says no you can't sue for defamation and this is what a lot of people including I think us on the show of argued\nYou can't prove it somebody to famed you if you can also show that you have financially benefited from what they've said so aside from the first amendment protections for the president I mean you can't say that she was the fame because she's made a mint off of this whole thing\nOh yeah the make America horny door yes then\nSome Oreos [laughter]\nIt's it's\nIt's the shot that Trump takes stormy then today that is going to be talked about for a while dun dun dun we will get to
