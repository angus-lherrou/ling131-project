FBI investigation and everything else they're still just not a shred of evidence substantiate her allegations and in fact I've even been refuted\nThat oh evidence is silly ... stock and again she wrote a really interesting in a very I think it's a provoking an opinion piece in USA Today I Am a sexual assault survivor and I don't want you to just take my word for it because you you could identify with her what she was saying because you too had gone through something similar\nRight yeah and yeah and like I like I said when she was detailing you know\nThe aftermath of that whole experience allegedly that she was saying you know I I should just move on and just pretend it didn't happen and I'm like well okay I you know that took me back I can remember feeling that way but I I you know you still need to look at the the testimonies and the facts objectively and they're just really wasn't anything that back up what she said at the end of the day\nYeah which is I Know it's crazy because we're watching when you watched that they're used to all the people out there and they're protesting do all of them and it was the just believe you must believe as if you weren't going to believe that somehow you were a bad person because\nYou know you entered your article was something that they thought it was very profound it was John Adams a he said he said it best once innocence is condemn virtue itself is no security you're looking out there and you're seeing all of these things and you're saying to yourself\nYou may identify with those people but the reality is you have to have proof in this day and age and people don't care about facts anymore it's feelings that seems ruled today\nThat's so true and some of the backlash had gotten which I've gotten quite a lot of backlash especially for women ironically enough and from writing this piece but I was told that it's even it's wrong to even ask a survivor for evidence because that would be the victim blaming since we live in a patriarchal society\nSo I mean that's that's the kind of stuff that they believe that it's just it's just mad that's\nHow I mean that's the same thing is you're a woman you've gone

should go if we're going to lead would Felix\nRight it's it's really scary I mean that's that's a scary precedent this whole ... and you know a lot of people responded to my article saying well well
