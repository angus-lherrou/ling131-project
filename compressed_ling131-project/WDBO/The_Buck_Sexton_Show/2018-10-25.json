be this side versus that side I don't want this to be black versus white I don't want this to be right versus left\nI Want this to be a conversation where we sit down and we have differing views and I

to write you don't get this at home with your spouse or your boyfriend you'd go for your kids your kids is\nThere's two ideas of how we should look at this do I think the left wants completely open borders or there are a few people that are probably that way yes\nYes just like there's a few people on the right that would like to shut down never let anybody else in here ever again right but those people are nuts and we're going to take them out of the equation so the left and right fight over ... which side thinks they have the better idea when it comes to immigration\nAnd while they argue about it\nRight and they throw those balls in the air and then argue about these balls in the air and they're arguing at each\nOther neither decided to catch anything and it just hits the ground\nAnd you're like\nOh that's that's that's crazy why is it\nBecause there's nothing in it for they don't want so instead of actually saying look we're going to a there's a there's a great story that Norman Schwarzkopf told one time about\nWhen he was first in the military and and general Schwarzkopf said they were deciding what they were going to do they're removing a base in to a certain area and they done years and years of research\nAnd they sat down and the commanding officer\nAt the time the commanding general can make that decision and again this is one source to first got into it\nHe walks in and he hears a Fifteen minute pitch from both sides of what they were going to do where they were gonna move it and the whole nine yards or if they're going to keep in the same place and he he hears Fifteen minutes this has been like a year or two of them putting together all this data all these figures he hears like Fifteen minutes from both sides and it goes okay we're going to do that\nAnd he said later on that night\nHe ... he goes permission you know speak freely says yeah go ahead and he says can I ask you questions to shoot he says how did you come up with all of the years of data and all the stuff and all the information they have all these kinds of things all of this stuff that happened\nThat they put together for this and in Fifteen minutes you decided to do that and he said it's simple somebody's got to make a decision and we're either gonna find out that the thing that I picked was right or going to find out that it wasn't wrong and then we can reverse of course\nBut without make any decision nothing was going to happen and that's what we've got with ... with our ... our political world across the board without making decisions nothing gets done\nAnd that's the

what's happening with this you know all these bombs is it's\nA false flag narrative I find it funny that it's only people uh uh it's ironic that the three main sources of the lie against Trump happened to get suspicious packages\nRight you know the left is responsible for the packages censor themselves it's it's out there I don't buy it just like with this it's it's not just this is how cynical we become as a country is our first belief is if it's not us and it doesn't happen to us that it's got to be alive\nThree two three five three twenty four twenty three ... that's in shows your Twitter you can tweet at us love hearing for you for a long ...

[noise]\nThis is news maybe six point by having the the window turns worse for breaking news\nABC News on TV and the secret\nService FBI another federal law enforcers are investigating\nThe seven package bombs delivered to President Trump's critics including Hillary Clinton President Obama congresswoman Maxine Waters of California and also to CNN ABC News chief justice correspondent Thomas latest in the investigation\nAgents combing through the parts to determine where each item connected to the packages were purchased holding the trail will lead them to a suspect or suspects the package is also being examined for fingerprints or DNA\nAn endorsement of trying to blow somebody up\nNo I mean honestly for Debbie Wasserman Schultz if you're you know conservative you want her to keep doing her job if there's someone with an axe to grind with hurts Bernie Sanders right\nRight well and speaking of Bernie Sanders I mean he talked about violence in the political realm I mean\nNot Bernie Sanders fault that speech to lease almost died no it's not but you have you know that things are running hard it's a good year to just take a step back from the ledge for a second right away that you can disagree even vehemently so without trying to kill somebody interesting to see who was who sent all this stuff\nYeah and reasonable people will say the same thing they say every time these people are nuts you know of course you're not down with this but there wasn't a big blame\nOn Bernie when that not shot up the baseball field in DC right\nSo anyway so then White House press secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders was asked about it and she came out and sort of of course we disavow all of this\nAnd the White House condemn these types of a horrific and the sick of all acts and we'll work with law enforcement to make sure anybody responsible punished to the fourth set off the wall certainly it's okay to disagree and pollen\nBut it's never OK to take action against another individual and we certainly don't want to see that happen\nI mean that's\nStock it'll be interesting to see what Trump has to say about this ... ... a little bit later on I'm speaking of Trump completely switching gears here\nThis I don't think this is just accident this caravan that's coming up through Mexico and started in Honduras\nJust the timing of it right before the midterms and we are to believe that it's just thousands of people picking up and joining in right who's paying\nFor everything while I was keeping people fed and all that yeah I mean that's a question that's been asked and Everytime you bring up that point you're called a racist or a big it you know that's just the way the world we live and I know\nI'm so yeah I mean now they're what seven thousand there's a second caravan that's being formed as well yes and it does seem like this is a mass protests but I Know there have been you know\nCaravans in the form of protest in the past but this is a particularly large one and you do wonder who's the one organizer you know as soon as the activist behind it or the activist group behind it\nWell they've been talking that it's\nFrom the left of course from different countries\nI don't know our eyebrows I if I Believe that the Republican Party had the wherewithal to do it I Would actually maybe believe a conspiracy theory that the Republicans organize it because it's an issue they went on [noise]\nYou know being floated out there with these pipe bombs as far as well and that and really orchestrated\nAdded to an inside job I don't know just wait until the facts 'cause I Know I Know I've heard that too that it's an inside job I Know is it yeah okay\nI don't I that's what happens now as soon as the news breaks right because they are just like otherwise you're not there is now President Trump did some good old fashioned trolling last night with the big caravan news butting immigration back in the spotlight he tweeted out an old video of Rocco bomb and now this clip is from back when he was a senator\nAnd he says and Obama says oh I'm Sorry Trump wrote I agree with Obama one hundred percent on immigration\nVery generous and welcoming people here in the United states but those who fit or the grocery legally and those who enjoy them disrespect the rule of law and they are showing disregard for those who are Bowling Alone\nWe simply cannot allow people to pour into the United states undetected undocumented bunch and circumventing the line who are waiting patiently diligently unlawfully because immigrants in this country\nThe it wasn't that long ago that even guys like Obama would come out and say things like that you say that today in your racist and you're a big it\nThat is correct and you have people who want a better life\nWell and so if you tweet that out okay is that causing division no that's pointing out hypocrisy very best pointing out the fact that it's not that long ago that Democrats seem to be somewhat on the same page right until they thought they could use it as a political tool to benefit themselves right right [noise]\nYes and that's not hateful that is not not loving that's just the the that's what Obama said there is one hundred percent correct\nAnd meanwhile another story of course it's got to be in the open because all they after the lottery yeah the lottery to beat it was the open on
