that's interesting too I think I may be mentioned already but\nThe window where people they have not been able to find a modern day descendants easy for them so as far as we know they are not related to any living individuals' which means either their entire population died out or\nThe genetic markers found in their DNA bottleneck at some point and just sort of got phased out that we are able to directly linked them so it's it's definitely interesting in that way too that\nIt's not like we can go into a DNA test of somebody today to see if they're related to these indigenous people because there are no genetic ties\nSo you're saying there's no genetic ties to anyone living anywhere in the world\nOh exactly anywhere in the world yep okay modern day descendants see anywhere\nWell this is really interesting and for people just joining us these are the central Florida spin that you're putting on the Smithsonian exhibit it's called genome unlocking life's code once it can tell us what the exhibit self is\nSo the exhibit itself I'm really looks at a variety of different angles about human ... er about will not just humans but also animals and genomes but it has a few different content area so it looked at the genome within us so that's really\nAbout humans and what is that you know what does it mean what are happy with groups of what is DNA so it's really got to kind of help give you the background for understanding especially are genealogy section man there's\nHow it relates to medicine and health to think about\nThey talk about like genomic sequencing and they talk about\nYou know being able to alter our genetic code and what that would mean for the future you know for a long time cloning was a big thing and that was all about genetics [laughter] um and and how we can copy DNA and make things like that happens so that'll be a really sort of good background area and then with the medicine and health again is it\nHow can we alter or genes and what does that mean for us and then how genomes connected humans to all life on planet so what are the what are the connections between our genes and the natural world or our genes and animals so\nIt'll have a variety of information that's going to teach you all about you know mix and again like I said it's got a lot of hands on activities or media interactive there's videos and a lot of different\nEngaging content but it it's going to show a lot of examples of ways that gene on science can affect your life and very ordinary an extraordinary ways the visitors who come here will be able to see how genetics can affect perspectives about their health\nTheir identity and their place in the natural world\nWhich sounds really exciting what is the run of the exhibit\nThe exhibit will open on a October thirteenth and it will go through the beginning of January\nAnd people can enjoy it for free on October thirteenth tell us about that the lowly so October thirteenth\nWill be having a family day so the exhibit will be open for the very first day you can come in come in and get all the secrets on the genealogy before uh before anybody else um but the exhibit will be open and will also have a lot of different activities\nGoing on throughout the building and so we'll be having some different like especially family oriented activities to do with your ... your family tree and DNA and things like that so there's going to be a lot of different things to see and do and it's actually going to be our last weekend that we have the\nPoll second tier exhibition up to it comes down that next week so if people haven't seen that yet also have the opportunity to see that exhibit that weekend for free Pam anything I have an ashtray you'd like to mention\nJust hope that people will be\nInterested and come see this really great exhibit and get excited about their own genealogy and their own stories that really fascinating stuff and check out our events for all the great ways that uh you can come and we can help you get started on those family trees and learning about your own genome mix\nPam shorts chief curator for the Orange County regional history center\nI'm best pero today we're going to talk about the hemophilia foundation of greater Florida and the upcoming creepy crawl five paying vampire miles taking place on October twenty seventh and Baldwin park to guess with me today ... she's the development manager at the hemophilia foundation of greater Florida\nAnd Samantha ... who is the chairwoman for the walk\nAnd I'm just going to start off with you've got these fabulous shirts on so tell everyone about the church that you're wearing\nI'm Samantha take that one I'm wearing our team Tyler sharing today my son is a little more artist out of our county and for the last four years he designed the different T shirt and all the proceeds going to walk\nGreat and I don't know it's like a dragon and harness on blood splatter and\nSpoke female he's in Berlin which means that he loved my little pony so he moved and made a pagan says that's the vampires and they always believe figured it would be fine and make fun of their ... so\nThat's how he came to be\nReally neat and I would also say a have a card for the Orlando ... five K. it's pretty scary looking\nYeah I Would say the T shirts aren't great idea to for teams to find race because that's where the main things that we're doing at the creepy crawly we're going to have a lot of fine but we do want to find ways for the hemophilia foundation in and designing sure does a really great way and ...\nSeeing them to folks is a really great way to raise funds\nIn fact make no mistake the reason we're talking here at the beginning of October and this takes place at the end just to get those teams going and get them set up exactly okay well I'll tell you what why don't we go ahead and explain the mission of the hemophilia foundation of greater Florida and then we'll get more into the teams a leader you want to tell us your mission\nTheme of ... foundation of greater Florida was founded in Nineteen Ninety six\nSo we've been serving folks with bleeding disorders and the Florida community for several years now our main purpose is to provide services to folks in our community so we do things like sending kids to a medically supervised camp that we call camp spirit they get to go to camp\nKnow that there is physicians and nurses on site be able to be with other kids that have pleading disorders and so many times they even learn how to infuse themselves which I think it's pretty amazing\nWe also offer scholarships to folks in our community this year we gave away almost forty thousand dollars and scholarships to twenty recipients\nWho are really wanting to have our community go forward and I'm trying get secondary education and then also we know that they're going to give back to the bleeding disorders community as well we also provide emergency financial assistance to folks who need it so if some of our patients have trouble getting to\nA doctor's appointment and maybe we can help them out by providing gas cards to them or maybe if you're having trouble with your ... this minds\nWe can help you out with that kind of thing depending of course on an application process and then we also do other things like provide educational programs\nAnd medical alerts and a lot of times at these walks although there focuses fund raising it also provides a lot of support to our community so that they can meet each other get to know each other and I'm kind of support each other throughout the year to\nTell me about the community because I feel I don't think most of us could go oh yeah I Know somebody was hemophilia we don't necessarily know that so um what is the prevalence of it here in central Florida and what is the condition that these folks live under because you've mentioned all these needs to know that you serve so tell us what that is like sure\nI'm In Florida we have probably about five thousand or more some people may be diagnosed so we're not sure about that and Smith I can kind of addressed that because her son has a disease called ... brands disease which we also cover\nBut uh we have thousands of people that we help ed bleeding disorders are primarily hereditary so we work a lot with families it can be spontaneous so it it it can with a third of our population they can\nJust kind of pop up than um than you would have to kind of figure out what to do that and uh you're primarily just that a diagnosis when you're a child with hemophilia as a baby because something might happen like a a boy might be getting circumcised or when you go to the doctor you know you have to get shots and stuff like that and then the doctor would realize oh\nThis if it may have hemophilia if it does run in your family you can get tested for it so we do recommend that\nAnd then um hemophilia is when you're missing what's called factor so when you have hemophilia you have it for life there is no cure at this point and we are in using our folks that we'd hemophilia foundation medical professionals or\nPatients even doing these themselves um with factor so that they can caught\nI think we've made a good case for why support that foundation so let's talk about the walk we've already given a sense I think of where the word creepy crawly [laughter] tell us more so than you are the chairwoman so tell us what this walk is all about and what it's like\nA this law is actually we kinda took everybody's input last year 'cause we used to do it very early in the morning\nSo we took everybody's input and went with a are you seeing in the afternoon in the evening time thing more creepy seal we're going to have some vitamins contain ers were going to have um we had an artist Scottish Santana have donated her time um urban Latin artist medallion junkie will be coming from New York they've donated their time as well\nAnd it's mostly for the kids to go out and have a good time and everybody gets to see each other because\nOnce they age out of camp very you only see each other when we do our war world you know so and we have a fun like interactive mirror we've got candy games caramel apples station I mean we all the bells and whistles here I Am so excited that we took in everybody's and put\nIt is animal friendly so you don't these are welcome in their costumes\nTo also have costume contest so there is a pack costume contests to bring your animals it doesn't have to just be dog evil and I can't imagine animals cat would be kinda I don't think there'll be maybe it's already cat I think it's I feel it's\nSo it's helping to discipline me most of the stores are now saying they're going to be close and that's because the few shopping days\nOf Black Friday weekend or not is key are important as they used to be and the shopping period is spread out a whole lot more if you heard me recently I explain the patterns to shopping I'm going to do that again\nFor people who did not hear me talk about that sometime around Halloween I'll give you an update on what the shopping cycles look like they're going to be this year for the best deals but\nPay for seasonal workers this year's going to be the best it's been in a long long time\nAs people are struggling to find holiday workers Amazon having real difficulty reducing their turnover did somebody it was such a two for it helped him so much reputation wise and will help them operationally\nIs they're raising the minimum wage and Amazon warehouses to Fifteen an hour\nWhere the turnover is just been horrendous for them and\nIt is just a sign of the difficulty of people and retail and online sales and the the carriers having difficulty finding a sufficient pool of workers so it means if you want to pick up extra money\nBe choosy be picky\nAnd don't wait until you really think you're going to want to pick up those hours go ahead now\nAnd pick up a part time gig\nFrom one of these holiday or work opportunities and if you don't like the place to be ended up you don't like the culture you know like how they treat you whatever it is you still have time to land somewhere else\nTo pick up those hours and pick up those dollars\nAnd there's a lot of Jim mix going on by retailers to try to attract people with raffles and things like that\nI hate the whole raffle thing I despise it because they try to fool you almost like a lottery yeah you come here you have a chance of winning twenty five hundred hours\nOne person that all the thousands that are working there are much more interested in what they're going to do for me it's guaranteed and what benefits they're going to offer to me that I Know I'm going to get some retailers\nAre specifically targeting special discounts for people who come to work for them they will have times they can shop at half price or thirty percent off or whatever I mean show me the money show me what you're really going to do for me it would attract me to come spend my holidays\nSeason working extra hours to pay for my Christmas ... working at your place so then I have the money to go shop for the Christmas left list I've got bill is with us on the Clark Howard show Hi Bill how you doing\nGreat ...\nWonderful bell I you've got a question for me about this impossible task were asked to do when we're on the line\n[noise] remember username and password yeah\nI've got a lot of them and I was wondering if there is a online or on all ... you know after that I can download and keep them securely so\nThe most well known and recognized and considered to be a much better alternative than you and I trying to create and remember a million different hide user name some passwords or dash lane and last pass they dominate the market\nAnd how they work on premium business models were generally your end up paying in order to have them be your password manager\nWho is the name of the second one\nLast pass L. A. S. T. P. A. S. S. ... have you looked at a dash lane already said she didn't ask me the name of that\nWell I got tired of exactly what you said there just wasn't sure exactly what the second one was\nThat says my addiction is so poor you know it was in a terrible not at all not at all [laughter] so using these things is uh is something that a lot of people who were in data security recommend is we're still going to question we're going to move away from user names and passwords\nWere going to go to alternative technologies\nTo recognize who you are but for now where it this way station of user names and passwords and if you did not want\nTo go to the expense of Daschle in her last pass an alternative that data security people recommend is extremely long phrases flight attendant that instead of doing all this stuff they had us do for a while with upper case lower case numbers symbols\nAlpha all that bit and none of that prevents the crux that going to a very long usually weird phrased that makes no sense but it's something that you'll remember is considered to be the best alternative to using one of the password managers\nRight well thank you very much I\nBest to you my wife uses the most sophisticated\nSystem that she trumped up for user name some passwords\nAnd it's one of those things it's so brilliant what she came up with that I'd love to share it with you but if I did it wouldn't work for anybody but if you can come up with something that's very very clever and long\nThe you'll remember the pattern that you've established then you will have much better security\nDo you feel like you're about to say something\nNo I was just ... you want to take a blast Clark's sure okay All right so a Dana wrote in clerks had my daughter signed up at credit report dot com she made an

don't want to be one of the people who I oh why oh why oh softer work I go\nAnd that's why I talk so much about the importance on living on less than what you make an saving money each every month each and every pay period we in the United states culturally are terrible at that the average American saves around three cents for each dollar he or she makes\nAnd if you listen to me for a long time you know but that compares a poorly to a lot of other countries in the world where it's routine that people say thirty percent of what they make\nBut there is a counter movement in the United states\nAre people who think heavily influenced by what they saw happen just so many people getting crushed\nLast decade by the great recession that people have become fears about living on less than what they make certainly not everybody but it's even got a name FIRE movement\nAnd it's about being financially independent so you can retire early but not necessarily retire early it's really about the first two letters financial independence were you then have the choice of what you want to do with your wife\nAnd the people that are big into the FIRE movement are also big into austerity sometimes too extreme with austerity but it's what works for them\nAnd I'm a big fan\nOf what used to be called max savers those are people who live on half of what they make and a lot of people that are with this modern FIRE movement or in many ways echoing what was part of the max saving movement of a different era\nAnd there was a a pod cast with someone I've been on her pod cast before ... it was a pod cast that she had she had Suzie Orman as a guest\nAnd asked Suzie Orman what she thought of the FIRE movement expecting Suzie Orman to say it's wonderful this great people are saving so much money and said she said\nI hate it I hate it I hate it I hate it and\nI heard about this and I was like why\nWhat's there to hate about people living on less than what they make\nAnd she went on to talk about the fact that the amount of money that FIRE movement people had his goals to save two women independent life were ridiculous dollars that people really need to have a [laughter]\nTwenty thirty fifty or a hundred million dollars be like me okay [laughter] fuzzy come on you're allowed to touch their [laughter] [noise]\nPeople don't need twenty million dollars for like you a hundred million dollars that sort of you have to live in independent life would be comfortable it's all about the lifestyle that you become comfortable with it so the key is a ratio is a formula\nAnd it's pretty simple you save money to the point that you saved twenty five times the amount of money that it costs to to live in one year\nAnd once you hit that target whether it's in your thirties forties fifties sixties or never\nThat's when you know you have enough money built up for the lifestyle you've grown accustomed to that you can afford to live in definitely on the money you've said\nAnd it I Know that's an oversimplification but it really is that simple as soon as he went on to say to Paula ... you need at least five or six million really you might need ten million dollars\nTo retire securely and respectfully I strongly disagree with what Suzie said there are people who easily\nCan get by for the rest of their lives when they hit the point they've saved a million dollars it means they're living a\nNot a barebones lifestyle but they're living a more careful frugal lifestyle because what you want is he won enough money saved that you have invested that you can throw off enough

you identify good on line savings account that is just a pain that you know you look at these Web sites in the rankings in what you're paying for interest rates are do you pick one that's always on the upper tier just step one that pays a really high interest rate for a few months and then backed down to attract new customers\nThat is a question and as a general rule\nIf you've seen them advertised for a number of years they're not just popping up a really great rate to capture deposits and then ... reducing it to a very low rate I mean all the big online banks have specific reasons\nThat they're offering the accounts like you know why capital one does it you know they're like one point nine or when something like that so I don't know why they do it\nAnd they need money to lend out on credit\nCard exactly and it's much cheaper for them\nTo offer a what's a good deal and savings and elsewhere markers switches Goldman Sachs it's much cheaper for them to raise funds for
