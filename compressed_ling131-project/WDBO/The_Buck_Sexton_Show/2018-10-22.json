York times what you said about the disingenuous reporting of why people are coming up here in this caravan\nA virtual listeners know this was a political ambush there's no doubt about this this is a very organized do for me to think of the cost involved it's just a two thousand mile trek from um doors\nTo the United states border and this was covered in a couple of days by some of these people on foot I Know there's some other singer on buses and cars whatever oh there's still a pretty good track and you need to get to ask who's feeding these people what's making sure they stay hydrated\nWorthy sleeping and that costs money and and so somebody's behind this effort we could talk all day about who might be but that's not the point to point that I was trying to make this is the political ambush I'm being directed at the ... the United states when I talked about that New York times article I read this morning\nYou know they're already setting it up they pointed out very early in the article that these are families in pregnant women and the article was full of color pictures of small children laying on the floor on cots and I'm mad so on and so for\nTrying to a strike at a motion and I know they were ready um that that have just reached the board of they'll start with their separating families again which was a a a which is nothing more than propaganda the last time this happened so you can see what's going on but this is a test of us sovereignty it really is and the president's so far President Trump\nOr showing great resolve he's not going to blink he's not going to buy\nPressure and some of the propaganda that the um a leftist media is ready to hurl Adam you understand that as a citizen duty\nProtect the United states this isn't a migration it's an invasion for heaven sakes so he's a he's holding from ah that's very important at a time like this politically and nationally\nYou know a share of you know one of the things that that is always frustrated me is that and I spoke to dream last week I all my pod cast item on for about an hour it's really good guys brought here when very young he's a lawyer now is an immigration lawyer\nHe thinks that Trump's actually can be the one that gets DACA done his frustration is like a lot of people's frustrations on both sides which is both sides have had opportunities to fix something yet both sides don't seem to have really any stomach to do it because I think both sides like the fact that stuff does it get fixed because\nAs we always say there's more there's more money and the problem then then the cure\nThere's no doubt about it this is the fault in Congress failure to act\nOn fixing this broken illegal under spoken immigration system and on not securing the border both see or some political leverage it can be gained here they're dancing delicately to try not to\nTo upset the potential a Latino vote but that's not what their job is their job is to serve the American people and that's to do what's in the best interest of the American people you know they've been kicking the can down the road for the last Thirty years\nBecause there's political leverage in it but like I said the president's doing everything that he came within his power under the constitution but really this rests with the Congress by the constitution\nAnd you know specifically says that the Congress still formed rules on naturalization or immigration and so it has to start doing until Congress decides they're not going to use this as a political football and finally fix this thing and it is very broken\nUm this is what we're gonna continue to see the back and forth\nHow do we give them that my my thing is how do we get them to act because you know a lot of times and and I think you know this is the more that you get into the political world you know you're working with the American first action you're you're you're out there and and you're seeing things and you're talking to politicians I'm sure talking politicians on both sides despite what people like that the thing is\nThat neither side has you have to have the stomach to take something some of these these real issues on political you have to have the political fortitude to stomach to take these things on and a lot of them they're just they're afraid because they think their jobs are on the line which may be true but the whole point is you're supposed to be they're serving the people not just your job in the party\nYou know what I think needs to happen is and that's after November because we have to win\nIn

homeland security secretary says it a statement she is monitoring the caravan situation closely adding quote we sell work with our partners in the region to investigate and prosecute to the fullest extent of the law all who seek to encourage and profit from the regular migration\nThe government of Guatemala Honduras and Mexico say they're addressing the situation ABC's\nAll of that and it's a terrible situation and the first part of the story was interrogation gone wrong right the truth is we don't know no we have no idea what this is so um\nSeveral elected officials now want to punish Saudi Arabia or but you know again it's complicated it's always been the case with Saudi Arabia Trump was asked about this whole situation and this was on Fox Business or you know before we get to that\nReal quick um [noise] the thing about Saudi Arabia David if you go back a couple of years ago with how Obama reacted\nTo people wanting to sue Saudi Arabia and you've brought this up before yeah it wasn't so complicated then it didn't seem\nNo okay so so this was September of twenty sixteen is only ... when the controversy first came out a 'cause our legislature or the Congress had overwhelmingly approved\nThe bill that would allow the families of nine eleven victims to sue members of the Saudi Government and ruin class who had something to do with September eleventh terror attacks whether that was exporting or the the radical violent ideology that Saudi Arabia has been exporting for years\nWhether it was actually having somebody to do with the planning and execution of it they wanted to be able to have these families of victims\nTo get some sort of compensation for their loss correct um and the Obama administration\nCame out swinging against this for the same reasons that Trump is kind of dancing around this issue with a jump ball ... saying there's billions of dollars in investments on the line there is also\nRegional stability on the line I mean on November fifth mark your calendar this was when the Trump Administration is going to come out and talked about harsh new sanctions with Iran lay down the law and say if you're doing business with Iran we don't want to do business with you and we have to have Saudi Arabia on our side for that\nAnd the media is also saying Trump got a personal interest here right [laughter] that I talked about all the time you know you don't but they don't get into the complexity\nOf Saudi Arabia being an ally also leading the charge there against Iran ...\nAnd the terrorists yeah it's it's very convoluted I don't think anyone's been saying that the Saudis have always been great for standing [laughter] you know but this is a bit much I mean you gotta wait for the facts right right so that being said here's what Trump had to say\nIt depends on whether or not taking the crown prince about it in my opinion [noise]\nNumber one what happens at whether or not they knew about it\nIf they knew about it that will be bad\nIf they didn't know that things are bad things can happen\n[noise] bad things can happen a buddy of saying also we can't just having knee jerk reaction to the situation\nFor the Saudi Arabia is a partner at their our ally against\nIran and against the whistles and against what they're doing trying to take over the middle east and by the way since we're not exceeding they're heading down the tubes if you look at what's going on\nNow with all of that being said he can do\nWhat we've been reading about [noise] we're gonna we're going to learn a lot about it\n[noise] course analysis from CNN Trump digs immoral hole in the U.S foreign policy this is really no different than than the nine eleven build that we talked about\nFrom two years ago where president is saying hey I I'm kind of the chief negotiator here I Can't come out swinging against Saudi Arabia right now because we need them but this is also why you have a co equal branch of government the Congress that can levels so I'm sort of punishment against Saudi Arabia if they see fit\nWhen they get the facts of the ... yeah I mean this is how the game is played at the end of the day we're all sitting here going yeah they probably did this ... but you still have to wait right\nMeanwhile there's the other controversy going on or space yes yes of course Trump called the the the porn star Stormy Daniels horse face yesterday on Twitter has been a lot of reaction to that he was talking to the Associated Press or he was asked about calling Stormy Daniels horse face\nHe said and there is no audio to this is just all just tried to do my best Trump impression\nYou know what you can take it any way you want [noise]\nDid you see the letter she put out a letter I had nothing to do with her so she can lie and

you like last night I'm seeing different ... what's going on I missed part of the news what was going on today you to give them that little\nTidbit of news yeah he referred to Stormy Daniels this horseracing for all my gosh and there's some you know ... going on\nAt the same time yeah he didn't need to do that [laughter]\nWell of course he didn't need to do that or did you see\nWhat she did and she fired back gum vaccine calls them tiny game on tiny yeah oh\nI Do notice in the year way oh and the today show coverage of this they highlighted a couple of parts of this response from Stormy

at a measly half half a billion about more than Ninety four million dollars\nSo yeah I mean I I look forward to that there is only one I think actually local TV news should have stopped a few years ago when there was one TV station and I can't remember where it was where they interviewed are due to the corner store and they asked him what are you going to spend the money on if you win and he responded something to the effect of hookers and blow\nAnd that's like alright packet in that's the best actuality you will ever get\nWell ... one of these stories figure out a way to blow it he already the already did\nHe's like I'm just being up front about it I'm going to spend it on on on drugs and women\nYeah terrible human being good luck awesome [noise] ah by the way real quick from

understand that\nWhole thing is that you know you're you're supposed to be able to just yell and scream and called cops names and all that stuff and and just not have any consequences about it\nSo

actually happened uh but I Would love it to happen so health and Human Services secretary outlays are announced yesterday they are proposing a new rule that would require pharmaceutical companies to include the price of prescription medicines in TV ads\n... you know the whole ad that you're seeing yeah the first one a lot of people think of is the blue pill\nOr whatever it might be it was like and here's the cost of fright\nRecommended price for a pill right I Love this idea\nGets probably not going to have the whole idea of courses to try to I mean you get these companies to admit how much they're charging ...\n... it looked everyone's entitled to make money in this country I think this is one of these regulations where you're not forcing businesses to artificially lower or inflate costs here right this is a situation where a company just has to be up front about what they have\nAbout what what what their product costs\nWhat other business doesn't have to do that for a consumer right I mean if you're going to get your car repaired\nHow much is this going to cost you know sometimes it could be what we got to see what's wrong with it but once you know\nWhat the diagnosis is here's how much we charge ... or if you know it's oil okay here here's how much the oil is going to cost whatever it is that's what's so maddening about the medical industry\nSo your farm pharmaceutical research and manufacturers of America this is the big lobbying group a sad that they would they don't want this of course they say and it's because well the reason we don't want this is because you're actually going to be harming consumers so please guys how you harm consumers most people will not pay what the price per pill is\nSo it could technically technically be Seventy five dollars write bad PR pill for most people would play it would pay no more than ten or Fifteen bucks for a script\nAh well I think there's actually forces companies to be honest about what they're charging absolutes\nIn this isn't this a way of creating transparency in the medical industry\nYes it's the same way you need your appendix taken out how much they're going to cost I go to the hospital and pull it all depends where's your insurance through because what you're charged if I have insurance different than if I didn't ... it it's all jacked up you just can't call and get the price yeah\nI think they're so used to being people in the pharmaceutical industry and and medical industry in general are so used to being protected by the system that's in place now and has been in place for a long time but they just don't like the idea of actually having to compete and actually having to be open with the consumer\nOh yeah why would they want this to change their making billions of\nDollars because I Would also think and there's nothing wrong with making that kind of money\nBut I Would also think that a savvy business person would say well now here's an opportunity to brag about what state you know the little blue pill versus another\nA similar product guy wouldn't you see an opportunity to undercut your competition by advertising how much less you're charging per pill then this other company\nYes isn't there an opportunity there\nMy fear is then it's going to be a war and marketing and the ads are going to get crazier [laughter] it's not just that me and the lady you're going to be in this tubs looking at a son say but with this bill it's like three times a day [laughter] I don't I don't need any more the crazy yeah it's just the price is fine you know now that\nNow now farmers are saying what we can do is we can direct people to our Web sites that will have the sliding scale of costs and all that stuff no man put it on the freaking TV ad\nNo I mean listen man when people can go online and see how much it costs in Canada and it's one sixth of what it costs here they're ticked off there like this doesn't make sense it's not about well a company you know shouldn't be able to make money no absolutely uh companies should be able to make money but\nFor something that you need you shouldn't be held hostage for it I think that's what Trump is being been saying and that's one of the things that has resonated with me now I Know he's about this so you know we'll see where it goes\nYou know the whole healthcare thing then we really haven't made much games there but a lot of games in different areas but not so much um in that area [noise] ah I don't know if you saw this story very interesting that if you have a late model Honda watch out somebody might be trying to steal the airbag outta there\nThis was out of USA Today I didn't realize this was a big issue stealing airbags yes\nAnd the reason is because these can make a whole lot of
