careful what you say about the family\nLeader who was an individual's using this for me to this group [noise] recover them [laughter]\nSo this story now is what they got into a fight into a fist fight yeah this Washington Post columnist got involved in a fist fight with Fifteen goons he gets in a headlock and dies and wouldn't you know it they just happen to have somebody who knows how to dismembered body there\nWell I don't know if it was worth all Fifteen guys I think there was one rogue guy re be that got into a it just happened to have well some martial arts skills that would put a guy to sleep right [noise] right [noise]\nJust happened so you know then the question is what does the u._s. do about it if anything\nDoes a great question and I know a lot of people in Congress have come out and said look we gotta we have to put in place sanctions Trump of course is in a position like so many other us presidents\nIs in a position where he can't straight up come out against them as strongly as a member of Congress might be able to make a good way he could but you saw the same thing with Obama we talked about this last week or you with a with the uh the legislation that would have allowed families of the victims and\nAnd eleven ... members of the Saudi Government or members of the Saudi power structure the Obama administration was one hundred percent against it for the same reason that Trump is kind of dancing around this particular issue which ...\nYeah I mean just to be honest it is so complex when you're talking about the relationship between turkey and Saudi Arabia\nAnd pretty much all of the middle east you're always trying to figure out what players in this whole mess can you trust and usually the answer is none yeah that's probably a good one um but I mean if Trump all of a sudden came out and said no no I'm not buying that you're going to have to do better than that would I mind no I Would\nNot them so Trump was asked about the latest ... whoa I'm dying to\nTell you whatever mad so Henry ... what would it be a terrible thing if you just came out and said no way we're not buying this this sounds like a load of garbage weirdo wait for the rest of this to\nCome out whatever so Trump was asked about this latest excuse over the weekend that he was killed by people who went rogue and it was an accident you see\nYeah I just wanted to find the answer but it was first sent for them when I Want to get into the [noise]\nAll that being said the\nHundred and fifty million down hundred million which is [noise] I Know\nYeah the best parts of the tiger in the background I was gonna say that's pretty funny to hear [laughter] survivor in the background\nTestifies unintentional but funny nonetheless\nMilitary order them and this is what the various things orders from nobody Arabian hundred and fifty million dollars I think it's over a million jobs not cancelling orders that wouldn't hurt on [noise] more and more than them\nThere are other things that can be done and [noise]\nSo we'll see you know I mean listen I Am I going to sit here and pretend to be a foreign affairs expert in Foreign Relations no but it doesn't take you know a scientist to figure out Saudi Arabia is not as powerful as they used to be\nMade there are other places to get oil that did not used to be available\nUsed to be very advantageous for the relationship it's dwindling as time goes they're desperate to hold on to their power now so we'll see what happens I'm speaking of money different story\nBut I mean hey I guess we're a part of the media kills me almost to say that but I guess it's true so by rule we have to talk about the lottery\nMega millions up to one point six billion dollars there yeah\nI Know you were you are pumped to hear about that news even though you don't play the lottery and you cast a pretty hefty amount of judgment on people who do I don't ah I always say you can play the lottery have fun it's dumb did you see my gosh did you see ... ... what's his name but Danica with the lottery he was on the today show this morning\nThat I see him or you trolling me yeah I told you about this bit it was a five minute commercial for the lottery away because it was ... it was hard to find that it was a hard hitting interview sir my\nGosh how is it possible that no one has one up to this point\nIt beats me I had no one has the combination outta that is probably why it\nBeats me I guess after like support tickets [laughter] I don't really find time for us I mean we're having an effect\nOn our players are having a wonderful time they are and this is a really rare event I mean one point six billion give me a break [laughter] Going Radical\nOur players are having a wonderful time throwing away money two dollars at a time people love it Jamie it's fine and they love the fact\nThat the odds are actually worse now than they used to be which is why we're seeing the jackpot go higher and higher they love it just listen to garden\nFor what we did this about a year ago for mega millions and we kinda replicated what Powerball had done a few years before that and it's working because now our players keep telling us they like the really big jackpots and so that's the case we also made the odds actually better\nIs that what they did they told you we like the really big jackpot that's what they said that's what he said he ... why would he lie I think it's ... it's not gonna lie here\nYou know you see all of a sudden with three hundred million he got some players but it gets to six hundred and then the fever pitch gets higher and higher and higher\nAnd they're more idiotic media outlets that cover it more and more and more I don't know why are so hateful Gordon is just looking out for you of course but I bet we are going to get to the schools and how it benefits so many charities and\nWe also made the odds actually better for winning the million dollar well the keep in mind second prize is a million dollars how many piano will team winners on a friday August ... you'll see in our eyes went from five thousand to ten thousand so people are winning all the\nTime I like Craig Melvin to saying how 'bout the tips yes hits for how he could win give me the tips on how I can win\nJust by a couple of more terrorist court [laughter] I can sprinkle some picks you up on you but I'm not sure it would work\nUm besides buying more tickets would make more sense to to pick your own numbers or to go with the automatic draw\nYou know it's completely random and at at these levels and Jack Potter I'd say Ninety Ninety five percent of the people are a quick uh random numbers but if you've got a favorite number your birthday or your anniversary\nGoing forward play it that is such a fresh take I've never thought of that and I'm sure millions of people haven't you got specific numbers you like well we keep hearing about\nIt yeah and I remember it benefits all sorts of charities and the schools and everything\nAnd just last night this money where does it all got like ... when he goes to the states you know and a lot of people say well on my throwing my money away if I don't when\nWe do it all goes to a very good causes and it vary state by state I'd say the most common cause is education right\nYes and I mean you think about your local schools right now you're thinking man thank you lottery all the problems have been solved it better\nThan it's ever been\nI don't know why you hate the children any great gateway it if you don't get out and play absolutely love\nIt much more to get
