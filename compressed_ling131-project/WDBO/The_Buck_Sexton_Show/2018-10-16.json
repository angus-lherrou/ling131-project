bought the twentieth anniversary box that you did or the hearings yes so much for those fantastic\nNineteen Ninety five and I got a T shirt with it that's not too bad and\nSo one of the things with Hillary Clinton\nThat then is brought up is you know with all of these people now losing their jobs for these relationships where the balance of power isn't there another words you got a boss and then you've got some intern\nAnd turned fields pressure so this person now in two thousand eight teams losing their job\nThe question to Hillary should bill of resigned back in the day\nWhat role if any did you play in criticizing the character of the women who have accused bill of sexual misconduct\n... now I take responsibility for my life and my answer\nThese things [noise] build should've resigned in a way because the Monica Lewinsky scandal absolutely not it wasn't an abuse of power now the now there are people who look at the\nIncidents have been Ninety and they say a president of the United states cannot have a consensual relationship with an intern the power imbalance here to weigh in adults but let me ask\nYou this where's the investigation of the courage in ...\nLike it's

consensual yeah Ali\nThis is where hills is losing some people on her side\nAs an example remember Matt Lauer mhm had the woman working underneath them she was a whole lot younger and so when that affair came out she told her story and that was also consensual but people talked about the balance of power right\nIt wasn't right it was abusive he should have been fired for that you can't have it both ways\nSure she well she is your Hillary Clinton you can I don't I think there are a whole lot of Democrats that she would like to say Hillary year who we need right now we need you to run one

running for president not a big surprise writes God I Hope so yeah what an insult to book on this\nI sincerely hope\nSo sir well she is trying to stave off that criticism her previous claim to Native American ancestry right so she is releasing the results of a DNA test\nOh on Maury Povich show\nThat it's already been released it's not a big repeal you are married at the end [laughter]\nNo it's the the news is supposedly though she is you got to go back six to ten generations\nBut was it is true of all the ... there's an analyst from Stanford that says at least strong evidence the war and had an ancestor with at least quote some Native American blood back somewhere between six and ten generations ago that was in the Boston Globe\nOkay see\nThat and you can read is a different places hotter had it and was talking about okay hold on a second to get this out of the way I'm there is no exploration of discovery or personal growth mean she's preparing to launch for presidential bed she wants this story buried before things heat up on the trail right yes\nThis is simply phase two of the quotes suppose investigation which was done early September finding that orange alleged Native American heritage didn't help her career\nGay so they wrote about that the Boston Globe say as to this DNA test there's a lot of red flags here that's them not me I'm just this is what I read 'cause you're trying to find both sides of this story writing\nTo begin with they ask why would anyone go to all the bother seeking out a specialist from Stanford what would you just go with ancestry or twenty three and me like everyone else and use standardized\nTesting just to spit test via the mail I mean the yeah there is easy ways and it's advertised all the time yes\nI'm so then they bring up well possibly exist at war and actually did one of those tests and it came up dry she refused to answer the question before when reporters had asked if she did one and this person from Stanford\nBiologist and a statistician doesn't appear to do DNA testing [laughter] rather analyze this test results it applies them to different questions that solves it doesn't it\nSo what sort of test results is he providing he's so again the doctor says the evidence quote strongly supports the existence of a Native American ancestor only narrowing it down to a span of four or more generations dating back to colonial times\nI'm so when you go to one of the usual DNA testing companies you get answers broken down by percentages and regions where your ancestors came from nothing is quote suggested\nRight so
