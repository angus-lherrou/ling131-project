justice entire situation and ah you know the capital and and how he thought it went\nOn to say that when I heard him hurting someone who I Would sound like if I hadn't been unjustly accused him to see his family behind and uh it was there was anger but um but if I were unjustly accused that's how I Would feel as well\nAnd I went on um my pictures interaction with some of the members or was a little too sharp\nYeah I get that what he's saying what nobody he's he is common sense enough and and again a lot of people I Can't stand them I think he's running for office at some point in time any bigger office and that officers and in uh Pennsylvania Avenue yeah I think he's going to run for president even said he probably couldn't do this\nIf if reelection was in his future he probably couldn't have done this so this gives them the freedom to do this but also you know there are other there are other factors that were at work behind the scenes but the interesting thing is is is\nEverybody is like how angry he was how mad he was how how testy what's how dare he do this how dare he act the way he did how dare he be angry\nAt something like this I was really\nStunned by how we acted at that hearing this as a basically a job interview for the highest court of the land or her testimony was compiling incredible but both of town can't be true and so one one idea here\nIs that he's simply with drinking more than he was saying over that time period\nAnd then he didn't remember what happened and so I was just simply trying to get it that and\nThat's Amy ... from a a Minnesota and so that's one idea right that is one idea it's the job of well there is a job interview I never got a job interview where they looked at me go so here you're a rapist\nAnd these people over here who may hire you or may not higher figure rights that you're an alcoholic rapist\nThings that you you you put people in positions to be raped as a child that was your job you were like uh the front man it's like the movie taken right here at the airport you're you're you're trying to get people to share rides with you and the uh tell your friends coming over here I drove them all up come rhythm no so how how would how would you feel\nRight how would\nAnybody feel any reasonable sane human being man or woman black or white gay or straight would be pissed off would be angry and if you're sitting there for days and we think about this for a second\nHe had days of being called all kinds of things he had days of seeing his name dragged through the mud he had days of sitting there stewing and being angry\nAnd finally he had his chance to come forward and defend themselves and do I think at times he was a little bit harsh oh I can understand that yeah he probably would but couldn't any reasonable sane human being understand that he\nHad exchanges with Senator Feinstein was that are close our with others that I felt when over line [noise] um he was clearly a Pulitzer and\nAggressive angry\nAs anybody would now at the same time things you don't hear about\nSo I was just simply trying to get a ban and really couching it in the fact that\nI'd alcoholism and my own family my dad is Ninety now struggled with a trial and his wife and finally got treatment and his sober I got help from a and so I was actually trying to get it the truth and that's why I was stunned by how he answered it but then of course he he later apologized\nYeah but you're trying to diagnose him as an alcoholic minus me\nI can name and no people I've ever\nWho didn't party as a as a high schooler\nProducer Phil you and I are the same age you're nearly the same age as our friend over here as I Am a judge Kavanaugh did you may be at times I have a few beverages of the adult nature when you were in high school I'm On the advice of counsel I Choose not to answer that question that but yes\nThere you go there you know why\nBut that's what we're getting a well he you know I've got friends who are alcoholics or my dad was an alcoholic and visited it it it that's that's the craziness of at all but this was never about and still continues to be never about\nThis\nPerson and his well being or Dr Ford and her wellbeing this has only to do with the fact that they want to stop him at all costs by any means necessary\nThat you know more by any means necessary we'll see what happens\nOh God I saw people over the weekend Amarillo you know it's because he's white you know like what yeah excuse angry white man what is in the white everything to do with this I'm sure if you choose the black man of rape\nAnd doing all these kind of things I Would expect them to be angry as well and push back or a woman I Would expect her let's just say he doesn't\nRight for the sake of argument he doesn't get through this process and then they go a Amy uh Coney Barrett is the one they become after next and they go after a hard core I Would expect her to push back and if your caller a child molester let's just say right like this is hypothetical here do you think she's going to be pissed an angry\nRight if you say hey I hear you bite the heads off chicken that's what I heard and that at night you do say ten of worship in your house and that you are you know you main line or whatever you think that maybe there'd be a pushback an anger\nI'm just curious I think everybody has a right to be pissed off at angry

have signed onto a North American free trade agreement\nCandidate agreed that the new NAFTA deal preserving the trade pact between the U.S Mexico and Canada sources say the final stumbling blocks were worked out\nThe U.S will have greater access to Canada dairy market and threaten us parents on Canadian auto exports had been addressed and leaders of all three countries are expected to find a new treaty after that the U.S Congress has six days to review and a project\nSo Trump wants to start a ASAP obviously and he is touting this is a victory one of the things he said he was going to do and remember this this is you know we\nWe we talked about it before even people who are never Trump bart's right who've come on here on on more than a few occasions so that you know what a Ruben Navarrette who's come on and said lucky I I'm never Trump but\nThese are the things he's done and he said he was going to do is this another one yeah\nCanada Jam all look a lot as well they'll come Vivian tracked word for word from the old agreement or something called chapter Nineteen what does that mean again that Canada and go to an independent\nReferee when it had the disease to train disputes with the United states and does not have to protect itself to any kind of us really detract from the old bill on all it is not a wholesale change the agreement that was already on the table but\nEnough for Donald Trump to claim that she basically had another victory on your on her campaign promise\nAnd which is true because a dairy farm thing for a lot of people are dairy farmers this was this was a big win for them and and the Canadians get what they want as far as the auto side goes so are you know the Trump feels like he did a good job\nWith this like everything else and specially something like that it remains to be seen because this is over time right this isn't an overnight thing this will be an over time kind of thing but he feels stoked about\nHave negotiated this new agreement based on the principle of fairness and reciprocity\nTo me it's the most important word and drag 'cause we've been ...\nSo unfairly by so many nations all over the world that we're changing that\nYeah and that's the way he feels that I think a lot of people feel that way you ... and when it\nActually has some Democrats say this is really amazing if he really got all of that but by a tomorrow I Would suspect they'll change their too but that's okay [laughter]\nThat's true true do a thorough do he seems to me to go to a\nGood day for Canada than Joe ... of all of\nUs are you guys to borrow I'll talk to you guys tomorrow it's a good day for ... who wants to see me without my shirt on ...\nSo a somewhat when all around so we'll see how this plays itself up Trump needs as many victories just possible because we're heading into the midterms and as we all know the midterms especially now more than ever may be a referendum usually it is on who's ever in power\nBecause we like checked power in this nation regardless of how well you're doing because we don't like to see one side completely have complete power\nThis is different\nIn what may come with this uh when it comes to President Trump\nA president's party almost always loses seats in the mid term elections there have been like two exceptions in the last Thirty years second apart is prospects for generally linked to the president's approval ratings currently Trump's average approval rating this past month\nIt's about two points lower than Obama in two thousand ten when Democrats suffered a disastrous midterm\nYeah yeah and that was looking at that was two points less here's the thing though\nEven though his approval rating and those are always skewed because you may not like the person had a lot of that stuff is is is how we feel about the person themselves how do I feel about you I may not like you but I look around and say well the economy's doing okay and you know I don't I don't\nLike him I don't like I I don't approve of him\nNow the job he's doing we may step back and that's a different story\nBut there are specific problems the strong for Republicans first some forty Republican

said was there would say that they were there I mean it goes on and on and on as every legal expert has said yeah you know ongoing through that I think there might be\nAnother problem for judge Kavanaugh or we can get into that later um and I think it has to do with the boozing issue\nBut I mean the Democrats this ... her own oh is out of control [noise] yeah well I mean this is maddening\nSo remember what was it now two weeks ago a doctor board needs to have a hearing Republicans say OK yeah you\nHearing hearing got it up we need an FBI investigation well let's start with the hearing first okay well we're hearing is read victimizing her and then she does the hearing and it's like well this is proof positive that she's telling the truth and Brett Kavanaugh was why he's a factual essay on that's it it's a\nClose the books on it but no one told Dr forward that they could have come to California which is what she preferred\nAnd so then Republicans are things in part to Jeff Flake go out and say okay fine we'll have a supplemental background check investigation the FBI is going to do this we're going to look at these claims oh well now you're just narrowing it your narrowing the scope to look at the allegations that we've all been obsessed with for the last two weeks\nHow dare you we talked about this the other day they're trying to stop the clock yes and I like to criticism where they say uh the FBI or at least there's was coming out of the weekend at the FBI hadn't contacted Dr Ford they probably wouldn't\nBecause they had hours and hours of testimony already so they're going to go and talk to some other people who may have been there to try to establish whether or not she's she's telling the truth I mean I Know they they're not going to reach conclusions with this but they're probably not going to start off with the two people\nWho just spent hours testifying and telling their story well not only that you're dealing in facts it's not if you\nIf someone comes off as credible if someone comes off as believable you're looking at okay this is the story line up you know the story change\nWhat are the facts that's what they're looking at right\nWell now center around always moved the goalposts again because the FBI investigation is just not enough is was on ABC with little George Stephanopoulos a\nBoy from what you learned about the FBI investigation will it be a credible investigation\nThat's going to be that big outstanding question and I would think that Jeff Flake and the other senators who are not going for this ... will call for\nThis time you know the thing is that every Senate vote matters and there is there's time to get to the bottom of it even if it's seven days that's bad enough for them to limit the FBI as the scope and who they're going to a question that ... that really have a [laughter]\nI Want to change the way far spent a mass of the kind of investigation that all of us are are expecting the FBI to conduct [noise]\nSo predictable man they're saying they're basically not going to have enough time to look into anything they're not even talking with the two principals involved\nRight are you boy wouldn't it be outrageous at the FBI were to I don't know reach conclusion before investigating or talking to your principles Clinton I mean sorry that's about as I Know I Know it's okay uh\nAnother topic of conversation over the weekend it was crazy should we be worried about Kanye well okay\nI'll say yes and no yes he's crazy should be we'd be worried not now any more than we have been before\nKind of had a nervous breakdown right well yeah and a half ago something like that yeah it does no big deal but man he's supporting Trump\nNow he is wearing a make America great again hat

it it'll go that route but he was asked about\nThe FBI investigation into his Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh and whether or not he supports an investigation or whether or not where he where he is on that so at first there was a push back when he was actually says what does that have to deal with trade\nBut then he didn't care so he just rolled on what the answer here\nIn the Senate decide

always taking the side of the accused even though he's out there saying I Want the FBI to be able to vet these claims\nRight so they were asked what is that the right way though he said he was asked again to follow up with something along the lines of well what about all three women because you have the Deborah Ramirez Christine Blasey Ford and then you have Julie sweat thank\nGod that you call that strayed she's the one that talked about like gang stuff yeah gang rape party right basically um and I think it's very telling the story hasn't really take an awful lot\nBecause some news organizations have been digging into her past and not found some things I mean the Oregonian had right up about a little tiff she had with um with the Portland based software company and there were other things there were an ex boyfriend who have you tried to file restraining order against her because she has a history of\nMoving into law suits and apparently there are some questions around her past behavior as well yeah media's not too much on the third accusation the second was the Deborah Ramirez wasn't where he allegedly pulled down his pay right in front of a whole lot of other people right and then\nMaybe wiggle it around a little bit yeah [laughter] or however you want to describe\nThat that's I don't know\nThat they want all three\nOf these women I talked to by the FBI do you think that's a good thing and he says well maybe I don't have a problem with it necessarily I just don't want this to spiral out of control because again you\nI had six FBI background checks involving Brett Kavanaugh\nIs a an expression often used by may want to go into which one do we\nDo just to be clear should the FBI interview all three of Brett Kavanaugh's accuser it wouldn't bother me at all now it depends I don't know all three of the IRS you'd all three certainly I imagine they're going to interview to\nThe third one I don't know much about but it wouldn't bother me at all I mean I've been heard is that the third one has I have no idea this is true has very little credibility if there is any credibility interview the third one should Brett Kavanaugh be interviewed by the FBI\nThink so I think it's fine if they do I don't know that's up to them I think that he spoke very conclusively and very well I think it's been a very rough period of time I guarantee that I had a period of time like this\nMean we have people that have already smoke on the record under penalty of perjury I don't think their answers are going to change a whole lot right I mean but yes do the investigation
