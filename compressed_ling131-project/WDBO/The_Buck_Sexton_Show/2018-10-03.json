[noise]\nNews maybe six point by ...\nA show Kelly from Orlando this morning news we get you the news and information every\nMorning as you hop into the car\nBut did nine o'clock Brian kill me does actually talking to the newsmakers and that's what's so great\nJoe that's what I have a chance to not only do you what I think's going on but you can tell me what you think's going on from your perspective I feel like we have a dialogue Brian kill me weekdays I told you news to point five shoveling TV do\nYou own a gun you have a full time responsibility\nWhen you weren't using as we can get into the hands of curious children\nOr anyone else might misuse\nAnd then we get to our tongues you know our tongues which one person wrote to I mean it was even in the scripture that the tongue is more powerful than the rug or on the ship\nAnd we use this tongue as a weapon and we use social media now as a weapon almost a virtual tang to say things that we ended up turning around and we apologize to our spouses we apologize to our friends we apologize for business partners and guess what sometimes we can't feel it\nYeah sometimes but the reality is people are we we've gotten so tribal that we live in these echo chambers and anybody who comes into her echo chamber we get outta here what do you it's it's like it's like turf right this political turf\nIt's like that's my street corner you're in my area how dare you come over to the red side or the blue side how dare you if you get caught dead over here you manage you're done now we're going to get you\nIt's sad it's absolutely said one hundred and ten percent it's completely sad the way that this is playing itself out and when I look at something like well what's happening with capital\nRight and I don't think we're gonna find anything out other than you know she drank a little bit in college and apparently\nFor anybody else that's okay but for him that somehow he's he's he's damned but\nThe fact that\nWe're at the point now where we're not going to find anything out he's going to be can you know he's he's a serial rapists these uh I mean he's he killed puppy dogs in polar bears he's single handedly destroying the earth's climate and all of these kinds of things and when I didn't find anything else out and people have already made up their minds and if you support him somehow you hate women\nAnd that's just that's the starting point for anything that's an ending point that's it and our tongues are in our mind tons of their mind our mind controls our town center tongue it's our mind and that's the point I always talk about being open minded don't tell me what\nColor friends you have or what sexual identity and they have what box you can check off for something\nI don't care about that what's in their mind what's in their hearts that matters far more than anything else\nAbsolutely but in this world of red and blue\nWe can't do that anymore we can't and\nFeel sorry I look at this and I think to myself how we always been this kind of we've always been this way obviously the civil war with something this is quite huge and we can go back to that but as far as individuals right the way that that that we now have that platform to say anything\nBuddy at any given time it's it's it is kind of sad because we don't care we say things to people that we would never say to anybody else because we feel that we have the right to say something because you I don't agree with you so I can hate you and I have I have moral high ground to hate you\nAnd we got all wake up that I don't have to win and you have to lose you know we could all have some victories how does that work in the confirmation process well five and I was going to be a win for some and lose our way up to think about what we're learning from this that we had Gorsuch was confirmed that we have to learn why did that work why is this not working\nWhat about how many times if I said this over and over again the sad thing about the politics that we have nowadays is we've stopped trying to say hey we've got a great idea we think it's a great idea it'll be great for the country it's now just easier to say hey they suck\nA lot more than we suck lettuce tells you how they suck\nAnd boom and the and and when you hear people like Bill Maher who what a month or two ago says you know we got to hope for a recession and at the end that everything can collapse it's it's that's the mentality you hope America goes into recession and people lose their jobs and their livelihood and lose their homes\nSo we can get back on the ground that you think we should be on in the path that you think we should be on because somehow people know better\nThat's not a when\nI've said it all along and people ask me every day would you supported Hillary I would've as far as I don't want my president to fail if she did something wrong I Would criticize or she did something right I was raised in the same thing I Do with Trump when he does stuff wrong I criticize what he does not bright eyed praising\nThis want it because I'm a great patriot you're a patriot everybody's a patriot ... patriot what all the time you know how I hear is you have half the country right\nYou have to have\nThe country 'cause they don't agree with you that's ridiculous that isn't a patriot right you're not patriot you you you only fight for your side and that's the issue with politicians that's why I tell everybody over and over again become a free agent\nEvery time your last vote\nIs cast for all of the people are going to cast a vote for come in November So every time you chicken you check off that last box or do whatever it is you do and that's it it's gone you turn around and you say I've got no allegiance to anybody they're gonna have to earn my vote its actions not words and become a free agent\nLet them work for you\nI learned about pressure cookers when I was a kid I said to my mother you know when you make those potatoes wiser thing whistle\nShe says Johnny if it doesn't whistle blow off steam it all explode we're about to see the explosion and we are seeing some since the explosion American politics I Hope people will listen to me and think about it doesn't have to be when and loss there are ways in which we can get these things fixed\nAbsolutely it's not going to be perfect right we're still going to have some uh uh you know some awful people in positions of power but when you start holding them accountable\nYou start getting rid of them you start voting them out and stop being trapped by some sort of deal are by your name you know much better that's going to be for you and me and everybody else\nThey're still going to be times when they fall short of expectations are she'll human beings they're still going to be times with politics get the way but the problem now is politics is all that matters the people don't matter it's it's it themselves it's the party and way down here it's the people outside of that they don't care\nThey don't and we need to start care we absolutely need to start carrying one hundred and ten percent\nIn a different way than we're doing it now we do it now when we go we say something on Facebook we say something somewhere and we are I'm only this or I'm only that and and and away we go and I defend my party and I don't care about no are you listening\nOr you're talking or you conversing other people are you having an open mind about something I don't have to agree with you you don't have to agree with me we don't need to hate each other find some middle ground we can find some commonality we can sit there and talk and you know what's great is when it comes to politics I'm okay if you have to give some stuff up\nBecause they're also Americans they are Americans just like me and sometimes you give and sometimes you get but we're in a position where we don't if it's not all it'll be nothing and we're okay with that and that's not a win\nWas winning on this nobody who are not teaching our kids this we reach our kids\nYou win at all costs you know I the Ryder Cup was on over the weekend you know when everybody liked each team given each other a hug right do you play as hard as you can and you show respect for somebody because when you back them into a corner whether it's a human being or whether it's an animal you learned your back somebody into a corner and they'll strike at you\nAbsolutely and I will tell you this right now like I said and I continue to say go look up the names of every tribe out there a majority of tribes have people in their name\nRiver people our people the people because they want to see themselves only as the people and everybody else is\nThe serpent the demon the evil they are less than us these people that doesn't get us anywhere the minute we see red white and blue hey we're all Americans here regardless of color or sexual orientation who worship or don't worship any of the better it is for everybody\nThe better it is I'm not saying that you don't have your thoughts and and you should look at everything and you vote your conscience and the thing you want but if we don't stop for a second and started thinking hey we need to start moving things forward and we're not going to get everything we want and we can do this as as a group going forward and we could show the world what it is and who it is we are\nIn a better way our\nFounding fathers were worried not about outside forces but by us eating ourselves alive three two three five three twenty four twenty three at you had

decision\nIf they're going to be forced into it if they're going to be forced socially enjoyed\nWhich is going to cut into their profits which is going to make things more expensive which is going to make Amazon this is a money when for them they'll spend more money but they're going to make more money and that right there is I think once again a brilliant move\nFifteen dollar minimum wage is a

going to go out and spend more money more money so because the economy's great one votes ... me and I'll go out and everything and but what ... is doing is he is now putting pressure on other

been richer in history might is has never been as rich as you you have all this money and your employees they they they just don't have a living wage and look at all this stuff\nNow that you've done this\nThey'll go ... go to Wal Mart because they've raised or wages have risen up let's go to target they haven't raised there's enough let's go to who we can't go to Sears because Iran long enough Kmart probably around long enough so so now they're going to go after this and what this does is as the pressure comes on them they have to start making decisions do we want to be in the
