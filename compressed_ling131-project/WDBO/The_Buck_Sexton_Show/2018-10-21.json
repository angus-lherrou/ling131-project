{"month": "10", "state": "FL", "station": "WDBO", "content": "Well that's my prayer um why were the one question everybody always asks me as where do I get the addresses and over the years I've just networked myself with a guidance counselor or social workers and I just go on good faith as the address comes to me that it's meant to be or meant to deliver it\nWhy don't you go ahead and tell the story of how all of this began\nWell I went to a Tony Robbins event uh about Twenty one years ago and he tells a story when he was a young boy that stranger shut up at their house with a basket of food and I guess a stepfather at the time was kind of a jerk and didn't really want acceptable because it was present at like a gift\nThe stepfather accepted it and he tells a story that you know his family really needed it will in that moment it changed his mind on that he wanted to help the world\nSo he's been telling the story at all of his conventions you know it uh seminars for many many years and so this is a global effort it doesn't always happen on the same day um it's always the same Saturday in central Florida Saturday before Thanksgiving\nBut um it does happen globally so even if you went to social media and you put the hash tag basket brigade you could actually see where it is an all over the world is really cool because you'll see\n'em groups and and companies and just\nPeople just coming together in that moment and that day one more thing that I Want to add is that you know for me it's a very special week because of that is a week that those children are out of school\nAnd so for us to show up on a Saturday morning were given that family hope that they can actually feed their families also that way because in the basket I always you know suggest everybody to get extra stuff like peanut butter and jelly and rice and some staple items to just fill it up\nAnd then that way is sustainable for that family because food is essential for us to to think and so when food shows up at a door unexpected then it's like love and so we're friends feeding friends\nAnd of course you're making the point that those kids are out of school so if they're in a situation where maybe they're getting a a meal at lunchtime and maybe even breakfast that's gone for the week until school resumes\nThat's right so this is a ... year after year by showing up at these families um door and ... we know that we're making a difference for these families during that week it's just not that one day on Thursday um because people have found me are found the effort\nUm you know later on and have shared with me and little stories or even email Neal thank you um and so this year actually we are official nonprofit this year which is a huge great news for me so we are accepting donations and I will go shopping personally for somebody if they did want to make a donation\nUm and also if anybody needs hours for their children to be a for school um I can also sign off on that as well\nAnd you know I Would offer up to that when you deliver that basket that family is going to have a nice time together eating it but it's also really nice for our families and delivering it isn't it if you no matter what side you are on the equation you're really getting a real good sense of community and a real good sense of bonding\nYes there's different layers to this effort because it's so organic\nI mean you're going to the grocery store you're gonna just be shopping but get your children involved to help them you know be part of it and then have them help you decorate these basket seemed teaching your children you know what contribution is and what it means to help others\nAnd it's not you know not just toys it's actually doing something and then my bringing 'em your your children that day and that morning they can actually go out with you and deliver these baskets again teaching them that\nYou know other people may have it worse than they do and that's also a lesson so it has a lot of layers to it and I'm grateful because it is\nA people have grown up with it now families like this is their tradition\nNow you started this effort in Daytona\nIs that correct yes I started in ... county Daytona Beach and that effort is still going on um my girlfriend Amy took it over many years ago and so her and I talk and we kind of culture we all every year we improve it\nSo they'll deliver about two thousand baskets ... county so somebody's here's this and wants to be part of ... county um they can go to a basket brigade of ... county and and there's a stage and that more in the same day same time November seventeenth nine AM\nAnd I we can go there or there is another place uh that I also coach somebody down inside\nThe ... and ... and they'll be doing the same effort down there so if somebody is in Osceola county and can't make it that you know it makes more sense for them just to go to a celebration then that's great or ... county but we need bodies also in Orlando so inspection speaking of which were going to be at the first Baptist church\nUm and this is the first Baptist church Orlando this is I'm off at John Young and I for and uh we had to go there they'd be really gracious because we were so big we grow out of the parking lot\nJoy to one more time let people know on line where to go\nOn the website is basket brigade Florida dot com and there's a great video to there so that's something to share a and take just a few moments just to watch that it'll give you kind of if if you've never been to the event it'll give you a feel for what it looks like and what to expect\nSo do you mentioned already a little bit about what goes into a basket that let's go over the last people can see that on line at the Web address you gave but let's go ahead and go with the basics and then let's tell people how they might accept that are enhanced that\nOkay just go buy a laundry basket like I mentioned it's been about four dollars on that um you know a rectangular one and then\nYou might add into your basket you know boxer potatoes either potatoes themselves or a box potato stuffing\nRoles any kind of can stuff is great to have because of that out that something they can use even beyond Thanksgiving so you know cans of corn cranberries green beans vegetables jams cream a mushroom soup fruit cocktail anything that's kind of coal\nAnd then I also add a peanut butter and jelly and macaroni and cheese is the extra stuff\nAnd sometimes I'll put rice in there as well um I also have on the list cookies and cakes and brownies I mean who doesn't like that right\nAnd then um if you wanted to add a pumpkin pie you certainly could but you know it's up to you so just you know still it up usually costs about forty dollars to do this whole basket including the basket itself and then the other thing is that ten dollar grocery gift card and that's so we ... the family can go and buy their turkey\nRight before so that we were not delivering something that might be a perishable\nAnd of course you make the point it's about forty dollars but in reality we tend to go to the grocery store and get the two for one oh yeah because we're buying for our own meal as well so\nWell yeah and then I was I always encourage people if you're going to do want to do too because guess what sometimes is a buy one get one so those photos and then when everybody shows up that morning with all their decorated baskets and and they we unload the cars and they line them up than we have a team that goes to every single basket and puts a note in each basket and that note says\nThis is a gift from somebody that cares about you all we ask is you do this for somebody else Sunday and so that's another great message to that somebody cares\nI mentioned other ways to enhance it I N and certainly I think that Carter is probably the greatest enhanced what an ... you know receiving that and and seeing and feeling that connection with someone but and little things I mean I Know you've told me in the past\nYou put hygiene items or you know maybe pans or something in there as well\nOh yes I mean you could do anything like you know if you see something in the store the dollar store that you know and decorated ... napkins and plates I personally like to also by shampoos and just to kind of the basics and sometimes I'll go to the dollar store and buy stocks\nAnd you know you know you get the big packet and break them apart and enroll him up and put a little ribbon on because\nYou never know that my my need socks you know just so if you just see any little goodies like that I'm ... I'm I add to it just in my bass 'cause they usually so have there can barely pick them up\nUm but that's really cool to weed because you've got to the door with two people on each side and you just knock on the door and some of the things that you see when people open the door it's it's amazing\nSo you're not looking for you know you don't register people and have them you know did you get your basket you're just the they go out there but I Know you must hear back in some way from some of these folks\nI think because now it's been going on for twenty some years that that people have heard of it and they've shared this within their churches other communities so they do find me now of course now with the Internet when I started this out there was no email I was back said\nTrucks backed a public service program of this station\nIf you would like to tell us about your a nonprofit organization your community event or issue of concern to the community please contact producer Beth payroll for zero seven to nine five five eight five eight extension for seven one eight or via the Internet and\nDon P.

plan to hold it or at least one year before you can show it and I was wondering what would\nBe the best way to do without the energy it I'm I'm fairly new to investing overall among to doing it for a couple of years Thirty years old and he\nHe couldn't get into the gang trying to leave 'em and so my ideal is to try to keep and bear um and just let it grow along with my little one Jay I'm however when I heard you the other day I thought maybe that might not be the best idea so it was just wondering what your suggestion would be\nSo I Love these plans where the company offers you a discount and I guess they take a little bit out of each paycheck and find the purchase of the stock that they give you a Fifteen Percent off [noise] is that right\nYes that's right yeah so I I Love that because they're giving you a direct incentive\nAnd you've got a guaranteed Fifteen Percent seal on the stock I mean that's pretty great and\nThen the iffy part is you have to own it for a year and then added\nHere you can sell so it's possible the stock would go down over the next here and even though you got to discount you might lose money beyond the likely that you would lose money consistently and it's really a a great gift they're giving you\nGiving you an opportunity to be an owner of the company and part and on the stock so I don't have a problem with that\nUm and you could at the years mark ... salad and take your profits paid the tax on it\nBut okay the four oh one K. thing\nThere's when you load up a four O. one K. with company stock that's the money you're depending on for your retirement money that you're doing and the stock purchase plan where you get the discount you can use it for any purpose you want after that twelve month holding period\nOkay and you know it was good at all out at that twelve month so are there different issues and different concerns\nOkay actually and I guess I was wondering if I should be taking that money and you know showing it taken the ... and then you know moving back to something else like an IRA\nWell I Love it if you took the words right out of my mouth would I Would love him smiling as you asked that because you made it sound like you don't get the investing thing at all and you ask the perfect question so if you ... for a year you sold it then I'd love it if you put it in a Roth IRA\nAnd because you're allowed to put up to fifty five hundred dollars a year and a raw you put money in a Ross and it grows tax free\nAll through the next Thirty years you'll be working and then you spend that money and everything at CERN tax free so and then that automatically diversify you away from the company's stock in a four one K. you have what are you putting your money in and hit\nA with a company matches or six percent shoplifters so six percent match in there\nAnd then what do you ... what do you investing in in\n... oh oh well most of it was in um the vanguard I'm target fun\nThat's perfect and I would put it all and the vanguard target fund for\nSince you're thirty three let's look like um oh what would that be great doing like twenty six to eight twenty fifty five\nI say it's twenty shift the child I Want to say yeah\nThat's fine and there'll be a great decision and then you're completely diversified away from what you're doing and that companies stopped\nAnd then if you did a Roth IRA with money you'd sell after a year of that company stock plan you could put all that and a Roth IRA with vanguard in the same target retirement fund twenty fifty five\nSo you'd have your uh four one K. at work it would be ... times and then you have your raw there would be after tax money and that would be a beautiful combo so sounds to me Brandon like you're doing a great job and you should know that\nIt's saving money for retirement thirty three put to your head and most people don't really think about it till they have their fortieth birthday so you're not behind you're kind of a head of a lot of people\nMarlins with us on the car coward show hell of Marlin\nBut after ... day going\nI'm having a great day and I hope you are too\nEarly are um [noise] just a question of one question I've um state employees retirement fund I've been a contributing to with my employer for about twelve years\nAnd he\nNeeded to hire in order to draw the sun's out so I couldn't do that um and take a lump sum would would there be any other\nPlans that you'd recommend take a I think it's maybe for about twelve thousand dollars which is a great song but should I call it like that which is another plan\nSo you said this is a state retirement plan ...\nFederal employees retirement plan\nAll right so you got this twelve grand and so your option would be to take it where they give you just a monthly check for the rest of your life forget that twelve grants\nSo until I he sees me by receive that amount but they do not pay up all too I'm an air war um you can write\nThis depends on the state plan and uh my thing generally is light\nFor you to get the monthly check for and the reason as you're not as likely\nTo be able to generate as much money from that twelve thousand says the state will pay you every month and if there's somebody who's really depending on you time in the event that they outlive you eat he married that you have a wife who'd be depending on you yes\nSo what you can do if you're if you're ... plan just terminate set the time of your death and doesn't offer a survivor payment to your wife at that time you could do something pretty simple you could buy a term life insurance policy\nThat at the time of year death would pay a a benefit to your wife and then regardless of where the sources of funds would be she would get a that amount of money in order to have to live on in the event that she outlived ...\nCase so I couldn't buy a term life policy that would be like hey that for some time is that what you're\nYou know the white term life works and you buy it for a period of time Fifteen Years Twenty years science Thirty Years' sensors gotta set premium for a set amount of coverage and in the event you do pass away and the Fifteen twenty Thirty years it just pays a lump sum\nTo your wife busier survivor in that way you don't have to worry what's gonna happen to her if you're not around um you know she'd be grieving over you but she wouldn't have to worry about money\nOkay now I Do have a term life there was a ... year plan which probably will expire and about the other six years the last lady I'll probably outlive it so\nSo if you are a good health and you want to make sure she's protected for a many years to come you could buy a twenty thirty year policy and you could let the one with the six years remaining lapse if you wanted\nAnd place it with a new one oh where you could have both temporarily because if you were to die unexpectedly in six years she might need more money to carry her through her natural lifespan for\nThis pretty stuff we're talking about but um you know it's something I I Want people to think about and discuss is making sure that their loved ones are taken care of financially and\nOn car dot com I have

something they very much want me to talk about and there are so right that\nA problem that has appeared over and over again\nThat we've noticed and is happening to so many people in the country is you'll resolve you're going to set up a Roth IRA or you're going to set up an IRA even put money into the account after you open it\nBut you forget one more step\nAnd that is\nYou've got to choose the investments the money's going to go yet\nSo many people's dollars are sitting in IRAs burning basically nothing in the default equivalent of like a money market account like a savings account inside an IRA or raw\nYou're not even going to be able to keep up with inflation\nIt's absolutely essential but when you open a retirement account that you go to the ...\nStep that may or may not be obvious when you open that account that with the money you put in\nYou choose what it will be invested in a lot of times people will be overwhelmed\nBy what psychologists referred to as the paradox of choice there are so many different funds they are so many different options used basically shut down you put the money in the account but you don't ever choose how it will be invested\nSo keep it very simple\nMost places that have you on any of the low cost places I recommend you are going to be able to put money into a target retirement fund\nAnd you put it in the target retirement fund for the year closest or when you're going to retire\nAnd just put all the money in that\nIf you ... wanna do things that are more involved and let's say you decide well I Want to put some money in\nEmerging markets so it's a term for third world countries or I Want to put money in some form of bonds or I Want to put money in a European stocks or whatever it is I mean you want to do things more exotic have at it\nBut for so many people starting out with a Roth IRA or traditional i._r._a.\nJust picking a simple default choice to target retirement fund will get your money heavily diversified mean simply spread out in many different types of investments many types of stocks here and oversees all in One Fund and so\nWhen you do find that IRA or raw\nMake sure you complete the deal and get your
