B. B. O. window turns first for breaking news\n\nI'm Todd ... senators Susan Collins not only dashed hopes of Democrats by saying she'll vote yes to confirmed judge Kavanaugh to the Supreme Court you heap praise on Kavanaugh for being America look up\nThis was about stopping any judge that Trump and the Republicans picked because they were going to pick a judge because they won the election because they were allowed to screen scoreboard they were allowed to pick any judge that was going to look at it in a way that they want the constitution interpret it\nAnd it was capital and he was in the firing line and you know what's going to be the most contentious fight ever and it was\nToday the Senate has the opportunity to advance his nomination [noise]\nEvery one of us will go on record with one of the most consequential votes\nYou ever cash and the ...\nYeah they're looking there looking there absolutely and and and no matter what people said today or tomorrow it isn't until it is over there we can go okay fine\nBut I understand why they fought the way they did\nAnd that while they may be destroying a good man the reality is is it could have been any man or anyone if this was Amy uh Coney Barrett wouldn't matter it would have come after her heart\nBecause it's about the direction of the court not the person that's tipping the court that direction is the direction of the overall court that people are worried about\nYou know the Susan Collins and Murkowski they have a tough position that they're in\nTheir in states that are for all intents and purposes they're purple or leaned a little bit in one direction you look at mansion he's in a state that leads in another direction and he happened to be on the opposing side of it so that's why he's more open to doing things\nThey have to play with a different world than all of these other senators were they know they're pretty much safe right and so you can go to Susan Collins and you can go to Lisa Murkowski and you can say look we got enough to do this because pencil break the tie vote your conscience\nVote the way you think it is mentioned on the other end knows I got a vote a certain way because I'm an estate easily won by Trump is a red state and I'm blue senator I got to do this in a way where I can I can walk in a little bit different direction I'm going to have to be\nGoing against the Democrats on more than a few occasions because of where I Am so you have to maneuver inside of all of those things and yet\nPeople worry about their jobs of course they do senators want to give up power out the reality is some of these people are going to be primary because of this about\nSome of them are going to be primary absolutely\nIt's interesting this was an ugly situation that would have happened no matter who it was it just happened to be that they found the perfect storm hit me too movement\n\nA person who had a he said she said moments that they're still debating about and will continue to do over and over and over again\nThat altogether it was a perfect storm Amy Coney Barrett whoever else it would have been they would have found something as I Would expect the right side of the aisle to do in a situation like this because they understand the gravity of what potentially could be happening here\nBut the perfect storm came in and this is it\nNow the fight is going to continue to go on and on and on and on\nI Do not see how it's possible\nFor my colleagues to stay with perfect confidence\nThat judge Kavanaugh has the temperament independence and credibility sister on the United States Supreme court\nHe knew exactly what was going to be the playbook on both sides what's going to be exactly what you thought it was going to be who's going to be contentious it was going to be\n... this isn't right like they don't get any better that it's right here is like this is what it is\nAnd you know when Mitch McConnell came out and said your vote your votes right here this vote\nIs the biggest though you're going to have because for a lot of them their votes are largely nobody cares you know pay any attention but this vote was big for two reasons one\nBecause of what it is going to do with the court and two because some of these people he knows voting in certain directions they're going to be issues down the road\nAbsolutely this is interesting very interesting I Love Chuck Schumer says here though\nWhen no American be surprised\nBecomes a decisive vote to restrict the rights and privileges of the American people\nWhile stretching the bounds of privilege for the current occupant of the White House\nThe is the fear factor that plays for your car always good everybody has that is what they do\nAgain you it's no longer you being out you go out and you're talking from the microphones and you do your thing it's no longer that right you don't get to do that anymore\nIt's not that now it's you've got to be able to get everybody riled up your people bussed in and and you know I was thinking today what what is the gone so let's say was it was a female\nRight it was it was it was ... a ... that would have been the one right like here's here's a woman who is a lot of people thought it was going to be very good super ... pro life they were already taking aim at her\nOver the last couple of days thinking they might have Kavanaugh done they were taking aim at her and then some of the groups she's been associated with because she was going to come in and destroy the whole row the weight and this is what\nIt again it it wouldn't have mattered well how would that have gone like these are the things\nThat you know just understand this for what it is it was politics and now you're seeing is you're going to see it for days and days and days and days you're going to see a lot of people protesting but eventually it's going to slow down and we'll life were turned back to normal you still have to go to work on Monday\nDon't care what side of the aisle you're on

have to be pregnant and you have to come back in the house and you're allowed to go outside or any of those things\nIt is it is it is just ugly the way that things have gone\nWhat left wing groups and their democratic allies have done to judge Kavanaugh\nIs nothing short\nOf monstrous ugly it has it's been ugly and both sides have been I think the way that this thing has happened in the way this thing has gone down that this has not been a shining moment in our history\nOf politics right\nI mean you look back and like I look back at those Clarence Thomas hearings and you know the whole thing

Christine Ford\nYeah she needed to be heard and they always will be heard and then it was well wait a second is on rush this through need an FBI investigation okay there to produce so far\nYou know and people need to be talked too including judge there's other people so that has and it's not enough and a lot of people predicted it would never be enough right now I think it was pretty good on this show actually it was that it would never be enough Grassley goes back to Dr Ford\nAnd I think he is speaking for a lot of people in the country saying what he says here\nBut let's get back to the legitimacy of foreign coming forward if she was she was a solid I Believe she was a solid\nA there is no cooperation that are about her a judgment that it was a judge Kavanaugh\nBut you gotta take sexual assault\nAccusations very seriously we don't do that enough in American society and this uh uh whether a Ford is right about judge Kavanaugh or not the fact that we had a forum before my committee bringing to the people's attention\nThe major social problem we have about for sexual assault and we don't talk about it [noise] uh that is at least one good accomplish\nBy Dr Ford coming forward\nOkay because she was to be respected right she was speaking out yes she was allowed to forty minutes\nAnd it certainly seemed to me like she was very well respected\nWell I think there were a whole lot of kid glove I mean they brought in somebody to ask the questions they asked the question it's\nA lot of compassion for fear of the optics of it of of ... old white guys old privilege white guys beating up on a on Dr Ford so let's bring in a female\nAnd she can ask the questions but you knew it was not going to be enough even with more question and going on this week\nNo I Know and that's the problem there's been demands they both been met both of them\nAnd still the biggest thing to me and I've said it before is that when Dr Ford said yes my friend feeling Kaiser was there\nAnd Keyser says I no recollection I don't know Brett Kavanaugh ... wasn't there that is a huge problem that are people supposed to do at a little kerosene on that fire today with guys are saying listen they were trying to twist my arm\nYes felt pressure yes oh boy\nFrom the left pressure to lie yes yes\nThat's troubling then you go to Kellyanne Conway\nYou also appeared later on Fox and friends today\nKelly it's talking about you know as women she was one of the first ones from the right to say I think she needs to be heard talking about Dr Boyle didn't Kellyanne Conway also tell us that she too had been sexually assaulted\nYes yeah so I mean there you go by the way Mika Brzezinski got into that conversation say will kill you have to talk about it you know ...\nOr ... sometimes we understand why people don't want to come forward the artist she doesn't want to come forward and tell her story right now isn't that up to her ...\nWho are you to tell her I mean should really be careful about morality oh buddy I don't think smoking Joe was back when I was actually available when\nThey come up with each other I don't think so either but Kelly is talking about the hypocrisy here it is\nIt say not as winning but as American dad mom terrific that lots of women are kind of the way they want to tell their story\nBut they need to be heard about why just in the context of this they're praying court hearing for this man based on thirty six year old allegations that are still on corroborate into this moment\nIf you want to we went to help women sexual assault maker let's do
