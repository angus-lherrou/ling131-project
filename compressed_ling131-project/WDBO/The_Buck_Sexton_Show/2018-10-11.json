I'll maybe I'll donate and then you move on\n\nBecause it because we've had so many of the last year or so where you get we've had the Houston right we had Maria and all of these and by that point in time that first mover advantage has moved on and we're just like I don't know if I'm gonna pay that much attention to it if you if there are a lot of people died and come to us but outside of that I'm Sorry it's raining I got other things to them\nAnd nobody wants to say everybody's afraid to say something like that 'cause we live in a World War terrified to say anything like that I'm sure somebody has to your horrible person was saying that to be honest\nI mean we we we only so much empathy because after a while because that the which is I got other things sorry I've already I've already given\nLike how many times I mean it's like when you go to the store is a perfect example is when you had to the store so you go to the store and it let's just say you've given money earlier in the day you know you get five bucks to somebody or you've done some and they go to the store they ask you like to round up or would you like to donate to such and such like in now already gave\nHer to get because we only have so much of that to go around and our cynicism in this where we should be paying a lot of attention to this but it's not going to get the kind of of of run it deserves unless the tragedy is Fifteen hundred people die\nRight Fifteen hundred people die we're going to pay attention to it if it's there was a storm surge people's houses got moved\n[noise]\nSorry that sucks hope insurance ... out\nThat's nobody wants to talk about it nobody's going to say but that's the reality of this and it is ugly ugly ugly\nWe feel that way but it's also human\nBecause we got our lives going on three two three five three eight twenty four twenty three and she had been some shows your Twitter you can tweet at us love hearing from you know we're talking last night that the u._s. you had\nYou had Taylor Swift over the weekend decided she was going to vote for a Democrat and you know and and it laid out a reason I got I don't care who she votes where I don't care who anybody that's probably true you both for as long as you vote in your education\nAbout it and there's been a real surge in voter registration because of that last night she spoke\nWarn every single word given out and I were voted on by the people [noise]\n[laughter] [noise]\nAnd I I I'm angry about the fact that\nIt takes somebody like her to influence people in the day and age when we have\nReal issues that may be talked about and we're not talking about those real issues none of these issues that need we we we paddled with Kavanaugh which is a very important issue because SCOTUS is one of if not the most important thing a president and the Senate will do for all of their other stuff because we know how important courts are nowadays\nWe understand that everything is is is litigated everything is going to a quarter matter what it is somebody's going to challenge something and you can expect lawsuit after law suits\nAnd so yes I understand that but it was the ... the way it's handled but you know it's not being talked about health care\nAnd the nightmare that it is\nYou know when you ask people the midterms like and I'm not talking about like teenagers you know like Eighteen Nineteen twenty twenty four years but you ask people in their thirties and forties you've got a family got business got all these things what's important costs of health care still sitting\nUp there it absolutely is the economy isn't talked about as much because it's going well it's almost like we don't talk about the economy 'cause we don't we don't ... I don't want to be that you know that guy that if I start talking about it go south so we just kind of\nPush that off were happy we only talk about but it's like a it's like a baseball player with a perfect game you ever watch uh baseball players got a perfect game about the seventh eighth inning or no hitter you look in the picture sitting in the quarter by himself and the other twenty four players or the opposite side of the dug out 'cause they don't want to talk about because we don't want to jinx it\nBut healthcare massive and the cost of health care and why haven't they fixed it immigration is still sitting out there because neither side really wants to deal with it and the whole they hope the whole DACA thing gets sorted out in the courts so they don't have to make a decision\nAnd then to me something that is vitally important it's a giant that were carrying we are in such we're upside down like you couldn't\nBelieve not being talked not not\nThose things are important they are\nAnd we have and and and as I'm trying to point out to people there's low information voters and and you'll hear a lot of other shows are low information from Asian voter isn't a voter that stupid law information voter is a person who who pays attention every two or four years\nRight they go out there and they get their book when they go through some of the stuff and and and the information they have is what they see on Twitter or Instagram or Facebooking his stuff and then they you know they they tried to put together something they're not stupid they just they don't take the time to pay attention the way that\nThey should and that's understandable but he's living in like the no information voter is the one I'm worried about\nWho's influenced by somebody like Taylor Swift telling them hey you guys should vote it's awesome it's super it's what we're all doing and that to me is where my frustration comes in right now\nBecause it is vitally important that your vote but you should vote in an educated way it's not hard how you can get the voting but they do everything they can do give you all the information you need in a snap shot kind of way to make it somewhat educated decision about the things in front of you\n\nBut alas so you got the educated voters you've got the low information voters not stupid just doesn't take the time to pay attention and only does it what it's like the Olympics they only pay attention when it's just around the corner and then you've got to know information butter and that is what the celebrities or do it and somebody like her it's great that you can influence people like that I\nHave no problem with that but I think there's a better way of doing it\nI really do and uh and I know she took a lot of blowback because a lot of people out there saying oh my God you know she says she must have voted for Donald Trump because she's not coming out saying the right thing\nAnd that's the most part they come out to the right thing we all know what the right thing is to say in a situation like this but it's a please if you're a no information voter and you're only influence and and is to register to vote because she got you over the line please don't vote that's all last not that I don't want you to vote if you want to go get yourself educated great\nBut if that is the only reason you're doing it please stay

Venezuela's not doing too well [laughter]\nBut and and and we begin to some of the reaction to all of this a little bit later but I I keep seeing all of these talking heads and cable quote unquote news anchors saying it's totally irresponsible to call the protesters mob\nAnd I don't know how else he would describe again people who are blocking traffic and people who are uh openly calling for the harassment\nOf government officials I don't know how you would describe it other than that other than this was a mob\nWell if you go to the playbook it goes like this if\nYou got a group of people to come together and summer pounding on cars and telling people you got to go the other way and throwing bricks through windows\nYeah you have to report it was mostly peaceful protests right other than just a few bad apples and but you\nDo also then have other people who are high profile names are in the Democratic party who are going out and saying basically well this is the reaction you get a Hillary Clinton this was on CNN yesterday and boy okay you cannot\nBe liberal with the political party that wants to destroy which banned for which you're paramount definitely I Believe if we are fortunate enough to win that house and a word that we ... started their own\nSo when we when that's when we stopped right oh that's exactly what you're saying and that's exactly what she believes I thought you were all about anti bullying that\nSounds like bully supporting we're going to keep doing this until we get our way and we get the power right right I mean\nThat the Republican theme to

doesn't make sense to them people are breaking the law doesn't make sense to your average Jane and Joe it just doesn't right\nWell and saying yeah well you can be civil until we went elections I mean and and it's really and she blamed it on Republican Jews as Republicans have taken it way too far\nAnd certainly I think you can look at the fringes of both of the both sides of the political spectrum and say that there have been conservative activists who have cross lines before or people who call themselves conservative activists new across lines there's no question about that but it did by turning a blind eye to what left wing activists have done right now and what's being encouraged\nRight now\nIs insane to me you get cooks on both sides right okay part of being the same ones is calling out the cooks ... you got to call out your own sometimes when it's obvious the behavior is over the line\nThe media excuse all of it I mean they say no it's not it's you can't call it a mob you can't do that I mean look at it because they see it as extreme measures to go against their viewpoint they don't agree with that is what it all comes down to\nAre you looking into that crystal
