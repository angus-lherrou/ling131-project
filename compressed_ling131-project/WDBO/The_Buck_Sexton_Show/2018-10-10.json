it wrong I'm not going to say that I don't but I just think that this has a lot to do with the fact that she's kind of over it and she may be need some money and not that you poor broke but that that there's a time to\nCash in and that she's got bigger aspirations I really do I think she's got bigger aspirations and who knows what that aspiration maybe yeah she'd like to be president but with vice president suffice pronounce\nFall along at you had mentioned sheltered you three five three twenty four twenty three you're useless facts they like the sixties gas prices right was around but I'm like

Seventy five thousand residents of Florida are being told a get out of the way of incoming hurricane Michael some for whatever reason won't\nWe have no idea what's really come out some of us said some of his left the ones who said we're just so we're going to pray that eventually are and I had a\nMan and Appalachia cola Florida packing wind one hundred twenty five miles an hour the category three Michael is taking Deb Amos Florida's panhandle federal meteorologist Richard Henry has been aboard a hurricane hunting aircraft\nI was really ... those people to listen to what urgency management folks are telling them they live in a storm surge their own area this is it time to leave because this is not a store and just try to ride out there talking about a very large storm surge\nI like how she just cut that off cut that line of questioning off altogether yeah how many people deleted their tweet after she said that a lot\nProbably nobody because unlike what we've been hearing the last three weeks or liberals don't believe this woman [laughter]\nThat's just the reality of it they don't you know they they don't believe or I mean you had CNN's Jim Acosta coming baggage and you you mentioned all the successes that we've had a so why is it that you would still leave now ... or Germany\nReligious law which is why we believe that all the times is a really personal decision because you've been away from your family members or you know something that might be okay\nHold on a second yeah so is it really that I don't believe you to come on out with it and they go well that's ... to\nMe and my family and so you know there was no personal reasons theory imported from Minnesota\nThe mountains down from when I come from\nOther people who can\nManage our way into it ...\nIt's good to rotate in rotated out I mean I'm ... I'm sure that she is planning some sort of political career after being the United states ambassador to the un I'm positive about that but I think there is a lot of wishful thinking going on in the media especially that she's going to come out and just towards Trump we saw we've seen that many times with people who leave the White House\nYou know there's this idea that everybody's going to go scorched earth Sean Spicer is out Sean Spicer is about to go scorched earth on Donald Trump oh Steve Bannon's out\nDonald Trump went scorched earth on Steve Bannon but Steve Bannon says no I'm Still going to work for this president I'm Still going to work hard to push this guy's agenda yes I'm just out of the White House out 'cause you know depending on who you believe based on news reports very you know either he just laughed because it was ready to time to leave or he just you know got fired\n... I mean no no matter what job you're in when you know it's only going to last a certain amount of time\nDo you have to have an idea what you're gonna do next yeah isn't that just natural oh sure that's not a stretch I mean anybody serving right now you know unless they're set financially like okay\nWhat we'll do after this what might I Do and sometimes you're like I don't know but I'm open to ideas but to have never thought that I'm just going to be in this good forever that doesn't make sense no it\nDoesn't make any sense so um yeah I mean there's been a lot of the ah speculation that maybe she is the New York times\nOp ed writer anonymous\nSeeing that already I don't I don't know if that's true\nWell\nHow are we ever going to know unless she admits it yeah or someone else says you know it was Mickey but Trump said at the time what female ... more than likely female yeah I'm paraphrasing and so everybody's like Kellyanne Conway battlefield my\nMoney I if I had to bed I Would still back on Kellyanne Conway as far as the anonymous thing is concerned I don't think it was Nikki Haley and again she came out today and was amicable and leaving she just said it was time to do I believe in term limits I Believe I've been in government\nAt this point long enough time to move on All right\nWell there's a lot more to get through with the Nikki Haley story today another thing a lot of people are talking about is what happened with the president that Kavanaugh yeah and Trump basically apologizing for America\nYeah so President Trump there this was the uh the swearing in ceremony for the new Supreme Court justice Brett Kavanaugh and I will admit I got a little bit worried when I heard him open up\nWith this case\nI Would like to begins and then it's proceeding differently than perhaps any other events such magnitude\nAs I'm watching this thing live I'm thinking oh correct what's about to come on man come on and on hold\nBut I actually I have no problem with with what he said after this\nIsn't that something that just makes it more entertaining because it's the wild card you're never quite sure what you're going to get with the Donald ... it I mean it's very true he went over\nHalf of the nation I Want to apologize to bread and the ...\nFamily for the terrible pain and suffering you have been forced to endure those who stepped forward just serve our country deserves a fair and dignified evaluation\nNot a campaign of political and personal destruction based on lies interceptions\nOkay the stop right there for a second yeah\nBecause you know right now for anyone that supported Trump or thought the Kavanaugh was done wrong you're like yes absolutely good for you and again if your against Trump or war against Kavanaugh your ... all the more with that statement you know especially when you're going\nDown the road of as he goes up into the cabinet was saying was violation every notion of sharing his\nDecency and due process as our currency the mayor was ... always be presumed innocent ... been doing to proven guilty [noise]\nAnd with said I must say that use are under historic scrutiny were proven innocent thank you [noise]\nYou know from the other side of ... he was not a victim mhm do not make Brett Kavanaugh to be a victim ... whole lot of people in the country that feel like his whole family were victims in this thing yeah they do\nWell and at that and then also the criticism of course has been he was not proven innocent well of course you can't our ... something you didn't do\nI mean I I think you can say that like Susan Collins said so eloquently on friday or you can say that there was definitely not enough proof to fairly say I'm going to take this guy's career based on these allegations but of course not proven innocent but it's hard to proven guilty\nBut it was interesting too on Megan Kelly show she was getting the blowback from some other ... the reporters right and she's saying there was nothing there you this would never be proven in a court in\nOlder just because you used to work at ... news do you mean ... ... ... right\nAnd that's all of a sudden I'm like I'm Glad making Kelly's in there you know what I'm saying yeah I'm so got no problem with that we still got to get the ... kind of going to fix all the problems of course as we know this yes going up automatically man came true

together\nBut then you know sometimes there is no tension or one person is a problem and you know Roseanne was no stranger to controversy yeah there's no doubt about that but yeah I'm sure that he really misses her yeah\nI had some nice things to say about her too about how she really worked with ADC to make sure that people would keep working on the show the ... uh Connors oh it's cool\nAnd she gave up a lot so that the people could work it's weird it was very we're doing the first show without her because she's my buddy I mean we just sit there and she ... which is always fun 'cause

around the block a few times saying no I I'm not going to trash or I mean she did a lot of work to make sure that we could all keep doing what we love to do\nWell and you can't argue she's really
