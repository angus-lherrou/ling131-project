{"month": "10", "state": "FL", "station": "WDBO", "content": "It's a great energy foods that great food for a snack if you want to\nProvide energy for the body so for whether it's bananas apples or grapes or whatever it is Bruce so wonderful energy food are they getting at\nVegetables into those either whether they're fresh and they're eating um carrots and they'll dip and young and and something or a salad that you're making because what happens is\nWhen teenagers miss some of these foods they miss all for it and I miss all the vegetables\nThe nutrients founded notices are part of what work together as team if like on a soccer team you got to have every position and player they work together to provide the body with energy so energy sinks when you're missing out on some of those things so again it's going back in asking yourself\nWhat is their diet look like\nAnd would it help us to improve in some areas and everybody might be different you might be saying oh I couldn't ... well bombs on that they like have I'm shocked with you haven't decided to try something new this week for my kid ... salad well what other ways because you do that ... you know\nUh and and embraces also make a difference in what you can\nDo for sure they do make it a big difference then you have to look at things usually that are softer and that aren't gonna pull them out for sure [noise]\nAll right what about us old people [laughter] when you're ... you're on the same is true all of these\nThings that we just talked about they apply to all ages it doesn't matter if you're over fifty doesn't matter if you're in your twenties if you want to have the most energy and live your day well and be competitive and what it is that you're doing\nThe things that we talked about working out sleeping having a diet that's just gets better and better with time they will give you the most energy that you could possibly have\nThere is not a just one source of like I can eat this and had energy what you can drink anything with caffeine in it and have energy doesn't mean it's going to be good for your body is just going to give you a temporary plug to make it through the next couple of hours and then he'll be the sinking ship and have to do something else all writers are different you know what I'm saying\nYeah I mean energy and yeah just a push and into the sleep how much you eat if you don't get enough sleep you tend to\nGet her ... oh yeah it's interesting there's been date in the past that shown that the less you sleep the more you crave carbs in ... so think about yourself and ask yourself if you notice that that's true the less you sleep the more you crave carbs\nI'm Sorry I'm busy [laughter] [laughter] yeah it is\nAlthough I Will say oddly enough going full circle here the more tired I Am the more I crave something like eggs is that strange\nI that's good I think I think cravings are\nDifferent for different people and it can also a very with age and hormone hormones and things like that so cravings but when people are tired or they're hungry ... have you heard that word hanged ... right [laughter] when you're hungry you get angry and all those other things\nYou try to the idea is to try to keep yourself from reaching the hang green point\nBecause then you just want everything\nAnd then it doesn't matter to get out of my way just give me what I can get to the fastest okay All right I\nHave to throw this out every year we we start to talk about during the holiday season and here we are in October the candy is already rolling out and I know you have some tips for how we can manage things one of which surprisingly is allow yourself to have some\nYeah absolutely and that can is here for Halloween around the corner and we're going right into the holidays but the truth of the matter is the candy never goes away and this country it's ubiquitous all you have to do is turn around there's a candy jar\nRight right so if you deny yourself constantly and that you have that little bird that sits on your shoulder and as you're not really going to\nEat that are you a sense and you go you avoid it ... to the point you can't stand it anymore what happens\nWhen you get stressed us didn't get it and when you're stressing me\nMore that's right you go to the bag and you just start on rapping at a flag as you can and if you don't taste it is you're just eating it because it's there so what I tell people is take your socks stuff that and that birds math\nAnd say to yourself no guilt if I Want a piece of chocolate every single day I'm going to have it and be okay with that\nAnd actually enjoy it for them\nTo Russia yeah today I had the tuna fish for lunch but afterwards I had this piece of it was a little thing from trader Joes I forget what they call it but it looks like a\nA baton almost shape and it was a chocolate with some little raspberries in it\nAnd I broke off at peace and I just sit there and and it was like young so instead of just like ... unwrapping it I just enjoyed it and I didn't feel of building a bit of guilt and when I'm telling you is don't if you allow yourself to have something and you say you know I Want this I enjoy it and then go about your business\n[noise] alright it's time to freestyle here what is going on with the nutritional research that you just like to let everybody know about oh gosh\nBut what's big I'm heading to our national meeting next week and one of the biggest topics out there is intermittent fasting and\nSo when I come back next time we should talk about that and if you're saying what is that what is that there are different diets that say eat for a day skip three days eat again or eight twelve hour skipped twelve hours eat again there's all kinds of different forms that intermittent fasting and is it a is it good for the heart isn't good for wait\nThere's or we're going to have a lot of that at our meeting and I'll talk more about that the next time when we're together All right\nSounds good and you know I guess I I couldn't tell you what the latest fad diet is that I'm sure there's one out there right now my\nGosh it's every week there's a new one and I and you can't even keep up with some people call the Quito diet a fad diet\nIn some ways it can be and other ways there are different cases with things like Parkinson's disease and such where it may actually be quite helpful so bad week to week there's always something to what I tell people has learned to eat real food and don't be afraid of food and learn to eat and enjoy your real meals\n[noise] okay so that means is Thanksgiving rolls around we can just go for it\nNow that if they eat at liberty and okay I like all the time but I think in this country we become fearful of food it's like obsessive you know and\nThe best thing we can do is learn to enjoy real grown food from our farms and eat reasonable amounts with out picking at a part in a million different ways and making ourselves how all the guilt about faith learning to eat the food and reasonable amounts and enjoying it healthy from it\nAnd speaking of which how do you buy your food or do you do you do any gardening to you and I try\nIf the bugs and it was an issue here in fact right now I have a baby kale grow and just in pots and I was so excited because it was just ready to harvest and I went out this morning and some critter\nLeft stocks and about twenty eight all the leaves and I said overnight what little pig ate all that came up and stuff like that something is really hard and\nForwards and grow I Try what I Do grow as citrus lemons limes 'cause I Need a lot of citrus and a fresh herbs and then during the rainy season you kinda lose not done it and then you start again okay let us southern Cal though are always\nGood wants that to grab and that was that's what I was going to ask you seem like there's something about kale you're a super taster aren't you I Am and that means you taste something and count that the rest of the\nSuper tasters believe it or not all of us have different numbers of taste buds on our time some people are non tasters meaning they'd have a lot of taste buds and so\nIt takes a lot more of something for them to taste it normal tasters and then super tasters on what's called a super taster I have a lot of taste buds and it means that it doesn't take much for me to go wow 'cause I I can really taste it and so [noise]\nFor us back to the public service program a vis station if you would like to tell us about your nonprofit organization your

I think it's actually worth like forty six but I'm just going to sell it for forty but I'm looking at offers from a New York and North Carolina and a here locally um but I I don't know how what is a safe way to get payment from these people\nLive wire transfer\nJust to our transfer\nYeah cashier's check means nothing\nOkay and so we have two sides of this let's say you were calling me as the buyer in New York and you're trying to ah you're trying to buy the vehicle and I'd say well\nYou got to be really careful buying cars how do you know it's really on the condition the sellers telling you how do you know Albert's not playing games with you I don't really even owns one and all that\nSo this is an area where when people buy [noise] I'm old collectors cars from across the country it's a very difficult process to protect yourself a lot of people do it by going through the ... motors platform\nAnd I I actually sold\nA vehicle that was in high demand for several years ago through ... motors and this guy bought it from me from Fifteen hundred miles away sight unseen\nPaid me through a the ... motors platform which ultimately will pay pal got my money they showed up with a with a car transfer service and my vehicle went on its way\nAnd so it is it is one of those things where there's a level of trust that needs to be involved with anybody who says cashier's check\nWhere cashier checks used to be the gold standard now they're full sculpt\n[noise] my wife was concerned that if I gave these people who routing numbers in my account numbers and stuff so that there might be some way to reach back into the account and hurt us later I guess that's not an issue\nThat is possible that is possible but with a wire ... that's when you do a CIA [laughter] okay if you do a wire transfer\nThe wire transfers operate that would be much more difficult thing for somebody to move on and try to get the money but it is true with a C H\nI say I didn't know there was a different\nYeah Italy so with a automated clearinghouse and all the AC eight system is one that it has risk [noise] all the way around and those risks are greatly reduced where the wire transfer\nOkay and if it's local people some of them were talking about that we had the same bank and we could go into the back together and do that is that a lot of good idea\nThough that actually can be just fine so if you were to to ah meet someone at their bank branch you sit down with one of those people those over priced test and a branch right and they witness he's doing the bills sail ship to copy says bills sail\nAnd they issue you hey cashier's check on site at the bank and it's one of the bank officers doing it that's money you can trust [laughter]\nSo that's that's a good point I I Can't just sign that title and handed to him I Need to make up a bill of shale two bills a sale\nYeah so when the bell a sale they're they don't have to be anything ah of ultra formal but the way you do a bill a sale is that what is\nYour name as seller the name and address and the name and address of the ... the Vin number of this luxury vehicle and a description and you know miles that kind of thing [noise] purchase price and then you eat signed both copies he knew each keep one copy\nThe reason that's important for you it wouldn't be with the type of vehicle you're selling\nBut often with a run of the mills used vehicle if it's later used in crime or the person who buys it never registers at their own name then and everybody's coming to you saying hey wait wait\nYou're the one responsible for this this vehicle still shows registered to you right and that's where the bills sail is an important piece of evidence says not who proof protection\nIn a situation like that but it is a layer of protection [laughter]\nOkay well that such wonderful advice clerk I I appreciate you taking the time to a steering me in the right direction\nAnd I'm so impressed that you held on long enough that you went from having your money trapped in half to now a doubling from the low points above what you pay\nI thought you'd like to twenty four years than\nI Do like the twenty four years that's

for about a month and today is actually our last day at work\nAnd I'm In order to I guess make it financially um you know and and looking at the cost of daycare um you know that was one of the reasons we decided to stay at home and\nJust wondering what your thoughts on um you know covering that that income gap would be you know reducing the amount that are contributing to um [noise] my retirement plans and I guess I just wanted to get your your thoughts on doing that\nRight well let's first talk on the income side and then we'll talk about expenses or it's not an all or nothing to do with your wife\nGoing from what was a fulltime job where this just isn't working to not working at all to she have a specific skill and experience level based on what she's done in a job\nI Would say no I mean she could go work at a ... a lot of different places but there's nothing specific uh that that really I guess so through apart from that from anybody else\nBecause as an example where she was working is there anything that she could do for them extremely part time and from ... from your home they would bring in some income there would still give her the flexibility of being at home with your young son and bring in a little income\nBut we we\nActually talked to them about that and they're just she's um she's in finance and painting and and it just wasn't any opportunities like that um they invited her to come back once you know she wants to re enter the workforce but they just don't have any positions like that available right now\nAll right and you said you said some in key there her expertise is in finance and banking is that right\nYes correct um\nI Wonder if there's anything go ahead\nOpening new lines of credit I'm hoping I'll let you know people that come into a financial and are looking to open up the college to tickle lines of credit and stuff\nWell I mean that's an area where there's all these on line lenders now maybe there's something she can do part time with one of the online lenders have become prominent I Know right now she's just exhausted and you are to where the newborn\nBut I Love the idea of her staying in the game just a little bit\nAnd bringing in
