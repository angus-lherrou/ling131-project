{"month": "10", "state": "FL", "station": "WDBO", "content": "A book on leadership is out and turbulent times where she looks at some outstanding presidents and and how they were able to rise to the occasion we talked about Lincoln and Teddy Roosevelt and ah doors let's look it FDR and Lyndon B or Lyndon Baines Johnson there were similar right you'd be able to use political power to get what they want it they were cutting deals correct\nAbsolutely I mean deals are important I mean when Lyndon Johnson needed to get the civil rights bill through he had to get the Republicans to help break the filibuster so he sits down with the Republican minority leader Everett Dirksen\nAnd he promises everything you want in a bastard a ship you want to postmaster ship and Peoria you want me to come to Springfield he wants to be there but then you also understands the ducks and wants to be remembered by history as well\nSo we system ever it you come with me on this bill and you bring your Republicans to help break the southern democratic filibuster two hundred years from now school children will know only two names Abraham Lincoln and ... says how conduction resist that's the way on all different levels he's he's trying to persuade people\nTo what was the America that FDR took over\nWhen you think about it he was so worried in February of thirty three that the whole house of cards might collapse before he even got their people were taking their money out of the banks because the banks didn't have their deposits on hand to take care of people's savings as they were pulling them out\nThe banking system was collapsing for one out of four people had only had jobs and the jobs were for small numbers of wages and a few hours\nThere were people in the streets who are hungry there was a feeling that capitalism itself with at risk\nAnd when he came on what he had to give most importantly was contagious optimism it wasn't that he didn't agree knowledge in his inaugural you said only a foolish optimist would not denied the dark realities of the moment\nBut if we can come together as a people and if the government can help with the problems we have to have to help with jobs the private sector couldn't do it any more states ... even if it's make workshops you give people back a dignity until the economy gets going and then you have the longer kind of jobs that would be possible once the economy got going\nAnd he got them into the sea Sisi the civilian conservation corps a whole generation of young people would have been without jobs and they're working in the woods and they're learning camaraderie and they're learning\nCommon missions something I Wish we had today as well to W. PA a W PA and the ... W why all these wonderful initials he had but you know in fact the interesting thing is he had two different people working on jobs one must Harry Hopkins who like the small term make work jobs if it needed to be even if it's ... and you get the person to going across the street and coming back\nAnd then Harold Ickes the secretary interior wanted long jobs like dance in public works projects that would last and then come back to the economy and they began to fight in public and he didn't like that so we buy them on a cruise in the Panama Canal for three weeks so they could drink and fish together by that time their fight was undone and that's how you have to deal with those kinds of problems inside your government\nComing out of the depression and you are looming ahead as a World War so how are we going to afford to fight in this world let's stay out of the American public didn't want any part of it at the same time how do we stand up this economy\nAnd then a lot of pushback from conservatives who don't want the social programs correct correct as their instincts are social programs are gonna be hard to break up which we don't really and programs even today which is why we're seven hundred and eighty billion dollars over budget right now\nAre on the deficit so he was able to get through it now bringing me to the psyche of FDR where's this leadership come from\nYou know I think from the time he was young he was confident he was gifted with an optimistic temperament but I think he was the kind of person who experiment it through the new deal and then to even during the war\nYou try something if it doesn't work you say to yourself I have to find something else\nAnd the great thing he did during World War two as he realized that his relationship with the business community\nWas at odds obviously and he needed them to build the ships the tanks and planes and the weapon converted factories so he put up an olive branch to them he stopped to antitrust regulation he built their factories he gave them profits that they would already have\nAnd it was the most magnificent government business relationship in the history of our country three shifts today what they produced in planes and airplanes which we gave to lend lease all over the world\nIt was an extraordinary partnership I I Love thinking about that whole mobilization\nKeeping the country together and keeping the allies together and one of those allies is Joseph stone\nCracked and he saw only at the end of his life he began to see what was going to happen with stones you needed stolen early on Russia was essential for keeping the German forces out of Russia and so many Germans killed because of the Russians he\nNeeded Russia he thought to come into Japan if we were going to invade Japan we would lose a million people he wanted the UN and he needed Russia for that so he wasn't in the best of health when he made those decisions but I think he would have made them any way but then style and became a much more complicated character then\nLBJ comes out at one thing about um you mentioned before that he does do\nThose we don't do any deals anymore you know we don't really compromise and his wife just play this for a for a Ben Sasse Jeff Flake saying there's no ... there is no rewarding compromising these days was it a different American LBJ without a question\nYou know the congressmen senators you to stay in Washington they played poker together they weren't racing home to raise their money\nThey their wives knew each other their kids know each other I mean he could call on friendships that were true I mean they were real friendships but he also never stopped calling he'd call at six in the morning you'd call it new and even called the senator two am I Hope it in wake you up but I Need you on this deal\nAnd he promised them what they needed for their states but there was a larger goal in mind that could be civil rights a voting rights or Medicare or Medicaid\nUm he knew what he was doing the means to the end but it worked and they they got something out of it and so did he instead of the\nCountry to if I was sitting there and and I want to teach leadership to my uh twelfth grade football team or a my son or daughter well can I take from FDR\nI think you could take that what a leader has to do is to have a bond with the people that he's talking with he\nKept up conversations in those fireside chats he knew as long as he explained the problems to the people\nAnd he told them why he was doing what he was doing they would then come along with him so he kept talking he kept listening I think having that communication with whoever you're trying to lead no way of going and then be able to explain to the people why they should go there with you\nAnd then yeah there'll be J who was a leader a lot of people are but he also we cut deals the ends justify the means right\nYes and he would say what convinces his conviction in the end he knew what he wanted to do but in order to get there he had to do a lot of things to make it possible and that's what Congress used to be about why not just share some of the largest of what's happening in the cities in the states in the country is with with a nation\nOf Donald Trump shocked the world no doubt what advice would you give him now two years in two years left maybe six\nI think one of the things that would be to get out of Washington more I mean Teddy Roosevelt went on a train for six weeks every spring and fall so he could visit people in local areas here their complaints listened to them\nAnd learn from them teddy said the worry for America and I still worry today is if people in different regions sections um parties religions begin to see each other as the other I mean that's partly what you were talking about before\nAnd the way to do that is to just go and see as many of those people as you can even if they haven't voted for you to expand your base\nAnd under a minute does the big worry the Thirteen colonies that they wanted you to stay in their own states they have to be convinced they had to ... were stronger together\nAnd that's why all George Washington one around the country to to be able to visit the different states to make them feel part of our whole we've lost that sense of common duties and common interest in the country and we have to reap pain that sense of citizenship people in the military have it when they come back they've had a common mission they care about that that goes across race party any kind of lines\nWe have to make our own people feel that again that's what leadership needs\nTo do some type of services ... or so for national service I Am so I think it's the most my one of my sons served in Iraq and Afghanistan and he's now a huge proponent of national service should come out of high school maybe go to a different part of the country\nAnd you're living with a host family and you're working on some common mission you're going to feel differently about these other people and yourself in the country and I'm a huge proponent of your son's mother's stores have anger you\n\nTake one Adam of

killed and dismembered the writer an allegation the Saudis call baseless right now secretary of state Mike Pompeo is on his way to Saudi Arabia to speak to the king about the disappearance\nWhen he went back to turkey to Saudi embassy and it looks like he got killed twelve days ago Thirteen Days now is a fiance was waiting for him to have lunch he never came out to be divorced and they can move forward it's not going to happen so President Trump yesterday talked about talking to the king about this one\nWe are only believe nothing on top of that being said became friendly denied any knowledge of it\nHe didn't really know maybe I don't want to get his mind but\nIt sounded to me like maybe they should have been\nWere going to try getting to the bottom of it but it is was a flat denial\nWell that's going to work the king is really not into these are into the policies probably would not know any details of this the crown prince who's not been reached there's got to be some type of there's got to be some type of hell to pay\nNow the president says I'm not going to put our business in trouble with Raytheon Boeing and the other defense contractors who got a hundred billion dollar deal\nI don't want to hurt American business to send them a message but he might not have a choice which was grandma last hour he says the only way we still dealing with Saudi Arabia is if the crown prince resigns that he feels actually taken advantage of because he went to bat for this guy in order to get arms sales through as a counterweight\nTo the rise of around in the region\nDaniel Hoffman says so he was a former\nIt's a station chief in Iraq in Russia cuts seven\nI think before we start to speculate about measures we might take in the policy well it's a good idea for us to collect the fact that's why I think we should all be pleased that the secretary Pompeo is going to be on the ground in Riyadh and then in Turkey after that\nI just don't understand why they think they get away with it it just blows me away I mean they have a good situation with the president that really likes them they chose that is the first Middle East country to visit the Jerry ... set up a relationship with the thirty three year olds who by the way it went to Syracuse University\nThis guy understands America how does he think he can get away with that invested a Robert Jordan's know

now feels ... Saturday expert and now it didn't take long for people who say well the president is being cut a week on Saudi Arabia and of course Nancy Pelosi\nSees a problem with that and of course is because Donald Trump is compromise could\nPressure not for you spend on just after the ... still has that ... blocks trying to get that cleared but in the meantime delays or all the way back to obey the for about sixteen minutes can exit and orange blossom trail take that as your alternate I'm at ...

Miller waiting yesterday cut six\nI think they're waiting to see whether or not we'll story has legs is whether or not anyone in Washington coriander any capital in the world believe starring folk and Saudi Arabia\nOfficial is concerned about the relationship are both trying to find a way out of weddings and patently series diplomatic embarrassment and that's something that could lead to a severe staying in one of our most important in our household warfare searching for like ...\nAnd now is there a plausible explanation that their results in oh now I understand [laughter]\nSo you know what the Saudis are working on is we want to join ... they're inching toward we wanted to talk to him\nAnd perhaps the interview got a little bit out of hand uh and he died and you know as you mentioned earlier the Turks say that they have information that says that he was killed there and of course the Turks are not exactly our most reliable ally certainly not in recent years under aired on who's something of an authoritarian himself\nUm this is so we can't take them at their word necessarily we probably will never get to a point where the where both sides agree on the events that transpired the question really is this and I think the the framing here has been pretty substantially unfair for the United states the question is what the United States is going to do\nThe question is what are the Saudis going to do the Saudis are substantially a client state to the United states um the Saudis depend on us in really profound ways now they make us keep our troops offshore they want our troops or they want our navy a doctor off of Bahrain\nOr not there they don't want us troops wearing American insignia when they're in Saturday but they depend on us and they are our client and they depend on us and western oil purchases to keep their an authoritarian autocracy afloat\nSo the question really ought to be you have a client state that is obviously misbehaved what are they willing to do it's not as much about what they're willing to admit they can come up with whatever ... story as long as in the end we killed this guy or whether it was by accident or intent\nAnd here's what happens next and that's up to them and we can't really ... it it would be it would be not only unwise but it would be it would be imprudent for us to get out in front and say this is what we're going to do instead to say okay you tell us what you're going to do it's like when you tell your kids what punishment do you think you deserve\nFor what you did I have free range kids I don't give them any instruction\nDirects the politics or that said you just give 'em fifty bucks turn 'em loose guy\nYeah and a quick real quick Chris we talked to sent Lindsey Graham earlier and he says he's been one of the the biggest supporters of Saudi Arabia I talked to Bob Corker last week also he says the same thing he's the reason they got these arms sales approve this has been pushed back on this here's what he told us a half hour ago how\nDo I engage Saudi Arabia when NBS they defected leader of the country is this brazen district disrespectful for the international norms that we fight for he is toxic there's no way we can move forward or I don't I Would suspend arms sales as long as he's in charge\nThat's that's huge and the president it is very made it clear he's very reluctant to do that is very reluctant\nTo do it because if you remember the orbit\nOr when Trump played his hands on the glowing or with the gas leaders in the new whatever terrorism response center whatever they call it um traumas Trump and pushing or have a big bet on M. B.

are about three years and uh but you know I've written to more book earlier books about the revolution I realized just yesterday that I've been now writing about the revolution for eight years would you as long as the revolution itself a fantastic but Yorktown we don't know a lot about that we know the war ended there we don't know how it ended their\nThe roll with the French and the role of the navy absolutely you know most people think Yorktown was the capstone of inevitable victory but it was anything but the last year\nGoing into Yorktown everything was in the balance\nWhat Washington New and this is a real brilliance Washington he realized the only way you could deliver the blow that one this thing because if you had this system to the French Navy he had to establish naval superiority and so he was trying to do that desperately and finally\nOn September ... Seventeen eighty one the French Navy had sailed into the Chesapeake and met or the British for the victory that made Yorktown possible and so they say five that no American ships were there no American ... I mean this is the thing it doesn't really fit in the storyline most of us want for the American revolution you know we want this to be something we won on our own\nBut the fact matter is we were just in terrible shape there were five thousand French soldiers that joined Washington's army along with a number of another three thousand that came up from the Caribbean\nAnd without the French Navy we wouldn't have done it and there was not a single American ship participate and they say without ballot Saratoga proven that we could win the French wouldn't have thought this is even worth their time right right and you know the French had their own agenda they wanted to help America to to uh to defeat Britain you know I'm defeating Britain was their main priority which wasn't\nAnd and so helping America wasn't always what they were doing it because they were fighting down the Caribbean and against against the British But so it was Washington's job to try to channel them or in a direction that would finally and this for America so set up this age of Cornwall is is is down south Cornwall is has been down south\nIt's been kind of a rogue he he's gotten very aggressive and the south and fights\nNathaniel green the great fighting Quaker from Rhode Island one of our great American generals the battle of guilt for court house of\nCornwall is technically wins but his army is is beat and ah so he he retreats to Wilmington North Carolina but says you know I'm not going to go back to Charleston I'm going to go into Virginia and stay on\nThe offensive and so he goes up there and ends up uh at Yorktown at the end of the peninsula between the James in New York river\nBuilding a naval base which is what the British want in the Chesapeake uh and he's in the midst of that when suddenly\nAdmiral deGrasse sales up from the Caribbean with a a fleet of twenty eight shipped to the line these are huge battleships arrives in the Chesapeake and suddenly Cornwall is realizes I'm surrounded and we'll just see have is an evil force\nHe doesn't he has a a few scattered forgets a as a ... assembled age of boats but nothing that can do any damage to this huge fleet\nHe's got an army of about seven thousand soldiers British and ... and what he should have done and and you know hindsight is everything you know what he should have done as soon as the the French Navy arrived get outta there he could have retreated into North Carolina they would not have been the great defeat and probably we'd all be speaking with British accents\nBut he uh oh\nHis superior officer or Henry Clinton in New York kept saying don't worry we're going to come down and help you and finally the British fleet did come down and under admiral Thomas Graves and on September fifth they had this battle and the entrance of the Chesapeake now up until this point the British almost always one [laughter]\nAh but for the first and that is so exaggeration but for the first that basically last time the French\nThe French one this time forcing graves to return to New York to repair it ships and just as that happens Washington and a French general roshin bowl arrive and begin the siege all the pieces fell into place it's all it's a miracle really", "show_name": "The Herman Cain Show", "year": "2018", "city": "Orlando", "day": "16"}
