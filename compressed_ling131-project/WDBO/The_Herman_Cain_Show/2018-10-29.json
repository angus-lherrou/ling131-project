Venezuela is that our obligation is that with Democrats want where are you going to mock dismissed the former president who by the way he's bucking old tradition and mocking the sitting president right after ... illegal definitely this is going to be\nYeah we're going to be an election that particularly in the house but it's going to be a battle and we'll see what happens but then both sides seem very very energized turnout or you know off the charts and I was going to exciting\nEight days and counting timid terms yes while the Senate showing promise for the UP some say Trump and company have already given up the house I totally disagree with that we look at the trends and the final tactics of the president's\nNumber one I'm not calling you a writer I bet they are the race to think about race is right there are cases where and Hitler in them I Believe that he and on their side and he pushed back hard enough to say so in Miami where\nThat is Jonathan Weissman who's claiming the prison the terrorizing in the shootings are really go back to the White House and the president yeah they say they the anti Semitic killer who hated President Trump\nWas really spurred the action by President Trump and that to me is the most horrific sets of aggravated and agitating comments that I can remember let's bring in Michael good window a Michael New York Post a in why post dot com as well as Fox News dot com or his latest\nOne talks about the midterms in both these incidents won't affect the result Michael welcome back on and Brian thank you\nA first officer anti Semitic the president would they would they daughter that converted with a son in law was tremendous power influence had his right hand for the last two years who is the best friend Benjamin Netanyahu move the embassy in Israel to the Capitol really\nYeah look I think this is a huge stretch a for those on the left to blame President Trump for what happened in Pittsburgh\nI mean as I say in my column the this is this is now the politicization of everything in America that no crime no matter how heinous is a is to aim is to exploit and I think that's what we're witnessing here I mean the\nThe anti Semitism that valor 's the shooter expressed is is is as old as mankind nearly and so to say that somehow the president is a responsible for that I mean that's that's a total distortion and I think it it really does show that the\nThe the hatred for President Trump knows no limits I mean this is\nThis is a sorry moment in America this is a horrible tragedy that speaks to a a deep seated evil\nAnd to try to politicize are to blame the president for it I I think just shows how far are politics have strayed from the original purpose I mean this has nothing to do with anything anybody said this is like saying the guy has leprosy it's somebody's fault I mean this is insane talk\nYou don't think either a van to the the fake bombs mailed to Trump painters or and or or disagree years and this incident using is going to affect them in terms why\nWell look I I think it could I mean I ... the headline is you know goes a little further than I Would prefer but I think that the odds are\nThat it will not reshape the mid term set the terms are on a trajectory right uh I mean I think Kavanaugh was a very Kavanaugh's confirmation was a very very big thing I think it it galvanized the Republicans and Democrats were galvanized\nA on November ... November of twenty six came they've been waiting for this moment for more than two years now a ... I think the Republicans were lacking and enthusiasm even though there's there Ninety percent support for Trump\nThere wasn't a lot of enthusiasm things were going okay you're you're not full of hatred you're not full of anger so therefore you're less likely to vote\nBut I think that the Kavanaugh situation\nGalvanized Republicans in the same way it was a sense of threat the sense that they are being attacked ... and that they must respond by voting um I think the caravan is doing something similar I mean President Obama not withstanding those pictures are not a figment of our imagination\nFor security we're\nStill following this crush on foreign westbound alec Mary boulevard Old West bound lanes are shut down ... marrying your horse to exit at that point with delays back to for Seventeen you can take for Seventeen\nOr Seventeen Ninety two as alternate but you can get on to ... found from lake married boulevard those on ramps are open I'm touring Ninety six twenty five to ... this is Ninety six point five ...\nGo let me tell you something if you remember the whole controversy with separating a women are the families in their kids or the or the people perceived to be kids if you knew the outrage we was the election moved in this has been an obsession of the president to somehow get immigration reform and cracked\nDown on a boat or is this is election day folks the caravan was not put forward by the White House to alert people to illegal immigration or a border and no one's afraid we just care about our country and border security the president former president acting like that\nIs beneath him and also as an insult to us who act as if we're too timid to attack\nHim pub and we're concerned about impoverished people are concerned about impoverished people there is a method to get in here and they are just obliterated it what is wrong with him\nAnd I I agree with your shut down one thing I don't think it's beneath for October I don't know\nI think that as Hoover arc Obama is that's who he has always been a ... his great skill was to pretend to be somebody else a\nA during campaigns but what you see there is is there real or rock Obama and and don't forget a lot of the the aim on the left has been to de legitimize Donald Trump's election\nAnd so this is a pattern that oh it's all bamboozled it's all ...\nUp so none of it's real right it's really just Russia that's all the trailers Russia\nUm so I I think that this is sort of thing Brock Obama I think will energize the Republican voters probably more than Donald Trump will\nBecause Obama is basically telling you don't believe what you see believe me I'm and I think he he did that with Obama Care\nYou know doctors they they would rather cut off your legs and give you an aspirin because they make more money that way you can keep your doctor I mean the nonsense the Iran deal was not what we said it was it was not ran some ... billion and a half that was not ransom ... of course it was\nSo Brock Obama is is a stranger to the truth when it comes to these politics\nI mean and so he talks about Obamacare and he said well this guy just slice he knows he knows very well we didn't get the whole deal in Iran he knows the money that we had to the checks we had the rights of the Paris accord he also said we're going to reinforce the red line\nHe also sees you keep your plan you can keep your doctor both things are true and save your money so because he's got so much charisma and presidents and he has more of a professor eel delivery we're supposed to believe him more than President Trump does he know that that he's got all these skeleton in his closet\nWell look I think he's counting on the same uh\nCheerleading from the media that he that buffet at him for eight years while he was rarely held to account by the media for any of this but look at their results the American people saw through it to the American people rejected\nObama's party they rejected more than that they're rejected Obama is that why Donald Trump was elected because of the failures and the lives of the Obama administration because Hillary Clinton [noise]\nBecause of our own character flaws but also because she she promised to double down on everything Obama did\nI mean that I think was the horrifying moment and when you didn't agree with her when you didn't support her you were deplorable your ear redeem mobile you were hardly American\nThat I think is the tone that elected Donald Trump and so when Obama goes back to that when Hillary Clinton is out there now when Chuck Schumer and Nancy Pelosi when they want you to believe\nThat Donald Trump is evil that he's illegitimate that the caravan is not real it's made up I don't know I see those pictures everywhere they don't look like made up pictures to me that does like real people\nThe last year if you're home was built before Nineteen Seventy five I have an important message you need to hear homes built before
