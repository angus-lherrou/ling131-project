about well sadly that won't be an option because of climate change\nThan today reports on a study that says global warming could threaten the world fear supply researchers friends in the Irvine and other institutions and the production of barley in black granite drop her factually droughts and extreme heat Farley as a can grant and their that means average beer prices get this\nDouble a man that price so hard to get people to care about climate change because they didn't tell Americans in ten years the Marshall Islands it'll be underwater no one has a tell them corona will cost more now they're marching in a free\nRide a that's a bad thought I did read that last week goes on our more to know section I did not bring that up but you know the climate change is a big thing that hurricane or Michael slams and just cars up most of Florida ports of Georgia and then people say well they're related and the presidents of getting a series of questions like that on sixty minutes which by the way it was extremely highly rated\nI think the president's getting an advantage up right now because he wants to talk about immigration and for the Republican perspective he thinks it motivates his base\nAnd right now there is a caravan heading up from Guatemala\nActually as emanates from Honduras through Guatemala El Salvador the president's won all three countries as well as Mexico stop these this three thousand person caravan before it gets to our border because we saw the chaos it started last time it should be hitting maybe it's just coincidence around election day\nSo how'd you get sixty five million dollars automatically get sixty nine million dollars\nJust from us we random checks that is in jeopardy unless you stop people from coming here now for me personally I see these people that I see their families and I feel bad for him because\nThey obviously don't have a choice however there will be great if we could work with these countries to make their nation's better and we go through our process of admitting people whether they're refugees are not because we're jamming the floodgates overwhelming border security\nComing up with lines to get you a asylum or getting ankle bracelets and never coming back for court\nThat is not working out for us we use the word is its virtual catch and release and it's very troubling to the border patrol and they in fact\nAnd their stories happening right now we're able to monitor these thousands coming up here they say this is by a lawmaker who's no longer lawmaker but the department of homeland security Katie Waldman said that she's spokesperson on Monday the current caravan is quote what we see day in and day out at the border as\nYour soul to the well advertised in well known catch and release loopholes so catcher leaves vilified by the president the president's been unable to change it because it's politically it's been a time bomb remember catcher relief separate families didn't go well now\nThey're saying this the catcher released will be converted to twenty days we will hold you with your kid or kids you got to show that it's yours\n... son or daughter number two then you gotta have a choice of twenty days they could say and be jet set up to a relative and you can go or you can stay together and you both go that is I think the plan that they're going to be an acting but they will not an act yet\nBecause I think they sense that there's a chance that could flip on him and be played wrongly Thomas Homan our Fox contributor on with Laura last night cut sixteen\nSo I think more important thing we need to educate American people on despite not controlling our borders by not controlling this caravan because of the caravan comes across I shouldn't have fun to write because all the loopholes that kind of effects are going to be released was more of a calm but at the money we're bankrolling the very criminal organizations\nThat smuggling these people are the same smuggle our shame organizations that smaller drug smuggling guns don't kill more of a choice it's\nSo it's a there's a there's gangs there's people would generally say they have no choice they have to run they wanted something better for the kids regardless it doesn't matter every country uh worth its salt has control over their borders Mark Krikorian Center for Immigration Studies cut twenty\nWhat's the point being a superpower if you can't\nTry to get a tiny little country in your backyard to\nDo what you want and honestly the most important target of this kind of pressure is actually not Central American countries it's Mexico because they're all passing through Mexico\nMexico was a much more functional state it's wealthier its government works better which is why Mexico really is responding I think to the pressure because I just saw um on the way over here\nThey're sending large numbers of federal police federal ... down to Mexico southern Mexico to stop these people aren't getting over

I've never been polled why why are these polls work you know and they feel that they felt disillusioned some some happy to be disillusioned some unhappy about\nWhat happened and twenty sixteen what do you tell them\nOh absolutely and I get that and what what I told them is look even if you've never been polled we have talked to somebody like you and people say oh wait there's nobody like may right um you know what that is true okay everybody's special in that regard but look if you were a Republican let's say the Amish forty million people like you in that regard and\nThere's different types of Republicans of course there's man there's women we talked to somebody who would essentially answer the questions at the same way you would\nAnd so we put together we put together as a microcosm of the country but it's hard work when I talked about how we do that in the book it's not easy but that said you know we do think these work having said that\nLook there's a margin of error around it and there are there are still scenarios there's still things that could change I even talked about this uh like mentioned the other day on stage we were looking at what happens this year we're looking\nBut what happens in twenty sixteen they're twenty Eighteen in these midterms\nAnd I said okay so we've got one estimate that has to say the Democrats at two hundred and twenty six seats over the the two hundred and Eighteen\nBut what happens if all of these folks who tell us in the polls\nThat they're showing up for the first time in a midterm don't show up right and they haven't voted before so we can take them at their word and we do we put them in the polls but if they hadn't done it before well what what happens if this time around they say yeah yeah it's going to be like last time and not going to show up something gets in the way they mean to do it but\nThey're they're busy if they don't show up then the Democrat number drops and drops ... under a majority and the Republicans hold the house so\nMight lead to the show though this will sort of the better for the party in power just Republicans in particular\nIt looks right now better for the Republicans in particular if it's a low turnout election that's what our model showed\nAnd and the idea behind that was not to just to tell what might happen in ... but your question about what do we make these polls shattered pollster give you these scenarios given people terms right so that's one way on trying to approach things a little bit differently than than twenty sixty\nI Want you to your ... said on Sunday which changed its Labor Day and see if you were on board she's with the New York times co twelve\nAnd then the drain among some a democratic strategist as recently as three weeks ago that they were going to be able to take back the Senate even by one the\nI got an email from a democratic strategist who I trust the other day saying is obviously what I said several weeks ago doesn't hold a Heidi Heitkamp in North Dakota absolutely they this is not a favorable now what you have seen with Kavanaugh's it's got an opposite direction in terms of solidifying the Republican base in terms of\nThe Senate like in these districts in the house there are too many retirements I think for Republicans to overcome it\nI think the way these districts are carved up I also think we haven't talked about one important issue in terms of democratic voters which the gender gap so can I take that that'll\nTake that one by one first off a did things change since Kevin\nI'm a little bit yeah and I think that's generally right I think the Republicans at this point are favored to hold the Senate and the mechanism not willing to say that it's likely [noise]\nUm I don't go away with weeks to go I mean here's another thing about you mentioned twenty sixteen right let's let's look at the range of possibilities here I'm not going to say that it's likely but at this point okay what's happened since Kavanaugh is\nThat these red states these Republican states Tennessee Texas had empty Texas um you know you got you well you know you've got to Arizona Nevada the Democrats are trying to flip but\nNorth Dakota Montana Missouri all these places the predominant most of them voted of course for President Trump at the time\nThe election has nationalized to a large degree and the president wants to well I think he I I don't know what he wants what I thought he was well we'll talk about that in a second 'cause he's he's a major factor especially in the house but you know speaking of the Senate look you've got now by two to one people telling us that they are voting on national issues\nAs opposed to local one interesting so you never you know that'll all politics is local post I Am not so much this year\nSo got this question for you spend on your world drive with ... locked delays almost back to us twenty seven for Fifteen minutes exit add twenty seven takes on north bound to one Ninety to an east bound eyes for to avoid all the ... there was Ninety six point five W W [noise] this is six point five ...\n... we also had a had bought burn up in ah in Tennessee and we pulled there a couple of weeks ago and how much are we had eight or some other places that had like you said six I've seen double digits I've seen another one\nJust out that has the march and a little bit smaller but it's a consistent pattern of her being up there\nBut again that's ... you know I I I haven't measured yet the Taylor Swift endorsement effect will so we'll see you know at that as anything you know to do it got to a different set of social media um you know we'll see if if registration or people you know get turned on her activated because of that but\nHaving said all of that you know we've got a case here again nationalized election I mean the the British and cases that is a perfect example of where the Democrats might have wanted to make it about state issues about local issues as long as it's nationalized attracts a ...\nA ... and he's here and he's a the name of his book is where did you get this number the outstanding poster with CBS is bringing us inside the numbers\nMaggie room as your other statement that she made is this your gender gap so what did you find on the gender gap we know that Hillary Clinton won the female vote but didn't win the white females hotel where they think it was fifty three percent went to Trump where we are now\nOh there is certainly a gender gap and you know you've got a you know Nineteen points on the difference between a how men are voting men are voting Republican women voting voting for Democrats but there's there's something a here's what's underneath that and this is in these competitive house districts\nWhat's happened is there's ... there's a lot of women a lot of black voters generally we think it's about a third of everybody\nWho said that the economy is good now typically that would favor the party in power right the economy's good therefore the direction of good and I think just\nCame out we were the most competitive country in the world for the first time since two thousand eight you would think that that that could be just paved pays you wait till the election\nAnd and you know one would suspect that would be the way and I've seen interviews now uh with with a number of Republican officials that that's the way some of them had wanted to run in and argue the case in the veterans but um these folks have the same time they say the economy is good and there's like I said there's a lot of a lot of women in this group\nThey say they do not like the direction of the country\nAnd those two things are sometimes correlated but they're not for these folks\nThey they don't like the direction of the country you unpack that a little bit\nAnd frankly they do not like the way the the president is handling his job they give him a very\nLow approval rating that's part of what do they see it as a result he's number at forty one um it's in the ... it's in the low forties and it has been I mean look we I think we've talked about this before it's one of the more stable is the most stable approval ratings we've said he wouldn't belief I yeah you know it it doesn't move that's a function of partisanship too but the point here is\nIf if the president is a factor for these folks and and he certainly is and they don't like the direction of the country they're breaking Democrats for that reason despite the fact\nThat they say the economy is good and that's one of the things that's under pending that gender Capra\nEyes so when you were on Sunday you said something about where the houses trending you said since this summer what has happened\nSince the summer that our Model S had it creeping slowly but towards the Democrats so there's this two twenty six I I told you about earlier it's a little over the two Eighteen you know we had a just a cedar so over the majority line earlier in the summer not a dramatic swing but it's it it is one\nBut that's why I I also want to emphasize there's there's a couple of things going on one is that turn out one is the fact that you know one in five of these voters say they haven't voted before you take them out of the equation the Democrats do not do as well Republicans do better\nBut you know the the other part of this is that difference between the house and the Senate and part of the reason for that is that these districts are the kind of suburban and a little more affluent they're the kind of voters where there might be a little more swing and that's why we're that's why we're watching them so close\nI Want to talk about national trends and talk about the Senate so you see it's spreading out right now if uh after you believe the election was this afternoon you believe that house goes to Democrats\nWell that's what the model says but it's a but like I said I really want to emphasize that turnout point and and that is a big variable here or that and the difference of that's why if the you know if it were today yes yes and if we are today we've got the Dems at two twenty six\nBut having said that a lot of these racist why these individual races are really close I mean I Would not be surprised if each of these comes down to a few thousand votes going to have my hands full on election\nWhen guys like you were saying all these these are electric had Hillary Clinton up a too close to call I said why don't you think you could go the other way up see if she they're telling you it's too close to call\nJust because somebody's up by one or two boys who doesn't mean it's going to go their direction and ended up going ah Trump's direction and a lot of those states Michigan or Wisconsin where

justice Kevin or the way he was treated [noise] isn't a standing human being an outstanding man of great accomplishment\nAnd the way those Democrat as senators treated him was horrible it was a disgrace to our country and I'll tell you what since we've been energized anyway but we're more energized since justice capital\nOr there's any question about that book is going to be enough because

everybody every journalist in New York and Washington thanks oh you've got to have Trump Trump is terrible but in reality they're making so many people wealthy in this country that he's got a lot of converts because of that\nSo you know what it takes to a movie you need investors and to do that that extra money by definition go out and I'll pay into music or take a take a risk on a movie because I have extra money you don't usually make your living on movies so to speak so you're going outside to get those funds\nAnd now you see more movies being made you see the salaries going up so you see Los Angeles Hollywood or wherever they decided to film sometimes in Canada maybe less\nThey are feeling the effects of a booming economy\nThat has you know he was going to feel the effects Albuquerque
