I I really I really don't first of all a Yemen on Saudi Arabia's doorstep Yemen is a tiny country with a different religious or a belief and and training and orientation then the Saudis\nIt's a desert where Saudi Arabia and Yemen made is that nobody lives there is a Yemen is not going to invade Saudi Arabia that who treat rebels are no strategic threat to the Saudis Saudi Arabia wants a Gemini there they want the you know they are petrified of the Iranians I give you that\nYeah there there it would be a Ronnie and base to be around ... experience Lewinsky\nIran doesn't need the Yemen Iran already is strategically located in the center of the of the middle East that has a much more favored location it doesn't need a satellite in Yemen what Iran is trying to do in my view is to protect the non Sunni Muslims who live in some of these other countries\nDo you mean out of benevolence the heart\nI think it's I I don't listen I think that I wanted my bottom line is this Iran\nIs Persia Persian is an ancient ancient empire with real culture when you see the Persians that live in the United states like this opens up a Sunset Boulevard they they want to be rich they want to be\n...

I I met Rowhani when he came to the general assembly a ... not this year the year before\nAnd I you know I hung out with a for a little bit interviewed him or you know I I\nHe's not crazy like the Ayatollah Khomeini and those other the the the ayatollah who took hostages back in the Seventy nine was it in the Carter administration I you know I I think that that there is a deal to be made with\nWith Persia slash Iran I we're getting off into a geopolitical yeah it's pretty complicated but I just think that America's by stereotyping Saudi isn't good in Iran as bad as missing\nThe boat okay I Want you to be on ... on something I think if we can agree on millennia Trump good great person who's got the president back here she is opening up a B.

I think Texas is a fascinating Senate race ... made a really interesting strategic choice early in this campaign which was that he's not going to worry about moderate she's not going to try to win over conservative voters in Texas\nHe's just going to try to drive unprecedented liberal turnout democratic turnout in the state is running a very liberal campaign as Karl just hadn't act in that gift big crowds gets big crowds he's raising unbelievable amounts of money\nThe problem is that there's a lot more Republicans then there's Democrats and the state and so like I think he's gonna he's gonna do well he's gonna he's gonna have probably a record number of votes for himself in Texas\nHowever Ted Cruz's finding that the Republican base is coming home he's got Donald Trump coming to to rally the base and even if if Cruz just gets average Republican turnout he's going to win that race regardless of what better does at this point\nHe wants to run for president can you lose a Senate race in run for president\nI don't I don't I actually tried it thought\nIt was gonna come out of this was probably the best fundraising list in the country just given how much enthusiasm you generate down the liberal side of the belt but again I don't know what the cases if you can't win in taxes statewide you're going to turn around and try to win and places like Iowa and Ohio Pennsylvania I I don't buy it\nSo now you know Florida well you there was Marco Rubio now you have a ... a you have a governor Nelson who's doing the Governor Scott look in the best doing the best he can\nIn a ... horrible hurricane just grind it up the whole Gulf Coast so he's their wares to St is congressman descent as I Know we just want to look back a deputy but at the same time she could be playing more overall\nRight yeah I mean look I it's hard to second guess from the outside these whenever I've worked on a lot of campaigns as you know Brian and whenever a natural disaster or some term disaster like this happens\nThe politics of it are really tricky you don't want to be seen as an opportunity to us so I I I don't want to second guess to San Francisco strategy I Will say I've friends working on that race and that those numbers the Santa's Gillum numbers have closed dramatically in the last week or so I think because people are discovering that go on the the mayor of Tennessee who's a democratic nominee\nIs it you know ... to Tallahassee ... thank you\nHe's a socialist and and Florida is not about to elect a socialist governor I I think if some if it wants to once we get through the storm I think the sand is just needs to focus on drilling down that message making sure that voters in Florida understand Gillum understand what he would do if he were elected governor and the base will come home and I feel pretty good about Marco\nRubio and Ted Cruz into Donald Trump won added barely and personally but yet I see Marco Rubio's Rubio is one of the first to be invited to the White House how is the relationship that the president they\nThey have a very good working relationship but we're talking just a moment ago off air\nMarco and the and and and Trump and the Trump team worked very well together especially on issues like the western hemisphere Cuba Venezuela market was really taken a leadership role\nI think obviously with the hurricane now the ... Marco was visiting with FEMA the Trump team making sure that the federal government is doing everything it can to assist in Florida Florida voters\nI look I think Marco as I Know for a fact of Marcos excited that there's a Republican in the White House and he likes Donald Trump personally they they they get along fine now after the after the some of the unpleasant campaign yeah but you know they've flown on\nThat they've gotten to know each other and and they work well together and market works very well with the\nPresident's Day is so interesting right to do if I talk to you and twenty sixteen after you say you will be what would you tell me well\nLook I'm Marco Marco Marco ... doesn't take all of a self any good politician doesn't take it all very personally and then at the end of the day when mark especially when you decide to run for reelection I knew he'd do what was best for Florida a but look losing as hard and um you know as as we are seeing with Hillary Clinton some people don't take it\nVery well absolutely but I Will say this I Do predict that Marco Rubio run for president will be successful I there's no question he's so young so talented and you are\nWay that are on a national campaign yeah uh I ... I Hope you're right I mean like I worked really hard I work for for over five years I think he's just a tremendously talented you and your biases I'm a little biased I mean yeah I've got me in\nFor president Rubio someday looking for those that he's the man in the middle and out numbered at noon\nOut there and we don't watch the news they want someone to try our job is to cut through the talking points of\nMartha mckell them we're going to ask the question because there's a lot of conventional\nWisdom out there needs to be telling me when I'm making sure that whenever ... through the day people are fully informed from coast to coast were twenty four seven news\nGoing to be here let's we're going to be fair weather for am a midnight were there on June\n... real news real honest opinion what it is the stars\nAnd Britain Henry and we're excited to be a part of Fox Nation because now more than ever we need to avoid that\nWe need Fox Nation the new face and you don't want to know and the Fox news favorites you already love Latin\nMembers all the time they're going to be very PC hell no on the news more light than ... certified nation dot com and find out more\n[noise] maybe six point five double the baby with him or led by new sound windows loosened up\n'cause we agree station\nIs news Ninety six point by heavy in the mail or window turns first for breaking news\nGreen wall street in a green It's MORNING finally after two days of taking good morning eleven o'clock at news Ninety six twenty five WTO getting me up to date and informed on your friday and nice morning out their top story no\nChildren are hurt when in orange county school bus does nose first the new a backyard pool in pine hills we've had a reporter on scene all morning\nThe school bus driver claims he was coming down here on Russia would court with nine special needs students had her for the magnolia at school when a car coming in the opposite direction swerve to avoid a dead cat and they crashed the bus lost control plowing through a fence and going head first into a backyard pool but the driver says the opposite that everything\nRight so that will be one good thing and I know the vice president states who's also led the charge on that so we have personal sanctions against the style on certain people in Turkey so we'll see where that goes\nBut I don't get why Saudi Arabia if these reports and their widespread and there are details are true and they actually killed his Washington Post columnist why they think they could get away with it and it's not and why would it be worst damage you relations with the world's number one economic and military superpower\n[noise] yeah and that's one of the questions you have to ask because one of the report was a thought maybe that this was they were going to get him and detain them and take him back in eighty it went wrong\nOr maybe they're going to refer him up and it went wrong we just don't know I there is a lot of unknown at this point and there are some people who say wait a minute it and think about this turkey as I said over the last couple of years have been more anti western a lot of friction with the U.S\nVery hostile um Saudi Arabia has been you know helping us and in the region and there's been a good us Saudi relationship still it does seem like something that would be so explosive and unhelpful on\nMany many levels that it doesn't make sense maybe there's something that went wrong or maybe I think it was that you played center Corker it might have been or make another one that talked about this arrogance is sort of developed with and that they made me feel like I'm under this new leadership that day can push the boundaries of what's going to be accepted by the international community\nI don't want to tell you had a book to show but uh maybe sooner Corker was the best interview of the last two months he's so honest anyway let alone a guy who's about to put a hold on his political career for now\nAnd he was denying that he was a huge supporter of Saudi Arabia made sure they got their arms and now a this is devastating now before we jump to conclusions and say this is done no how Turkey's been acting over the last couple of years Daniel Hofmann took that into account and said this about this entire incident cut twenty four\nThere's roughly a dozen a U.S citizen is being held in Turkey we don't have any hard evidence here but the timing does look awfully awfully interesting and maybe not so coincidental that at the same time as we have this\nIncident with a ... and the ah Saudi conflict is on both the same time the Turks appear to be wanting to warn their relationship with the United states which has been suffering over the past couple of years\n[noise] so he sees you know he he wasn't born yesterday he's got an intelligence background from Iraq to Russia and he says wait a second before you jump to conclusions as did the president and the prison is getting some blowback he's used to it for\nBeing slow to go after Saudi Arabia mhm caving in Reno\nWell and you know I Know that you guys talk to him yesterday and the night before I had him on and asked about\nUm the the arms deal because\nThere is absolute agreement on Capitol Hill the Senate is going to shut down for the arms sales is is they're conclusive evidence that lead them to believe the Saudis were responsible for the parents are ... so\nYou know the president was very hesitant on that\nSaying well you know that I mean it's we're talking about billions of dollars and he says they're just going to go buy it from Russia and it it impacts American companies that are manufacturing arms so that's very much a a business standpoint an economic point but I think there are times when the U.S got\nTo stand up on moral grounds and they're ready to do it on Capitol Hill will see the president will come around to their way of thinking that\nYeah I guess so uh a couple of things are happening right now number one I didn't think it was I found it heartening that Michelle Obama's saw her family friend attorney general\nAttorney general Eric Holder come out and say when you go Hi Michelle says go on when they go low you go high and he says no you you kick him and she still was not happy with that and she was on the today show promoting her book and she called the golden to task I was kinda I was heartened by this I Want you to hear Michelle Obama\nThink about how you want your kids to be raised how you want them to think about life in their opportunities they want them afraid of their neighbors they want them angry they want them\nVengeful and she went on\nThere is is not a\nYou know we think of the values that we try to promote to our children savannah your mother right\nAt this point you have to think about what are the things you're selling your girl which model that you want them to live by\nSo I always hard by this she knows what's at stake with his midterms for the Democratic party which he would not cover Eric Holder's back\nYeah and I think that that's interesting once you're out of the White House you have a lot more freedom to say uh and do things that don't have necessarily toe the party line or or you know have everyone's back and he said I think it's very helpful and now a lot of people will feel like that happened then and I was in the ceiling over the last\nFew years I'm like you know\nWith a little bit of space I think out of the political world and being in the spotlight of being in the White House um maybe see things differently and you're thinking about your family and your kids and I applaud her for that\nI think it's great we need to have more people that are standing up saying yeah let's take a bath let's let's not talking about taking people are punching people learn anything that people on both sides of the bed I mean it's definitely time for a little cooling off period so bravo to her saying it right\nUh Shannon calling us went to the White House I don't know if you heard it makes it very comments let's listen together\nThose were saying before I got one question was do go to another question I\nI don't ask the questions that that was sound bites you pay the fine wine I have no\nThe minority [laughter]\n[laughter] that's a little of it got one\nBut on the liberals improve on it if he don't look good\nWe don't look good this is\nHe has to be a precious the flyers the fly explains the best factories and we have to make our poor ... and power we have to bring jobs into America because our\nIs entertainment of ideas but when we make everything uh China not America there were cheating on our country and we're putting people in positions that have to do illegal things they end up in a cheapest factory ever or the president though I'll tell you that was pretty impressive [laughter]\nSo I I mean I I Know what are you I was able to follow them but the criticism that he got afterwards blew me away should what about this reaction I'm sure you know to the same thing last night\nYeah I think it's so insulting that\nAnd I like you I went back and watch the whole thing with a transcript and I thought it was fascinating\nDo I agree or disagree with everything I mean you know I'm not saying you know ... acre president or anything but I'm saying I understood like you\nDid the threads of what he was talking about um about in trouble with an African American community his love and cried for the country they need to manufacture here I mean I got it but for people to immediately cut out of that say he's just gone crazy he's off his meds he's mentally ill without really\nTalking through and looking at the ideas that he expressed there was a lot of really interesting ballad stuff in there um but I think to immediately dismiss him by sitting by talking about his mental health um I find very insulting to him honestly\nAnd I was just brought up yesterday that okay let's say he does have a he's bipolar or he's got ADD or a asthmatic depression whatever it is\nHere's a long line of or suggest for people that suffer from some of the same things I mean if you look ... Abraham Lincoln I think he was pretty successful he was a manic depressive reportedly\nUs Mike Wallace maybe the finest newsman outside Chris Wallace ever where he was he said I suffer from a bad bouts of depression or I was like three or four NFL players who have come out and said I'm bipolar and I'm taking medication for it I Want to spread the word about it and people should be\nHesitant now now that we know what we know to criticize anyone for that but for some reason no one has any problem criticizing him and I don't see any blowback on it listening to I thought Don Lemon who are like one way over the line and saying this cut Thirteen\nThis was an embarrassment cognac mother is rolling over in her grave I spoke to one of her friends to their texture with one of her friends today from Chicago Don different used to live there I Know she's gone to ... be\n... be embarrassed by this need someone to help them and the guy them I mean he's a hug more than anything calling you back away from the cameras go get some help\n[noise] wow are you kidding yeah I\nMean that's that's completely dismissive and again you don't hear them\nTalking about the ideas that things that he talked about with ways to turn around Chicago talking about guns talking about manufacturing talking about American industry tax cuts I mean he talked about\nSolid policy issues nominees offering a ton of solutions but throwing things out there that need to discuss I didn't hear these guys and I would have ... you know I Can't watch every channel at one time and maybe there was some discussion but I heard the discussion of the policy points to he put out and said hey these are things I'm grateful\nThat I can come here and whoever the president as I can come talk to them adopted and things that may be actually helpful to immediately say his mother would be rolling around in her grave and that he's mentally ill I mean that's just to me it was just so insulting to him and he talked about the fact\nThat he believes the positions that he's worked with a misdiagnosis ten am bipolar that's between him and his position but to go there and not talk about any of the substance of which he said just disrespectful\nMe absolutely and in my family my grandmother had severe depression and they what they used to do they used to give their they used to give shock treatments right and and uh and we just wiper out for like two months and then she would come back and they actually said well this works but nobody could tell anybody about that they do now in when I was\nYounger they said whatever you do you don't tell anybody that and now that certainly changed so the good news is we start with great news we in with a pastor Brunson will be fine to Germany tonight ... for the medical examiner and flying back to the United states a shot at anybody want a promo for tonight\n[noise]\nThis is news maybe six point ... happy and they were on land turns worse for breaking news\nWhat else is new to the news ... eleven thirty at news Ninety six point five WD our top story broke during the eight an hour and we've been on the scene in no children are hurt when their school bus veers off the road right into a backyard pool knows first and there's a disagreement about how exactly got there is what we've learned from the scene and pine hills\nWell there are two story to this the first one is that a woman driving down here on Russia would courts to avoid a dead kitty in the road and collided with a school bus filled with special needs kids\nBut the driver says it was the last I was trying to avoid a car parked on the shoulder and sworn into her lane either way the bus lost control crashed into a fence and took a nosedive right know backyard swimming pool this guy heard it over
