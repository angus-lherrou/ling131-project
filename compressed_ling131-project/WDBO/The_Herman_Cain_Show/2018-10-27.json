talking about a well you know it's a nice weather this morning nice cool weather I should say you're in a gorgeous Saturday tomorrow it's going to be even better\nWith a high in the seventies and the now is the time of year where you can walk through your house walk next those windows in the all the cool air\nCome in and if you feel about that is a bad bad thing and not because of the house gets cool naturally that's because the exact opposite is happening\nDuring the rest of the year right you know in ... the reason that happens is you know in a in a in a builder grade contractor grade window\nIt's usually a looming um frame but there is no weather stripping on it so in in any replacement window that weather stripping is that felt that site in all of them are double whether stripped on the inside and outside that allows nowhere to escape\nAs the you know in the summertime your air conditioning stays in the house and then as you walk by and today and yesterday were really good indicators if you're going by and you got small kids or you go by and you feel a little bit of of of cooler\nIf you see your blinds or or your um shears moving a little bit that's because there is no weather stripping there and that is the air from the outside that is causing those to move so\nIn our house in every house that we every place in this thousands of windows and all those people have reduced their electric bills anywhere from Fifteen to thirty percent\nMy house twenty seven percent it's very easy to track and things but\nYou know it's it's it's a good investment\nUm you know windows if you replace him when you go to sell your house you'll get the value of them back because those windows will be you know there's still state of the art\nSet up you know we do a lot where people I'm I'm I'm going to a house on on a Tuesday repeat customer and they just bought the house but he wants me to come out and take a peek at the windows to see you know where they can start investing into their newer home\nI also answer criminal law questions DUI small claims matters and consumer matters as well boundary line disputes and overhanging trees I'm available to answer any of those questions\nIf you want to reach us here in the WTO studio with your legal question you called eight for for two two zero zero nine six five now Rob you do regular workshops for landlord tenant and one of those workshops is coming up next\nIt is you know I've been doing them as you know for about ten years we do them once a month so we get some bagels and some coffee together and we give out free legal advice workout uh you know ... workshop people's actual landlord tenant issues and\nWe hope that when people come they'll leave with some of those ... some solutions in and we have one

come to robs landlord workshop next Wednesday and I believe it's nine forty five AM if you want to come to that next Wednesday nine forty five AM the landlord workshop\nYou call or text Christie for oh seven eight oh eight eight three nine eight let's go to work in first in line is Paul from mount Dora Paul you're on news Ninety six five go ahead\nTom I'm a fellow thank you for a for than than than a manuals that was on the uh well they know You're welcome yeah\nUm I I had a question it's a kind of I don't know it's a friend um he's got a uh somebody you know a long I'm staying with them and they actually got involved with a drug\nAnd getting scared of the way that we got a lot up and he didn't put a violent injunction arising it was just let them stay there at the time that's\nBut anyway um he came and went but now it locked up is that a a way because of the band he's looking for a way it is\nThat's a great question Robert I think we understand that so let's start with is that when you have a somebody living your house whether they're attendant or a guest\nThere's really only three ways to get anybody out one is you a victim to is they abandoned the property or three as they walk up and hand you the keys and say I'm leaving so Rob if the if the tenant has been locked up in jail can we assume that that's abandonment\nWell no because if he's a tenant which I'm not positive I heard him saying it almost sounded like this was like a buddy of his or a friend of his and he let stay in the house and maybe it's a consent arrangement but if he was a tenant\nYou don't lose your right of tendency simply because you're not there true if you abandon it you're gone you haven't paid the rent and nobody knows where you are and you have no intention of coming back\nThere's a band in the people that are in jail who let's say continue to pay the rent continue to have a right to be there\nThis strikes me more as potentially a consent matter for legal detain or action where the person was there with consent the guy doesn't want 'em there any longer because he's causing all such trouble he's in jail and so there's a\nParallel proceeding in law statutes eighty two as opposed to saturate eighty three that allows you to withdraw consent and to bring forth something that looks like an addiction action as them a lot of the same qualities so a ... that may be where we're headed with this if he's attendance then we have to know whether or not even paying rent or not\nSo the key there is that you might let your son or friend move into your house they may not be paying rent they may not be a legally eight Senate under Florida law but if you want your son or your friend out of your house you still got to go through some kind of a fiction procedure if they want voluntarily move out\nI think you're up let's go to Mike in Kissimmee Mike you're on news Ninety six five go ahead\n[noise] hey [noise] my wife\nAnd I are trying to decide between living well I'm Sorry living trust that well and the question is if we vote that way because it will just as good as living trust or vice versa\n[noise] I don't see any difference between a will or trust as far as somebody contesting it or the legal vote and validity of it being challenged so let me ask you sound like a young men Mike do you all have children and what are their ages\n[noise] ah we're not so young and now we don't have children do\nYou okay so you're at really what you really asked me the difference between a willing I trusted list is is is that both of them will dictate what happened to your assets when you pass away but if you have a standard will your assets are going to go through probate [noise] if you have a living trust than you do it right your assets are not going to go through probate [noise]\nThe Mike we're all about helping people avoid probate but usually we're focusing on simple tools to avoid probate we consider a living trust to be a complicated and expensive too for voting probate it can't be the right to for some people but we like the first go through and see to see if we can use simple tools for voting probate [noise]\nOkay such as\nFor for example you can have a bank account and you and your wife's name any if you make that bank account he owed deep payable on death\nAnd you both pass away whoever you leave that bank account to all they have to do the show the bank your death certificates and they'll turn them money over to them no probate required so making your bank accounts P. O. D. is just one of these simple tools were talking about\nIt we do that was pretty much in the house surfer\nPretty we have a special tool called a Lady Bird deet it's a D that we would prepare it would state that as long as one or both of you are alive and is your home to do with as you please but when you both passed away your home would automatically go to your heirs no headaches no hassles no probate that's another simple to we are talking about Mike\nNow might the good news is we have a booklet on easy ways to avoid probate and I'd I'd recommend that you or other listeners out there get one if you haven't gotten one yet\nIf you want are easy ways of would probably be booklets all you have to do as a called techs or call or text crispy anytime of four o seven eight oh eight eight

there let's go to Jim and something her county Jim you're on news Ninety six five go ahead\nThanks for taking my call I have a neighbor that decided to landscape about three feet or my property or on the where where the property was do I need to be concerned about that when I either go to sell or he goes to sell\nIs it a flower bed or is it hard scraping like a fence or a wall\nStoves and landscaping blocks\nOkay so the bottom line Jim is I don't appreciate your neighbor doing that without looking at a survey first but at the end of the day it's not going to hurt you necessarily and this is why\nPeople are always concerned well my neighbor put his fence on my property or stone wall on my property will buy property become my neighbor's property some day the answer is no\nAh for adverse possession here in the state of Florida they would have to be paying he would have to be paying your real estate taxes on that three feet of property Jim and that's never going to happen so that property will never be his\nJim what this may be creating issues is is that when you go to sell your house and you're new buyer gets this ah survey and sees that your neighbors wall was on your property hey it may be an issue for your buyer\nSo Jim here's our use of resolve that\nI used to resolve it by doing an agreement that signed by you and your neighbor were your neighbor acknowledges that this wall and this landscaping is on your property you both agree that you're going to leave it as is no problem but if you ever want to remove it your neighbors giving you the ... permission to remove it\nAnd that's going to give your new buyer comfort level down the road gym does that make sense\nIt does thank you very much really appreciate it\nYour walk them if you want someone ... help without agreement you let me know and you know as it happens I built to stonewall and paid somebody to build a stone wall and went over over my neighbor's property a little bit we didn't mean to but we did\nAnd my neighbor and I always find that same agreement by the way when you get that agreement done you recorded in the public record so it doesn't get lost in his picked up by all future owners

possession in your the person who has the power to say in NATO or other people coming in with a landlord you can put things in leases and there's a statute that gives them\nPowers that nobody else would have to enter a non enter but generally those are with the consent of the tenants so yeah and you have to give notice except in cases of emergency so you'll see that in leases\nAnd if it's not in the lease it will be in statute eighty three that gives those limited powers of the landlord with the consent generally of the tenant entered at certain times to make repairs even to show the
