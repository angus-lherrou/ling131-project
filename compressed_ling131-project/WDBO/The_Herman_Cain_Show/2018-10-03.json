died he should have paid five hundred million in taxes\nAnd paid like fifty two million in taxes uh they say that that the blows up the Donald Trump by did it on my own strategy\nBut when you get to

then trying to get to the conclusion\nAnd all these big businesses all these organizations\nHave a slew of tax professionals handling these things is one thing\nThat the New York times article does not mentioned in the way everything's disclose everything is out of the reason they were able to go through all these documents cause it's already been done already been filed with the New York state tax authorities with the IRS\nAnd it's the state's been closed everything's been done but yet all of a sudden everything that was done was fraud and illegal\nAnd the and the bad and they're guilty or you know just from thirty thousand feet looking down it just seems another hit job on a man that by the way of course did not create all these great golf courses did not build all these buildings did

this they look at valuations on real estate\nThey look at movement of money and they tell you this is good this is not good and you act\nIn ... based on what you're being told by these people that's why you pay them the big bucks so all of a sudden it's Donald trumps the bad guy\nOr he did this he did that all I can tell you is I've watched this man's career he went bankrupt he went on the verge

on bravo that's the rap on the other two sophisticated oh is that right if there was a rap I mean you could push back on that\nWhy they're rap I didn't know I didn't know so I'm curious because they're so this is what it's like you know the Fort one one on Brian ...\nSays the one thing that I I'm not I'm not very I'm not in touch with my emotions that's one of my negative and not\nAnd I am I correct Eric I'm I've been in touch with my emotions that focus and his role okay fake no\nWe go so I'm someone first off if the FBI hands in a report is six it would be five days okay [noise] um we know that they spoke to mark judge today over two days who knows what to Deborah Ramirez ... headed up suddenly she does not know she's the number two accuser\nUh she does not know if the FBI followed up on that they talked to another friend we know of Brett Kavanaugh\nUh and uh they uh fanned out and try to cover the story but they wrapped up they take that made opinions evidently they just got a file report from what they have what they concluded there not speaking afford again\nAnd that upsets afford attorneys cause I guess she wants to speak more about what she experienced before we get into the allegations that have popped up sense do you feel do you feel satisfied whenever this report is that it's that ... that it's really took a look at it may be what would be troubling about Brett Kavanaugh's school days well\nTo me it's about Christine Ford a and I don't understand how you can have done a follow up on the background check\nAfter these allegations without talking to the chief person making the allegation which is Christine forward So Professor for it I think has a great point to make the you know a lot of the sexual stuff uh she wasn't going to talk about it explicitly in public before that all the TV cameras we\nGot it ready I don't know I got it and\nYou can make assumptions but again that would indicate you're in a rush and that's the issue here has this investigation being constrained in what we are looking at right now seems to be evidence that ah it's really just a whitewash\nSee I'm surprised you because if I told you a week ago before Kavanaugh defended himself and I said about what he says you're going to get FBI investigation and it's going to just say it's going to be double the legs of the Anita Hill Justice Thomas investigation I Would think Juan Williams would be satisfied with that\nWell no that's the key thing is it are they allowed to pursue the leads that you described Brian coming from anywhere\nSo they can say conclusively you know what here is the best fact based word that we produce on this and then you can have a further ... deliberations\nBut right now what you've done as you open the door to the last thing you know what this was nothing but a pretense you guys want it to do is to say okay we heard the lady and then the president mocked there and we went back to business and by the end of the week it was done and remember\nThere's a woman in this country still from the Clarence Thomas Anita Hill hearings ... he'll still complains about lack of follow up from the FBI\nWas very interesting that was George Bush forty one and that's what the Democrats were calling for hey why did George Bush do it and why can't Donald Trump do it in a word was over the weekend that Donald Trump said yeah you can do it but don't talk to sweat Nick and only talk to these poor people and then you see you know what\nThe goal but it up till the FBI do what you have to do just get it done I don't know about the latter point what we did know\nI think that's what he said to us but the question is and the question coming from the agents and especially now this is putting a lot of pressure on Chris Wray the FBI Director is re willing to stand up to the president and say Mr President we cannot have a limited investigation put our name on it and then give you the ability to rush forward\nSee I think for them when Chris Wray shown that he'll stand up to the president even the president that appointed him and he saw that are different pro football pro you saw it on the other investigation to the frustration of many that he was saying you know\nI'm Upset about the people in my ... and the other agencies one rogue and they never did that he seemed to be standing by the FBI more than he did the president which drove I think the president nuts except for Governor Christie what it was pushed back and say I like Chris Wray unless I recommend you to him hanging there I think the the investigation is going to wrap up today the report is if it's going to be delivered to the White House\nThen Fox expects a vote on Capitol confirmation could come as soon as Saturday\nI guarantee that no matter what's in those trio twos\nHuh everybody on the Democratic side is going to say not enough\nAnd I'm going to every one of the Republican side is going to say this is more than enough I feel good about voting for Brett Kavanaugh she's oh he was a little crazy as a high school kid\nThe sexual assault thing you could not feel comfortable if that was someone you know the accusations could not make you feel as though that she is telling the truth in which which gets button guilty and now we're trying to find now they're trying to look at a one William Still trying to look at\nWas does his temperament reflective of somebody's British Supreme Court justice in the hearing not even in the eighties\nWere a contrary Mr receptive or I think that if you look back at Mr Kavanaugh's history opens up a big door\nIn terms of you when you when you said in the nineties when people don't want to answer Clinton how about going back to him so we're talking about on the star commission getting involved with Bill Clinton sex life to an end and then you have people like Lindsey Graham even going back\nLindsey Graham another Supreme Court nominee here and say this person lacks the temperament this part of life and I've never said he liked to a gym and no not Cavanaugh I'm saying in prior Supreme Court nominees confirmation hearings so when you have people who are shifting the the the standard conveniently and that's my point you Brian photo company which\nWe should disseminate that you have the old the good old days let's talk about Kevin with the nominee okay to build out at the new days are let's talk about the high school kid oh no no no I'm just saying if you have a problem with them it's not many that's fine those are the good old days I Love debating that\nBut when you talk about the Nineteen eighties drinking or a Yale freshmen story when the accuser says I was so drunk I'd be all remember thirty three years ago\nAnd I thought you were saying when the nominees as he was so drunk because that despite his claims are virginity and being a choir boy\nOr what but but again and and he says never said quite well your lawyers when he said\nThat he was drinking legally in fact there's not a single day and his high school career when he could have had a legal drink in the state of Maryland and then he says oh you know what I like beer like you and I like beer but then you hear all these reports for people who say this guy stumbling drunk in color hair and lacking out and\nChris Dudley who's a longtime NBA or says I never saw him like that is other three roommates say never so I'm like that one of the roommates did they had a problem\nAt all I'm saying is if the five came forward this guy this as Mr\nReceptive as an FBI agent filing reports because Mr receptive let me tell you\nIf you are hearing conflicting reports that's what you should be writing down you shouldn't be saying stop looking we're we're not in ... said that American style and you know what else that really bugs me what you know this woman ... through the Republicans brought in to question professor Ford because they didn't want just a bunch of\nMen older men doing it right so they get the message and she comes in she's not very good\nAnd then the other senators have to really get involved in the cabinet and then and then she filed this report and says\nOh look at all these holes in forward story what bothers you about that how one sided and again evidence of the tribalism is taking over this it has nothing to do it through to the point where it's just pushing him through but everything that she wrote real you have to agree with you know I Do not\nShe's she said is that even he said she said because what she said doesn't add up there's not enough there\nOh and what he said so let's let's flip the coin because you're an adult you know oh you oh you don't have to get hurt you for joining us it\nBut you don't have to because if you want to defend yourself is brain kill me to one Williams it has to defend themselves and you say the person accused me does know how they got there they don't know how they got home they don't know who invited them they don't know where it was they don't even know how would they know is Brett Kavanaugh but\nThey can answer those five questions she just point that out that there's not enough here even to bring this forward and I got to run\nOkay and Mr receptive what if I said to you Mr cabinets calendar that he provided indicates that he attended a party on a date that fits the exact time that she is describing and he talks about skis talking about Bruce ... beer at this party that's illegal one\nAnd then we can go on there so many points of common story here to wish I did the FBI could for us\nProvide we don't even have a point where we can have an honest discussion but that's apparently not what's this is about because the tribalism says the Republicans want are hard ride court they kept Merrick Garland off for a year right now they want to complain a lot of destruction because you kidding me you can de\n... is on one side will not one Democrat has ever gone on to the Republican side what if any Democrat goes on now it's just to save their button a red state the tribalism right now Cory Booker Chris Coons kind of a a cold bitter I'd go\nDown the list they made up their minds already no matter what this gorgeous at you know such a choir boy\n... or and or an ass right from the start said he didn't care he's he doesn't buy that I Know the guy for Twenty years I've seen in professional for thirty six years\nI don't think that the high school a sexual assault allegation with all these questions should cut off a man's knees ... thirty six years of professional\nIt okay so here's what should\nWhen he's not on his when he can't speak up about what to say hey look okay so I had a little you know a little wrongly and you know what I saw what

appalling\n[laughter] yeah I Do I Do I think it's that big a deal not that big a deal but I've been I've been in office uh knowing the president and his instincts to go out there and say what's on his mind\nHow he's laid back and have been so calculating just letting the FBI play out letting the hearings play out wedding the testimony play out letting Mitch McConnell handle it let Brett Kavanaugh is attorney go with it\nAnd then talking to Capitol behind closed doors let him into support a there was a report in the Washington Post that the president's let other people do he had no idea about Brett Kavanaugh drinking in high school and he wasn't happy about it the president's really sensitive about drinking\nSo he does not like when people are drawn to go out and eat it it bothers him more than most other things so he didn't know anything about that because you don't usually ... somebody's high school years you know especially with six background checks and when they pop up on that federal slip that federalist list\nOr you're pretty secure a letter to Leo has fully screened them and they're ready to go and then when everybody else indoors to them he said I'm going to do that Brett Kavanaugh said pick a did even the Bush people that don't like me we'll get behind because they really like him\nNow one of the first people to call for the FBI investigation and I thought it was going to be a huge delay member they kept saying the Gavin uh why don't you ask for this or why don't you asked for this FBI investigation that Justice Thomas set it only took a couple of days was Alan Dershowitz\nBut Alan Dershowitz had an interesting tactic and again so smart [noise]\nHe said don't don't even talk you know before you talked to Dr Ford I start with this wedding woman her story is so implausible when it's brought forward by ... who found the circus on Showtime to tell her story while he was on camera with many go gratuitous kind of waste\nAnd her story is so ridiculous in fact some of the leads that she gave of other people that saw a people break Kevin on those parties one was dead one says I don't recall anything like that the other one could not be found any a fourth one may have been found this morning but I don't know this is Julie sweat neck\nTalking about the ... the president's nominee standing by the punch bowl here's Alan Dershowitz cut six\nI think the FBI or to investigate every single one of her claims and if it turns out if it turns out that she made it up out of whole cloth\nThat she never met cab not that she was several years old and then that she along with others or by herself simply made up a story the FBI should conclude that she should be tried for perjury and she should be sent to prison this becomes a very important education moment\nBecause we have to teach the women of the world and the men of the world that there is no genetically linked aspect of telling the truth\nThank you uh we have to stop it because the next person is not going to be high profile could be you could be a ... not me of course but it could be somebody out there right now and next thing you know they were accused I got to prove themselves not

to people who are on the fence on a on cabinet and then I got word that you what you saw it on one of your people saw it and said look I'm not on the fence I'm voting for the guy even\nThough we weren't we weren't you made a statement to my hometown paper about two weeks beforehand but I think that reflects the typical accuracy of the Washington Post on these issues\nAs Mitch McConnell says the first one is obituary will refer to the sets terribly can't hurt him anymore I'm I'm actually in favor of openness\nBut I also recognize that people gave testimony thinking that their identity would be protected and it may be that you could read what they said and you will be able to figure out who they are so I don't want to die out let me just put his foot I don't want to be like some of

listening on serious in North Carolina Halen\nPay a lot of your show Brian thank you um I I had a question and that is if someone did something but what I did in high school or college is so important in determining the qualifications for a position in our federal government why can't we not said President Obama's high school and college ...\nOh yeah that's a good idea we're like that and didn't even admit that he was a ... it's doing drugs in college yeah I mean does that we should forget about that it was part of his personal growth is it Brett Kavanaugh where we're doing is high school classmates who might even remember him he's gotta go contact them or they got caught they they just got to start up instead of petition to back him up\nThere cannot believe we're not talking about two

maybe Saturday a for a vote to see it and finally put to close the fate of Brett Kavanaugh is legal career\nAnd right now I'm going to steal your clothes up there and I'll get to them there's nobody answers were also expanding the New York times story here to the White House in response the failing New York times it's something I've never seen\nBefore they use the concept of time value of money and doing a very old boring in often told ... piece on me added up this means for the Ninety seven percent of their stories on me or bad never recovered from bad election coal exclamation point [noise]\nAll right before we get to your cause it's got to Peter Navarro a Peter Navarro was one of the main people responsible for pulling in this trade deal or redoing the after as well as working on many others including the framework for a bringing the EU a rebalancing trade with the EU\nPeter how do you think so far this new NAFTA has been received\nA vendor seeing the amazingly well we have a Chuck Schumer on one\nSide Mark Meadows on the other side we got the farm bureau got the national association of manufacturers\nAre this is a unique deal\nBrian is not only the largest trade deal in history one point you trillion dollars a buddy it's beneficial to all three countries what a concept\nAnd for me Bryan them the most important thing really is a reclaiming a of our manufacturing base particularly in the auto industry the ability through the incentives in the deal that bring back our auto parts industry so they stopped being just assembly plants here but we actually\nMake stuff and I'm Trump a Trump voters the\nMen and women in this country work with their hands are basically clapping their hands right now\nBecause it's going to be a big help higher wages more jobs all good\nI Want you to repeat them Riccio a noted economists out of Maryland said about the message that this new deal since\nThe Europeans said and this is important that you know that Mexicans agreeing was one thing but don't think we're going to roll over like the Mexicans because you know you got a lot of leverage their\nWhich is really squarely in the European camps got a free trade agreements with Europe and Britain won't have\nThis is a clear message to China and Europe that this president is serious about not putting America above all other countries or really America First but by putting America on an equal footing and giving American workers a fair and decent chance at competing in the world\nSo I I guess he you know he's obviously a fan of the new deal but do you think they get the message in China and in Europe\nI think the world gets message right now and I know Brian you've been nervous about some of the stuff we're done over the past month about rattling the global markets cage but this what's happening out uh with with now than last week\nA is a validation of the president's top strategy I remember last week in New York it was historic we we renegotiated that bad South Korean bill we open negotiations with the Japanese and you're one of the things you've been I was encouraged me to\nBe thinking about is getting the the allied approach to cracking down on China I don't know if you saw it was the last week Japan Europe and United States\nIssued a joint statement condemning China's practices and forced technology transfer that uses state owned enterprises their their subsidies and promising actions in twenty Nineteen basically to crack down on that so I think I'm\nI'm this is a great week for America great week for North America but it also\nValidates this tough strategy and all we want really Bryan fair and reciprocal trade that's all the president's asking for and um you know Donald Trump in my judgment is putting together the best performance of any president in history\nIn any president in history on the economy and trade his first twenty months and I think that's undeniable\nSo to me very interesting because we know a China everything's related North Korea it's related to trade and military it's related to trade I just saw that video from September thirtieth with ah we put we put one of our ah\nAh one of our ships who's by one of their manmade islands and they send the ship within forty five yards of ours are charters belligerence is getting hard to avoid are you feeling that too I mean you've been at this now for two years have you seen a change\nI I don't know yeah you you you have some great books are read read the Jefferson book for example but you know I wrote this book in a\nCouple of years ago called crouching tiger the rise of Chinese military is and it goes chapter and verse and all the different times that China is challenged us or were there air fighters in\nThe in the air and with their ships at sea or what happened on September thirtieth um is part of a broader pattern in a more than one occasion I'm the\nHas stress this thing Brian economic security is national security in this context what does that mean I mean he's expressed uh\nThe the this a pleasure I guess you'd say with the fact that when China\nRecess off with their unfair trade practices accumulates a bunch of money they're spending that the built ships a lot faster than we are and now those ships are in the water\nBasically challenging us or in the south China Sea and what's at stake there as China's trying to close the entire South China sea uh and all we want is freedom of navigation so economic security is national security or the sins of the big picture look in and yeah these things come into the equation\n[noise] couple of things we heard the president said he had a very good conversation with Japanese leader of a a A R B any they talked about maybe setting up a Japanese United States trade agreement is that next if not what is\nThat's definitely a ... if they're still what what's going to happen there or was that was announced last week the way it's got to work though Brian is I have asked are white ... goes to goes to Capitol Hill\nAnnounces his request for what's called fast track authority to enter into negotiations with the Japanese at that point we have to wait\nOr at least Ninety Days\nBefore any further discussions can take place but the beauty of fast track which which is being used\nUh for the for the old NAFTA deal or is that it's an up or down vote no uh no amendments very difficult to negotiate a trade deal when you've got a three thousand amendments are\nTo it so uh Japan is moving forward the European discussions are moving forward uh we got a deal in place historic deals with South Korea\nUm Mexico and Canada and there's going to be more to come this president as a dealmaker who make deals that help America and he's a demonstrating that fair and reciprocal trade is the banner\nOf the very interesting so we'll see where it was he that goes [noise] was I I Know the president doesn't idea too caught up in the market but what was his reaction if you don't mind telling us as the market responded to the announcement of the passage of the u._s. MCA\n\nWell two things one is that the president is going to make a tough good trade decisions uh irrespective of where the market's going to go uh at the same time or certainly the market are going up since election day since election day minute is really a validation of\nA strategy I talked a lot of Adam campaign trail which is you've got a synergistic Lee you got the tax cuts\nYou've got the deregulation you got a young lady she of the energy sector you've got all the trade actions were taking which which should help to reduce the trade deficit and leave him out the whole border security issues which basically help or economically\nOur most disadvantaged part of the labor force because it's the folks at the lower end of the income stream particularly um people\nOf color that are most vulnerable to competition from the illegal aliens so um this market's going up on the expectation of a robust economy we get over four percent in the last quarter gross when the Obama administration\nBasically never thought we'd get above ... percent\nAnd um this is a president who every day twenty four seven he's thinking about how to grow this economy and um\nAnd he's using so many different tools to do it it I mean this refreshing to have somebody in office who who knows how to grow and economy\nI've never seen anything like it and I've never seen anything like it before\nBut last week when you look at Bob Woodward's book if you read it but it's obviously Gary Cohn is all over it I Know you start with Gary Cohn in the past uh what's your reaction to that [noise]\nWell look I'm a Gary I'm Gary came here and you remind me kind of march and April when spring I came in like a line went out like lamb or the president was a was a decision maker all along or end of it doesn't matter who's here\nUh as long as the president's at the top of me you know Gary ... contributed in in a in a number of ways\nI in the private sector now and I'm the market's going up we're getting things done and this is president Donald J Trump's presidency he's he's decided this vision maker he's the leader of this country and um as I said earlier\nBrian I'm no president in modern\nHistory has done more and I was twenty months on the economy and trade which really an extraordinary record it's historical\n[noise]\nThis is news maybe six point you baby oh we'll turn first for breaking news\nLoving thirtieth used only six twenty five ... hours on the north side of page on the radar and forecasts coming up new stories big goes in Washington is our Republican senators can them I mean the president or openly ... judge Kavanaugh's accuser Christine Blasey Ford\nHe previously called her testimony very compelling and described Christine Blasey Ford as a very credible witness but days later at a rally and listen to the President Trump went on the attack\nHow did you get home I don't remember how did you get there I don't remember where is the place I don't remember how many years ago was that I don't know\nWasn't senators are speaking out Susan Collins said the president's remarks were coach just plain wrong Jeff Flake calling it kind of appalling to Norman ABC News that the White House\nCourse you know Democrats are talking to Washington insider James debris gathered more reaction on the hill just tap the Jamie button and the news and you say twenty five ...\nPoint five guilty db\nOrlando turns burst for severe weather I'm not I wouldn't ...
