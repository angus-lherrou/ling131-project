court and that\nTroubles me greatly habits neat because\nOur judicial person has been viewed as one of the main pillar of our constitutional government so I don't know how people are going to react to it I think given our divide that were pretty much fall predictably between those who are for and those who are against\nThese guys are insatiable and I'm Talking about Hillary Bill Clinton they're not starting their own show cost you seven hundred dollars to feed them talk about politics my goodness as was brought up on the television show Fox and France say which I'm On\nSeven hundred dollars to talk politics in the meat to era and when you put up your hand and say hey how would you handle all of the things that happen to you that you did these are going to be a friendly audience granted now by Bill Clinton endlessly more interesting than Hillary Clinton I Would not pay seven cents where it but I Would like to see him talk openly\nIn a private setting because he really has a great sense of politics where it was where it is I have no interest in putting to matter Monica Lewinski or things to that nature but would it hurts is when she does not go way Hillary Clinton does not go away we understood she was trying to run and stay relevant actually became secretary of state but now how do you feel if you're a Democrat\nNow they're out they're charging seven hundred dollars and they got to be creating news\nA non stop so I don't think it helps anybody with Hillary Clinton comes out there um meanwhile we're going to go to the phones but first I'd like to find out if there's more to do more\nTo no we haven't done this for a while but to get to a former White House communications director for the most talented people I've been around once close aide to the president when he was just a businessman has joined Fox\nAs an executive vice president and chief communications officer Hicks resigned her White House posed eight months ago she did a great job incredibly a fishing under pressure this a good move guys do you think\nI think it's gonna be interesting for sure and you can be based in LA not New York yeah but she's also good in the crisis and understands challenging situations Fox is always in shouting situations it's us against the world so often that stuff that she's accustomed to these can be infinitely easier than working for the president\nI Would imagine any job she has after that will be easier [noise]\nUh Drew Barrymore rule Paul and er James Gordon faith one thing in common there'll be judging Amy thank goodness another talent show a competition series the world's best for the masters of the game\nWas going to be my door now from American Idol and mark Burnett one of the nicest guys around from survivor so they can have a brand new series in

you think [noise]\nI mean clearly they must be well because they keep putting them on the air is free talent trying to prove themselves but no one's emerging anymore well really I mean we don't know anybody that's doing something for America's got talent American Idol the last big one was Philip Philips and that was on the uh later end\nAre they not emerging are they just feel like the fact that they want a competition or on the top of the final isn't the key like no other person anymore because I was watching something the other day and she's a very successful countries different starting to think she made her way on like the national got talent but that wasn't her key point that you would like\nTo me I was just one of the things he did well we were supposed to be launching point a star is born is usually the concepts star search is usually the concept they built it off with a with ed McMahon\nSo social media ratings I don't know how the heck they do this but they rank the shows that has the most social buzz number one\nA news while I don't know anyone that talks about the news is that because we're not in Los Angeles we don't do this I think it's probably because you don't hang up on Facebook that much Ellen DeGeneres is number two she's always been strong the walking dead is also always up there uh I don't even know what the numbers are necessarily going to translate Grey's Anatomy\nThe Daily Show and then Fox and friends beating SNL TMZ the today show in entertainment tonight how's that\nThat's fantastic that's very terrible videos thank you [noise]\nRyan Zinke he has

time for God\nI've never been but I hear it spectacular so I didn't want to go [noise] I Would definitely go to Yellowstone Park\nBut don't get over excited when you see a vice and you're about to see a lot of them in the beginning we totally overreacted used to have to take that every time and also there's something interesting I think they took out mountain lions and it allowed way too many dear so they had to bring them outlines back to kill the deer that's a problem when you try to overeat when you try to referee nature\nThat them very that problem but did you see any mountain lions guilty earlier there no but it would have been something I remember forever and traumatized children around the globe [noise]\nNext Trump campaign aide Rick Gates reporter resort proposals of online manipulation from Israeli intel team there's enough to keep CNN going Rick Gates you know it's already become state's witness New York times has the story took campaign official requested proposing

I mean you could very easily be her family she went from South Carolina Governor not the youngest family as she does have a young family\nAnd now she's in New York almost all the time it's a tough job but you said you have not been able to to get any reason\nI don't I don't have a clear picture of what happened I I don't have any idea what has happened and frankly the reason I have no idea it is people should know I don't know so I there is just a very very very very small number of people who knows the full story at this point and I don't want to them\nBut you can't break I Will try to\nFigure it out I only want to tell you what I Know it Brian I only want to tell you what I don't\nKnow I understand a couple of things out if you're just looking in which you speculate if you're looking at what is taking place foreign policy wise over the last few weeks you've got the trade deal and after she wouldn't be against that and then you have a full engagement and aggressive stance towards China that to me wouldn't wouldn't knee jerk reaction be a negative\nNo I I I Would I Would be shocked if it is um\nIf if the substance I Would I Would be shocked if it is um policy related because Nikki Haley has been very much I mean there's very few policy things that she has it's a great with she very hawkish author and also on basically the same page with everything when it comes to Iran particularly when it comes to Israel\nA I suspect there are other people and and I I don't want to say like I just don't know I I'm trying to find out my reporting on there was a very interesting op ed that she wrote recently\nAh which caught people's attention and that the White House ah which was when the ...\nA ... she brought her own public op ed basically saying that look she gets agrees with them but when she does she she got that in ... um she got that right you know anonymous op ed\nSo I'm a that is taught me to cope with the ... the cost is always speculation about I'm\nA about a political the ... I just saw a report now for me to be the record it just spotted Nikki Haley will in the west wing or if she declined to ... ... and she smiled and walked by recording\nYour story every one story with a siren on drugs the number one website in the world\nSo well a big story that's a good job a thank you so\nBut I I Will say this for the country sake I Believe she has been a shining star for the last two years nobody ever brought more prestigious I Would argue to that seat in her she was leading the way a lot of times the one time she was crossed I think by Rudy Giuliani excuse me Larry Kudlow she went and talked to him directly and say don't say\nThat confused ever yet she looked she I'm Nicky highly doesn't take that will take a anything from anyone uh she she is very very forthright um so ah\nYeah look she um she certainly been one of the most high profile it gives it a couple of minutes ration she has been a huge voice at the un United Nations I'm seeing her speak out against\nThe countries that that ... Israel has been a very very uh I think for many conservatives are have been wanting to America to have a voice like that at the un so she has definitely feel\nThat uh that well yeah and real quick on on the other stuff down and then when you you talk about what happened yesterday with the president saying that uh apologizing on behalf\nOf the American people for what Brett Kavanaugh one thrill of course Democrats are beside themselves are saying you know the guy's guilty shouldn't be a stream court justice and they're the president is apologizing but how does that resonate with the elections\nWell it's it's going to watch TV day you know I mean there's I think that they thought you many conclusions drawing already about\nUm the effect is just had one here's what I ... I had a good conversation with Glen Bolger who can post to that I have a lot of respectful and he said to me\nIt was very striking to kittens during the Kavanaugh ... scandal whatever you want to call it debacle um but when a start to heat up he saw\nAn uptick in in the ass them among Republican voters and he said Democrats are already the way he gets characterized is eleven out of ten enthusiasm he said Republicans have been up for out of ten and having a\nJak them up to about an age so he said the effect of ... to it being a net positive to Republicans particularly in the Senate ... thing a lot of Senate polling and nice red states that he's more favorable for Republican however and this is a really important ... Republicans do have a huge huge problem with\nIndependents independents us a wildly in favor of Democrats ... and they would be comfortable with and uh and the house is still a very very ugly Matt because there's a lot of\nWhat they swing districts where Trump is not popular a lot of members of very vulnerable so there are a lot of problems\nUm but it appears so that they can pay the net positive for Republicans to the question is can this enthusiasm and energy ah maintain until election day\nOr a couple of things you know we don't this just looking back and Nikki Haley we first negative thing I saw that blew up it was ... and not to be true about how much money she spent on drinks\nOut here we go to just wait I'm I'm just thinking now apparently I'm a therapist added to told a leaky how he spoke with the west wing and that it has said that they can have an open press a return Trump in a in the west wing today in the article\nYou right now man like Fifteen minutes [laughter] they televise yeah I I guess I'm just seeing all these things being recorded by my colleague\nWith him was incredible it's incredible the what you're going to happen\nHere here's an e pretty hot yeah here's this other story that just came across a ... a watchdog group wants a federal investigation to Nikki Haley's use of private planes owned by a South Carolina businessmen that group citizens for responsibility and ethics is Haley undervalued defined by tens of thousands of dollars\nYou have to fight to the flights creed or the impression of him impermissible gifts to a public official\nSo the scrutiny that the Trump officials go under scrutiny that have not seen others going there but we'll see if that had anything to do with it I highly doubt it\nUm\nI don't know I just don't know one way or another I really ... with with the choices like as broad as you know you just like the more caution the ... the better I mean I just I just want to tell you what I Know and be very honest about what I don't know I don't have any ... I don't have the wildest\nIdea it's me and that's why she died so I don't know I could actually do a lot more going to find out\nI Would say this if she just resigned she's done and this stuff with the drapes or you know there's no problems she comes out as a leading candidate in twenty twenty four she told us on the couch on Fox and friends\nThat she was I've never run against the president but she easily could have ruled out ever running for president period but in twenty twenty four when you look at a governor of South Carolina who's already shown a bipartisan player who now has international credentials\nI mean I don't know what you're going to do to keep busy and relevant over there a couple of years but it's possible that you can be uniquely as it was an Indian Indian American background and one with a husband that's in the military I mean it's that's on this\nQuestion business look there's no question that she has a very very bright political future everyone knows it quickly in the Republican Party as you\nPoint out that you know is is crying out of the\nNile leaders ah and she said she has a lot to you know she's been a governor so she's actually have to run the state and she's now on you know being a leading voice at the un ah so I mean it's all there is sold and by the way probably one of the more media savvy about figures in the potty\nNo question can handle any question and dust and a lot of it which President Trump's policies which President Trump sometimes has trouble explaining she usually did better than him on that so ten thirty we don't have any indication that ten minutes we don't have any of the New York\nTimes is just the New York times was just confirmed my recording and the and that is just about ...\nAll right he didn't need to know

... a\nA pool spray which means going to be slightly delayed\nOf a President Trump take accepting the resignation we understand them Nikki Haley who was procure short time ago that Nikki Haley is going to be leaving this is starting to everybody including the man that broken on our show who you just saw John they we just heard shot it in one you know he was a book to come on because if you ever watch or listen to him on ...\nIf you read is a newsletter you know that he's always got breaking news it's always reliable and he always double and triple triple jacks he does not at the speculation nor do I pick up an agenda so let's listen\nTo a box of friends' houses to discuss this and other things and Brian\nYour thoughts on this breaking news\nShows just moments ago Jonathan swans who broke the story was just on with us he was booked at a time and say I got this stunning news that a Nikki Haley's resigning and it's obviously joking about the president's tweet it's friendly my friend big announcement bottom of the hour that any minute\nSo it could be happening now they send to the pool cameras are slightly delayed when they come out to us\nI Would say this and I don't know anybody that argues\nShe was just on the Fox and friends catch last week I said how do you explain the fact that you get along with the president he said well because we have disagreements but I have a direct line to make a pick up the phone and we can talk it out\nThe only time I ever saw her or disillusioned let's say was one Larry Kudlow made a statement that she was confused by something when he called then she called him out confused by anything\nSo besides that she's had a chance to put up with a lot of ... to that scene I thought she's been brilliant\nEveryone agrees things were brilliant and even even her retort that Larry Kudlow got a real quick apology for more or less safe but don't mess with me again the whole thing right don't mess with me don't mess with America\nSo just to speculate real quick because I Want to get on the record as he wasn't my idea this is Alison Mansfield the great radio producer who I've never met in person she came out and she just told me and you know because you feel it's Michelle's said what about Lieberman comes out of retirement to take this\nOut well how good is that that would be great I mean that's why he has been great it's a radio producer out there I was in great call uh we'll see what happens and you know he\nAnd certainly what would be something that this country we need right now right it'd be great a great bipartisan moment right in the nation that's ripping itself apart along ideological lines so we'll keep that won't open other than that though I mean it's the marketing to held up Bryan throughout this new the fact that we've actually as a little bit higher\nSo right now despite how shocking timing as everyone still sort of hoping like your that it's going to be a positive announcement\nHere's the thing she's that secretary of state she has a spokesperson for a position secretary of state kind of does their own thing so I think it was punt pale resigning it would be

six eight seven six six nine I have to report some sad news Nikki Haley's resigning as UN ambassador\nWe don't know the reason except for the early indications are that she made it clear she's only going to last year or two in the job because he has a younger family or ... in the military and she's leaving South Carolina for New York city and this job requires a lot of travel\nAnd what the president does is he empowers people trust if you notice that you know bugs got free reign secretary of defense has to be the secretary of defense the one he didn't like the president was tuition and even like is he didn't think Tillerson was on board with him so he didn't give me almost any responsibility and under cut him one possible\nNikki Haley was never on to cut by the president a president liked her gave her direct contact so for a unit bass or to have direct contact with the president and said to me and everybody else\nI think everybody else but at least to me the thing about the president is you talk to him and he listens\nSo they're leaving on the highest no possible leaving for now is what's been relayed Thomas listened W ex J.

Thomas we know the pool spray is happening as we speak as we get read out I'll interrupt you but what's on your mind\nI think I'm I'm speculating here but I don't mind speculating I think that she's sending herself out to be a a the vice president and twenty twenty to run I think is going to step aside and Haley is going to jump in and that's going to help them with his gender gap\nAs you say by definition speculation but if Mike Pence is don't anything it set himself ought to be president and for him to step aside for the next four years when he's done a really good job is never cut the president out he doesn't leak his staff does a week I think there's anybody secure Thomas\nHits or the vice president Meek who's got news Ninety six five and ... do leak\nSay yes I'm I'm On a Thursday night they're number one Sarah paving\nMaterial to fairer playing them and number two pound bunny from Florida\nPam Bondi your body more of a legal expert I Would think that if she was going to make a huge leap it might be the next attorney general\nBut I Would not say but I'm not saying you're wrong I Would say there'll be a huge leap because it's such ramp up time\nWith the with the president taking on China been trained reestablish relations with India between trying to find a way out from North Korea while enforcing sanctions well upping the pressure on Russia and bushy or Assad\nWhile now putting pressure on Saudi Arabia to find out answers with Washington Post reporter is this the Bible position which I think would require someone with some who was more of a resume or for the international affairs but Pam Bondi might be a leading contender for attorney general\nMight be I Know the president certainly likes her glacier listening a strain on the stream hey glacier\nHello oh I'm so disappointed I understand why she's leaving but she's so dynamic I don't know who's going to replace her okay she's like the Clint Eastwood of un it's like don't mess with me\nAbsolutely and I mean like there's\nNo way around it you you know and she is talking to you she leans business that's what we want that we're going to do don't mess with me okay so um yeah I understand completely why should leaving she's got a family and stuff but I'm so very sad and just like no no no but I understand\nSo I I don't know if it's going to replace her yeah I have no clue\nYeah I mean we were brought up about Joe Lieberman already I brought up Kelly Ayotte a former senator from New Hampshire who's done a lot of international work with Lieberman and Lindsey Graham reaching the replays Lieberman is one of the three musketeers with John McCain will be a very interesting\nI don't know who they could bring back from the Bush years he gets along with the president but if Mitt Romney was running from Senator from Utah I Would think that would have been something but you have to realize and I know you do when my colors do\nThe reason why Nikki Haley did so well is because she clearly spoke for the president [noise] the reason why to assume was so ineffective doesn't matter what his ideas were\nIt was clear\nHe was not speaking for the president in fact this present with under caught him the reason why a pump pale\nHas worked out is because there's mutual respect their and pump a understands who's the boss even though he's with West Point background mad if as far as I Know he might I don't think he leaks but publicly he never goes against the president\nRemember he got mad at me that statement or\nMade that statement after the NATO meeting when the president said you know NATO has got to start paying their fair share and everything like that Mattis at the end they said what a disaster those meetings why Madison tells you the news one of the best NATO meetings\nOf the better part of Eric ... W. N. I. S. Hey Eric\nChase a man a great\nTime or listen to your show and everything I Am a little um about a naked Haley stepping down but I did say that it was a ... it's not unprecedented [noise] um and the reason I say that\nThere's a lot of the founding fathers when they would do that as well they would take time off but then they get reelected in their their duty to serve was so strong that they were put behind their family and go sir yeah George Washington's great example repeatedly\nWill home to like Mount Vernon last fall the founding fathers would do this so you know my my hopes are are a little time to see what my hopes are also how not\nTo them because I Believe she's telling them back better than ever in a better position\nWell I think she definitely will be back in as you mentioned that the other person I heard we'd be back is Gary Cohn and I think it would have helped if he did come back because he's so smart\nBut he he undercut the president was constantly who reportedly leaking about the president\nSo it over shot the good thing things he did with the economy and tax reform\nBut if you like history that much obviously do I hope I'm going to see you on the twentieth Saturday at seven thirty because I'll be talking about all three history books and taking questions and we'll talk about stuff like this ah Erica W.

Michael I'm your thoughts as as a columnist I think it's hard to put I I don't remember anybody riding negative things about Nikki Haley do you\nWell just recently Brian remember your drains tried to take her with the fifty two thousand dollar curtains for the residents before having to effectively retract the story and can see that the decision was made under ... Obama's administration\nBut you're right I think in general she is the lack of any ah coverage of her would be a positive because of the way the media has Savage picked off like they're trying to call the herd\nOf every member of the Trump Administration so they haven't gone after her directly in the same way but uh they ... out of neither neither have they complimented her I think to to the extent that she deserves it\nI think she has been a faithful representative of the president's policies at the United nations and by doing so I think she has shown an incredible a fearlessness a an accuracy in ... in a consistency and pushing forward America First idea is that we are happy\nTo be part of the United nations for the good things that does but we will not be a path the we will not be a ... and we will not give our money to to wasteful programs that encourage violence and terrorism as with the Palestinians and we will not go along with his demonization\nOf Israel we will use the UN for good purposes but this idea that a block Obama pushed that somehow to be a citizen of the world was to uh she'd American decision making to the global body\nWhen the global body is just a group of individual countries all of them want to put themselves first and many many cases greedy and corrupt diplomat who live like kings in New York\nYeah or even as they cry poverty at home so I think that she blew the whistle on a lot of hypocrisy\nAnd now at the at the United nations I think in in the spirit of Jeane Kirkpatrick and Daniel Patrick Moynihan who are held\nThose positions and also John Bolton who I think was a clear scourge\nOn the United nations that's what we need there and I I'm Sorry to see her go but as you say she's got a she's got a life to live she's got I think at least one child who is still in high school ah and ah her husband in the military I think it's it's been a complicated life for her\nAnd I think it is that the nonstop pressure the nonstop decision making it's probably taken a toll but I Hope she'll come back into public life soon\nWe will Michael a good one with us now so she's going to finish at her job to the end of the year gives the president sometimes to replace or\nNumber two is the president empowered her and they had a direct line that has everything to do with it so it it became clear to other nations they she has power and the president's ear she gets more respect the one time she didn't she blasted Larry Kudlow for saying something like she got confused no one ever do that again to Nikki Haley\nThe other thing she told me behind the scenes she says the funny thing is all these people who evidently don't like with Donald Trump's done to this country when he comes he is like a rock star every one of these ambassadors wants their picture with them everybody wants that moment with the shaking hands\nAnd then she said I asked the president for one thing I said we can do what can we do a cocktail party we just give me twenty minutes to meet the other ambassadors now his people told them you can't do it has no time\nHe says Nikki wants me to do it I'll do it and not only did he do it last year he asked her again this year do you need me to do that again and she said yes\nSo it's just the respect they could that permeates into American policy he has saved money she has taken on North Korea pulled back from North Korea one demanded also personally went and visited the Syrian refugees and made that her cause I just yeah I just can't say enough about her\nYeah I think she's terrific Brian and and you know I I read a little of a thing in the paper about uh uh in the paper called the spectator that how President Trump is viewed positively in Africa by the general population's fifty six percent of Kenyans and fifty six percent of Nigerians\nThink Donald Trump as a positive force for their countries I think about that you would not hear that at the United nations itself and that's what Nikki Haley was up against that that these tapes sees these potty miles at the United nations do not really represent the mass public in their own countries\nThey are divorced from them they are the elites of their countries and this is what Nikki Haley was up against\nAnd she constantly blew the whistle on it I think it it it's it cannot be a a said too many times\nHow difficult that can be the pressures to conform all the time she took her marching orders from the president she clearly embrace the president's view and I think that's what makes her so special\nYeah I Want you you're more which coming across right now it's in a slight delay\nSo let's listen together more from Nikki Haley in the president\nNow I Want to say on her so I like to thank for allowing us to come out in the way it has been an honor in a lifetime you know I did I\nLeave her\nI\nCan't wait for the United states on foreign policy now the United states is\nFavorite thing to say we're going to do something we've always heard that whether it was the kind of area whether it was made in our country to pay their fair weather tried the main thing and they know\nThat [noise] so it's true I mean if you've ever remarkably productive sometimes I teach almost invisible in this case it isn't I imagine you'll be back in a couple of years\nIf the president wins reelection ... you'll have some type or oh you don't know how long it has to be a step off the that's the issue and it's got to be a step to enhance his her resume and gets her ready for the next challenge now I've got to ask you a Mike Goodwin\nOh how do you feel about my premise in the hope that the president will not bring up the word hoax when it comes to Dr Ford will not talk about a sham but we'll talk about Kevin or being on the bench and fighting through the turmoil I just worry about the Supreme Court losing its non political nature after\nThings like this happened I like to go back to court as usual like it did after Thomas do you agree with that\n[noise] I Do to a certain extent Brian and I was thinking something similar watching the president last night I thought it was one of the most remarkable ceremonies have ever seen in government um I mean what the cabinet family went through in for the president to apologize on behalf of the nation\nWas incredibly important I think it struck all the right notes and I agree with you there were hoax um and maybe even is proven innocent I I I don't know about all of that but but I Do think that there are these things are not just intended\nFor those who are who supported Kavanaugh they're also intended for the other side and I think this is this is the genius of Donald Trump that often gets overlooked he is signaling to the other side\nWe we will deal with you every time we we will not turn the other cheek we will unload on you just as you unload on us and that's a really important signal I mean the Democrats have to know they were trashed here and the president is not in a Haley mood\nIf they want to play by the that's fine but if they want to fight he'll continue to fight too I think so I think that that is that is a hidden message to them don't screw with us again\nAnd you're seeing any seems to be the only president they can really help out in the midterms where all the other presidents or might have been have higher popularity ratings but we're basically told to stay home just another thing different about this this uh this administration Nikki Haley also praised Jared ... Blanca let's listen\nI Can't say enough good things about Jared and I have\nNo one understands reviews and after the on the way we're not done working on that not only need to find out if I'm leaving I'm going to find and they do a lot of things behind the scenes\nI Wish more people knew about because we're about our country ... minutes\nSo that's interesting Jared ... again get brought a silk just when you were fading away does that mean in the beginning Kelly was pushing them back but now they step forward but they don't want to credit is an interesting they don't have to credit\nJared Kushner or does a lot of things I mean the the Mexico when she mentioned NAFTA I think it was primarily his he's been in Mexico a number of times talking to the current president and the new president the old and a new\nUh he's had a very big hand in that uh the Mid East\nOr I think he clearly had a big hand and moving the embassy or we haven't seen the peace plan that the Trump or people have been working on I think it's clear that\nThey're trying to line up a lot of Arab support before they present it to the Palestinians and try to make the Arabs push the Palestinians to agree to it I think that's been the hold up but yes look I think you know Brian you and I talk about this a lot we we we you know constant media coverage\nAndrew Jackson the miracle of New Orleans which come to New Orleans which comes out on paper back two days prior to kill me showed them in\nHis news Ninety six point by your baby oh we'll turn first for breaking news\nEleven thirty and news Ninety six point five WD be our top story is breaking news which you just sign on our air moments ago us\nAmbassador to the United nations Nikki Haley is resigning the announcement was made just now by President Trump in the oval office with Haley by aside\nPresident Trump would not say who he is considering to replace Nikki Haley as US ambassador to the United nations\nShe told me probably six months ago she said you know maybe at the end of the year the end of a two year period for the end of the year [noise] I Want to take a little time off\nThe president that he and Haley solve a lot of problems together and that this position that top American representative to the UN is now a more quote glamorous position than it was a couple of years ago ...

Ninety six only five WD be you\nKnow the Brian killed me to a news to point by doubling de Vito\nDo this because\nThe United nations has been very special to me she's done an incredible job she told me probably six months ago she said you know maybe at the end of the year at the end of a two year period at the end of the year I Want to take a little time off\nAnd that's why with that we were the stunning news invested Nikki Haley will be calling it quits at the end of the year she'll be tough to replace I just don't know anybody who's been critical of a performance or who's more empowered in her job who actually elevated the job in ...\nWho she was speaking for president that you had direct contact with a man that knows that well as ... there's been some very confident people in and around the president\nThey just don't feel empowered they leave\nThat's not the case with investor Haley my right Corey\nRyan you're exactly right look ambassador Haley had weekly meetings in person with the president\nOr she would fly down from New York she'd sit in the oval office they would be on the same page on every major foreign policy decision and she brought that message back to the United nations and re asserting us dominance to the United nations taking some very tough positions of what this president wanted the world has noticed it she got a very very good job of the UN ambassador\nSo how surprising is that you know about this\n[noise] I I didn't know about it and I can tell you from my friends on the building that I've talked to and they didn't know this was coming and you know if this is something that the president and and the ambassador spoke about six months ago then it was kept as a very very close secret I spoke to a number of people who work in the building today none of the new was coming it's now being reported\nA Ambassador Bolton didn't know it was coming national security buys a boat and\nA secretary compelled to do was coming but that's okay because there was a transition period here and what the president just said I'm sure you saw this was in the next couple of three or four weeks he will be naming a replacement for ambassador Haley and I'm sure there are a number of very serious very confident people who can fill that role\nOr so in terms of a real section you could read through the the jargon like nobody else 'cause you know the president when it was just you and him trying to get your campaign underneath you try to establish yourself I sense that there was a real respect back and forth let's listen to a little of it\nIs now there is no personal reasons one minute very important for us to understand when it's time\nTo time and again and every thing down there and I do some\nOther people like that same energy and power anyway so it really is a lot of people want to stay alive rings and finally I Want\nIt was a blessing and going to the un resigning\nEveryday American um and I always think our necessarily\nFighting for our our pay back\nSo she thinks it's time and the president just through ah through praised it her so see we'll see where this goes but because I think that unlike Tillerson who had a more prestigious job he didn't have any power so we'd go to meet with these world leaders and they knew he's not speaking for Trump\nRyan you're exactly right every there was no question that went Nikki Haley spoke at the un she was speaking directly for the president of the United states his policies were on full display every time that she went out to speak she\nShe understood what he wanted to accomplish he implemented his agenda regardless of what that was and it was the right thing for the country in every world leader knew\nThat when she made a phone call or she spoke to them at the un she was speaking\nOn behalf of the country with the full support of the administration and she's not only had a good relationship with the president but also the vice president secretary palm pilot is a very sharp contrast to her relationship with the president\nTo what was rex Tillerson's relationship with the president and so you know as you go forward what she said was she went into the un every day with ... on\nBecause she has to be ready for that fight fighting for America first putting our values and our agenda at the forefront of the UN which is the job of the UN ambassador she's done a phenomenal job but I have to think that in and out every day that weighs on somebody", "year": "2018", "show_name": "The Herman Cain Show", "city": "Orlando", "day": "09"}
