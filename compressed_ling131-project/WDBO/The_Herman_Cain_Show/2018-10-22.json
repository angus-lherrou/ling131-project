general you've got a brand new book out called leaders myth and reality do you believe we would be having the civility problem if our leaders would set a better example\nNo I actually think we've got a crisis of leadership in America and I don't think it's a limited to one side you could say maybe it's limited to a leach however you want to do it but the reality we we do\nYeah and do you think it goes his desk filters down to diners ah where we see people yelling at other people that are restaurants\nI think it filters to every one think about how you act at the dinner table affects how your kids grow up how they think and how they comport themselves if you're rude to people if you are hateful that shows up but I think that's what's happening across society\nYeah I got to ask you got a couple of things first off I Know you don't do the diplomatic thing but man Saudi Arabia has played a role in your life for a while because they play such a pills a pivotal role in the middle east [noise] Jake killed this guy I mean you've got everything except the actual crime itself [noise]\nWhat advantage to Saudi Arabia have to putting the risk of relations with the United states what is it about this column is what am I missing to think that they would say that this is a good idea\nSense is now in the rearview mirror they don't think it was a good idea and I don't think it was a good idea from the beginning but they must calculate this way\nSort of extraordinary chose a sign of arrogance if in fact it's true as alleged in a church there seems to be and and as it is\nAl Pacino what's even worse than how they're dealing with it afterwards and the fact that they are eking out admissions as we go in continuing to ah to not be forthcoming that's going to be a real issue\nWhen we had a we have less outrage after nine eleven about Saudi Arabia which to do with a jury of hijackers then we do now so what we're seeing here is do you think it's the media outraged that somebody in the media was shot and this is a self interest thing\nNo I don't pick at all I think the the Braves and this of this particular act of factors media I think is minor and the fact that it happened in another country because clearly present everyone and his government are are pushing the issue pretty hard\nHere is a what a Bob Corker said cut twenty five\nHe also has made a mistake and obviously if he's gone fourth and murdered a this journalists um he's now crossed the line and there has to be a ... at a price for that and then again I'm not rushing to document I think he did it yeah I think he did it\nAh let's let's finish this investigation we have the best in the world at being able to do that we obviously have intercept from the past that point to\nInvolvement at a very high level of less let this play out\nChairman of Foreign Relations Republican so general you have to in the world that I have not experienced but studied you have to deal with bad people in order to achieve your objective you did all the time in Afghanistan obviously in Iraq\nSaudi Arabia is not the type of government that we want to emulate but they've been vital to us or you know four fifty sixty Seventy years\nKnowing that there were a counterweight to Iran is it is it not in our best interest to be cavalier and break off relations in an arms deals do you think they're too busy street smart is to is to have an objective to keep relations would send a message or do you just say well this is not what we stand for must make or break\nWell it's interesting I think the near term thing right now is the evidence is piled up is to be outraged and make an immediate break with the Saudis but we need to think about tomorrow when you think about long term be mature we're gonna have a relationship with the kingdom of Saudi Arabia tomorrow next week next year and we should and that's very important so I don't think we should be\nFought not thoughtful approach on the other hand the farm or a ...\nPort and part of this our our values and how we portray those in the world that's going to be more important long term or legitimacy and credibility in the world so I think we need to take a very firm stand but make sure we're making it for the right reason and to the rest of the world carefully Saudi Arabia is going to pay a price in the relationship with us but there's also going to be tomorrow\nBecause you know with Iran did to us in Iraq and it might have killed people that you're friendly to you or people that served under you and to allow when Saudi Arabia is diminished or there's a break they flourish\nThat's right I mean you've got to look at the holistic part of the region in the world and an Iranian outrages we started to take for granted and so we we can't go out of control but at the same time there's no way we can turn our back on this\nTo you wonder why turkey seems so sanctimonious and all this when what they've done to journalists in jail people in this alleged coup for a few years ago you wonder what their motivation is\nWhen I Do think they're just looking for justice no I think it's interesting I think all countries try to take the moral high ground when given that opportunity and leaders do that and and they suddenly say look what other people are doing because certainly it takes the heat off them and in some ways it brings them a little closer to the world community again so I think it's totally in their interest\nAll right I got to bring it to something else US Army brigadier general Jeffrey smiley was confirmed to be one of the two Americans wounded in Thursday's attack that killed a police chase we were talking about in southern Afghanistan who you said was a very a very powerful figure they're\nA what a brigadier general a shot what does that tell you about where the where the wire is\nWell I I'm not sure it tells us anything specific apparently it was a ... bird the security detail it pulled his weapon and kill general regime can will do generally you don't know who your\nFriends are so your own security turned on\nExactly and and that's pretty hard to to draw big conclusions obviously it's a challenge I think more importantly it just shows they continued instability in Afghanistan and the difficulty of reaching something that we're all comfortable with but I don't think it's hopeless and I think it's still important\nThe Iranians are in there and the Russians now in there that's different from when you were in there so it's even more complicated however we've gotten a lot tougher with Pakistan what do you like what what are you stressed about in this in the Seventeen year conflict\nWell I think the fact that inside Afghanistan the political reality is they haven't yet been able to hit stability with a popular president and ineffective parliament and working internally\nThey're still the biggest part of the problem\nBut now that you've got Iran Russia China to a small extent Pakistan of course in India and other players [noise]\nIt makes it awful hard now that's Afghanistan's history people always wanted to keep Afghanistan unsettled because then the great game it was in all of their interest to do so\nWhat we've got to do is try to work past that because an unsettled place in the world now is a haven for terrorists or for the problems that we did make mistakes we made a lot of mistakes who whether well you know we tend to look at the graveyard of empires story and and there's some truth to that Afghanistan has always been hard\nBut I think as Bob comb are set about Vietnam we did Vietnam ten years one year at a time\nAnd I think that that's what we've done in Afghanistan in fact we've been very cyclical and how much effort we put in initially we put way too little in terms of military force money then we put more we had political lack of conviction and our part we couldn't build confidence on the part of all of the players that we\nTalked about pulling out the day we search that's\nThat's right and so whenever you do that you create uncertainty and when people are uncertain about the future they hedged their bets they don't commit entirety they don't join the army they don't invest they don't do whatever you want them to do and that under cut your chance of success\nFeel as though if they only let me finish the job\nWell that's what ifs personally I Do think we were in the right direction but but I Can't tell you with the\nGeneral Stanley McChrystal here general use is a a a book about leaders myth in reality you know a lot of people that did you is one of the great ... could you as one of the great channels of this generation are you still learning about leadership\nCompletely I in fact I went through life being educated to be a leader being trained getting opportunities at every level ... leadership\nI wrote two books before this about leadership and then I came to the understanding I didn't really understand the essence of it there was something missing so we went back to pollute talks lives the first century study of forty eight leaders Greeks in Romans to try to find out what it is we don't get and why if we got it wrong\nAnd what what we learned as we did this as leadership is not what we think it is and it never has been\nWe've looked at it through three deaths that distort our view of leadership one is a formula a mission that says that if you do the right things I have a checklist\nThat you're going to be effective the second is that the leaders responsible for all of a success and failure an organization and that's never borne out by the data in fact it's it's a fact of followers in context and then the finalists that we can follow leaders you produce results the bottom line if it's a commercial company or commercial success\nAnd the reality is that's not true either we follow leaders who were homeless cereal failures in many cases\nWe look at leaders in an emotional unrealistic way we put them on the pedestal we say we want humble leaders but nurse assist are over represented in senior leadership roles so it's this dichotomy between what we think we want and need and what we do in practice\nDo you think fundamentally we're looking for somebody better than us to show us the way\nWell we're certainly looking for somebody to show us the way we like to think that they are better than outside the smarter or more successful are stronger\nBut in reality that's that's a fool's errand because people are people and followers have much more responsibility for the outcome than we want to pretend if you look at general Jackson and his great victory down at New Orleans that you wrote such a great book about\nIt was his army and all the players wasn't Andy Jackson that did that alone he was important but he wasn't the guy and yet history tends to put the spotlight on the star the show\nNow Adam paperback by the way as a model but I just got to talk of\nThe specific Lee about some of the leaders that he outlined alone with Jeff Eggers and Jason manned Joan a General Stanley McChrystal hear the name of the book as leaders myth and reality go grab it\nAnd we'll be back with your phone calls one eight six six four oh eight seven six six on don't go anywhere [noise] this is Brian kill me show\nThe security center where he's been on the phone or crash continuing to block the left lane ... crushes just moved off to the left\nYou have um [noise] um you have um the\nPittsburgh coach who are who is now out who is a Bill Keller is now out doing it as a broadcaster when he had all that success he says the guy stop listening to me ... seems to move on to a year before he has to cause he senses they heard my act before\nI think that's true plus there's always the danger that the leaders starts to think they've got all the right answers they've had the success they hear the press they start to believe there's really smart they lose their humility and I think that makes you less adaptable\nI Will never use my ... my ... a general I've become more cautious way catch up on the other side of the book as leaders go grab it while you can it's a great idea for Thanksgiving leading up to Christmas or whatever holiday you celebrate\n\nThis is news Ninety six point by your day they were doing turns first for breaking news\nFour hours a day\nGood morning ten thirty at news

one we get to ... get to see the general by he only he um\nYou'd be a great guest on every single major issue would you pick and choose your places and yet this is one of your places the name of the book as leaders Smith and reality you go and even for a great leader in your own right you want to learn more and it is is this written for the future military leader of the future or is it future pedestrian civilian\nIt's written for all of us and it's written not just for people who are likely to be leaders but it's gonna it's written for people who are likely to follow leaders shore judge leaders which is all of us\nAnd it doesn't give you a check list for how to be a great leader or even ready to lead or what it does is it builds the complexity of the situation and if you step back and go this is how hard it really is you have a better understanding for it you can\nElect people better you can select you can promote better and we can predict what leadership is going to be needed for the future with a little more clarity right\nAnd you are we already went over a Walt Disney what are some other leaders that you wanted to highlight here whether\nIt was interesting we we took on Coco Chanel and you'll be surprised to know I didn't even know she was a person before we read this book and yet Coco Chanel an orphan born in ... becomes an ex\nCoronary business person but she also establishes maybe one of the first brands and the brand was her she lived a life style became a persona and made people want to buy her products because they want it to be like cocoa while at the same time she was a rock hard business person through some pretty difficult years\nThere were some others like Abu Musab al Zarqawi the the leader of al Qaeda in Iraq who my organization killed in June of two thousand sex\nAfter going after him for about two and a half years of bloody pursuit and struggle against him [noise] he had a very difficult upbringing wasn't very well educated but found that if he\nWas the most convicted person meaning the most intense believer in the organization and he could constantly demonstrate that in the book we talk about him first trying to remove tattoos on his arm\nWith bleach when that didn't work he had his eye a razor blade smuggled into the prison and he cut the tattoo off\nAnd on the other prisoners saw that\nAnd what they saw it with somebody who believed so deeply was so rigorous in his adherence to Islam\nThat he became a naturally magnetic person for them later when he led al Qaeda in Iraq although he was a very effective leader in terms of moving around the battlefield it was that white hot zealotry that made people attracted to her\nWell it's so in a way as much as he was evil and he was your number one target on some way you respected him\nWell and I learned from him as well because in reality he was very effective and had I'd been on the same side is Sam I think he would have been a tremendous comrade and yet ... obviously I was opposed to ...\nSo uh so Leslie about what's going on in the world today a UC that we still have a war on terror ISIS has been a diminished\nOr Iraq has a shot if they could finally pick a a new government Afghanistan is very much up in a year when you look in the region do you look at a run at the root of most of the problems like this administration does\nAround a huge contributor to it and if you look at the Iranian Quds Force in other parts of their military that are [noise]\nAre helping Hamas Hezbollah other organizations and certainly pressure on Assad's regime yes what we're we seem to be involved in past just a terrorist period al ... in Iraq and ISIS and we're almost into regional great power politics between Iran Saudi Arabia the major players\nHow that plays out I could play out in ... in a major conflict or it could continue to burn up the periphery like Yemen and die in Lebanon\n[laughter] I Know the general or admiral McRaven was extremely critical of the president came out and gave some a blistering accounts or do you think he was right to do that I Do and because you agree with what he said or if you're a civilian you can answer at any moment anytime booze in uniform would you\nThe kids see it and they lose respect for authority and they end up doing whatever they want with no consequences then I think that's what the people down in South America the going on here they think they can just do what they want and I think Trump is\nTrying to avoid that trying to stop that kind of [noise] no\nI don't really think Democrats are behind it\nI think this is I I have a strong reports that Venezuela might be behind it\nThey think and because they're idiots they think is actually going to hurt President Trump has been extremely tough on them and plans on taking some type of action I think any should because they're destroying all of south and Central America and their propped up by Cuba's ... bad actors in prison Obama propped up\nAnd and and welcomed into the international community which they never should have been but I Do think that these people are financed I Do think they're closed I Do think they're pushed forward and I do think a lot of them inside our legitimately looking for a better life and want to save their families\nWe just can't be their answer we can't wholeheartedly taking forty five thousand people were taking hundreds of thousands a year we have millions here legally why do people think that it's selfish to act in your self interest is the responsible thing to do Michael W. when I say Michael\nHi and thank you for coming to knock off a last Saturday I doubt a great trip for you about coalition building or a based on the um we're only a give and Walt Disney and General McChrystal\nWhere do you find\nThis kind of civility\nIn American politics ... ascent chili killed off the president of the United states in a way\nThat makes them look like perfect gentleman we need in America and by the way that no that was eight and you're in a in a development there the artist\nThat's making that your um was born in ... he is from Mexican heritage he is married to a Russian from Siberia and uh I watch it or get a whole other managers\nThere are at Norfolk because his wife is a rising star\nAll right thanks Glenn a I'm a big fan of General McChrystal he's just he's not the biggest fan of President Trump and that's perfectly okay everybody has different styles I mean I look at a President Trump I don't think President Trump fires general crystal I think that President Obama fire General McChrystal about hearsay said to a ... a left wing magazine\nNothing to do with him this guy was featured on sixty minutes set to offer the surge was going to settle Afghanistan and he's pulled out of there because disparaging things were set about Joe Biden and the lack of leadership from the White House this White House this president who got over his ... with\nA Ted Cruz over his personal animosity with Marco Rubio got through the fact that Nikki Haley didn't endorse him and said some negative things about him and then hired her\nGeneral McChrystal saying negative things how accuse me General McChrystal staff say never negative things about vice president Biden and the president then Obama would never have gotten President Trump to fire him he just wouldn't do it he rebuke of publicly absolutely\nBut there'll be about it what thing uh I just I was like to thank all of everybody who came out in Tampa I like to thank everyone who came out Norfolk on Saturday everyone who came out in Nashville,

bit of a a it's a bit of a right turn but I Do want to bring it to anyone who says the ... the United states has been easy on Russia has not taken account that he spelled sixty or sixty or members of the Russian delegation close the Seattle a consulate of course gave lethal weapons to Ukraine\nAnd now a allows them to fight a and stick up for themselves against the Russians which President Obama never did and also isn't take into account there were about to pull out of the IMF treaty that the Russians have been violating here's Lindsey Graham cut thirty five\nAbsolutely the right move the Russians have been chanting the Chinese are building up a uh they're they're ... uh I like President Trump being tough\nThey walked away from the Iran they'll call us it was a joke of the deal you know Obama tried to ignore ended up paying the Iranians and see what you got I don't want to ignore and a piece of Saudi Arabia and because of\nThe many things to change I like being tough on Russia and walking away from this deal is a good that says that the Russians never honored their end of the bargain and the Chinese are moving forward their weapons program and we need to counter it\nUh that is a Senator Lindsey Graham who is critical to prison for not being stronger against Saudi Arabia has called out to prince\nWho said you better step but he said you better step aside at the same time stuck up for Brett Kavanaugh because he believes Brett Kavanaugh was the right guy was being just skewered by Democrats who saw nothing but political gain in labeling him was sexist a drunk or which is not true in either in either case\nAnd again Lindsey Graham calling balls and strikes but loves the fact that the president is calling up the Russians you know what happened when we signed this agreement are indeed goes out the window they're allowed to develop and cheat and we don't see you have no choice\nBut to pull out [noise] meanwhile I have to tell you uh take one atom of nitrogen

demanding entry how did we get to this what's it going to take to reform our immigration laws and what does this house is going to impact the election\nNumber one where\nThere isn't it different from past midterm says they're they're just not seem to be an appreciable fall off in the intensity in either party\nThat is true sixty days and counting to the most consequential midterms of our times whether GOP seemed to have secured the Senate or the president's approval ratings hits an all time high because his numbers save the house from Democrat control possibility whereas it gone how do we get it back with me right now is one of the great minds of the election by analysis\nAnd that is real ... up real clear politics a co founder Tom Bevan Tom welcome back to bring her to\nBe with you tell them what I Know your big average guy you don't overreact to any one poll that's that's what real clear about is taking the average but this Wall Street journal poll I found I found really a really interesting number one that has the president's approval rating at forty seven percent basically higher than President Obama's at the time how that happened\n[noise] [laughter] that's a good question it was a like a six month six point net gain for him over the last month um [noise] and uh what is this is a good trend for ...\nWas just a couple of weeks left I mean I obviously as you said um you know we don't try and focus on too much on any\nIndividual poll one poll but certainly this has good news for Republicans in the Trump getting more popular and he certainly you know if you look at it he's not getting more popular among Democrats they hated him from the beginning they still have them they don't give them any credit for anything so these games are really coming among Republicans and also independence and that's important\nOr as you know because these elections are going to turn on who goes out to vote in a lot of these swing districts and to the extent more Republican turnout and more independents are are are viewing the president favorably that's potentially really good news for\n... years which is not a when asked is your preference for the what is your preference for the outcome of this November's congressional elections who would you want to have power forty one percent say Republicans forty eight percent said Democrats\n[noise] yeah and that was the hotline national generic ballot number and nine percent that's a strong number for Democrats and that was completely jibe with the idea that they are on the verge of of taking control of the house representative getting you know well over the twenty three seats they need to to win control\nOf the interesting part about that though Brian as they sat in the in the wall Street Journal article that in competitive swing districts\nThat the Democratic advantage has almost disappeared and it's there basically running even what that suggests is that Democrats are maybe over pulling on the generic doubts really strong and very very blue areas of the country\nUm but but much more competitive in some of these swing districts and again\nThat's good news if you're a Republican running against suburban districts and in some of these various states um so keep an eye on that I mean I'm I'm I'm got a real close eye on the generic ballot but also um how that plays out in these individual districts 'cause that would really mattered\nThen well a couple of the things I Want to bring it to what is the most important factor in deciding your vote\nOr this is the first time I've seen this new one economy and jobs Twenty one percent that could explain the the approval rating going up for the president healthcare Seventeen percent to ... even though the Democrats did not run on Obamacare they now think they have the advantage on health care\nAnd changing Washington fourteen percent immigration is six does that change with this this image of a caravan storming our border\n[noise] sure I mean the the news will certainly Dr what ... what what voters are paying attention to and what their concerns are if you go back and look right after the Parkland shooting in Florida gun control shot up on the list of voter concerns\nOr to the top for a very brief period of time and then sort of settled back down to you know states has its its normal position in the in the issue matrix\nUm immigration has typically been\nPretty low um as a general election or mid term election it's it's certainly higher on the concerns of Republican voters be out of care of and the amount of attention that this is getting on news will definitely drive that\nThat issue up the ladder um the longer it stays in the news events election I think that's probably a benefits Republicans because that's one of them is one of Trump's her signature issues or it's one that he's seen as being really strong line and also puts Democrats in a really tough spot I mean what are they what are they going to say the voters\nAre they going to say no I I you know I Want everybody to come in um you know they have to sort of puts in a tough spot with their constituency\nIn terms of securing the border which again is not something that that the base of the party wants to hear but it would also turn off independents if there was a yeah we want to bring all seven thousand of them in um that the humane thing to do\nA very interesting I you know I just see these laws are so critical to stop it on a separate note elections aside I'm wonder if the president would do better to define what exactly the two thousand eight law they gave that single Central Americans to come here because Dianne Feinstein is behind it and that will be a very specific about people that everybody knows rather than\nSomething is overly broad where Democrats one open borders which leaves them open to or rejoined or\nUh I'm just curious to see how that plays cabinet was unexpected now the caravan is somewhat unexpected the one thing we know Tom is something that's going to happen that's unexpected whether it's going to be with Saudi Arabia and international affairs situation and security which Democrats seem to think they can make some ground on\nNow I since the average American doesn't really expect much from Saudi Arabia and thinks they did this and things we still have to be allies with them because in a bad area they might be a somebody we have to deal with do you think Saudi Arabia is an election issue\n[noise] no not really I think most Americans uh you know obviously they they to the extent they know anything about this news there there you know horrified by the fact that the journalist was killed and it was a gruesome or heinous act but in terms of it motivating people to vote one way or another\nDon't see it happening I'm you know the kind of thing that would motivate people\nIs is it a terrorist attack in a bit of that magnitude on our soil that would really sort of shock and galvanized the electorate but absent that it's typically not the case that you're going to see you know stuff that's foreign policy related or this or a day in day out type of foreign policy related news around the world is not really going to move voters and a significant\nWhat All right we're talking with Tom Bevan real clear politics cofounder I Want you to you with Jonathan Martin said about these midterms are the New York times and tell me if you agree cut Fifteen\nFor this different from past midterm says that that does not seem to be an appreciable fall off in the intensity and either party you know you guys know and two thousand six Democrats won big in part because the pay was depressed\nAnd twenty ten and twenty fourteen Democrats could knock it there are folks revved up when President Obama was not on the ballot this time got and it seems like both parties are fired up ready to go\nAnd it is in the numbers reflect that do you think is going to be over fifty percent of the population goes to vote I Do\nI think it's going to be huge and I'll tell you what it wasn't like this until the Capitol hearing Republicans were really having trouble getting their voters energized and getting them to pay attention and and all of that Kavanaugh hearings change that\nAnd the question was whether it was that the intensity the outrage all that stuff was going to sustain through the election um and you know we're halfway there two weeks basically\nUntil the election and it looks like it is at least for the time being the Republican energy has risen to match the enthusiasm of the Democrats pretty darn close to it and now that doesn't translate necessarily into votes but it certainly\nDoes appear that both sides you look across all ... all different demographic categories everybody seems pretty far it up to vote\nYeah let's go to the Senate if we can the president was in Nevada seemed to me the difference Dean Heller was once arch enemy and the Republican Party has a point ... all one point seven percentage average lead in Nevada said training in the right way for Republicans\nIt is a he was trailing in that\nIn the polls there for I Would say the better part of three or four months again until the cabin on her and then you saw Republicans coalesced behind them are behind Heller and uh you know I think Trump's\nTrump's appearance there helped helped also juice the base the most recent poll we have out of there as hell or up seven points that's a big number for him but he had gone without leading in the polls for um [noise] since all the way back to the end of July and now he's led you leading in the last polls that were taken in the end of September and the\nFirst two weeks of October so that's a pretty remarkable turnaround for Dean Heller of Nevada especially a state that Hillary Clinton won correct\nIn a state where Democrats feel part of the problem too for Democrats we've seen this appear in polls in Texas and Nevada and even a certain degree in Arizona they're not getting the support among Latinos if they mean Dean Heller is getting thirty seven thirty eight thirty nine percent of the Hispanic vote democratic cannot afford to give up that much of this ... expect to win either of these races\nSo you know that's counterintuitive for even while Republicans thought they thought if you talked about building a wall and uh and if you took on dark or a chain migration that would be a debt to the Hispanic vote that's not playing out\n[noise] it's not an ... it's not because um and we have talked about this before I mean the Hispanic vote is not a model is a you know\nYou see older Hispanics are much more conservative much more supportive actually of of legal immigration but opposed to illegal immigration the younger cohort of Hispanics who are much more liberal much more open to that sort of open borders type message and and really vote in pretty heavy number ... Republican but it's not just the you know\nThe Hispanic this\nBetty population votes is a solid block against Republicans and that's where I think folks like Dean Heller and and Ted Cruz have done a good job\nFor example some providers say they offer fast Internet and voice but they mean they offer a slow Internet that can't keep up with your business\nAnd one other providers say they have low
