and and I are right through work as it actually a four O. one K. that your peril detecting into\nYeah OK so one thing that you could do with these insurance proceeds is if you can increase what your deduct it from your pay\nTo go into the four oh one K. then maybe you can use the insurance proceeds to supplement the span double income that you won't have because now you are putting more into your account pre tax\nFollow that work Susan later you follow how that works yeah\nOkay good okay you know so that we'd be wanting to do so you could you can stashed away more until you you know are

nine nine eight zero zero\nYou know I just go do it for this week's edition of all the money all the best number to reach out during the week\nFlora seven eight six nine nine eight\nAnd what I think one of the reasons that people um like granite countertops is the organic nature of the each piece of stone right the beauty of it it almost looks like a piece of artwork each piece of stone it\nCan be amazing and you can have something that's unique or something that your neighbors don't have exactly the same I'm the same pattern the same color or the same especially substantially\nEspecially when you get into more exotic granted to natural stones\n... yes so um but now fast forward since when courts has been on the market for a long time but um it's predominant now um and I think part of the reason that a new correct me if if I'm wrong here but\nUm I think part of the reason that it's a gained a lot of momentum and gained a huge market share is because of the color palettes that become and the style and the fashion that's become very popular ah now and um and continuing\n... exactly the\nWay that it mimics the look of natural stone but the durability of a core of the court is the ... the main selling point why people want it because you have so many limitations with natural stone\nUm based on everybody wants that open concept as you know and so what these big islands you're able to use engineering courts style stone to span those lengths versus with natural stone you may not be able to do that\nRight and you know the um the granted that comes um natural stone okay granted I'm you know I I've always felt that if the stone can survive being blasted off the side of a mountain sliced up into slabs\nTransported across the ocean or you know from one continent to another uh survived being taken off the ship or in the container and then shipped to a local distributed or from the distributor to fabricate or and then from the fabric cater to your kitchen counter top\nUm I think it's pretty strong stuff\nUm the the fact of the matter though with courts counter tops\nThe courts countertops don't have any natural fishers or cracks or fault lines across them because I Am and made so you have complete control over the um the stability of the product or you're not limited in cut outs right like a lot you'll see 'em\nSink cut outs are basically the spot where the fabric caters want to hide the seem that's in the granite countertops um that you don't have to do that in the courts countertops\nWell no you don't sometimes you do just depending on you know the logistics of getting it into a house or about ... or something like that right but you definitely don't have to\nWrite and the um they'll that's another one of those things that the fabric caters are able to do that at the shop rather than on the job site if they do if they make a granite cut out I'm In the shop and then have to transport the granite with it being cut out\nUm and you just have a little three and a half four inch piece back behind where the faucet deck is and then there's the piece the small piece of ... there's a danger that it could crack\nWell to fabricate fabricate are taking a risk because if it cracks than they're the ones that need to get another slab need to re fabricate or they mended on site and then that doesn't make the homeowner very happy\nFor exactly right [laughter] so um we're we're going to talk a little bit more with Kelly about um the anti dumping tariff that was that we're going to talk about this after the break but I Do I Do just want to mention that for those that want to\nStay tuned because I think it'll be an interesting conversation but um and how the anti dumping tear up and how it's affected ah our industry and specifically the courts countertop um industry but um let's talk a little bit about the durability of the court's counter tops um and the maintenance procedures\nOf courts versus any of the other natural stones\nWill it's silent stone which is my product made by ... we have a twenty five year transferable warranty um so it is and we have a superior polishing system called end with this technology and all\nUp what now if I haven't heard of that I'm sure that the listeners haven't heard of that so let's talk a little bit about that\nWell they used to call ... antimicrobial properties to it but what that was just more of a superior polishing system now what they've done in Spain is they've even perfected that even more so the polishing system is even better so it's the end of this technology where what that polishing system does is it\nTo the microscopic I it takes less and the surfaces more polished so there's less pets in it so it's less able to absorb stains\nOkay All right so I'm Sorry so then continue along\nUm now I forgot where we were talking\nAbout the durability unlike maintenance between the\nAnd that's why you don't that's what the beauty of it with the end of this technology and the maintenance you don't need to\nBe as cautious with them with stains there is a lack of ... that comes with that end of this technology what the ... stone um you want to care for it as you would ... anything I'm an investment like that but um it's it\nYou know you ... anytime you really don't need you just clean it with regular maintenance with a quality court\nOkay and I ... so compare that to um granted okay but also I Want to set you up here so you can knock the side of the part I'm not just grab a but let's talk generally about the grab it and then compare that to your sense of product\nWell the thing that's the beauty of this house down the engineer court is because\nYou don't you have the durability of it with natural stone you have to feel it um and typically depending on the embrace of ... of the chemicals that you're using you need to seal it periodically mhm and so and then if you don't feel it and then you're going to get standing on it\nThat's the ... when we get calls from people and they say that they don't like their granted for whatever reason it's because they've\nThey've cleaned the sealer off it basically they'll use something that's abrasive although use of chemical that they shouldn't use on it um and we'll get that that those comments on that feedback from people sometimes well after ... refill it all the time or it looks though it's been looked like it used to and invariably it's because of that factor\nSo now um you have a product goes into you know has a product called son so\nYes we do and sent say as many as brought in from Brazil most of it um but we have a factory in Brazil and we apply product called St guard and it's basically in in ... nation of the stone so it's not a topical a sealer which most dealers or topical and so\nAnd you when that product is impregnated our factory in Brazil and then brought here to the United states and other places around the world and um you don't have to it's got a Fifteen year transferable warranty\nSo every time you're cleaning it and you're wiping it you're not wiping off that feeling that's on the top and then plus the stone is still able to breed\nNow you've ... you've mentioned that before about the stone breathing I remember last time that you just described that a little bit I mean to me that's a ... it sounds like it's porous and you have um but that's a that's a good thing\nAbsolutely because then you're not blocking it you're not trapping anything inside of their which you do with a lot of time you're\nTalking about what food particles or something\nOr act or even bacteria is okay you know because the thing with the natural ... said that it's a porous material\nOkay so I'm also there's another product or in addition to the style stone product that you are that goes into you know makes and then also the sun so granted um there's a product called decked him yes that Tom I'm\nSo described that product um and then I think we'll go to break in the ... where I Do want to talk about this anti dumping tariffs that was\nUm passed recently um and the effects of of that on on the building industry or coming out of it now if you want to hold on to the took all talk about on the other side let's do that I Hope we don't have the phone numbers and your calls so let's give up the phone number\nIs obsolete for for two two zero

I probably have six or eight projects around the house that I got to eighty five Ninety percent done 'em and then they they just remain on done for whatever reason and one of the three reasons is that you simply just run out of time\nTo do these things and whether it's because life gets in the way\nUm my mom is home convalescent\nUh this weekend after a brief or stay in the hospital so uh and I know she's our she's our biggest fan pile did you know that\nMy mom not she listens without fail every weekend so good morning mum hope you're feeling better I Would have thought Tim pat Iraqis mom would be the biggest fan or probably her as well Tim from accurate window and door is I'm not here this week so yeah it bill ... biggest century store you know so sometimes life just gets in the way\nI'm or you know you're a victim of your own poor planning for the project my maybe you forgot about something that needed to be done or you do something out of sequence\nUm you know bad scheduling on these things but life gets in the way on these on these things and then it just I have a light that's been out for my under cabinet lighting\nUm and my dad came over and we tried to find there's a breaking the line somewhere the power's not getting from the transformer to the fixture itself although everything test positive we still we were never able to unwind then thankfully it's just in this one little section where it doesn't really matter if we have this light\nThe president to make the comment in an interview with CBS sixty minutes why we're expecting a dry weather weekend and no rain news under six point five double duty below interacting with radar we got a sunny eighty in Orlando\nSkill Kelly from Orlando this morning news we get to the news and information every\nMorning as your hobby into the car for nine o'clock Brian kill leaders actually talking to the newsmakers and that's what's so great show that's an advocate for that only tell you what I think's going on but you can tell me what you think's\nGoing on from your perspective I feel like we have a dialogue to Bryan feel weekdays I knew the voice by family the the\nReason we invented things like same day delivery and TV and Jay in the same jar we love convenience which is what makes Kaiser Permanente so special we offer health care coverage together rather than having your doctor over here and your insurer there we provide quality health care in coverage under one roof\nBring you up for other important tasks like making a sandwich Kaiser Permanente together we thrive in Haiti dot org slash integrated because when they when they think we're particularly when it when he's ...\nMetro PCS is now metro buy T Mobile [noise]\nNow you get new plans with unlimited high speed data all month long all under the mobile networks [noise] check out the new metro buy T Mobile today and discovered the smarter way to get unlimited metro buy T Mobile [noise]\nDuring adjusted the fraction of customers even greater than thirty bucks for a month later this reduced the metro customers ministry speeds versus on the mobile customers that extreme to forty percent of their own some areas the store for details in terms and conditions\nProgressive present ... view insurance stuff\nOut your blood you mean a possum [laughter]\nAt all when you want to pay for insurance and hope you find out you don't get me to get pumped out get out\nKnow I hear your budget oh wait that's just those kids laughing at me\nAnd of course the casualties insurance company that the price of protests limited by state law\nYou reach the high that's not good news bad news my family has fallen out of\nThe old maybe I'll maybe I'll back dial on the ballot or maybe up to ... percent off what why did well maybe maybe not going to be present dorm I I think\nLincoln plots grab genes from just Fifteen bucks I don't know for kids under ... for them just like forget newsletter and maybe\nI said well maybe I'll attend tended to Nineteen like ethylene\nSaturday evening sevens and IBM hot news Ninety six point by Wu De Vito presented by corona cigars with locations in downtown landowners sent like Dr phil ups and like Mary\nGuarding your nest egg with Mike Lester me at times make us feel a\nBehind when it comes to money have you ever so nobody says are term keeping up with the Joneses anymore because they're the crash in the ... that's right [laughter] or something part of transitioning and retirement is to know that you're going to be able to do what does he want to do\nCheck out guarding your nest egg with Mike Lester Saturday afternoon it won for Sunday afternoon it windy here on news Ninety six five security and security they member spinner SAP [noise] men\nAre used to bring from E.
