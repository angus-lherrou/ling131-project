K. O. uh for two thousand twenty how do you feel about that\nWell you and I should both reach out to ... or ... bill shine it was now deputy White House communications director and convey exactly that message here's what I think I think Donald Trump as a movie star\nHe's very very charismatic he is wearing well even on the people who hate him or he the more you see um the better you like him but you're absolutely right\nThe more you see an acting presidential are responding to citizens questions now it's just reporters' questions but in a town hall setting as you suggest he can answer these questions more thoughtfully and and nobody can hold a candle to him who will the Democrats put up to contradict him Cory Booker I don't think so I\nIf I said I don't think so Nancy Pelosi I don't think so I think that he is the best salesman the Republicans have the ... and the and the as the this unusual phenomenon that the more you see him the more comfortable you are with it right I think that he should really stay out their answer every question they can\nEvery time there's a gaggle a you know stop do more interviews do more town halls especially I I think that uh he is definitely the most potent campaign or the Republicans that seemed\nLike Chris Wallace and my first hour who disagreed with everything I said Geraldo Rivera started me on this hour almost agreeing with me my self esteem is back and I thought it was gone forever [laughter] so I'm going to bring it to some this what the Donald Trump critics had something to go on in the in the wake of what happened with ... and it looks like even the president ... killed\nNow trying to find out why the president said this last night caught one\nGreat get smart and by the way never wrestle him\n[noise] any\nBody clammy my highest shouldn't say that there's nothing that we endorse ... very early but I had heard that he body slammed reporter\nSo they say in the wake of that murder should the president be saying that and then there's the cascade of outrage where do you stand around there\nI think that this uh you know this\nKind of a tossing is where you have to stay on one topic why didn't you go down to the victims of hurricane Michael immediately why did you wait a week why did he hold the rally before you went why this way that I think we have to get over that you know people have become part we caught meant car\nMental wise compartmentalize these issues I I you know I took seriously of secular about the immigrants uh I been I laugh about something else the body slam thing I mean ... what led him joke about it I mean\nHe said that he wants to kick the s a Trump says President Trump said he went to kick somebody's ass or a you know let let him be himself live I say the same kinds of\nThings I mean it's ... the presidential where it's appropriate I thought that in that crowd particularly that was a good crack in terms of what happens if you're asking you about the show is murder and what the United States should do I have a solution just asked me anytime\nA first off before the solution to set up the president will pause according to the secretary state and wait for the Saudis to conduct an investigation Jack Keane weighed in cut thirty one\nFirst of all this was a serious setback for the relationship no mistake about that also the reality is\nThat the relationship with the kingdom of Saudi Arabia and the United states is in the U.S national interest that will also guide us in terms of what we're going to do about this obviously I Believe there'll be severe punishment meted out by the United states\nThat you set up tell me the punishment that works but saves the relationship\nFirst of all I totally agree with everything general Kane does I urge people to listen to him when he speaks he has no political agenda he's\nA hero retired four star\nOr a Roger ales hired him for a reason is the best of the military analysts I really I Love the guy\nAnd I I really appreciate everything has to say here is what we do here is what I suggest and here's what I Will recommend it to the president or either via tweets or more directly we sell Saudi Arabia all these arms\nIt's well over a hundred billion dollars it's a lot of jobs tens of thousands of jobs at Boeing and a Raytheon and these other defense contractors and so forth we don't want to cut off our noses despite\nOur face as a as as a as Michael ... says the secretary of state Saudi Arabia has been our historic ally for over Ninety years we should keep it that way although they must be severely punished here is the punishment that makes sense\nWe sell them these fighter bombers we sell them the jets we train their pilots we sell them the bombs and missiles that the jets fire but we do more than that as these Saudi\nAir force jets take off for Murray out of the other bases in Saudi Arabia to fly to Yemen\nTo because they are not very good the Saturday pilots because their intelligence uh sucks because they don't care\nThey use our bombs to bomb ... civilians and schools and so forth it is absolutely appalling the way the Saudi Arabians are waging\nThis war so here's what we do do you know that these bombers and around from Saudi Arabia to Yemen either en route to the bombing or more particularly as they are returning from these bombing runs that our medical out\nThis horrible civilian casualties they are refueled Bryant they re field by American tankers\nFlown by American pilots how is that\nThat we allow our pilots and our resources the refueling resources to be used in this horrible\nAnd so when you and me that way we\nStopped the refueling at least we can do that it is a concrete steps it will punish the Saudis without affecting the strategic relationship\nOn another note let's go to the phones Bob listening ah news Ninety six father land do hey Bob\n[noise] hey I've got five thanks a George Foreman I worked with George Foreman for two weeks when he fought Scotland too\nAnd he is a real man he says he's just a way cups of course on us and just IQ Brian you know and I really didn't like to hear 'cause I was talking about honesty when he said a ... and oh

J. listeners or had been so great to the show news talk when I'm five nine uh but uh I committed to doing this but then I got a quarter Dolan says Brian I'd like you to come to the Al Smith dinner be my guest and be on the day is\nAnd it looked like a great time although I Would have had to rented a tale because I don't have tails so I did say myself money\nThat is good All right let's go out to the calls Mike listen W and db in Daytona Florida Mike\nHey Brian thanks for taking my call yeah I'm Brian ... square now is on your face or why Ted Kennedy and Dianne Feinstein and all these liberal Democrats want open borders they want to let people in because\nThey want more votes Brian I didn't expect your spokesmen from the immigration a department to say that because she wants to remain non political book Brian\nThey understand they are losing they need more votes they get 'em in here they get them on the welfare system and who's going to vote against somebody that sending them to check every month Brian are you an\nIdea that that that is the theory might I've heard that before I don't think it's going to be effective and the word is the Hispanic vote is a is remarkably undemocratic considering they usually get about eighty percent Hispanic vote and it's got the Democrats panicked but now you have a situation where central and south Americans are coming in and you heard that a hundred thousand\nA hundred thousand a year four thousand a day and they've been able to stay\nAnd they're in our system and who knows who they're voting and I'll be honest I'm not convinced that there's enough of background check to know who's voting\nThat would be the point in my time W O o K v in Jacksonville Hey Tom\nHow're you doing today good will tell you one quick\nQuestion you know if the federal government is hands are tied with these loopholes on a child's involved they got to release but once they're released why can't we have like the local sheriff ghetto without the child today to order that way more of a grassroots effort I no\nNo no no you need to do that you need ice and now ISIS the bad guys are because they got to go around and do their job\nBut the thing is they didn't violate they just haven't shown up for the hearing and they've melted into our system and they rip the banquet bracelets off they told me last night the ankle bracelets useless so we have no ... there right now catcher releases there you can't keep someone that within twenty days you can't process I mean twenty days therefore the law says let them go\nAnd that is unbelievable it's so easy to solve this solved the Mexican issue because the Mexican you saw that Ninety nine percent of the people coming in or not Mexicans oh GM's other the Mexicans they solve the problem by making it worse and Mexico essentially says oh lay\nGreg W. H. I. O. in Dayton, Ohio quick Greg what team on\nHow you doing sir I appreciate you taking my call and we'll never been hearing a lot of rumors on Fox News channel that sorrow supposed to be just care about and\nThat I have no proof of that I read Venezuela is playing a role in that caravan\nWhy can't they be charged with human trafficking I mean that's illegal I mean why why can't they charge you never hear anybody being charged once they find out that they're supporting money issues for bringing these people in\nThe good point but I I don't know if it's been I don't know if it's been tracked back to Soros or if that's just people's the arising that Greg it is frustrating W. H. I. listeners have a chance to see Steve do see in person I think tonight\nThat's great also everyone here is ... or ... in Florida right around the Tampa area thanks so much for housing me today W ex JV [noise]\nMaybe six point five but there will be a baby with him Orlando by new sound window for new saying about media group says it's time to time to join them really\nMetro PCS is now metro buy T

unlimited metro buy T Mobile\nDuring a just a fraction of customers even greater than thirty bucks for a month later to reduce the metro customers mental just review speeds versus on the mobile customers video streams of forty percent of the some areas the store for details in terms of conditions\nIs news Ninety six point by having the the ... window turns first for breaking news\nFour hours a day\nIn traffic on the turnpike while I Can't help me there but at least I can tell you why it's our top local story at eleven o'clock news Ninety six twenty five WTO lots of even sitting in traffic since around nine this morning to Florida highway patrol investigating a fatal accident on the turnpike\nIt happened around eight thirty this morning as an unidentified Marion County man pulled over from the south bound lanes and the turnpike not far from the beach line another vehicle drifted into the emergency lane hitting the man as he tried to get out of his vehicle the Fifteen year old victim declared dead at the scene strippers tell us charges are pending against the woman who hit him\nSinger still historic lows in terms of the number of people crossing the border it's just now they're coming more family a little bit from last year but it's still way lower we\nGradually uh we just heard from Katie a from a from Katie Waldman da da da de does that bother you hundreds of thousand a year they all get to stay\nBecause of the laws that Dianne Feinstein put on the books in two thousand eight Bill Clinton did in two thousand will explain the loopholes to you because central and South America to get it out meanwhile that cat is getting closer and closer as about four thousand plus\nA Hondurans get closer and closer to Mexico's border will they be able to stop the ... before they get to our border\nSo far I think the answer might just be yes I\nAm one it's got to be an election\nOf those things is law and order\nAnd remember it's going to be an election of the caravan you know what I'm Talking about\nThese days and counting until Trump gets his mid term report card is crowds who growing they are getting louder in bigger like the one in Montana last night but he has his party problems deeper than he thought has tendencies Senate race is now a dead heat that once belonged to Bob Corker in a very red state\nAnd is the ruined their report is true that the person is already given up on the house I say absolutely\nNot ... even the person's given up about the prospects of him actually being alive the evidence seems to be mounting did he not only was killed but he was tortured Dan ... from what you've seen do you believe or the reports coming mostly from turkey sources\nWell a first burns great to be on the show um yeah I think cooperate what we're hearing from the Turks and back over to our intelligence community I have no doubt that we have a significant amount of intelligence collection will be called unilateral collection so that's\nA CIA and that day and others doing the work to determine exactly what happened and determining whether the Turks official rendition rings true it looks to me on the surface of it like it does we know showed answered that conflict we know that Fifteen\nSaudis at least four of them apparently were part of MBA at the security detail and and there was a horrendous that Dr Stanley there's an audio tape that we haven't\nHeard yet but which many believe exist um\nYou know with the internationally recognized more uh espionage and I'm quite sure the Turks have they've got all sorts of collection on the consulate and they know what happened is I Will just say Brian last like\nThis fits the Saudis have been hard on just sense for sure but it is taking this to a conflict over seas which is eminently discover of all is out of pattern even for them\nSo you see it out of pattern which makes you suspicious\n[noise] it it it's just I'm\nAn important moment I think uh for us to assess if I were at the CIA I'd be asking for the leadership profile which CIA prepares I every foreign leader up my ... been thumb on he had been rash of times and I think the question is what he really have done something like\nThis with which again is so eminently discovered but you're talking about Fifteen guys traveling in a gulfstream going through passport control using the Saudi conflict or to torture and just member which I'm up to show the\n... they could have bought 'em over on the streets of Istanbul but they decided not to do that um he had been hard on the set up and put people in jail you had a lot of his own family and business people at the rips I'm a ... century house arrest\nA man has it taken it to another level and I think many found it to be unbelievable but at the days go on you know what I expect to see if our Congress will bring\nThe intelligence community senior officials foreclosed testimony it solves the Senate intelligence community's house or Senate insults you may want to know exactly what happened then they'll do it um and I don't doubt that that the public the u._s. public well we'll get to know exactly what happened down the road\nHere's Mike Pompeo yesterday I'm not happy with this decision cut twenty six we made clear to them\nSo we take this matter misery very seriously\nThey may be the thing to understand the serious nature\nThe disappearance of research\nThey also are sure to me that they will conduct a complete\nSurrounding reserve unit they will do so in a timely fashion\nReport in South where we print burn where everyone is saying\nThey're investigating themselves stand\nRight now so it's up to a company I was actually doing some good\nPublic diplomacy here with the Saudi if they look it's over to you to do the investigation but under the surface he told them I'm quite sure\nA lot of people are watching and we all know where it starts to compare use to service director of CIA or I'm sure that that\nHe told the Saudis when he met with ... treat told them that look we have intelligence collection on this so when you come out with your answer it better be consistent with the fact is we know them the other thing that's probably happening that no one is really talking about is if given the fact that ... ... a lawful a permanent residents cannot stay a green card holder\nOr he's got three children of his four were us citizens I'm sure the FBI is engaging with their Turkish and fatty counterparts not so much to collect evidence but rather to examine the evidence\nOr there's probably a lot happening beneath the surface um that Secretary Tom Perez not talking about and he's very aware of the potential for collateral damage on our bilateral relationship with Saudi Arabia for us to try to avoid that so it's hard to thread that needle prime\nWell you you know the deal or Saudi Arabia with their their uh the way they cut the way they treat their people's terrible it's supposedly getting marginally better but we have similar interests we want to counter the rise of run in the region now they suddenly are open to putting together a Middle East peace in working with Israel\nWe also we are concerned but they are more concerned about the rise of the who the rebels will to the Iranians over in neighboring Yemen\nAnd if you're going to control al ... and ISIS a lot of them come from our finance from different sources within Saudi Arabia so since we working together why would they they put that on the line I Would you be as a leader Dan hopping willing to risk all that because of this horrific murder\n[noise] so there's there's something that for me have got to be immune from whatever tension there isn't a bilateral relationship but I can tell you I served in Russia for five years we maintain some level of collaboration with the Russians on counterterrorism we have to do that a citizen safety\nAnd our homeland is that it would be otherwise that Rick I'm so we do have a strategic partnership with the Saudis but at the same time\nWe have um how long history of defending human rights and while we respect the territorial integrity of other\nNations we also recognize that when human rights are violated\nInternational law there is cause then there is reason uh to intervene Clinton ministry and did nothing about Rwanda for example of genocide there that's probably the best example of of a reason to interfere in somebody else's internal affairs in this case um again I think the administration is going to have to draw\nSome sort of a line between what is the greatest value if I were for us to teach a partnership with the Saudis that we're going to carry on\nAnd they're not a monolith either I mean we do a lot of work with the intelligence services that should carry on that should be immune to anything that happened but our bilateral relationship with much\nUm but we have to think about how we manage that relationship and sometimes the best way to manage it is by keeping them close um and uh and delivering the tough messages to them rather than necessarily\nEliminating the partnership on which both nations rely\nYeah but I ... which is I mean we have Lindsey Graham basically called on the ... for the resignation of the crown prince I'm not sure that's going to happen ... says don't usually resigned from things but I mean what is the pound of flesh that we need\n... and it's good that you raise the Congress because uh I'm sure that something that secretary palm pale having come from the Congress would have told the Saudis look on like you we have a representative government and\nLike it or not our Congress has got to be out front here doing things that you might not like like breathing millet trying to bring the military sales or imposing sanctions and the Congress can do a lot of things to make it really hard on our relationship with the Saudis that white incumbent upon Saudi Arabia to deal with if I'm In a transparent way\nIt could as I think your next guest David Ignatius is going to say it could be a real tipping point for our relationship with the Saudis and the relationship in the region this calls for you know the most sophisticated uh diplomacy I'm Glad my palm pay up at the helm if there's somebody who could manage to pay him but he's going to have to manage\nThe value of a strategic relationship\nAnd then what is inconsistent for us as bad as the support of human rights and and dealing and holding the Saudis\nAccountable for what a Paris appears to be a critically murder but they do want to do all\nDay and do you think is a major thing here is to show every journalist out there not only will we kill you we will do it in a painful way and we will do it any we're not used to when you come to Saudi Arabia but you're not safe anywhere is that the message that it's worth giving\n... right well that the question I've been asking myself the unknowns in this case or what were the orders that were given to those Fifteen guys who gave the orders for the ...\nFirst carried out as they were intended to be carried out or you know those are those are really important question to be up in the post mortem who reported among those and got back to the kingdom\nAnd energy knows the answers to those things and the conclusion that the dark side of me\nTo draw the conclusion you just true which is they get a discoverer of away so that all the other journalists Korean so they take care of their internal dissent by themselves but this is about\nDon't want to see people that are are wanting to live off our welfare system here I Need to see professional people coming through the lines people that want to work and people are ready to work because we have the jobs we just need it and for any truck driver over the road right now\nRocket city in that city these drivers\nOK Chuck where do we get a hold of you if we want to drive for you\n[noise] ah well you can call me um or you can email me
