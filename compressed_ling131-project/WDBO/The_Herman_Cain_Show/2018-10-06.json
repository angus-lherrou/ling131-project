the first sort of hide advisory corporation registered investment advisor on line to financial group dot com\n[noise] this is six point five ...\n[noise]\nThe final segment on the money's a certified financial group showing for for two two zero zero nine six five is last chance to get your question answered by Aaron Burr Nancy ... here in the studio again aid for for two two zero zero\nNine six five says somebody had written into Facebook asking about a ... attack site I went to when I can remember it mhm and our eighth um Web guru found the clips that I talked about it on ... and he is editor face paid\nFire you go absolutely so you just go to ... votes in the ... it's in the comments section of this live video so if you want to go watch Nancy's a Youtube video from when she was on and Bush was on channel channel that acts\nAnd then you ... you get the information about the tax said\nAll right well speaking of a Facebook questions we've got one here from a Joshua ... what are your thoughts on a Florida prepaid program versus a five twenty nine plan for college planning five twenty nine is better which state do you recommend well we actually get\nThis question a lot because people with children are looking at college expenses and they're trying to figure out the best way to pay for it and first let me just talk about five twenty nine plans real quick a five twenty nine plan is nothing more than a savings plan that allows you to put money into it for college every state has one\nAnd you put the money and for college it grows tax deferred and if you use it for qualified educational expenses that comes out tax free and the new tax law actually just change it so that you can pull out some of that money for pre college dollars for tuition as well for private schools\nAre but I'm not going to get into that yet I'm about twenty dollars every state has them which is the best one to use a funny that you can use any states five twenty nine to pay for your college in any state\nSo really what we always say is go find the ones with the best investments are the best um or the lowest fees and go find a five twenty nine plan that will work for you we've we've had a lot of success I personally I think he's the one in Arizona is as my kids but I used to be in Virginia 'cause I really liked the plans over there\nOr the Florida plan I have not seen a lot of people use the Florida plan and it's so I don't know too much about it but again you can go and do research to find the best by twenty nine for you and it's really gonna depend on what a sort of investment vehicles you want to use because every five twenty nine plan has specific investment providers that they are allowing their platform\nAnd if he can he do five twenty nine than I I suggest that the owner of be\nA grandparents or aunts or uncles for the child if the child has any opportunity to qualify for grants or loans their scholarships and the parents don't own the five twenty nine and it's not reportable on financial statement oh that's another way to have those dollars work\nAnd if your kid does get the grants or loans their scholarships then you can change the beneficiary and the Dallas can go to somebody out very can't even you end up going back to school you can use those five\nAnd a nine dollars if you're doing that after your kids are all died out so let's talk about prepaid real quick well I I\nI think that it because it's constant gotten so crazy um to do at least two years in state I think is a good idea you know everybody has to take the same prerequisites to face the same classes to you know the basics to get him out of the way so\nCan be in state for the first two years in ... in fees housing if they're if they're not going to be going to one of the local state colleges is not a bad thing\nUm I Will say right futures will cover some\nA tuition you will realize when you're looking at cost for expenses for college is really one of the smaller class in ... um it's it's the housing and the fees and the books and everything else that ends up really costing the big box as far as college\nGo the other Florida prepaid used to be a pretty bad deal it was a good deal and then it was a bad deal and now they changed the law again and now it's actually not a bad deal it's it's a pretty good deal for those people that want to stay in state\nAnd so you know they will also if you if your child chooses to go out of state they will pay the same amount that you would have received in states that had a State University so it's not that you you lose those dollars ... yeah so it's not a bad deal you can actually buy a whole year worth of tuition or if you have grandparents that may be inclined or\nSomething like that it's a it's not a bad way to look at it as well so\nUh it the five twenty nine website Florida prepaid dot com it go check it out um for the Florida prepaid and then you could also learn about the Florida five twenty nine savings planning there as well\nBut the prepared like Nancy ... for a couple of years not a bad idea\n... two minutes left here before the show I wanted to give out the workshop dates one more time yes so

on Facebook Live in the studio very\nOh yeah but again that's going to do it for this week's edition of the money with a certified financial group we had been planning tomorrow today we'll see you next week [noise]\nThis is news Ninety six point by your baby were Orlando turns first for breaking news\nAnd the land like ocean so you know at the end of the day everybody's windows will meet the you know what the state says because you cannot sell a window in the state of Florida unless it gets a notice of approval from the state so you know at the end of the day you know everybody's going to get a good window and Home Depot their windows\nAre made by all the national manufacturers you know so when we go back to tie it back to that\nThey all you know we'll meet the minimum requirements of the state I'm ... from the big box stores is do it yourself things so you you know if you don't know what you're doing\nYou know when you buy in from them you're going to get a sub camp and you know I hear war stories about what subjects do and what they don't do and you know I'm actually going to a house my Monday where\nWhere I'm going to look at it they look at a job that another competitive see if we can see what they do it because they didn't do their exact measures properly uh\nTrying to catch my breath or a little bit nuts okay no I don't you get you but you're on a roll their I could say [laughter] ...\nNot only that with the windows and the final a double framed the style there's just so many options and and if you're of vinyl framed window who would be the target customer for that type of product\nYeah well basically now the state is is basically said you know if you're going to sell vinyl in this in in the state of Florida or window it's gonna be vinyl I'm adjusting my by Amir tai chi that's all right so he can move\nDown where you normally said it said that Iraqis minor either a usually on my for anything he's being thrown off by a been going on in the area and I was just ... yeah so yeah but ah what's that question again\nWhile I was going to say you know we talk about all the different types of ah windows and I said vinyl frame for example you know who was the target you know if I if I'm looking to buy windows from my house what am I looking for so I just picked it up with vinyl frame you know what are the benefits and cons of of of vinyl front window\nRight well the big difference between vinyl looming um is you know there are multiple number one aluminum will conduct eaten cold so what we were talking about earlier in the show\nWill you know you're going to feel the cold in the in the wintertime when you pass it and you're going to be air conditioning in the yard in the summertime when you get direct sunlight on those frames you literally and that's an east west in southern exposures I'm a ... by aluminum frame window you can put an egg on it and fry it because they just conducts and if you feel the inside of your home\nThe heat will have already penetrated 'cause of the illuminate does conduct eaten cold\nConversely with vinyl if it's a non uh it doesn't conduct eaten cold so as a result what I tell people and I I have I've had my windows in my home for ten years\nWhat you're going to get is the inside temperature of both the frame and the glass is going to be what your room temperature is and that's and that's when it's direct sunlight on\nThose windows so that you know that's kinda nice where you can stand in front of you you know your window and you're not going to get sunburned I'm half hour or so you know I I go out in the sun I get a little color almost immediately\nBut you're not going to have any fading of your of your furniture window treatments carpeting flooring and things like that because it will be no UV rays coming past the doors\nSo it you know at the end of the day you know you're going to get something that's way better than you know that what what you'll get but the vinyl is very important in Florida because we are so hot here that they are trying to eliminate solar heat game into the home\nAnd that and um you know when you pull permits and things you know the municipalities roll with all different some don't really care about the solar heat gain undercover if you have sliding glass doors and things you know so we can give you a clear glass but we need to check with the municipality and make sure to pass the the L D inspection\nYou know each municipality is totally different even though the state has what the requirements are each municipality has their own set of rules\nUm you know and as a sidebar on that one brandy who is our our general contractor and does all the permitting is you know I mean it's it's fun to watch or you know roll their eyes and do things because each municipality is you know some require for copies\nThat'd be saying and it's kinda like well you guys all have all this paperwork there and what we have to send you anything because everybody knows you know the state provides everybody with everything but you know they put it on the uh the contractors and you know everybody else to provide them to get permits and things and but you know it's you know we we get them done it's just a matter of you know each one is a little bit different [noise]\nYeah so uh you know at the end of the day I die I don't know if I mentioned at the same in power one of my really really good friend is a a what's going to be my you know I'm here so right now but yeah I texted him this morning I said he remembered to bring your ... your headphones within I got I got a text back almost immediately said to him\nYou know I was called me and he's a first responder he's asked her to the uh the the uh downtown me church\nHe's also um and it's a promotion he just got which is an awesome he uh he he's he's a two time Purple Heart you know when you have in the winter gravy I come back from overseas and it was ... almost well it was but it was in October so it was and that was his last tour because he was\nA ... inactive reserve which means you can call them up to your thirty five years old mhm well now you know the same it's thirty five so yeah there you go but you know for thirty this morning he got a phone call and up and out and go into something Orange County that was important so\nYou know I just wanted to give him a shot I 'cause I mean you know thirty five years old this guy's going I mean I'm I'm old and he's done a heck of a lot more in his life in a short life than you know that we all have so\nYou know next time I get that our for you you know with no one wants to show up in the gym and we'll get your back in here\nAnd that you know take some doctors have yet either that there is a good guy we love to have him back in your face is do we\nAre talking about windows enclosures I Will moving to enclosures now you don't see many of them but there seem to be pop\nBack up again yeah you know enclosures is you know an interesting dynamic with accurate window and door it's not like we go looking for him but when we're out in you know we're looking at windows and doors on the main part of the house and they have a screened in porch\nYou know they popped the question you know can we get more square footage you know at a uh by by doing windows and things and that and I'll look and get some measurements ... we can see what we can do so\nThe main thing is is the roof it has to be with us the main route flying of the of the home if it's an added a you know the aluminum flat roof and all that other stuff\nWe we just don't been those because to attach a window to the top of that thing that just might pull that whole roof down so you know at the end of the day we we we shy away from them because it's just a nightmare\nAnd we would probably be out there there's other ... you know there's this you know in construction he they they you know Rick is you know as a as a friend he advertises on W ... and a few minutes ago\nYou know ... they're the experts in that and I read a lot of help people that 'cause I'm not going to waste your time or my time when I Know I'm not going to be able to do it right in that but when we do it I'm doing one we just got the deal this week from Jerry we talked about um last week out in Mount Dora\nAnd uh you know we made some modifications to what he wanted he wanted a set of French stores uh on one side of the opening\nA so that he could get furniture in and out because of going into the home has French doors so he's going to have you know six foot it'd be ... to get things in which makes it easier\nUh the thing he wants is it's a western exposure so we're going to put Energy Star rating glass Gary Cooper who is are you know he does a lot of construction indoors and all that type of work is going to build a twenty four inch in the wall\nAnd you know so that we have something to the rest of the windows on and then he'll lay that he'll insulated he'll he'll he'll stucco blended or or do whatever the customer wants them finishing standpoint we put the windows and\nHe will now have probably two thousand two thousand two hundred more square feet maybe up to fifty of livable space uh-huh VIP has a ceiling fan and there he has a small air conditioner he can compare their you know I tell them you know what if you if you if you get your keep your friends' doors open you're going to get some air there\nUh it'll only get a teeny bit you know from the roof little hotter in the in the western exposures you know there but\nAt the end of the day you know he wants more he wants more square footage and not have to spend an arm and a leg to do it so we you know we do um I tell people when I come back to the office with it you know they you know Frank are apps manager will look I mean you go what did you find that I go out and walk and while I went looking for people call us\nWe are very capable as a license you know us presidential stay contractor so you know we have the wherewithal to do everything our guys uh you know we're all owners\nThey know their stuff I Am very fortunate that I Do the sales I Do the radio show they kind of gave me the title of president 'cause we all make our own titles up 'cause we own the company\nYou know that so but we don't put any titles on our business cards because you know I was out you know doing some talking the other day I was ... you know checking a lock on my hands and knees\nTeam over their great team over there\nAnd that yeah we we all on and we're all friends we all you know there's there's no there's no drama or anything we you know just try to work hard play hard trying to remember to keep it in that order\nMhm well you know if you have a a windows problem or a door

ready to deliver a major political victory to President Trump and GOP leaders giving the president to justices in less than two years on the Supreme Court the final vote should come around five pm on what is most certainly a day of celebration for the Trump White house\nFor two three five five six one let's go to work first in line is Saturday morning is Linda from when a garden Linda you're on news Ninety six five go ahead\nSorry thank you for taking my call your uncommon for\nOur allies as his father passed away for a month ago and\nUm another uh her sibling and his wife are taking care of that ad allied but in any event\nUm my my sister in law had texted um family to find out about if gates or I Will\nBecause she hadn't heard anything right and\nUh uh she got was that um her father had on pretty much a used up the is the address is first that trash while he was still that\nThey are right and that uh\nShe always told at a house that they had ... had been given to my sister in law was a sister in law has as that that that was her ... and that she was not in the will or anything else and\nThat that person who is relative is I'm a executor at the state and she says that she's under no obligation according to her attorney chip provide any more information\nWell that were kind of like what do we\nKnow what do you do so Linda there was a lot of ... and she's in inlaws a nurse so I don't fully understand your facts situation but it is taking place in Florida\nYes it is so what counties the property located in\nThat property that they had in the LA county property was already sold a long time ago\nWhat I thought you said there was a piece of property that was sold or transferred to one of the kids are cousins or somebody\nIt was okay my sister lives with her father had passed away they had Curtis teeth and they had purchased a home I gather\nCry or an author and that we're living in that then the matter passed away author was taken by on the other siblings and his wife\nTo Lake County and then eventually I get the help that I don't know what happened to that helped that night\nHow seeds okay we're I don't\nKnow if that guy if they later or what\nLinda I bet there where it's it's a shame and so Linda there's nothing I can do for you over the radio today do you want to come see me there ... or ... comic the offices we got to get a little bit better clear understanding of this but hey the bottom line folks is is that\nWhen I first started doing wills trusts and probate thirty five years ago kids were straight in square with each other when mom and dad passed away they were fair with each other when mom and dad passed away\nMore and more these days when mom and dad passed away the kids are trying to take advantage of the situation well mom was alive well after she died trying to get more than his or her share and it's just a crying shame is just a sign of the times whatever that means\nBut the bottom line is that if you're a parent out there and you want to avoid your kids arguing and hating each other when you die\nThe key is that you get some good planning in place and so that when you happen it all happens kinda automatically and there was no opportunity for one of your children to take advantage of the situation\nSo Linda you can call me next week we can try and get through a little bit more detail but the bottom line is\nFolks let's try to avoid what's happened to ... family here and that requires that you get some good planning done come see me making a point and come see me I Do a friend to free initial console to talk about your estate planning our goal make things simple easy inexpensive when you pass away and\nAvoid your kids hating each other when you pass away call me attorney tunnels and at the ... next week will set up a free appointment when I did not mean to turn that into a commercial I'm just trying to forewarn people out there about what can happen Linda feel free to call me dumped six week I'll be happy to talk to you now more detail\nThat is the ... group in Orlando for over seven\nFor two three five five six one\nPart of what I was saying before we move on to mark is is that\nYou were talking about a piece of property and not really sure what happened to it but it won't let you all you everybody out there needs to know this is interesting\nIs that you can whatever county the property is located in you can go to the county property prices website Google for example Orange County property appraiser you're going to get to that website you can find all kinds of information it is public information anybody can look at it\nA history of the transfers of the property deed that were done and how much money was paid at each one of those transfers\nSo if you're not sure whether mom gave it to a child a sibling or how much was paid for it you can find that in your case Linda at the U.S the only county property praises website just you can look at it by name or look it up by address\nCould look Linda let's go to mark in orange city mark you're on news Ninety six by go ahead\nSir I owe a two part question a\nCommon law at the same woman for Thirteen Years now a nine years ago we purchased the house she a credit I cash cash in my retirement\nCourt about twenty five thirty grand\nCash into the house where they're living at nine a challenge for domestic choice you want to call it a were partying ways alright she's basically telling me there's a sidewalk you walk in with what you walk out what you are in with\nA house is in all in mining and I'm selling you got a I Know what the answer is but it legally do I have a leg to stand on\nWal Mart just to confirm if I look to the deed to that property it's in her name only earning on\nYeah some market here's what I'd be concerned about mark\nYeah you may file a lawsuit and ask a court to decide what you got a special equity in that house the court certainly has the ability to do equity in Saint Marc\nWhen you bought this house you put in thirty thousand dollars you should leave with thirty thousand dollars but the same time that she's going to say well guess what he put it in thirty thousand dollars Thirteen Years ago and he's been living here for three cents\nIf I were to add up all the rent that he owes me guess what it equals thirty thousand dollars and that might be a defense now being legitimate defense\nWell I shot the case because they take that guy made a over the years in direct deposit into a common account and you know I I basically paid for more than build all the time uh I Do have a paper trail\nOK Mark I'm not going to say it's impossible but it's gonna be a bit of an uphill battle it might start simply by having a lawyer write her a letter and say look we're going to sue you to get some money out of this house and maybe she would be a grid grill too compromising with you and paying you something for your interest in the house rather than face lawsuit\nUnfortunately we're still sharing the same house a chill it sold so I I Walk on eggshells on that I was uh\nOh so you're still living there\nStill living there and and that's the second part of my\nQuestion uh where I asked that are resident of this house for nine years your receipt Mayo got those air and all that stuff uh she claims and throwing me out on a twenty four hour notice\nNo absolutely not work she would have to go to if you don't voluntarily move out of there she would have to go to court and get you a court order to move out of there now mark I want to confirm you guys are not legally married\nNo sir Okay Mark you could turn to clear her deal\nBy when the realtor comes over and ask her to sign a document said look you know what I live here too I'm not moving out or she might sell it but I'm not moving out of here\nIn the real is going to hear that and she's going to go whoa what am I getting myself into maybe this is not listening that I Want to handle\nSo you could just make things very difficult for her is for your girlfriend [noise] as far as lifting the property and selling the property and refusing to move out of the property and any lifting agent and potentially any buyer may walk away and say I'm not getting in middle their\nDomestic dispute to some degree mark you've\nGot some leverage if your if your if your girlfriend wakes up one day and says yeah you know guess what I'm going to need more cooperation get this done and I would agree to pay more twenty thousand bucks mark\nDo not rely on her verbal agreement to pay that money did in writing and I think it would be in addition to put a mortgage lean against property so it cannot be sold without using paid off\nThat was another part of my question I I\nI was I'm sure remain out of business I Would just feel like this I Would put a mechanic on the property now where I did all the remodeling and I have maintained the property for nine years\nYeah mark you know that I don't I don't consider that to be legitimate I consider to be a little bit shady mark so\nIt's a lot of dirty do studies say twenty five W ... happening right down\nBy Kevin all the steps of the Supreme Court in Washington ours are grown and

the Internet clearly go ahead yes I like listening to your program thank you how did you find it Bruce\nWell then Donald Florida before ... before I go to the talk radio minor question here and I thank you for taking my call um [noise] I Am\nA lien holder of a car that I physically have it in my a garage the person that ah I go on the money to surrender to Kimmy are such a lack of payment [laughter] I Try to traded the other day yeah toward a new one\nWith mine and the current era would not accept it without a title or or some kind of paperwork fit the [noise] the other party but have to sign ... to transfer to be made and rice\nGo out and said I Wish I knew that I I just probably there and I I went over to the EMT and explain the situation of about me having possession of the car and I no longer and they wouldn't let me add to it to either\nGet my name on the top of the title and then create the car and off the next day [laughter] well um how do banks to pay for repossessed cars all the time and I'm sure they're getting no cooperation ... a a person that took out the low\nI you know they must have seen is always the cars that's a great question Bruce and by the way this is an Illinois title I assume right yeah so and\nI Will call it elsewhere to get it switched to your paper I\nWas so great is I guess so I don't know how it works in Florida but I hear exactly what you're saying when when you don't pay the bank\nThe bank is somehow changing the title and selling the property whether they're going to court and getting a court order I don't know I certainly that'd be a relief to your Bruce but on a practical answer could you go to the person whose name was on his title and ask him or her to science and paperwork for even if you've got to pay them a little bit of money for that\nMight be a good idea I asked him to appear the dealer that has not happened\nWell I don't you they don't need to be at the dealer they just need to turn that title over and convey the title to you and it kind of look I'll give you five hundred bucks if you'll meet me and sign without ever paperwork I Need that would be great and Bruce it would not only be signing of the back of the title but it'd be a below sale and limited power of attorney as well\nI Am drinking fake you OK Bruce thank you for listening all the way from Chicago by by by\nLet's go on to Jill in Melbourne
