that's a big question that we did all the time share and we've written a piece up their\nReal concise we called three mistakes we typically see with annuities lot of people obviously investing for one case which yeah the the the the the most common way to save for retirement so there's a four O. one K. retirement strategies piece up there\nAnd then there's also a piece about five twenty nine versus

they're on let's talk future dot com\nYeah those are the three most popular subjects I Would say and we always rotate the is as you mentioned so annuities four one K.\nAnd college planning mhm what's his let's talk but you're showing again that website was let's talk future dot com we started the show talking all about mania is\nBasically bubble that have occurred in history from tulips to the tech bubble we talked about the real estate bubble had about beanie babies you talked about a lot of them over the past four hundred years\nAnd basically we want to stress knock you get caught up in that and I feel like I've seen that so many times oh my buddy keeps making money on\nX. right and I need to get involved in it it's just a recipe\nFor disaster yeah and we did talk like you mentioned a lot about those you know ups and downs in the market but what is the solution I think that's the heart of the ... yeah I I think one of the big solutions is number one\nNot to get your your emotions get underway right or you know that's kind of the obvious one but the second but you know the the big thing is focusing on what we can control and when it comes to the market when it comes to these bubbles these\nUh you know over inflated projections of investments these uh you know things that tend to to rise and fall in the market very quickly\nOr we don't really have control over that so um you know if you look at it something ... a specific like beanie babies or something like that my advice would be\nOur bitcoin is the current one right which people have made lots of money in bitcoin it you know ... maybe a a very of a a you know relevant technology and it might change the way we do banking account sorts of things\nAs well but we also encourage you to go out and do your own research as well and you know make your own informed decision but\nAgain we will take phone calls today at eight for for two two zero zero nine six five but we are going to probably primarily focused on this show on educating you the listener and educating me as the host here because I I don't know a lot about these things either and Sherry's a wealth of information so\nIf she mentioned something and you actually have a question on something she's talking about that would be a great question that will take today for for two two zero zero nine to five but of course any legal questions you have is well we'll field those as well eat for for two two zero zero nine six five and nothing me Sherry do it is here Sherry taken away\nOkay so first of all let me just correct one thing oh no\nI'm there are not Thirteen proposed amendments are only twelve oh there are only twelve okay that's because the Florida Supreme Court threw out one of the amendments that used to be Thirteen now there's ...\nIt was number a U.S they had then it might help to the right thing and it leaves it and they threw it out is because they felt that was too confusing for the voters\nUm it dealt with charter schools that didn't mention charter schools but I'm not going to focus on that because people don't need to vote on it right um so there are a total of twelve proposed amendments um\nThis is eight more than appeared in the two thousand and sixteen ballot so it's going to be a long ballot\nWhere people um and they actually weaved through the entire proposed amendment which can be somewhat confusing sometimes especially when you're in the voting booth perhaps seeing the actual language of these proposed amendments from the very first time\nI'm so\nAmending the constitution is serious business which is why I'm a dedicating\nThe shows to these amendment so that people understand their impact and what they are and can answer any questions that they may have\nThis is just um basically talking about what they are\nOr what it means if they're approved what it means if they're denied it's not a ... uh I I don't do politics and the show so if we don't have to tell you how to vote no and we're not going to do any political analysis either or talk about politics it's basically just an educational show\nOn the uh what people are saying are the pros and cons of amendments mean and what people are saying are the pros and cons of the amendments and and a little bit of background like how they got there\n[noise] so um how the amendments\nGot their their eight of these twelve amendments were proposed by the\nCRC which is the constitutional revision commission which those listeners who are avid listeners know ah from previous shows that the constitutional vision commission gets together once every Twenty years\nAnd his staff with proposing proposed amendments to the Florida Constitution that the voters and need to vote on\nSo originally the CRC proposed eight amendments one of those amendments have limited number eight\nUm was um\nTurned down by this the Florida Supreme Court so that leaves seven amendments on the ballot proposed by the CRC three were proposed by the Florida Legislature legislature and two were proposed by citizens initiatives\nTo pass um\nAny one of these amendments needs to receive sixty percent\nApproval by the voters 'em\nAnd unless and otherwise indicated in the amendment itself most of these amendments will take place if they're approved January eighth two thousand and Nineteen so\nVote in December of two thousand Eighteen takes effect several months later January two thousand Nineteen you don't have a lot of time to do much though it's not a lot of time to become familiar with those that pass what their actual impact is um and get used to them so um it's pretty short window there\n[noise] um\nThe ah Supreme Court approved three others that were challenged on appeal I'm so they remain on the ballot and those are number six ten and Thirteen [noise] okay so\nAs I said the CRC meets every Twenty years so the first time that I'm In a place on the ballot was Nineteen Seventy eight so we have Nineteen Seventy eight Nineteen Ninety eight in here we are in two thousand and Eighteen\nThe first one CRC proposals in Nineteen Seventy eight the CRC proposed eight amendment I'm half\nOf which had multiple questions when we talk about the multiple questions previously but all go back into that in Nineteen Seventy eight all of those eight proposed amendments were defeated\nBy the voters and back then the voters only needed to approve those amendments by a majority it changed to sixty percent in two thousand and six\nOr when the voters approve the sixty percent requirement so back in Nineteen Seventy eight when it was only a majority of\nThe voters defeated all eight of those amendments that were proposed by the CRC and then in Nineteen Ninety eight again when it was just a majority the CRC propose nine amendments\nAll of them had multiple questions um and all but one passed\n'em again we only needed in the majority back then it wasn't until two thousand and six or that the requirement went up to sixty percent\nSo now we're in two thousand Eighteen um and I see are the proposed eight there's going to be seven on the ballot from the CRC but again another five pretty long ballot now when I talk about combining subject matters um I talked about this in previous show\nThe name of that is either called log rolling or bundling bundling uh-huh and um\n[noise] people are wondering some people ask me well I thought there was a law in Florida that said that um these proposed amendments could only have one subject that laws can only have one subject in Florida well um\nThat's true but only in regard to the amendments that are being proposed by the legislature or by the citizen initiatives so the citizens initiatives or the Florida legislation there proposed amendments cannot bundle but\nThe CRC proposed amendments can bundle and they have\nUm use their that ability yes um and so I'm an example of bundling is where you have\nA two subject matters put together in one amendment and the two subject matters are really pretty much totally unrelated\nAh people are giving an example of amendment number nine for example um and that's an amendment where the voters are going to have to decide whether to ban offshore drilling\nAnd at the same time ban east cigarettes in the workplace yeah right totally unrelated but you can't vote for them separately if you ask for the amendment you're willing yes for both of\nThem as an example um so\nWhat we're going to do um\nToday and and the next few weeks until he will have to vote November is go through these amendments a one by one and so people can get a little bit of education and some of the resources that are out there to further educate themselves\nUm and so we're going to start today we're going to go no American ally I'm numbers one I'm through beat the twelve\nOr any of those good little prologue of what's going to come here and that's exactly will set that up right there so stay tuned we're going to start going through these amendments one by one just for you and again if you have any questions on any of this or to make sure he's talking about please feel free to call in and ask your question because if you have a question\nThere is a chance that someone else they're out there has the same exact question that you have eight for for two two zero zero nine six five eight four for two two zero zero nine six five we'll go to the amendments that's coming up next but first we got to get to the three big things you need to know you're listening to the law review on news only six point five WTO [noise]\nThree or four years old and he was beginning tomorrow in orange and some companies where polls showing the races for us some of the Florida governor just about even\nMigrants ... his numbers wells over to an estimated five thousand people or the metro Guatemala border has resumed its march toward the U.S one way or do you pick up no rain or news on this one guy but will be reviewing director where the ... report it all and [noise]\nYou get the bathroom\nConnected to Britain was with our ... was it everywhere you go this is news maybe six Boyd five WDC radio were Orlando turns first for breaking news

Ninety nine Ninety nine\nDining from two Ninety nine Ninety nine and more present prizes and find all weekend long at our tend to court\nCertainly are and start wondering nine for sex lead Jackson memorial highway or go on line that court Clarence furniture dot com\nA thousand and they they put this temporary cap and um for non homestead properties now the um proposed amendment is to make this temporary cap\nPermanent um\nThey'll will know what would they do in an instance of say a hurricane or something in in in need of a ... emergency relief situation something that kind of like with the housing crisis with\nRight so you know that's one of the reasons why some of these organizations are opposed\nTo this amendment and to him than men one um because there are no provisions for exceptions and emergency situations and because these amendments um if approved according to the data analysis would substantially impact\nThe availability of resources to handle these kinds of things so um that's an important issue I'm In a lot of people are saying that\nThis particular amendment tends to benefit more the wealthy yeah um you know that have\nThe money to buy a vacation home or to develop a shopping Centre or whatever and those that oppose the amendments say that it's no longer needed because the market has corrected itself and we don't have those rapidly rising prices in these kinds of properties in\nThe market is always fluctuating your in your own and just to remind everyone that these are constitutional amendments meaning that if they are voted upon and they are accepted they will be in place\nFor Twenty years where is this is something else I could go through legislation which maybe if you're if if the market's going to fluctuate or something you may not want something set in twenty and a twenty year window block correct\nRight and that is one of the a very strong positions that Oregon some organizations have taken like the the little league of women voters which makes some sense or because you know if you're dealing with revenue for example or or change change conditions\n... the economy or conditions that change fair if can change fairly rapidly even a matter of years um it's very difficult to change\nOr the constitution it's a lot easier to change legislation um but the constitution doesn't necessarily mean it'll remain for Twenty years um because it can be changed in other ways but\nIt's a it's\nMuch more difficult to change the constitution and the change legislation and the constitution would over rule any legislation to the extent that legislation is in conflict with the constitution\nTrail or an interesting stuff you want to is there anything else we need to cover with them into their\nUm no I think that again amendment to pretty straight forward is William yet except that we've seen a lot of um\nA lot of commercials and advertisements on amendment to and one of the things that it doesn't\nMake clear ah some of these commercials is that it does not apply to homestead property it only applies to these other kinds of property royal shopping malls prior vacation commercials ... right\nOr landers only local news

W. American Legion and stuff like that they do to fifty fifty tickets they do raffles and they do bingo what's gonna happen what with if this amendment goes through for those organizations\nYeah my understanding of um how they are defining casino gambling um from what I've seen a does not necessarily include a though that those kinds of um basically fundraising events\nAnd I'm also going to give you options you know people like I said it's just not being given the option should when it comes to their health care especially when it comes to neck and back pain I see every single day and it's so frustrating\nTo taste different today I Want to take the show in a slightly different direction I Want to cover some chiropractic miss you know we have 'em\nIn this profession a lot of different things and people sometimes don't understand what we do so\nYou know over the years has some recovery missed or negative things objections if you will that people say about ... practical I didn't want to handle a few of them if I can if they have time I'm going to start with one and we'll go from there so I hear this stuff and it really bothers me big time because\nI Know the truth I I hear this negative stuff and it's just like\nIt's just rumor it's not even ... it's it's just stuff that is designed to make the professional bad I guess and I'm In this profession I have the education I have twenty five years of practice and tens of thousands of patients I take the seminars I read the journals I see the studies and\nStudy the literature so I Know what's going on I Know what's so and when I hear this it does make me a little bit aggravated someone said the deal with some of that today so let's first discuss\nWhat a chiropractor die so basically a chiropractor as you know specializes in the spine and\nAs such we look at the spine that we look at the nervous system and how the spine and the nervous system relates to the body long story short we look at this fine for a structural abnormalities ... areas that don't move correctly areas that could be putting pressure on the nerves and causing nerve interference and we know that the nervous system controls the whole body\nAnd that when we take pressure off the spine we can take pressure off the nerves we can get you to move better we can get your body to heal better naturally this is why\nThis works so well so that you know that's the basis of chiropractic just to get out there we don't use drugs and we don't use surgery we do all naturally with what we call chiropractic adjustments and then we support that with some therapy and mortality and so forth\nSo today let's talk about some ...\nCan I can I actually throw it out there right off the bat\nBut I hear all the Wonder Years he's not the right on yeah I'm I'm ready I Want to go I Want to go because I\nI I've heard this all the time and you mentioned it to me a bunch of times but it isn't the case but the one is having to go to the chiropractor once you go once you have to go for the rest of your life\n[laughter] that's a great Chris or you know what this is this is a common misconception or a common thing that I'm the objection are made in a negative spin so let's deal with this comment went okay and this is the most time I want to hear Chris so\nUm if you don't mind it like to role play with Chris I I Want to walk you through and the audience through how I deal with some sort of a negative spin like hey you got you go to a chiropractor once you have to go to the rest of your life\nSo let's run through that okay or like that so I'm just going to kind of play play around with you here so I pay my patient or your ear you're ... you're just a person that hey I heard you you go to a chiropractor wants to go to oh okay\nSo let me ask you a couple of quick questions of virtually Chris do you feel that your spine is important\nI feel it's very important okay do you feel your like your teeth are important\n... all yes yes very important I like food you like fruiting like to eat and you're like your teeth right like the ... so um do you go to the dentist yeah of course right and how often do you go to the dentist\nProbably go like once every six months right twice a year that you're most people say twice a year they go to the dentist why do you go twice a year to go only when your teeth are literally killing you and you can't take it\nWill know you do you do but also just because you want to make sure that you maintain\nYou do go when you're a pain but that's a different time right most people go twice a year\nJust to get checked right right regardless like would it make sense to wait until your teeth are all decayed rotten falling out and gum disease and all that and then go get checked or do probably up so you can have a problem with your teeth like a cavity\nYou may not feel yet and then the dentist maybe finds a problem even though there's no painted All right so the purpose of getting checked his to find things early correct yeah yeah and those measures and prevents the findings early early detection and prevention by getting a cleaning right where they they get some of the charter out and the\nAnd the plaque and all that right so\nWhat if he found some tooth decay on a visit and he checked you out fully they said look you've got some issues but look you know what you don't have pain you Chris so let's let's send your home let's wait until the teeth until the Catholic it's deeper till hits the nerves until you're old really irritable they don't want you to take as much as well as you possibly can and that doesn't work Chris\nI didn't want you to take opioids and I want you to block the pay as much as you possibly can even the means getting addicted to the drugs then come in and we'll take care of your tooth\nThat make any bill that doesn't make any sense but this is what people do it they're spying continued all along this so you go to dances twice a year you catch problems early right before they become ... before they become symptomatic you're going this twice a year but what do you do in between Chris the twice a year like on a daily basis to keep it to tell you brush\nYour brush him brush your life lost yeah yeah see doing all this stuff um\nAnd and and I may ask you a question when are you going to stop brushing your teeth and stop forcing\n... for when you're going to stop going to the dentist twice a year for for early detection in preventative maintenance probably never\nSo you're going to do that as long as you have your teeth direction or as long as the ... of the rest of your well that'll hopefully help me keep my teeth [laughter] yes it will help you keep it to you if that's the whole point of of keeping them you're going to have them for the rest of your life you're going to keep them as long as you possibly can so\nThat's preventative dance just read that people understand that got to do this to take care of my teeth when are you going to ... so you're not going to ever stop going to the dentist and properly right no\nYou don't want to call your ... thanks I came once and now like quick 'cause my teeth feel better [laughter] I mean are you gonna call me quit no ... who who quit their dentist unless they don't like the dentist is still going to take care of their teeth right\nSo now we're talking about this fine you mentioned the spy this important\nRight but is it important enough to take care of the rest of your life\nNotes this oh okay so we have people that are are having issues with their spine and they're like well I I don't want to go to a chiropractor rest of my life because you know that's a bad thing you know to take care of my mind forever\nBut it doesn't make sense it doesn't like it it it you can replace your teeth right you can get false teeth ... dentures and such crowns\nCan you replace your mind not that I Know of right\nSo let me just a couple of analogies hum the as we go along cholesterol cholesterol whether it's high it doesn't give you any symptoms at first you know that no I did not well you don't have symptoms like last year almost had a heart attack is that right yeah I guess so that's what actually them you're getting blood work done and you're\nChecking your cholesterol right\nAnd that's it may be high and then you're gonna have to deal with that and take care of that but you also doing preventive checkups on your blood pressure I mean people take your blood pressure blood pressure in the beginning stages when it's I guess what no symptoms it's called the silent killer\nOr you can cause a lot of issues and that there was no symptoms of high blood pressure initially have a high blood sugar Chris\nSymptoms ... no no not right you check a one see you check your boat oh my God may want to see if I didn't know that oh my blood my blood sugar is one ten nights over a hundred I didn't I took over the normal I didn't know that ah I better take care of that\nOr see getting regular checkups people check their cars as well right yeah for and to an end to for regular maintenance\nCan you replace your car\nOr you know what you check it regularly throughout the cars life will change the oil rotate the tires and all that and the air conditioning system you ... you you take out the uh\nUm the filters you get maintenance things like that so teeth replaceable even your heart valves replaceable they replace heart cells right so why wouldn't someone take care of this fine for the rest of their life\nIs your hip replaced with him as a hip replacement surgery and I'm like I just got oldest sets her place you joined a unique replaceable yes so all this stuff is replaceable and\n... but to find is not in the people like why would I take care of this virus it doesn't hurt me it doesn't make sense of my job here is to educate people as to why you should take care of your spine because\nWhen it goes and I see this every day when it's degenerative when it's broken down you are stocked with that's fine for the rest of your life there is no spine replacement it's not like putting false spines and like false teeth it's not like change the tires on your car or rotating a ... changing the oil or changing the tires or changing your air filter or\nYou you you're stuck with a crippled fine and this is not a good way to live folks\nSo that's the goal of my show\nHow would you want to time Chris by the way we got about two minutes or two minutes I saw me get a a wrap up on this thing so the spy cannot be replaced and you get to live with it so I Want people understand that let's take a negative spin and turn into a positive what if you came in and I got you better and you felt better than you felt years\nWhy wouldn't you want to maintain that through regular chiropractic check up to the thing that got you better when drugs and surgery injections couldn't it's not a bad thing I have tons and tons of patients come in they come from monthly maintenance big deal\nIt's like ... you know are you going to stop exercising oh I'm I'm In shape now I think I'll quit the rest of my life\nI mean everything has to be maintained your spine is a mechanical moving more wonders marvel of engineering you need to maintain that if you're going to use it every single day so let's not make this a negative thing let's make it a positive thing spinal health people need to learn about spinal health and wellness and take care of for the rest of their life\nSo it's actually Chris it turns out to be when a chiropractor recommends you get your spine check regularly it's not a negative thing you know I thought to be a positive thing\nAnd that's the point I Want to get across with this one miss and there's so many myths but this one of them I wanted to dispel a lot of car parts as well try to go oh no I Know you don't have to commercialize income with whatever you want to come and that is true you could come whatever you want to
