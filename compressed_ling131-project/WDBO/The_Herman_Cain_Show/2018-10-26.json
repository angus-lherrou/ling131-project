morning\nAmong fifty fifth street two blocks from where they found the or the ... book or pseudo bomb oh so you're in New York City I didn't know that\nI Am in New York this this this minute I I came to do a you know the weekend shows and I had to have another benefit tonight for the charity or you know male friend Bernard was institutionalized we're uh we're celebrating and they fixed the fear of that particular charity or was it was a even a pre dated my expos\nIs Willa broken the other institutions are down how long you been doing this rather\nStarted the initial expose a uh uh the John Lennon they picked up on started in January of Nineteen Seventy two\nSeventy two such a long long time ago\nForty six years ago I was the initial expos as but then they had to change the way society deals with the developmentally disabled is really a a herculean effort that took\nA combination of federal law suits and a legislation and and just to get people's minds around the concept that you don't warehouse humans the way you wear ... or a you know old furniture\nAnd in fact uh and I want to get to the breaking news but I Do want to finish this and that you did developmentally challenged now or ... that the goal is to get them living on their own\nIt gets there will be gone or what exactly exactly and that\nRather than being stuck in a huge dirty filthy smelly noisy\nRoom sixty of them was one attendant smeared with their own PCs and I'm being dead slop very they live respected a respectable lives normal lives as normal as possible depending on their disability they're handicap or there's homes opening all across the country from coast to coast uh uh you know we're two three\nFour five or a developmentally disabled folk live together they uh they go to school they take vocational training they have relationships have known\nNow are back to normal very ... it's like the the signal signal achievement of my otherwise a futile to\nBe true and just real quickly ... how do we get in touch and support you\nWell life's work life or is it the principal charity life's work but I tell you autism speaks is also\nTerrific it's nationwide or anybody that wants to help and there's so many people who were directly affected any parent with an autistic child does what I'm Talking about they need help they need support they need more of these community based residences to open as an alternative to going back to the grim old days life's work looking at ...\nAnd now to this what is going on we found out two more packages since I got on Fox and friends and started on this show a they looked like packages how would you label them Geraldo because they they have the makings of a bomb but no explosive devices\nI think they're pseudo bombs fake bombs I think there are weapons are designed to terrorize rather than to explode and because they never intended never were designed that were never capable of inflicting or\nA death or injury or it was clearly a stunt the question is whether the stunt was as a you know certainly as advertise done by a Trump supporter\nI regard yet the trumps enemies list\nWhich to me and I had this eureka moment last night Brian I said what twelve days to go to a crucial midterm election what Trump supporter is going to do something that was guaranteed to make the ... the president the United states looked like he was complicit in mass murder or tempted mass murder I mean no supporter of Trump\nI play with friends like these who needs enemies no supporter of Trump or that I thought this through for one minute\nWould think that this was going to help the president striking out James Clapper or Cory Booker the Clintons Obama's or Brennan deniro George ... was I mean that's the Trump enemies list you get you you're going to do something so blatant\nSo obvious that uh I you know my uh my my pet dog would see what was the clear motive apparent motive or false flag motive was to uh uh you know go after the president's enemies or was it just to make the president look bad\nReally at Trump paid they're doing this or even dare I say it has some manipulator of our political system like Russia or China\nI Want you to hear some of what uh MSNBC and CNN is saying about this attack ended up going into that I thought we'd have conversations like this may be on the Sunday shows but first we find out who the who the suspect is not so cutting\nTheir fair to blame and some of the president's rhetoric our president cannot escape special scrutiny that the head of the hate parade\nUnleashed dogs are the\nRhetoric that comes out of that White House not helpful it all\nOn their collateral damage\nThe rhetoric has been going on in President at his rally in front of the ...\nWhat ... what what is new and toxic next toxic mix through years raising dictator tone is coming from the top and now CNN has become a target [laughter] incumbent upon the Republican in this country to start to think about the perpetrators of fat\nOkay or you think that's fair\nI think it's appalling Lee unfair that exactly my point people seize on this\nThis sounds so obvious a connection between\nTrump's enemies and uh and being in receipt of one of these devices and we all tend to Trump's enemies but what a Trump friend really do that no friend would do that\nThat ... days before an election if ever it's just it's either it's shocking to me that there hasn't been more skepticism more cynicism directed at the mainstream media than there has been and it is strictly a up\nA ... a point of believing what you want to believe people want to believe that Trump's by fiery rhetoric led directly to these devices being sent to his enemies that Trump inspired these attacks\nIt's time to be as it's too easy to make that connection you know my dad can make the connection anybody can make the connection it is obvious what they intended to do they intended to make President Trump blip complicit who did it\nI think that that once the FBI announces for sure and I think coming on them to do it sooner rather than later once they run a announces for sure that these devices never could have blown up\nNever not real bombs once they announced that then the next step has to be ... to find the states or alleged perpetrator let's find out what is real motive was and is it not a fact that the real motive was to get the\nMigrants are bands that are the front line to get the a lot of jobs not mobs a slogan of the president's off the front line to get the economic achievement so the president's off the front page I I think that this is a put up job I think more likely than not I'm not sure of course I don't know yet\nUh but I talk on the cops last night and I spent a long time on the phone talking to cops last night they think that these were bogus devices or big big ... the\nHardcore or a bare knuckle ... street cops that I Know I think that this is all in elaborate hoax\nOr rather of air with is obviously Geraldo as we head to the terms I Know it's impossible who'd ever predicted the caravan Hoover predicted this type of a rock is confirmation of Kavanaugh\nSo and now all of a sudden we have a eleven devices scattered across the country against prominent Democrats but if the election it where the election now and eleven days on Tuesday what are we going to be seen by the house we're going to be saying about the Senate\nYeah if you had predicted on the midterm yet [noise] I\nGuess no blue wave I'll tell you that much as noble away I don't know I haven't factored in my own psyche yet the impact of the this uh uh ... uh you know on\nA before the devices were discovered before the cascading\nCriticism ... excuse me President Trump as the instigator of of this or be a potential horrific violence I thought that Trump had it I thought I thought that ah\nAh when the Margaret ... started coming even though I oppose the president's immigration policies by and large I think that much to draconian a but having said that I thought the Trump totally reverse the trend his popularity picking up\nHigher than it's ever been higher than a rocket bomber was at this stage I thought that he had the midterms in ... in his pocket I don't know what the impact of the last two three days though has\nBeen Brian ... is going to be so tough to tell and to keep up with all this was the last time you talk to the president\n[noise] I have not talked to the president in ah almost four weeks\nOkay I I Do believe according to reports say he's really enjoying it may be the first time\nHe certainly was having a good time when I talked to a he's\nA you know I think a lot\nHas to do with the stepping now I think he's finally gotten to a place where uh you know first of all you as the competition between John Kelly in in a a jumble which I think it's healthy I help the tension and you know he's got a out on a bill shine one of the most brilliant media executives on earth now\nUh you know I at his uh it is right or his right shoulder they're backing them up I I think the weeding out slowly or did the deep state types who want to sabotage him\nA and I I think he also senses are with the economy and with his uh his\nHis poll numbers are getting rose zero you know taking up a that he may really have a shot at being a very good if not a great\nPresident he is Geraldo Rivera Geraldo best

minded that because then you go back and you realize the chain and lottery or something even Democrats aren't very ... they aren't necessarily against blue to where the beginning of possibly a cascade of deals now I'm being optimistic\nBut they said the Democrats they feared he was going to start with infrastructure why\nBecause that would have made them play ball instead it was his fourth or fifth thing and they said well you know what we we just we don't like what he's doing you know with this tax plan and everything else so we're not going to participate Scott if he could hold the house and Senate I think they're going to get stuff done I think they're going to get stuff done if they could hold the house and Senate by anymore do you\nThink so too I think so too I mean just the first time

say that he had a good grasp on exactly what he's done um my very non scientific political I put out last night says who are you taking the fight ... or Chuck Chuck is currently up Ninety five percent to five percent\nYeah I'll take that for what it's worth so but ...\nDoes he have to go back and can you go back in and to go into discovery and try to find out more information about cabinet\nI I mean to me I don't think so the way that this is proceeding of the Senate proceeding he filed a couple of 'em are presented a couple of the declaration sworn declarations by women that he was working with this isn't like he is going to now get get to open some civil lawsuit against Chuck Grassley unless he decided to do that if this is going to be a deal Jay investigation that's not how it works\nGotcha part oh let's talk about these packages are your sources saying they're getting close to finding out who's behind it\nYeah in fact you know we had a couple of a so called last night uh who are very experienced in this\nUh including um you know somebody who has been a part of numerous a high profile bombing investigations and they said to us or the FBI has way more information\nIs probably way closer to the individual or individuals and then they're publicly saying at this point\nJust because there's so much potential forensic evidence and all these these packages that didn't actually explode um there's just so much information material there it's almost as if the person is hunting down because you know when these things to stay in place the forensic evidence is out\nYou know just overwhelming if at at this point I'm so yeah all sorts of things that they are very close and it wouldn't surprise and if in a day or two we had to really concrete information about exactly who they think's responsible\nTo return to the former deputy assistant director of counter terror said this about with the suspects probably like ... even\nIf I Do feel this is probably some sort of loan offender I don't think this is going to involve the group I think it's somebody that is clearly been planning it for a while because after all this person has put a seven to ten bombs in the mail for took awhile to do all the research it took awhile to do the building to the wall to put these packages together and have a plan so that what the FBI has to do is go back\nAnd try and I'm In reverse since these crimes actually occur in from the time these packages were mailed and place for the military and they have to figure out what happened in between and where the packages were and try and pay for all this together you know the the things we talked about before finding cameras finding potential witnesses in the mail saying that handle these devices\n... we're living in London and as a professor exactly\nI'm living in London tied to all these western intelligence groups but then you know he starts to present himself as a Russia Insider and basically a couple of days ago his
