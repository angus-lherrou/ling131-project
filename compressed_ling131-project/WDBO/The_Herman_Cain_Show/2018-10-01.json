die us instead of your resume room trial today\nSo let's bring in a and I see all the lines are jammed I'll get to you I Know is a constant a topic of conversation over the weekend run hospital run as a former FBI assistant director president at law enforcement legal Defense Fund\nFront a back in the spotlight as the FBI when you talk to the men and women there are they happy\n[laughter] well look this is part of the mission or you know they they do criminal investigations do national security investigations\nAnd they do background investigations for White House nominees so they are today as they have been acting as a service provider for a client the client as the White House the White House gets to set the terms and the FBI will go pursue elites that uh are read on\nThe ... why in the sixth background checks throughout his career did his high school education or a or alleged or college educated ... alleged why is that I come up\n[noise] well look the these backgrounds Brian start with an F. eighty six form a that's a bit in the news of late certainly since Mike Flynn's legal dramas or it's a lengthy for they they go into the details of your employment your education they collect uh your your grades and and\nLook into educational information but really they they generally aren't going back before the age of Eighteen\nOr less it's for an FBI employee who is starting out in the organization that you know the age of twenty two at the age of twenty\nIt's so in these successive backgrounds that they've had now reportedly I guess half a dozen they're really going back to the last background investigation and going forward so this most recent one is is going back to his last\nBackground investigation looking at has he moved does he have a different employer uh habits finance has changed and they're going forward in time they're not going back thirty six years\nTo say you know did a teacher say bad things about him so if they would've caught it would have been more likely caught way back then\nOr it would have been more likely caught if somebody who had some derogatory information on on Mr Kavanaugh would have surfaced you know ten years ago Twenty years ago then they would have had a much better opportunity\nSo when it comes down on friday how soon does he have to do is the FBI get where they got to be they're going to be I'm going to be pulled off the bench they're going to be involved too they asked the White House who they shoot interview and with the scope should be\n[noise] you know in a case like this I think the answer's definitely yes Brian you know first there's the traditional scope of character and associates at references and and a financial information and loyalty to the U.S government those are all the standard questions\nBut here you have really a horse of a different color you are or have allegations made by at least one person and now multiple people that go back decades\nAnd and so it's going to be up to the White House to tell the FBI here's the additional scope of work we want you to conduct and I understand that that's probably being coordinated\nAs much with house the Senate Judiciary committee and and the FBI is going to be told look here's here's the range of issues we want you to cover and if it's outside of that maybe come back to us and tell us what\nWhat you found is that you see is out some additional derogatory or or you have additional ... come from these leads but I think they're going to be constrained by what the\nWhat ... what the White House wants them to death\nBecause Justice Thomas who just took a few days and he he'll come out they looked into it they bring both they bring them both and\nSo that's what the Democrats are calling for hey why don't you take a couple of days and take a look at this new information that came up even though you had a month ago but that's where a different conversation so we understand that the FBI is already interviewed the New Yorker woman Deborah Ramirez who claims with to be very drunk or freshman year and Brett Kavanaugh exposed himself\nBut suppose himself to her the uh what do you take of that because she's on the record saying I was so drunk I take weeks to remember what I saw and then she decided to come forward in the New York times didn't want to publish it of all things New Yorker did\nYou start with Deborah Ramirez from there she says I have reportedly I have three people that witness is does the FBI go find those three people or did they just right down here are their names here their addresses here's what she said they said\nYeah I think it is that is all on the record now they would be having a back and forth with the White House saying look you know here are\nThree much like they would with with Dr Ford if she can provide additional ... fact witnesses who who they say were present at that time I think that they would be having that conversation with the White House counsel's office and saying look here here we have we have a list of you know additional potential witnesses\nWe can go there today are and what their cooperation we can have them interviewed by the close of business by by dark tonight\nUm I I mean and again it's going to be right what does the White House agreed to it in this case and the white can the FBI do that work absolutely they can um\nThis is not the case in my mind where the FBI is going to grab you know three hundred agents and say we're going to go interview every one of Brett Kavanaugh's classmates as is graduating seniors from Georgetown Prep or wherever I don't think it's a situation where we do that but it's like if you have obviously that can either shed light\nOr refute an allegation they they certainly could do it as the question is where the White House\nWant them to and bottom line is do you think they should\nLook I\nThink we have an obligation was putting somebody on the highest score to land to to take\nCredible allegations and flush them out and that can be done quickly\nIt could be that those allegations wash out that that the person making the allegation is not credible or when they have an FBI agent sitting across from them they say look you know I I ... bridge that a lot or I you know I was really drunk I think it was him it could have been one of you know other people many other people up\nA you know it's it this is an opportunity to flush it out sitting across from an FBI agent or more than\nI Know I'm just saying how extensive you want to be and then you wonder what's going on here or I'll give you an example a run\nThis Roberta Kaplan attorney for one potential witness Elizabeth were so or restore she's a former girlfriend of mark judge member mark judge or the emitted alcoholic with cancer and depression he did not want to go public but now he says all submit to an FBI interview but now we're going back to his high school girlfriend does that sound\nFair and ... you're right there might be yes but I'm just saying if you think about this just think if you're on the other end of this microphone you the FBI expert I'm Talking about it now everybody out there do they have a girlfriend that might want to come out from Thirty years ago and destroy your hopes of becoming the next CEO\nOr the next ... general manager or or or the next coach of uh NC double A. team because it's something you did in high school according to the girlfriend of your former friend [laughter]\nRight I I think that's the very troubling part of this process and we collectively and and the Congress especially\nReally needs to put some thought into what do we want this process to be how long do we want it to take place over what what is the scope of the investigation\nAre we looking for snow why are we looking for somebody who is never touched a beer does know what is beer smells like a at any time in their life we ought to ask some hard questions after this what do we want this process to look\nLike a well he apparently already we've had to have asked it already\nAbsolutely well we should have asked it already but you know this is a cautionary note for potential witnesses say look this is a a three ring circus doing you know just Cuban music\nAnd start the animals um you know do I want to be part of this do you know the FBI knocks on my door do I say very politely thank you but no thank you I I don't want to be part of this process\nOr are people willing to to bring their own they meant to have their own lives opened up for a question that's what's going on now Congress ought to be asking that and and and the media ought to be asking it all of us as Americans who are serving said what do we need here what do we want as a process\nSo I'd Alan Dershowitz on today who said you know I he was outraged these high school things were coming up and he does say the FBI should investigate he said that on Thursday last Thursday his credit\nHe came on today and he said I Want to I guess I Would start with Julie sweat Nick she's the one who said they were talking about a force for gang rapes\nThat he witnessed in was spiking punch putting drugs in punch so let's talk to Julie sweat neck right away the Michael ... client and let's see if any of these allegations are credible and then work our way backwards towards somebody that seemed authentic Dr Ford\nHow would you feel run high scores and FBI investigator going with ... with his suggestion\n[laughter] we'll look I I I think we they ought to examine credible allegations and they ought to be putting some thought into allegations that seem like they're not credible\nMaybe they point to flaws in the process where you you you know part of the FBI's role is to look at\nIt evidence of bias evidence that suggests the person is making it up from whole cloth a\n... again it goes to how long do we want this process to to continue how expansive should it be how do I characterize entered and try to process a personal bias that oh yeah it turns out that guy broke up with me or he said something that I didn't like in Nineteen Seventy two\nIs that should that be part of the consideration or should it not be again by you know the FBI's role here is fact finding they will challenge people if they have something to challenge the Mondale test their recollections\nBut at the end of the day we could end up with you know a credibility\nA back and forth or a a change about somebody's credibility I and the overall nature and and and uh uh in people's taking different people taking different views about somebody's reputation in their character that may be completely unfair and frankly as as as we've seen this play out\nMost of most of the senators I think on this panel have have long ago made up their minds one way or the other

actually that the oil for Republicans have just a motivate the base turnout and worse numbers there right now judge Kavanaugh and what they perceive it there's a fair treatment in this process motivating factor\nThe court that Donald Trump at twenty sixteen\nThe campaign for the court and the court could help them again and it's got so sometimes the politics of the weather gets confirmed or not sticking with judge Kavanaugh is important based motivate motivational strategy\nAnd what what was going to be if it doesn't get through\nUnlike repeal and replace why it was your plan why did you see John McCain to put a thumbs down you're making it up on the fly and you had seven years to get it ready in this you know everyone says you know exactly how they're voting how are you going to blame Donald Trump for Susan Collins is Senator Murkowski it because\nIf it was something about his judicial record that wasn't studied and prepared for it if it was Trump's saying yeah my sister recommended some judge Brett Kavanaugh that would be a problem that means is president so were they didn't think about it\nInstead he goes to the federal is Leonard Leo leading the charge you becomes an advisor they look at this list they say that let's say they released it as in the campaign\nAnd Brett Kavanaugh is the final is the first time of course it was a brilliant picked the first time so at some turbulence didn't get sixty votes all one party line\nA few extra not needed and then incomes Kevin Oh he was a deliberative process so when you were at home I don't care if you're barbecuing or in Washington or in Capitol Hill\nYou know what happened some guy comes forward about something that happened in high school that Brett Kavanaugh never remembered so we can never tell the FBI and that was so when it comes out because the freshman class and Susan Collins or Murkowski were flake couldn't get aboard\nSo are you gonna believe Trump for that no would you do is if you like Trump and a Republican you get everybody out you can't sit out the midterms if you lose the Senate nothing gets done\nBy the way the new NAFTA deal was announced last night that we're talking about today and the president's gonna confirmed twenty five minutes that's not going to get ratified so there's no question in my mind\nThat this is a motivating factor even with disturbing it gives everybody anxiety

be among the\nRocky on tap on opening up to a world has happened no\nOne to the park on line with a different [noise]\nThere are some moments Molly before it's going to find your discover the forest dot\nYes the big deal for Trump I think uh and and you know as you mentioned this is a promise delivered him and he said called NAFTA one of the worst trade deals in the history of the country he promised to renegotiate it uh and he was surprisingly effective at doing it individually and and really leveraging a Mexico against Canada\nAnd so ... yeah this is this is a big deal and we will see the devil's in the details always but but big picture wise um it's a it's a good moment for me there was no\nInternet ... basically when the last NAFTA was done they now have groundbreaking IP agreements they go into combat currency manipulation between the three strong labor provisions that might drive the prices up on certain goods but it's going to drive up wages especially for auto workers that's the theory\nThat go into the sunset and sixteen years in visited every six years and I guess modernize it and reaffirming but this is the\nNew access for dairy farmers a and a chicken farmers if there's a difference I'm not a big farm guy but both there are listed what Canada gets they still have this independent arbiter or arbiter to decide on different ... disagreements or agreements between all three of them the president didn't want that but he's got to live with that [noise]\nYeah and look to the bronze theory of the case from the Trump Administration standpoint with trade in general with Canada with Mexico China or around the world is that we've been taking advantage of we need to renegotiate these trade deals and and he's using tariffs as a weapon to do that particularly with China\nUm it is going to eventually a result in an increase in prices but the theory being that he'll be able to open those markets and eventually will be sort of in a place where we have much more fair and balanced trade agreements\nRemembering time you're too young for this but I remember the Ross Perot is running for president\nHe said this old NAFTA thing I hear this giant sucking sound like you I can hear like his yesterday and some of his arguments are exactly Trump's arguments today Gary Cohn is an example of someone says premise to present you don't understand\nThat you would the world is changed we don't want to make this stuff anymore we said well the heck with that we do we just don't have an opportunity if you noticed we've also lost our middle class and that maybe has something to do with it at\nThis was this was the thing about Trump's that he recognized that no other Republican recognized in twenty sixteen and even before that I mean trust been saying this for a long time but particularly in that campaign right [noise] which was\nThat for for these communities in the rust belt that have been hollowed out manufacturing has disappeared um they were always told by the Republican Party have free trade it's it's an unmitigated it's a good thing no matter what that was always the that was always there answer just stick with free trade and and you'll feel the benefits of a rising tide lifts all boats et cetera et cetera\nAnd they cannot to believe that particularly after the crisis of two thousand eight the financial crisis where many of them were wiped out and didn't recover and certainly while Wall Street recovered and some of the other folks recovered they recovered Trump Trump recognize that and Trump put a plan in place to address that and that's what he's doing I think they they are sticking with him because of that\nTo a politically I think that's so that'll help maybe not in the ... maybe in the midterms you're the expert but we have about six weeks ago I took her first so about five weeks a November ... election day so now we look at what's happening with Kavanaugh we thought the seat was done we hear about this anonymous sweater the anonymous sweater gets a name and face behind it\nThen there is a ... to see if we can get her to testify to talk about what a horrible person Kavanaugh was in high school she was in tenth grade he was twelve\nAnd about a party didn't exist when that testimony comes to a close on Thursday I was in the impression time we're going to have a committee vote friday because he was so strong in defending himself and then a floor vote on Tuesday along the way\nSenator Flake has confronted I Believe by two women who said they were sexually assaulted and without that maybe flake votes keeps his mouth shut and this goes to a floor vote what we're we are now [noise] well\nWe're going to see I mean I just for real quickly on the hearings themselves I mean it was a it was even by the new standard of of news and drama surrounding the Trump Administration this was this was off the charts and you had\nI mean he talked to people the Democrats liberals progressives they watched a doctor for testifying and said there were ... they were they were touched them so deeply there weeping\nAnd then an hour later I heard the same thing for conservatives men and women who said they watched\nJudge Kavanaugh's testimony and they were they were sobbing because they felt that he had been so wrong in this was such an agent you put yourself\nNumber one would have fewer assaulted and it affected your life you had to put two doors in the front of your house number one okay that's the doctor for it and then what if you or to live this exemplary life top number one class great athlete great father great coach unbelievable judge syringe and decisions backed by two Presidents Bush as well as a as well as Trump\nAnd you think you there in life you you people look at you a certain way and all that is lost in ten days that's what I was looking at right there front and center that's the way I Would have acted right or wrong\nAnd it it is absolutely and I said this earlier I think you know we'll see where the FBI investigation wrapped bends up my suspicion is that it's going to uncover nothing new and barring some big new bombshell I think I think we'll go to a vote and he'll be confirmed but\nBecause we have we're still we're going to be left in the same place we were when we started you know people say Dr Ford was credible but she has no corroborating evidence if she had just one person who could corroborate her story\nOn the other side you have judge Kavanaugh says I've been wrongly accused right and there's not a hint of if there if there was something else in his background right you spend thirty six years served at the highest levels of government not a hint of scandal not a hint of impropriety with women until two weeks before his nomination and suddenly the floodgates opened his colleagues allegations against him so\nI'm In that circumstance right we have two people who are credible or people think are credible but there is no you have to look to the evidence and there just isn't any evidence but I think what Democrats have done is turn this into\nAlmost if you if you followed the news coverage of this they turn it into a referendum on his white male privilege and the fact that went to the lead institutions and he thinks he can get away with anything and uh you know now it's about how much he drank and whether he was downplaying his drinking and whether he blacked out um get sort of gone [noise]\nAnd you heard Democrats not they want the rest of this stuff investigated and the Trump White house and Senate and Mitch McConnell are saying look we're going to stick to the lease for people to specific allegation and I'm so we'll see what the FBI says in in a few days\nWe will but it's already expanded Debbie Ramirez was spoken to last night by the FBI agents for about three hours at which time she says I have three witnesses they say that I got really drunk tonight and he exposed himself to me my freshman year\nNews Ninety six point by building a New York we're interrupting the show because us for breaking news when it happens\nBreaking news\nThen don't it was about this I told you is going to happen about Fifteen minutes to go to Jean Wexler here interrupting the brine killing need show to bring you live coverage of President Trump at the White House he's going to be making a statement from the rose garden we don't know if you take any questions at the end of it he's going to talk about this new trade agreement that he's thrilled about he reached with Canada\nLast night they revamped trade pacts\nSo this you've heard the president talking about how he doesn't like NAFTA and he wants to redo\nIt so now he's got a new agreement it's called the U.S Mexico Canada agreement not called NAFTA anymore or gives American due to the headline that I'm seeing from our partners at ABC News is that this new trade agreement which was reached\nLast night in the eleventh hour by the way it was due at midnight and I came down in the eleven o'clock hour last night this new agreement gives American farmers greater access to the Canadian dairy market that is one of the biggest headlines we've been talking about today\nAnd it also provide some protection for Canada on automobile terrorists that the president has been threatening so if he were to go through with those up Canada would would possibly have an out for that or at least be excluded from it so right now I'm looking at life pictures from the White House and Laurel if you get on my board up here our partners at ABC News are getting ready for the right now I'm going to\nRevamp NAFTA with or without Canada today prime minister Justin Trudeau\nSaid as he left his office it is a good day for Canada so he also appears to be pleased with what he than the United states along with Mexico partners have been able to negotiate care and says oh there is still a lot of work to be\nTo be done the U.S trade representative said in a statement that this new agreements going to strengthen the middle class create good well paying jobs are new opportunities for the nearly half a billion people who called North America whole getting there though Karen was never really a certainty or so a team\nNo and and you brought up the fact that the president was willing to go it alone with Mexico but it was never clear that Mexico is willing to go alone with the United states that that certainly was a kink in the negotiations that they run a candidate could be a part of that and also lawmakers I there was no guarantee\nThat Congress is going to go ladies and gentlemen the bilateral trade agreement there making the announcing the rose garden Aaron and at the president's elected to walk outside [noise]\nDoor opens from the White House and hear the president is here\nComes President Trump lived at the White House line on news Ninety six point five W ... always going to talk about the new trade agreement reached\nWith Canada and Mexico the president about to take the podium now interesting to note Jared Kushner his son in law is there so here's President Trump lives on news Ninety six point five WTO sending your reactions to what he says it will play it on Orlando's new the new coming up\nIt's really great to see everybody on this beautiful beautiful day in Washington DC\nSomebody will say the swamp but I Will not say that to the Irish is this is too too important to what we're doing what are the most important deals and the most important trade deal we've ever made by far and wanted to thank senator Joni Ernst for being here Joni thank you very much\nIowa and I'll be there very soon we'll be doing something\nVery important that Iowa but this is maybe more important than all of it put together a journey so I Want to thank you for being in a\nCongressman holding congressman row congressman new house and congressman meadows thank you all for being here we are very much appreciate it if you've been very instrumental thank you\nI don't want to see our companies leave and fire are workers and our workers never get jobs to replace those chefs those days are over\nThis deal will also imposes new standards requiring at least Seventy five percent of every automobile to be made in North America in order to qualify for the privilege of free access to our markets and that's what it is it's a privilege we don't take it as a privilege\nWe don't take it as a privilege is a privilege for them to do business with us and I'm not talking about Mexico ... I'm Talking about everybody everybody it's a privilege for China\nTo do business with us it's a privilege for the European Union who is treated us very badly but that's coming along to do business with U.S Japan every country it's a privilege for them to come in and attack the piggy bank and this\nWe will have a result of much more happening right here in the United states it means\nMore than anything else far more American Jobs and these are high quality jobs they're also strong provisions to enforce what's called the rules of origin requirements this will incentivize billions of dollars a new purchases of us made automobiles\nWants to prove this will be a new dawn for the American auto industry and for the American auto worker they will say they understand they voted for us in large numbers even though their leadership\nAlways goes Democrat\nA couple of them said to me I don't know how I can do it again many of them the leaders were back Democrats and would tell me you're going to get most of the votes from union workers and we got most of the votes from workers period but\nAmerican auto worker\nWas very much behind what we were doing as one primary aspect it will transform North America back into a manufacturing powerhouse fear remember the previous administration said we're not going to have manufacturing jobs anymore essentially we're not going to have we're not going to make things anymore\nNo just the opposite going to be a manufacturing powerhouse that allow us to reclaim a supply chain that has been off shored to the world because of ... fair trade issues\nWe also provide brand new intellectual property protections for biologic drugs which will make North America a haven for medical innovation\nAnd then develop and we want our drugs should be made here when you talk prescription drugs we don't like getting them from foreign countries we don't know what's happening with those drugs how they're being made to important\nThis landmark agreement will send cash in jobs pouring into the United states and into North America good for Canada good from Mexico instead of jobs leaving for overseas\nThey will be returning back home and we've already had a we have many many car companies I was with prime minister of Japan you said\nWe have sent many car companies to the United states over the last year and a half it's true and big expansions and very importantly he said many more are coming\nBecause they have an incentive now to be here people want to be back in the United states again as I say and he was\n... when I Lived ... here President Trump
