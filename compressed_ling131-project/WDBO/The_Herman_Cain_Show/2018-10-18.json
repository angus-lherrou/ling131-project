{"month": "10", "state": "FL", "station": "WDBO", "content": "You know we remember the last century everything that had been invented was advantage that was an erroneous statement obviously we also thought the world was pretty much set once the Soviet Union collapsed in the in the eastern bloc spelling and now we're all of a sudden we had big NATO in a lot of democracies we thought we were done what happened [noise]\nI'm frankly nobody really knows I mean the last Twenty years has been a roller coaster almost all the expectations big not to look for weren't fulfilled\nAnd nobody really knows what we'll be say in the ... the first time in history\nWe have no idea about the basics we don't know what the job market\nWould look like in Thirty years we didn't know the human body oh life expectancy will be in the middle of the twenty first century so it's also the face time in history we really have literally dear to teach children in school because of all of last before they learn what it probably be irrelevant by the time the therapy of faulty\nThough of course also in previous in history you could never really tell the future in detail but at least you know the basic things like what will people do for living in Thirty years oh what kind of body they will have in Tokyo for these we knew that and no we don't know that\nWell a ... so you get artificial intelligence you say it's outstripping the human mind the human body in what way\nI mean you know almost every month fulfill we hear about and you eh um and you achievement of all the official intelligence\nOr doing things do better than human beings but only playing a game or driving the car oh diagnosing diseases or deciding who gave a loan tour ... load gauge do a lot more than you apply to a bank to get to the lower\nEnd to the process as the request and decide whether to give you a loan or not he's not a human being it's an algorithm\nSo interesting also people get a nerve they remember President Obama gave this speech saying hey we you know bank tellers aren't needed any more because of ATMs almost cursing the advent of ATMs but you cannot hose onto the past right you have to stay ahead of the curb so where does some of the Twenty one things we should be looking at in the twenty first century\n[noise] what if you talk about the job market then obviously the will be a new job\nBut we don't know if you will be enough\nNew job and the biggest problem of fall will be to retrain and to basically reinvent yourself when we used to it to ...\nWhen you do most of your learning when you're young and then for the rest of your life few you rely on the knowledge on the skills that you acquire the young person but in the coming decades they will not be enough\nYou will have to reinvent yourself\nYou'll you'll live several times not just one\nBecause the automation revolution will not be a one time event and let's say twenty twenty five like fifty percent of job disappear new job in marriage though if you refuse but eventually everything settles down into a new ... bringing it won't be like this\nIt would be kind of infer bigger disruptions\nEvery ten years you basically have to reinvent yourself if you want to stay in the game\nAnd we don't know if we have the educational system or even we have the psychological stability the psychological balance\nTo to live up in such a stressful world\nSo interesting you bring up a story a weed Google for example so you have a you have health insurance and you told you you don't smoke or life insurance you don't smoke will use use knee gets me a cigarette Well Google has a way of finding out that you did that next thing you know your policies cancelled we're living in a surveillance ... it'll he did it to ourselves\nIn ... one of them maybe the most people don't think if you don't read that for the most important thing to know about leaving the twenty first century either we I'm now ... bell on emails\nWe are and he knows that can be hacked let me get a lot of talk about ... king your computer or your smartphone your email account\nThis is nothing but the real story is the ability to hack human beings what does it mean to me and I'll go read them\nGot their own you enough data not just about what you buy and you go with a bump to you what's happening inside your body to gather enough data to get to know you better than you know yourself because the crucial point one some I'll go with them out there\nKnows better than you know yourself it cannot only put the decisions and choices and makes choices on your behalf it can basically make them for the most important decision in life for people to study in college a will to work even who pulmonary cooking is a federally dystopian\nEat them even today increasingly rely on I'll go read them is that in order to make decisions that used to be made but human humans\nWe rely on Facebook with what you knew we rely on Amazon ... could afford to buy you would rely on Netflix to tell us what to watch how we rely on on a Google to tell if it's true\nBut increasingly people will turn to uncle rhythms even to tell them things like what the study or who to marry\nInteresting and lastly what happens to religion what happens to patriotism nationalism where where does that go in this new environment\nThey still have a lot of importance but the key thing to realize they think that the biggest problems we face all agree all the problems in nature and therefore cannot be sold just on the level of a single country you will need stronger global cooperation in order to deal with them because\nOf it is in the case of nuclear war and the climate change\nBut it's also true of the cultural disruption if you if we want to regulate the slow these potential of all the fish will encourage answer bioengineering you can't do it on the level of one country because nobody would like to stay behind he for example you think that\nStarting to engineered human babies is a bad idea and you can ban it in other states\nOr do you do if the Chinese are doing it and they'll think the ... youth super human is by the south and\nVery soon you will be forced to break your own band because you wouldn't like to stay behind and it's the same we development like autonomous flipping seats that they'll kill a robot\nFor if we if we want and we I mean we certainly shoot regulate these exploits the mute the cheese it can only be done to global cooperation from nationally it's any state of patriotism as to the very important\nBut it should be um Olbermann that they should show added to it shouldn't be the realization that with out strong global cooperation human crime we're not be able to regulate and to really survive these men for the Lucian\nYeah it's so hard we're not cooperating with each other let alone with other ... uh we'd get we'll get nations who are so different to get along but who knows maybe we'll make the adjustment on the fly that's certainly a let's hope so yeah let's hope so a\nProfessor thanks so much for joining us I appreciate it go out and pick up his book is excellent it'll get you thinking twenty first Twenty one lessons for the

you seen this\nAll started a down in Guatemala on friday with a hundred and sixty migrants\nAnd apparently they said we're going to try to take the same track that they took in April when thousands or almost a thousand migrants were heading through Central America to the United states and Donald Trump worn Central American governments hey you're better turn up but the flow of migrants or else\nIt looks as if we will probably turn off the foreign aid to your nation and when you look at the amount of money that the United states gives to all these nations it's substantial [noise]\nSo what is different this time the last time is the fact that now you've got Honduras and Guatemala they're both saying hey uh you know what if you're in the migrants um march toward the north a turnaround come on back because\nYou're breaking the law essentially up at the big thing that bothers a lot of Americans is the fact that the borders between these nations are invisible and they're simply not enforced [noise] but now we understand from Mexico which has sent or something like five hundred security personnel to their southern border in Mexico between Mexico and Guatemala\nA unless you've got the proper papers they're not going to let people through nonetheless the president or given the fact that it is just less than three weeks away from the mid turns ...\nThe realizes that this is not only an important issue for our national security but also for his turn out the vote\nBase a heated and tweeting this morning and the tweets are so extraordinary I'm going to share them with you right here on the brink ... two hours go to the president tweeted this out I'm watching the Democratic party led because they wouldn't open border and existing we claws\nI'm watching the Democratic party led assault on our country by Guatemala Honduras and El Salvador whose leaders are doing little to stop this large flow of people\nIncluding many criminals from entering the United states from Mexico to the United states and he goes on in addition to stopping all payments to these countries have remembered it adds up to hundreds of millions of dollars\nIn addition to stopping all payments to these countries which seemed to have almost no control over the population I must in the strongest terms asked Mexico to stop this onslaught\nAnd if Mexico is unable to do so and here's the news folks in Mexico is unable to do so I Will call up the U.S military and close our southern border the president says\nHe's got one final tweet it says the assault\nOn our country at our southern border including the criminal elements of drugs for an end is far more important to me as president than trade or the new NAFTA us MCA hopefully Mexico will stop this onslaught at their northern border all Democrats fault for weight loss\nBut we had a one of the men in charge of enforcing the immigration laws in our nation Tom Homan was on with us this morning and during this time of breaking news and watching this a caravan of now close to four thousand people from Honduras in Guatemala heading to Mexico\nWhy are they doing it well Tom Homan had this observation\nLast quarter of a in Mexico that you know people to Central America cannot transit through Mexico without without ... what we call transit visa\nSo Mexico can stop these people are the southern border term around or that imply for asylum in Mexico see here's here's the thing I was talking about these people are really escaping fear of persecution hunger us\nWhat they already wants it while I'm all the getting some skull so they don't need to get to the United states so this is really about skipping fair persecution this is about ... states and pick an advantage of the loopholes in the system\n[noise] see it's the loopholes in the system that allow people to come into this country who do not have proper paperwork and did not apply at their native plants for passage into the United states if these loopholes that are on the books that so many Republicans\nHave suggested Congress has got to do something to change the laws but you know you know how Congress works these days it's interesting the president of Honduras this morning in the pages of the Washington Post\nAnd and this is a little crazy I don't know exactly what he's talking about but the president of Honduras accused on named political groups including the caravan\nWas based on lies to cause problems in the country of Honduras he said quote there are sectors that want to destabilize the country but we will be decisive and we will not allow it he says\nUh also the foreign ministry of that country has told a alleges that people are lured to join the migration with false promises of you know what you're going to wind up getting a visa in Mexico and then you're going to be able to ask for asylum in the United states so ah the foreign ministry of Honduras is saying\nYou know just hop on the line and Mexico is going to let us go through and then you're going to apply for asylum and that's one of the loopholes\nThat Tom Homan was talking about if you get to our southern border and you apply for asylum the United states government without laws on the books has got to go ahead and take a look at your application and whether or not you should be allowed in you know here's the thing\nCurrently Mexico says that anybody with travel documents enemy ... will be allowed to enter Mexico and anyone who wants to apply for refugee status can do so but they have no intention of letting the migrants simply cross the border they say they're going to go through standard immigration procedures\nAnd the Associated Press yesterday I talked to a number of the migrants in this particular care of and\nNot a single one had a passport\nThink about that no one had a passport so what's Mexico going to do when they're knocking on the door and they say okay uh we need to apply for asylum what's Mexico going to do the president has made it very clear\nThat Mexico let these people in there is a possibility he will mobilize the U.S military and close our southern border to them that is extraordinary [laughter]\nBut as I said earlier it is politics and we're about to play a cut with a Newt Gingrich from last night on the Sean Hannity show\nAnd he sees not only the national security angle he sees the or the midterms as well looming large just three weeks away and here are two words that Newt says it's all about\nI think two words are going to define the night of the two thousand Eighteen election and an X ray which one is Kevin ... and the other is caravan\nAnd the combination of anger over how the left smear engaged in character assassination lied used bullying tactics with judge Kavanaugh is the only one part of this and the degree to which the left his anger\nTo have three thousand people have caravans across the American border break American law recognizing that if that happens next caravan will even bigger and the caravan after that will be even bigger\nAnd I think the American people are going to reject both the way they treated cabinet and the way they are dealing with the border and I think those will end up being\nThe reasons the Republicans keep the house and dramatically increase the number of senators they have\nSo think about it or if Newt is right and uh so many Americans already have an opinion formed on Mr Kavanaugh who now sits on the Supreme Court a lot of Democrats are steam that he was able to be confirmed by the U.S Senate there are a lot of Republicans who are steamed\nAt at the treatment and the investigation and the allegations that were never proven were made no doubt by a number of women but uh we're never proven according to the FBI background checks so you've got a ... the the country motivated on that but keep in mind the midterms art for another three weeks\nFor the most part what do we have a looming large you've got this caravan\nAnd just think about it uh currently the caravan is a four thousand people is about Thirteen hundred miles to United States\nAnd there are some who have suggested just about the time people are going to vote on election day\nOn the first Tuesday in November and it's about the time that this caravan could be arriving at our southern border and keep in mind last time this happened and um it was a number of months ago where it became so dramatic when it was a learned that the federal government\nUnder laws enacted during the Obama administration were enforcing the laws and the land and that was to separate families and our southern border and there was a a you know if it was a shocking to many people because they did not realize that that was happening [noise]\nIs there a possibility this caravan could actually be at our southern border at about that time and that would inflame both sides once again because it really is a binary choice\nYou look at the Republicans who say we need a strong border we need to keep people from coming in who have no business doing that but then again you've got the Democrats saying essentially they are a party of open borders let people who qualify come on in\nBut at the same time you've got a number of Democrats\nIn the U.S a strategic positions in the communications department at all of these Democrats offices and they're saying you know what this is a loser issue for us so whatever we do let's not talk about immigration before the midterms\nBut we're talking about it here on the ground kill me ... we'd love to hear your point of view we if you'd like to call in and weigh in on the number is one eight six six for all eight seven six six night we're going to take some of your calls end or buddy rich Lowry from National Review is going to be joining us on the other side of a time out you are listening to the Brian kilometer radio show\nGiving you everything you need to do is Brian Gilmore [noise]\nVery troubled him traffic\nDelays on ... east bound growing just a bit you're slowing down now about Seventeen minutes east bound from Osceola Parkway they just after five thirty five\nInsurance news Ninety six twenty five W W [noise]\nSenate races where it looks almost impossible to me now that Republicans could lose nominal control I think they did at least you know the worst cases fifty fifty where petri tie breaker\nUm but the question is does that energy you know last that the next three weeks so if there's something like you know crisis over the caravan maybe that\nHelps calm in a house it's just the these um districts that Clinton won that are occupied by Republicans are really endangered the ones where they're public an incumbent has retired about eight of them\nAre basically gone even Republican admit they're they're gone and that gets you you know eight eight seats towards just twenty three they need that that still holding the house will be the Republican somehow managed that it'll be a miracle and I'll do it you know by Syria to\nWrite a we had Eric Trump on Fox different this morning and he said look if the Democrats when they're going to be a lot of investigations into you know the Trump Administration the Trump family everybody he said uh but then again when you look at what the Republicans have been able to achieve with the Republican president\nTheir record is body you know the president really one of the the the wall ... you know they're barely building the fence or you want to get rid of Obamacare So it's not like a Republican led Congress is helping him\n[laughter] yeah so they did attack which ... which which is a big deal step but otherwise most of the important things have happened through executive action them through\nRegulatory actions so that the downside of Democrats\nTaken houses when you you you know what the other party to take our period but um as Eric I'm pointed out they'll you know some kids spend all their times of painting the president and they ... and investigating and try to make everyone's life miserable it's possible that's just that they have a one majority and see if there's any kind of joy\nAnd they got you know Fifteen it was like a wave Fifteen votes they're going to\nTeach the other two yeah you're probably right hey rich Lowry thank you very much for joining us today here on the Brian ... radio show\n\n[noise]\nThis is news

neighborhood I live in ...\nThey wouldn't know the difference in the Republican or democratic conservative and liberal um that's just not the case and as long as I Lived in New Jersey I've ever had a republic cub stuck in my city of care do they always you know right by us\nSo how is it that you know\nWhen you guys allow the Democrats to say that Republicans are or racist and all we see is is is you know the president thoroughly let see them a paper towel but that's that's what we're that's what we see the ideas we will republic you guys have a lot of great ideas I mean I Can't look Republicans are just so your your ideas\nNow let me ask you because I live in northern New Jersey I'm about Seventy miles away from where you're talking about down the camp than we're used to live do you think Republicans don't go because they just figure you know that area has voted Democrat for generations and I'm not going to be wasting my time there\nProbably but they don't they don't know

I Can't even tell you how many times I grew up in the kingdom of Saudi Arabia I remember when I'm there was a huge uproar and threats of the Saudi Government at OPEC\nRaising the oil prices when the princess of Saudi Arabia was executed in a soccer field along with the man she tried to flee Saudi Arabia with her ... she wanted to marry her lover and they caught her at the airport uh it uh\nYou

about it so we're talking to certain quarter you know over the last year she has broken so many stories choose an investigative reporter and so you know it looked like Rod Rosenstein was going to be going up to Capitol Hill I think last week last Thursday is going to need\nIt was going to talk about the New York times story about how he's just said he would wear a wire and they needed to use the you know all sorts of a\nConstitutional tricks to get rid of the ... the United states and it sounds like when it at the eleventh hour when the congressional investigators and their staffs\nSaid okay we'd like you to come and you're going to be under oath because I'm under oath ... wait a minute I thought we just have a little uh informal conversation with Mr good lead I didn't realize there would be a lot of people with ...\nWanted to ask me questions the very late and really\nI Would have to be actually telling the truth and the latest story at a certain quarter dot com is congressional sources concerned Judiciary Committee threat to subpoena Rosenstein is empty so in other words you know it sounds like well you're in front of the cameras were innocent but that's not going to happen\n[noise] no I ... you know this is what's so frustrating talking to a number of sources who spent a I guess you could say last few years investigating this right uh and putting the pieces together\nOne of the most frustrating aspects of this for both those congressional members and those investigators in reporters like me and judicial watch fighting for document\nIs the fact that there is no teeth ever to anything that they say who is investigating the investigators Steve this is what's so frustrating we have Rod Rosenstein who's overseeing the special counsel we know that\nAccording to my sources Robert Morris wrapping up its pro we've seen it you know he's he's going to issue a report after the election but we also have all this other information that's been pouring out information that is by far the most shocking\nEvidence that we've seen in modern political history of people working subversive Li like a shadow government to remove a duly elected president of the United states and the fact that the outcome of an election so now we have all this information we have James Baker who's by the way on Capitol Hill now uh with with testifying\nTo Congress he's a former general counsel\nVery close to James cone each met with Andrew McCain me at least a page after they meet and made two thousand Seventeen with Rod Rosenstein and they're telling him look Rod Rosenstein has this idea\nTo record a President Trump there's also some talk about invoking the twenty Fifth Amendment and apparently there's two other administration officials involved in this town and it's\nShocking but he won't want he doesn't want to answer questions about this he doesn't want to talk about this the American people still don't have the documents that that they that they should have that they should have the the transparency that they need to know what was going on and as far as I can be\nThe only accountability it's for those people that supported President Trump those are the people that were investigated roots that none of the other evidence is is is being investigated and there's nobody overseeing that\nNo it is just such a mess I Want to read the
