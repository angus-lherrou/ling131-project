Alaskan ... right\nMight remember though right after the last big get together with these guys the uh after the committee vote remember it was more kept the mansion columns in flight who got together and a lot of people think they move as a bloc now she need political cover to vote no\nThey may have made a deal were mentioned that I'm going to be a yes that gives you what you need to go home and go now because you know for him he's in a reelection race and a state that President Trump won by forty point it may be more politically advantageous or if those or are working together for him to say\nI'll go ahead and take the yes so it won't hurt me it'll probably helped me in reelection if you need to be a no on the cover for you because the war has been behind closed doors many times together discussing what they would do and it could be a deal [noise] I'll\nTell you what are the more I think about it tactically show and it is a genius move for mention at this age he's a young I mean he's in he's about Seventy no he's already been a governor he wants to get another six years here it will just you know it'll say I'm doing well West Virginia wants me to do okay he's already pro gun we're you know he's into Obamacare\nSo he can stay a Democrat being West Virginia and it'd be the most vital vote for Republicans and Democrats for six years heated arguably the most powerful person in the Senate\nYeah he could be like the Justice Kennedy then\nIt where you know both sides know that the persuadable at\nTimes on really important issues and\nYou know I covered his Senate campaign last time around and traveling state of West Virginia over and over and over again people love him there and what they told me is he's actually worked with both sides of the ... that's why we loved him as a governor Locke Republicans and Democrats in the state capital and say no one's leaving him ordering and food and so we figure out the budget\nAnd he would make sure that both sides are doing some give and take and I think we've seen him do that in the Senate\nUm that he is persuadable on key issues to both sides so um I think that he is a true old fashioned politician and that he doesn't always but with his party\nAnd see the is the benefit a and actually across the aisle at times not political reasons uh although you know this vote could be one of those political reason um but because he actually thinks it benefits people West Virginia and they have great respect for him there I mean I I couldn't find a Republican that had anything negative to say about him when I was there covering a campaign\nBecause he just truly respect him as a man of his word and a principal\nOkay we got this news you want to share with you a source familiar with the lobbying efforts to confirm Kavanaugh to Fox News this might have been from you that the White House believes it has the votes to confirm Kavanaugh other sources they blew Murkowski's loss but they will get managing as well as cones and boy to vote yes\nMhm [noise] and they were still working on Donnelly too because you remember last friday he voted or that he was going to be a no votes and then they have the deal come out of committee and then he was sort of like well let's see what happens after this report the White House has not as as late as yesterday they did not think Donnelly was locked in fact they thought that he was\nPossibly still persuadable um you know you've got the issue of the bank to I mean he's an absolute yachts for cap and all but his daughter's getting married tomorrow and we had him on the show last night and eat that if I've got to be there I Will find my way back ... opened\nUm you know and of course the vice president's going to be around in case there's a tie that needs to be um broken but they feel like at this point they've got a path albeit a very narrow once he getting cabin on to the bench\nFor the next most important votes tomorrow if we've got to get past that Frank and then that will set the clock here for the vote on Saturday I've got a wedding on Saturday my goal this weekend is to walk my daughter down the aisle and to see a you know you knew the United States Supreme court justice\nWhat does his daughter say about that [laughter]\nYou know can you imagine this is that the opposition for their family to be in but you know he told me there's no way he's going to you know let them fall apart he will find a way to get their act that would be at a time machine um and he had no but you know they have maneuvers to hold a vote open and he said there are these things called airplane\nSo you know initially he was saying he wouldn't be available at all Saturday the whole wedding day I'm sure they have yes than family and it's\nThe one day in your daughter's life that you know you really can't miss 'em but what did they hold that over into the wee hours or whatever they do you know Mitch McConnell the man is a master technician at procedure on the floor and accounting has the there's no way he would have triggered this if he did not feel like they had a way to win\nIs that's interesting because I was asking around and people say that he said do we as a country have no choice we have to move this ahead\nBecause you can't use what are you going to do I mean you do the FBI investigation you're done with the persuadable she's not going to come out again he does the oil so wouldn't one way or another we have to do this so you tell me that you believe promote your contacts that if if it became clear that two of the poor we're going to vote no that she would have held it off\nI don't know I mean I think that yeah we're kind of it at the point where they're really has no\nUh no we don't do that but you know how good McConnell is it this until I have\nTo feel like at some point in the week he and I did have someone tell me earlier in the week a GOP center that they felt confident had mansion so you know I I think when McConnell took the floor and said we are voting that week I think by then he would condense it they had to pass\nThem when you say that you do you think do you think of the brain that they told mentioned will ease off in your Senate race if you give me this\nI don't think so I think that they're going to want that seat more than ever um but if they feel like there's not a real shot it that they tried to give him some political cover [noise]\nUh I'm just saying that were done only two dollars yeah I'll give you this vote it'd be it'd be back off because I could lose but Donnelly weight and there's no yesterday Heidi Heitkamp trailing by about eight to nine votes collectively got a point to collectively she voted no\nYeah and and I think for her at this point there's no chance of now there is no chance the polls don't look good for her right now and I feel like if she and her got our heart and and on principle feels like she doesn't want to vote for this guy if she was maybe within three or four\nPoint maybe we see something different if she feels like um she's likely going to lose this race anyway she may want to go out with a her head up by ... if she feels like there's something\nAbout judge Kavanaugh that she can't wear personally for her\nUm but you know you got in the capital she's in knowing that the nail biter I mean there's so many of these races or cannot absolutely factoring in and you know all the polling showing that it it looks like it's kind of been a bad that the Republicans I mean that they say they're more United and they would have been they've had not nothing to really\nRally around and tell now I'm In the house paints a different picture the race over there but the Senate races are now it looks like despite what you've been been losing nasty and ugly has actually benefited Republicans in in most of the Senate races\nAre shattered Bremer those Jenna before I let you go I Want everyone to get an understanding of what it's like in Washington here's an example center Orrin Hatch who's seen it all but it's not take the Republicans are beginning to fight back listen to this cut forty one\n\nI guess one of the things you don't say there is when you grow up that set her up I mean but that's it's indicative of what's going on what is it like walking the halls and Capitol building\nIt is absolute insanity as you would imagine I'm listening to Capitol police have worked overtime they have had so much on their hands in the U.S hearing began at the beginning of September\nUm it's been nonstop and you understand people are so passionate on both sides of that but the left has been very organized\nYou know they're celebrities involved there's funding for numerous sources involved I mean this is not just a few people are going to show up because the the big day I mean people are organizing nearby in 'em and I got to think that he's members Republicans or Democrats most of them\nThey like and able to walk around and be normal people and not have any security with them and most of them were just that but from talking to you right now are taking it I mean they're using\nUm capital and other security to get them from point a to point that they don't vote and they can get them where um the conflict and the people of the country are more than welcome to show up and all of the Senate um hallways and to make their voices known at the protests\nUm and it's just part of the job right now but it it's at a level I haven't ever seen before uncovered Washington fourteen years\nFree with help from one Democrat Manchin
