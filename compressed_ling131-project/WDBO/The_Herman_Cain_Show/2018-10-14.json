future\nDot com bust show as always goes by too fast or you know we wish we had more time to unpack some of these topics a lot of times it's been a great show\nThe one thing we were talking about during the break with Jeff was a VA benefits are changing and a couple of days what's going on there\nYes for the past history of the some ... called eight in attendance that are helpful for assisted living there in home care mhm I'm can be up to twenty six thousand dollars a year that they give you to help pay for these sorts of benefits [noise] um there was no look back period there were a means tested that you could essentially\nDump all your money into a trust to turn around and apply for these benefits are in four days that's changing\nSo for the last about three years they proposed implementing to look back period\nI'm late last month they made the announcement the rules have been approved and on the Eighteenth of October so in four days\nThat look back period is getting put into place we actually have been hired by a lot of people recently to to do set up the trust and move everything right now before the Eighteenth because it specifically included language has said that it will not apply retroactively we're down to the for the Eighteen so we have a lot of people doing that\nAnd then it kinda firmed up what the um the limits look like it used to be where you can have more than eighty thousand dollars but that's if you were Seventy and married if you were Ninety and single maybe you could only have thirty thousand dollars there wasn't a bright line yeah so what they've done now they say okay it's a hundred and twenty three thousand dollars of assets\nCombined with your annual income and that's the limit now there are still ways of getting around that so that's an important thing to keep in mind that\nJust because the you know that that one twenty three as the quote unquote limit there still strategies we have they're just not going to be as good as they just dump it into a trust and turn around the\nGlobe right right you got to do a little bit more of their and that's an important part and that that's you know a lot of the work that you do is helping people have a source of\nMoney even ... you know hey I'm going to go on Medicaid and if I can only have one of the two thousand dollars to my name yeah well how are you going to you know buy a new t._v. when you want to you need new clothes you need things that you know that assisted living are\nSkilled nursing care center is not going to provide for so how do your shelter some money right to do that so that hey I don't just have a thousand bucks to buy name and\nYou know whatever the the skilled nursing place provides that will you help people do are able let's shelter some money so that it's there for a mom or dad in\nCase they needed an awesome show thanks to everybody that contributed\nThrough the phone and a couple of text messages there again if we can be a resource to you\nThat it's a simple process and everybody should have a well\nI don't want to spend too much on this because we do other stuff to get to hear but just what school you know a little bit of what might happen now to her state into everything she owns because no should\nNot legal will write well every state has and test state laws which means that what happens depends on the law of your state and it just goes by the statute so you know maybe she review the statue and that was fine\nWith her um but maybe not so um that's what happens with ... wherever you may live so if you live in Florida and you have a well it'll go by the end to state laws of the state of Florida\nRight good stuff Sherry right now on through the constitutional revision commission and the amendments that they're putting forth which will vote on November there eight amendments correct and in within those eight there are a bunch of other little things is is a this is a commission that gets together every Twenty years there's thirty seven members\nNine and ten Floridians were unaware that existed right [laughter]\nWell you're not one of them not the [laughter] that's all he thinks the sheriff [laughter] um but you're absolutely right Chris now that the primaries are over\n[noise] we've already began to see some commercials yeah I'm trying to persuade people to vote one way or another on these amendments and\nThese amendments are not simple um you know they took a long time and a lot of debate um for the constitutional provision commission to come up with 'em and so you're not\nGoing to understand what's in it by a thirty second or a minute commercial\nUm so it's very important that people go behind what they hear in any commercial regardless of the side that the commercial is taking 'em so that commercial or advertisement or however you want to put it so that you really understand what's involved here\nYou don't want to make your decision based off the commercials but the commercialism lease bringing it to your attention and now you know that this happening and this is a sign that if you aren't quite sure what the commercial is talking about you should probably go do a little research on it you can form an opinion of your own not based off what the commercial is or isn't telling you to do\nThem solely but even if you are sure what the commercial is talking about sometimes it might only take one aspect of the amendment and yes that aspect of the amendment might be what the commercial says but there are other parts of it as well that could have a different impact\nAnd that's where I Want to talk a little bit more about today because you're right the constitutional regime commission consists of thirty seven Floridians and it meets every Twenty years and this was when I met\nAnd it comes up with proposed amendments that the electorate then votes on so we all are going to be voting on these in November and the amendment numbers proposed by the constitutional provision commissioner number six through Thirteen the others are proposed by legislature and citizen initiatives but I'm going to talk about\nNumber six through Thirteen and those are eight different amendments\nBut included in those eight different amendments are different sections to each amendment and what is very important that the electorate needs to know is that\nIf you vote yes on one amendment even though it may have three or four different sections to it you are voting yes on every single section even though you might want to vote yes on section one and no one section three you can't do that\nIf you vote yes for the amendment you're voting yes for all the section should\nOne of those sections go through and be passed their own votes yes they were you get the majority of the vote on it these can't be changed easily won Caesar and please correct\nBecome amendments to our Florida Constitution which means no they cannot be changed very easily at all um and you know the next time that they may be looked at whether the constitution will be looked at as a whole will be Twenty years from now so we're looking at\nThe thing that's going to be with us for a long time if it if it passes this is not like legislation you know legislature meets we've talked about this for years of the show how\nLaws changing laws often change based on case law or circumstances are things that happen well it's not going to be able to change it because this is our constitutional amendments where's the legislature can change legislation can change statutes\nIf you get a new Congress people and in in the Congress and they have a different view of the law they can change it pretty easily so long as they have the votes\nSo then is there no wage reverse one of these amendments except for Twenty years down the road\nWell their citizens initiatives and things like that there are other ways but they're very difficult and they take a long hair and and they take a long time and they're very difficult so you know a lot of the things that they're proposing has constitutional amendments call for instance to be done as legislation\nRight and do it as legislation it's easier to change yeah you do it as a constitutional amendment you're living with it\nFor a while for instance just won't get then we'll go deeper into details and some of these but one of the ... one of the main amendments board of the sub categories of an amendment is something like a ban on the east six right just something that may be easier to be handled in legislation as opposed to unwritten umbrella of one of these amendments\nCorrect exactly so what I'd like to do is talk about them in order\nUm and the first one is amendment number six now I'm\nThe reason we know these are the amendment says because uh the CRC the constitutional provision commission has to\nDo that that's a lot easier to say I always I keep I fumble over every now and we are see I'm going to remain [laughter]\nSee I see um has to forward their proposed changes\nUm a hundred and eighty days before the general election so where it was in that period of time um\nAnd so it resulted in eight proposals to amend the constitution the a reason for this\nIs just a little bit of history in Nineteen sixty six or the Florida Constitution was drafted a buy a statutory created revision commission and by that back then was chaired by the recent Florida bar president Chesterfield\nSmith we all hear that name if you are familiar with the Florida history a lot um they didn't teach\nMe in Rhode Island and I'm Sorry [laughter]\nAnd Smith and his fellow bar member Robert Irwin urban um wanted citizens to have a the power to amend the constitution\nUm so um [noise] you know for a minute think about what it would be like\nIf we as citizens had the power to him and the U.S constitution every Twenty years right uh [laughter] area would be very interesting but that's what's happening here in Florida so um\nIt's a very serious\nEndeavor yeah and\nI'm concerned that a lot of the electric won't electric won't take it as seriously as I Know and a lot of people that I work with no it shouldn't be taken\n[noise] that's why I'm going to spend quite a bit of time on my shows talking about these various amendments new and the one that I Want to start with first um is amendment number six\nYou know it's very why do we want to hold off on amendments six for a moment here will break for the three big things and then we'll start fresh on amendments six so return here that change land the benefit of the\nThe change coming amendment six and what you need to know about that one coming up next you're listening to the law review right here on news Ninety six point five WTO [noise]\nTo read this morning of

relevant and we still have seven others too so this is this is deep right right well we're going to try to cover one and then we're not going to get them all today that they don't have time for that but I held the but that's how\nThat's how intense these aren't that's how much information comes along with each one that we have eight amendment and we're not going to be able to get through more than one show we're going to focus on one amendment a show because that's how that's how much stuff is going on here that you need to know right\nRight and I'm hoping that I actually get questions about these amendments because you out there as listeners I'm sure have some concerns and some questions about what the impact may or may not be\nRight well so we we will do well we're talking about the sixth amendment or ... a year and you know do your own research on the sixth one now this coming week and get your questions writing and we'll build ready to answer questions about the six men next time as we're also talking about the ... right and do a little ...\nExactly exactly so the uh the the portion of the last portion of the first section\nOf the sixth amendment as I was saying before the break requires proceedings legal proceedings to be completed within without reasonable delay and without reasonable delay is basically um\nAppeals and collateral attacks of any judgment must be completed within two years of the date of the appeal and non capital cases and five years from the data the appeal in capital cases\nI'm now at the there are issues regarding you know arguments on both sides of this um but some believe that this requirement or what unduly burn the judicial system and state resources along with the requirement to protect\n'em we afford reasonable protection to the victims um the concern here um by some as that is going to really stretch of the resources and and I'm I'm put a burden on the judicial system\n[noise] okay so in summer ate the first part of the sixth amendment alright has basically three different sections um one\nIs a victim's rights um the other is the um proceedings must be completed within a year and the other is the\nUm idea of the allocation of judicial resources to these are things [noise]\nNow the second section of the sixth amendment is judicial deference to agency interpretation well what does this mean this is a um ... a legal issue right and I'm kind of surprised that a legal issue like this is actually put into the constitution\nUm but what has happened is this is directed toward a I'm\nIn Florida Supreme Court decision in Nineteen fifty to the Florida Supreme Court basically established the doctrine of what we called judicial deference and what that means is that an interpretation of a statute

I Would say hey let's just\nOne issue for time so I'm really glad that you have a exposed this thing and that would have to rely more on personal researchers and see how it will be best suit the individual informed citizens appreciate your being one of those persons are doing well\nThank you Joseph I appreciate you taking the responsibility seriously\nYes ma'am God Bless you thank you much\nThank you appreciate that colleges have good call it is a good call and you know the the the one issue as we go through this people may have\nVery strong opinions like Joseph about one section of the of the proposed amendment I'm but not others um and I'm a [laughter]\nAnd all of a sudden the patient says to me talk why wasn't given this option and I thought bingo that's the purpose of my show that's where I've been saying week after week and I said to him that's a good question and I'm asking you folks\nWhy wasn't he given the option stink about it why wasn't he given this option\nWhat we have to offer and our offices is clearly safer it's less invasive and I could tell you from treating thousands of these cases it's clearly effective so why wasn't he given the option that's a great question a quake Russian I don't know the answer to exactly but I could tell you this\nIt's obvious in the news that people are not being given option so I came across an article from NBC News that was just from a couple of months ago\nAnd it was exactly on this topic you know of course we treat a lot of back pain in her office and it's a difficult thing to match for a lot of doctors so here's what NBC News had to say\nI'm just going to be little bits of it to you guys are so first of all says low back pain is eight the top cause not a V. top cause of disability globally yet most people are getting the wrong treatments for a new survey shows\nAnd nowhere did they get more wrong therapy I eat opioids is what they're talking about\nWhich by the way they have had my first show it was on the opioid epidemic you could go to um a website on orange foremost dot com and you could actually scroll down the home page and click on uh the podcast I Choose or you can click on Google Play if you have an Android and you listen to the opiate show anyway the article says\nNowhere do people get\nThe wrong therapy more so than in the United states and that they're referring to opioids and drugs in general that goes on to say that despite guidelines from top medical groups and studies and recommendations that doctors still tend to prescribe pain pills to people with back pain\nInstead of recommending other options I mean just unbelievable in in the midst of an opioid crisis stepped epidemic Chris we still have this going on in this country\nNow further in the u._s. for instance more than sixty percent of the people with low back pain get opioids greater than sixty percent of being prescribed and more than half of the total number of people who are taking the opioids were given it for\nLong term lower back pain which is what we're all out here and we're going to be talking about low back pain today some more specifically we're going to be discussing herniated discs degenerative disc bulging disc\n... addict or a term called ridiculously to see that a lot of people see on there and my reports it on the what that is so we're going to discuss all of this this stuff but half the people on opioids\nAre for given for back pain that is just huge [noise] um let's see the Centers for Disease Control and prevention says an opioid overdoses went up to thirty percent between twenty sixteen and twenty Seventeen even though they know this is a problem it's still going up it's killing thirty five thousand people a year in the U. S.\nTruly unbelievable stuff folks\nAnd um the American College of physicians has said in guiding the the the guidelines on back pain that prescription drugs should be used as a last resort I remember when chiropractic was a last resort and now we're seeing patients come to us first and now the drugs are last resort something my profession has been saying\nFor a hundred and Twenty years or so that chiropractic should be first then we could always go to drugs later than we could always go to surgery after that but unfortunately I'm a lot of America's not doing that still ... says he's\nSixty percent and you said it really sixty percent of people are seeing on opioids for the ex those back\nThen yep ... and it's a and they're saying now that they should be the last resort and they're not unfortunately\nBut so that's not what we're getting we're not getting the right recommendations or instead people are getting painkillers and surgery now listen to this one crisis is interesting obviously we know surgery\nIs invasive it does work but only in ... in particular cases\nAnd it's expensive and could lead to ... complications yet it is a popular choice they go on to say that are in the u._s._a. and twenty eleven spinal fusion where they actually take the disc out and fused vertebrae together with screw in plate I mean it's a pretty invasive surgery\nUm this is responsible for the highest aggregate hospital costs of any surgical procedure\nOf any procedure us the high horse is with this spinal fusion surgery and they say it costs are the costs total twelve point eight billion dollars\nWho [noise] so um you know it says not only are people getting inappropriate drugs or surgery but they were being treated in the wrong places and diagnosed using expensive in a ... and inappropriate technology\nWhen patients are showing up in the emergency room\nInstead of going to their primary doctor's what's a chiropractor and that's the most expensive place you\nMentioned just going to the emergency room for something like this and then discovering afterwards you know listening to you on this show something that you didn't need that you didn't need an emergency room visits for somebody like this the pain can be managed and taking care of in a much more efficient and more cost efficient way one where you don't got to deal with\nScrews and plates and being open up all those words all I cringe here and thinking about having your\nMind cut on and they don't use like little ... when they got to cut open a spy they're using a saw and a chisel I'm Out in the idea\nThat you know God Bless celebrate neurosurgeons we have around here a love them love the guys but again said before my job is to do everything I can to keep you away from that surgeon when you need it I'll be the first got her before you begin there are reasons to have it done but it's being done too much in this country is being done too often at too high a price um [noise]\nYou know and then there's this last part of this study where they mentioned the increased use of ineffective and potentially unsafe treatments has wasted limited health care resources and harmed patience\nAnd you know you mentioned all the screws and play and that you cringe but what about the disability the falls and what about the people will never get back to work after surgery what about the loss income what about the depression they have after that what about the increased drug costs to deal with it what about the ... the fact of the effect on the family the emotional effect on the person whose family\nSide effects of the surgery which is something you never really want that mean you know it's not something that anyone really wants to invite in because like you said there's more to it than just getting the surgery and hoping that it's going to be all good after that no there's going to there might be more problems that you experience after this\nYes ah people think it's a a just a you know you go and you got to fix up in them good to go it's not the case especially with the fusion when you need a fusion surgery and they do those those are more invasive or not to be surgery requires a screw in a place sometimes you just ... it's called the disconnect to me they go out and take a piece of disc off\nBut even that their scar tissue that can happen afterwards there's ... there's this complication so look you know there are reasons to get back surgery and ... for that matter and their reasons we shouldn't be getting it\nAnd we're not saying that one trip to you is going to fix and care you know like that it's going to take a little bit of time but by the time it's been there the the time afterwards once everything is all said and done you won't have as many of the you won't have the lingering back pain you won't have\nTo make reoccurring visits to the doctor's office to get ... seconds surgery or a third surgery you know\nYou will have to make another visiting too and keep this up but\nMost likely you're going to be pain free for the rest of your life or you would hope that you have a much better chance of that was going to you while\nWe are much better chance because we're not cutting in forming scar tissue so uh you know it does take a process sometimes some many people have chronic conditions that have been long standing these herniated disc bulging disc degenerative disc they they're stubborn conditions but they do respond to a treatment\nSpecifically they do respond to non surgical spinal decompression which we're going to get into in the next segment further about what that is that how that works it's like a car\nWhen you get a car and if you just take care and maintain your car over the cars lifetime it's much easier thing to deal with where they start going into that car in an early retirement when one thing breaks down\nStart removing parts and putting new parts in and moving things around I think it's just one more breakdown after another breakdown in you're going to have to pay more and more and more to get that car fixed whereas if you just took care of it over long term and just you know we're diligent about it you wouldn't have nearly as many of the problems are nearly as much stress\nAbsolutely uh you know that's the thing is we will help correct the underlying problem find the cause but then what we recommend is that you maintain it and I always use that example Chris I use the car the oil change analogy\nThe uh manufacturers recommend mate recommended maintenance schedule the rotating tires you know just you're driving your car and not rotating tires you know what happens to the tires right and they're going to wear out quicker of one set of a line that's going to wear a quick I was a different with the spine\nUh if you don't take care of it it's going to wear a quicker it's ... it's designed to last a lifetime but people are breaking down their spines within like thirty forty years or less we see a lot of digital change\nSooner so um and you know just remember you can't replace respond you can replace you need with a fabulous knee replacement surgery they can give you an artificial hip\nThey can change your heart valves out uh but you you don't hear about um a spine replacement surgery like where they're replacing tire spying right\nYou know once you start cutting into that's fine you can just build a new spine again I Can't\nTake it out and put a new one in and you can't take it from someone else and transplanted so you don't hear about spinal transplants you know folks this is a message if you don't take care of your spine if you don't find out what's causing it and you just keep covering with drugs you gonna wear out your spine and then you get to live with that for the rest of your life how does that sound\nI mean I just think I'm I'm a I'm a little bit younger than you and I just think growing up you know\nAll my friends and you know the ... the dads all had back then everyone had back pain and without them make it was so common my dad has back pain now you know it's just something that everyone eventually hits and whether it's a tiny bit or a lot of pain or something it's got to be managed\nBut it's getting out there and uh you know we're so excited to see these people in the offices because the results are truly astonishing\nOr this is a shirt

but if you're just joining us we've been really hitting on back pain epidemic the ... and more specifically on disk issues like her nations and Bulger's degenerative disc disease and all that type of stuff\nWe went through some of the headlines in the news as well as some of the research just pouring out\nNow look there's ... there's an old definition of insanity right it says if you keep doing what you've always done you're going to get what you've always got and that makes a lot of sense if you keep taking drugs to fix you herniated disc\nYou're going to keep having a herniated disc as it doesn't fix anything it just covers the sense of cake if you put injections into spying for her nation it's going to cover the symptoms\nNow surgery might get out the cause of it if it's a her nation pinching the nerve but\nDo you really want to go into surgery and have you back cut open when this\nConservative options out there like non surgical decompression [noise] you know when surgery occurs on the spine for disc it's called surgical decompression well why would anybody tried non surgical decompression first right I mean do you have nothing to lose a if it doesn't work is always surgery waiting for you so\nThis is the reason we do the show you know it's my mission to help more people live a better life I also want to make sure you follow along with us here on a on our Facebook page this week to post a lot of this there and that's um orange wellness Florida\nYou could click like in share over there and also our website orange woman's dot com so look I'm the last segment I promise to talk about some solutions to the back pain epidemic and the first thing is in chiropractic reduced bottom lip elation so we have some nice techniques that we can do considerably before we even go on to decompression\nAnd chiropractic adjustments are very effective and one of the techniques we use is called flushing distraction which is basically attraction like\nTable that move the spine into traction or pulling as we adjust\nAnd and stretch it uh but sometimes that's not enough and we have to go to the next thing which is called\nNon surgical decompression what we've been talking about and with that is being amazing because what it does is it decreases the center of pressure and the disc and the nucleus and allows its undergo negative pressure there by sucking the disc patrol back in it it's kind of like a jelly doughnut like I said and if you can get a negative pressure in the center of the jelly part of the disk\nAnd negative pressure in physics\nIs a vacuum in a vacuum suction so you're getting the suction effect and the little jelly stuff that's coming out of this is coming off of the nerve and voila you feel so much better when there's no pressure on the nurse\nSo that's kind of what we've been doing this technology is been blowing up in Orlando enough for offices we have um several tables within our for officers and it's kept people out of drugs and surgery and it's been amazing and kept them off of epidural injections as well\nSo look I've been telling my patients about all this and they've been hearing about it and a couple of my great patients who've undergone not only chiropractic an office but also\nSpoke non non surgical decompression they said hey doc let me come on and tell my story I I Want to tell my story so I said you know what let's do that and so the first patient a is her name is Becky and she's from Orlando\nAnd she's been a patient for many many years for different things in the office different conditions and a half or here on the line and Becky are you there can you hear me\nYes Hi Dr Jeff\nBecky if you don't mind telling you a little story about a you know who you are and what's what's your problem then you condition how we talk to you [noise]\nWell um I've been doing um I think\nTaking care of myself to a holistic methods and um and actually obviously to have you with animals I'm a chiropractor treatment in order to deal with my back pain and laid back issues but I'm sure for many years I\nHad just on going back pain and never knew that I had a herniated disc satellite low back and down and in my neck and it wasn't until that you know thankfully you ordered an MRI and I", "year": "2018", "show_name": "The Herman Cain Show", "city": "Orlando", "day": "14"}
