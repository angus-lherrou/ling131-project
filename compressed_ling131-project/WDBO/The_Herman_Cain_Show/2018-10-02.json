you don't have to stay with a couple of the accusers and a couple of the friends Kevin Lucien WALDS in Norfolk, Virginia where I Will be on the twentieth ... hey Kevin\nYeah the norm is a great location hey Brian uh I'd love to see the FBI subpoena the phone records of these accusers wouldn't it be interesting to see who they talked to before\nThey came forward a Ford went through a chronology and the hearing of how she ended up coming forward what if none of that is true I'm pretty sure the phone\nRecords are going to show who they talked to and then uh you know regarding the FBI what they're doing I've actually been a participant and two possibly three national security FBI interview\n... regarding my neighbors um uh there in the military and it it's kind of scary when the FBI you don't know they're coming they knock\nOn your door I Am the FBI like to ask you some questions and the first time I'm like oh wow and they come in\nYour living room but it's it's pretty

for breaking news\nFour hours a day\nSet a clock in news Ninety six point five W DVR top stories around one they've been attacking each other from a distance for weeks we'll today it will share a stage Bill Nelson and Rick Scott meaning for their first debate in a campaign for for US Senate seat an hour long debate will be tape that tending moon do in South Florida\nThen to air tonight across much of the state now as of now only one other debate is scheduled for October sixteenth\nSenator Nelson has held this seat since two thousand one and the getting listener reactions to this all morning\nWell he said this week or so Mitch McConnell the Senate majority leader as well right now and I've been listening to his remarks to see if he gives us any clue as to how this was going to play out now I was told yesterday we could get this FBI record\nAs early as today now that was a ... in a one very senior center Republican source\nAnd then what's unclear is if they get the record today whether or not Susan Collins of Maine and Lisa Murkowski of Alaska that allows them to say OK let's forge ahead with this vote whether they are yes or no you know they had asked for this delay and that's what they got if you listen to the language from Jeff Flake and the committee hearing friday he said\nBut you know a week which would be friday to friday but here's what to watch and I hate to go into the parliamentary we'd\nSee I Want you to very imports okay so what McConnell has to do next and this is this will set things into motion over a four day period what he would do is filed culture culture is what you do when you want to end debate on the nomination so they're technically on the nomination right now\nBeen led to believe that that would not happen any earlier than wins now does it does he do that before the FBI report is complete choice such things that motion\nPossible so long as Collins and Murkowski okay with it you might say well who cares about college in ... I guess what if they don't have Collins\nOr Murkowski at least one of them he can't get to at least fifty votes and then have Mike Pence break the tie he has a chance of getting as high as Fifteen three votes on Capitol if he you know if they stick to the terms of disagreement maybe courting a couple of Democrats so this is an important gambit by Mitch McConnell and he doesn't want to jump\nThe jumped the gun so here's the four day process number one you file culture\nWhich is where you move to end debate by that stay one by rule\nThat has to lay over for one day so that date to on day three whatever day that might be that close to petition the term of art and the Senate is it right but and it's available for a vote\nThat's the vote to cut off to filibuster and under the new procedures in the Senate it only takes fifty one goes to end the filibuster on the Supreme Court nominee that's what happened last year with the horse and then if you have successfully voted to cut off debate invoked cloture on the Capitol nomination on day three than the opponents get thirty more hours to run out the strict\nWhenever they want to do on the floor they want to come and debate they want to jump up and down or whatever they want to do they get thirty hours which triggers a confirmation vote sometime late that day on day for so that's where I'm saying if this starts on Wednesday\nThe procedural vote with the friday and then the confirmation vote would be Saturday under what McConnell said yesterday that is this week\n[noise] okay chat a couple of things to move all the extras nose and your ... where you've noticed\nIs Mitch McConnell have the type of relationship with Murkowski in college where you can just go up to and say how close are you able to yes what do you need hey Jeff I saw you in Boston yesterday well what did you mean I'm trying to read between the lines of what happened to I don't get surprised again so I mean do do they talk like that isn't really down to that\nYeah they do talk like that and and it comes down to the math and I've said this many times before the math is the math is a map\nYou know Hitler was a lot of criticism by conservatives have Jeff Flake over the weekend they said oh you know he delayed the capital nomination let me flip the coin for just a minute that Jeff like not gotten to it yes in committee\nThey would never had a chance of getting to fifty one fifty votes little ... on boats and as I spelled out maybe as high as fifty three uh Murkowski and Collins said let's run the traps on this FBI reports would not even be able to court a couple of Democrats and that will get us across the finish line potentially\nHedge Jeff Flake not done that they wouldn't have a chance to confirm Brett Kavanaugh because the Math Doesn't work the math is paramount in the sect\nGot ya so I Want you here flake yesterday and you know that he tends to go with who is with so he's hanging out with the Democrats lately and obviously doesn't have security in the halls and changed his vote it seems to take him at his word in Fifteen minutes so here's what he said yesterday in Boston cuts six\nDoes no good to have an investigation that just gives us more cover for example we actually need to find out where we can find out how we have to realize that we may not be able to find out everything\nAnd we've got to do some investigations\nAre we on route to a Folsom investigation especially with the president told the FBI to do yesterday expanded go where it has to go just wrap it up\nSoil that's going to be very unclear here not just in the past couple of all but says this is coming up here that Lisa Murkowski has said that the FBI is doing the investigation and I'm going to wait and see what comes back I don't know what will come back now let me just throw you know a monkey wrench into the gear boxers here for about a\nQuarter or something that comes back in this report and it raises more questions\nAnd you get a McConnell has been critical critical of the Democrats saying well you know I bet that they will come back and do the goalpost it's very possible that he could have Republicans\nAre certainly Murkowski and Collins and say wait a minute this raised another question and we're not to not say yes yes Senator McConnell that is possible will that happen I don't know but again that's why the math is ... ... if you don't have and hear the four senators were really employ Collins Murkowski\nOn the Democratic side of the aisle Joe Manchin of West Virginia Heidi Heitkamp of North Dakota\nYou need to get at least one of those for to get to fifty so what I just told you about a potential scenario with college or Murkowski saying you know I don't know what this has to be high report means or this or you know satisfy my concerns here that could throw a monkey wrench into the system\n[noise] but yeah possibly if it comes back but do you believe that we're debating on high school and college the end of all your years can you believe are debating this\nIt's ... that's the remarkable thing here uh you know I mean ... but they keep in mind what the focus was in that hearing on Wednesday\nIt was on beer it was on sophomore references and the high school yearbook\nEven Kavanaugh said you know we're embarrassed by that your book it's like something on a fast times are rich Mont high his words a ... you know and even you know the ... the United states yesterday started talking about it you know he said he was a bit surprised at how much Kavanaugh talked about is like a beer\nOr you know I I'm going to give you some history here in Nineteen eighty nine\nGeorge H W. Bush nominated former Republican Senator John tower to be defense secretary this was early on and Bush is a ... you know first year Nineteen eighty nine and the Senate defeated that nomination which is remarkable to defeat the nominees from their own party\nThere were allegations woman I think there were allegations that he wasn't conservative enough but the other issue was alcohol and so we've been there before now that was of course alcohol abuse alleged alcohol abuse on behalf senator tower when he was ... he was a well known Washington quantity I don't think I've seen it go all the way back to\nThe high school and and what people were doing that with alcohol and their high school and college\nNot only that she had programs we talked to the arts or a A R guru of Capitol Hill Chad or you're official toe senior producer\nBut not only that we're not even talking about Brett Kavanaugh in the nineties were in the next century two thousand which I've ever come in Nineteen eighty so ... always doing that day maybe who knows I\nYeah and here's the ears of art will say I went back and looked at you know before we were hearing these allegations you were figuring out when Christine Blasey Ford when Brett Kavanaugh would have been in high school and then I kind of look back at when Anita Hill worked at the ... seat with Clarence Thomas\nAnd so those allegations against a Thomas made by hill happen in the mid eighties and of course that hearing was in Nineteen Ninety One and so they were looking back somewhere in the neighborhood of seven to eight years so in other words and people said oh it's hard to remember and everything else in Nineteen Ninety One so the issues we're dealing with now happened several years even before\nThe hill Thomas stuff that's what makes this so remarkable I mean it's hard to believe that that in Nineteen Ninety One people are saying oh it's hard to put this together because it was so long ago the allegations were addressing now in twenty Eighteen happen even before the hill Thomas stuck\nTo the way I understand I talked to a couple of ... just today one on television went off\nAnd are they going to get back paper so if you go and talk to W. were near as these the Yale freshmen who said that she drank so much as we remember a lot of it but now you go talk to you when you and the FBI and you're taking her testimony ask some questions\nDo just going to hand over that to the Judiciary Committee and then I'm going to go talk to a maybe a Debbie forwards best friend okay fine a doctor for his best friend I go do that okay here's what she told me and I'm going to hear that over so they do all the interviews and follow some leads from those interviews but they don't make conclusions\nThey might even they might not even have a summary at the bottom of the page so then you're going to see Blumenthal said this is the worst thing ever read and you're going to see a Cassidy say I have no problem with this at all\nSo we're going to be back where we started\nVery possible but that's why if McConnell thinks he has the confidence of Murkowski ... Collins or both\nThey'll pull the trigger on this because then you get you get to the fifty maybe fifty one vote it doesn't matter what what Blumenthal says uh and then it becomes a political question is this an issue\nWhere Republicans overplay their hand and it hurts them personally in the terms or is it an issue that Democrats overplay their hand and it hurts them it virtually ended it or or or did it it ... off the base on the Democratic side or did it Jennifer based on the Republican side that's what's what's unclear\nA that is the risk of doing this so close to the term elections one way or the other and again you know it is a political question uh you know it it says nothing\nIn the constitution about what the process is to get there on a Supreme Court justice you just provide advice and consent you don't have to have a hearing I reported how they didn't even really have a modern confirmation hearing in the way we think of it until Nineteen fifty five you didn't have have the

story oh he may have thrown on the body of Ninety Ninety five\nYeah it's unbelievable they say that you know the headline is sensational up but the story isn't ah basically is in a bar and uh someone said he's through ice somebody got caught in a in a fight broke out afterwards he has to answer it a few questions and there was no problem I think Chris Dudley wanted to do a long time uh NBA player former player who's a good friend of his\nWho went to bat for him as a character reference\nThere was nothing that happened I mean let's be honest with nothing happened in the nineties that negative nothing happened after Nineteen eighty five that negative nothing happened from two thousand two thousand Eighteen but taking it so now we're debating what's in our high school yearbook\nPut somebody in tenth grade said about a twelfth grade Brett Kavanaugh and he says it never happened his best friend said that never happened and then we have\nThe farcical carnival that took place at NBC last night with Kate Snow and the third accuser where she claims that he walked around with the solo cup and handed it to people\nThat might have been water it might've been sprayed it might have been

didn't like the soccer to feel like kill me\nI mean I Know I Know there's a I understand especially in Missouri that is a hotbed of soccer and I'm not kidding you I mean they're just St Louis is ... out and they're they're pro teams even did indoor soccer in the eighties so they play\nAnd this kid got cuts on the varsity team and he's a junior\nSo he said I Want to play in the JV and they say that our school policy on the boy side is it takes a place from a tenth grader can't play they always think of the girls are allowed if you get ... to play on ... on on JV and the guy says I I don't care I I that's not our policy\nSo she says their son will be irreparably harmed if he can't play soccer for three months in the fall on a soccer team so she's suing because of gender a a gender

H. I. O. in Dayton, Ohio Jerry\nBrand new thing that really bothers me is the way are Republicans are almost too soft stepping likely every one of a match to make a claim of while she was very credible talking about Dr Ford specifically I\nI I find that troubling because I don't know what part of it was credible because she can't remember the details you know she has to\nBe reminded of things she does not upset with Feinstein and the Democrats for outing her as a\nActual so you're right there's a lot of weird stuff Jerry hold on we'll get you\nYou'll belch textbook by you know kind of suicide in the brain ... dot com and order the pod cast the first hour always free [noise]\n\n\nOur foundations our future people are afraid to talk about that as an interim\nNo\nReally hoarding like him I don't know any politicians pocket out here so I say I have to haul Harry for a while\nWe were going to hold back the effort to Fox News channel [noise]\nNation coming into the real big can be the personal\n...

candidates in Florida US Senate race are going to meet face to face for the first time today and then you'll see it on TV later tonight\nPeople have never been in a bar fight and I have never been to college I just I Know I I I have no idea how I got through college but I did go to college but I'm but I I just want you to know I've never been in a bar fight okay I just\nWell if you're if you're going to ... and I'm a guy that six foot ten ... gun ho as your friend because Doug Lee evidently did get by with a guy\nSo just to be clear I've been I I'm afraid I'm embarrassed to say how many bar fights I've actually been in [noise] but my my ... my ... my whole thing and in high school and college was to be friends with enormous people always have big friends and if you have to make friends you can talk all the trash you want to call\nThis a type of things you don't get in the hearings but we might get next if it was brought back\nWe're going to do it but just think about the next the next nominate the next nominee that we get we're going to get where he's going to have to come in with all of this\nDirty laundry and just sort of dump it right out there on the right on the table and we're going to and they're going to be sending their picking through it with a with a you know I mean it's\nJust well William Rehnquist a spelling test we're not out of there we confirmed him without knowing what he\nDid in college and and uh who was it that said you know George Washington was nominated he the president yeah and then and then immediately all these people all these Democrats went crazy and started picking apart George Washington's life and actually proved to point\nHere is uh with Donald Trump brought up yesterday on Capitol and he wanted to talk about the historic trade deal em Ali he's not wrong he's not it's not hyperbole this is a huge trade deal the president brought home is going to attack wages is going to affect relations is going to affect other trade deals down the line\nAnd it looks as though the Canadians caved in presidents to go shooting brought him to that point\nYeah and and it just to go to the press conference said it was so delightful every politician no matter what would have just completely cave when reporters started demanding to talk about Kevin up\nNot President Trump he doesn't care you know it's ... it he just doesn't care he's willing\nTo uh pick those fights and say no I'm not answering your questions we're going to get through what I Want to talk about and then we'll talk about what you want to talk about and\nIn the rose garden he said this about cabinet I finally started to answer some questions and I think it's been remarkably measured unbelievably measure through this entire process cut three\nBut I can tell you I watch that hearing and I watched a man saying that he did have difficulty as a young man who drank the one question I didn't ask is how about the last Twenty years have you had difficulty last Twenty years 'cause nobody said anything bad about him and many many years\nHow about thirty five years they're not no not Twenty years thirty five years\nYeah so so Republicans led by Trump and and Chuck Grassley really have I think handled this thing very nicely was one of the I think one of the ... basically Democrats put out or they bought a bunch of lottery tickets\nAnd one of them was that a doctor Ford would go out there and Republicans would overstepped and they would make her look like a victim all over again and it yeah exactly they they they were going to trash or\nTrump who's going to send out a tweet about uh the way she looks or some crazy thing and it was going to like it was his wife yeah\nYeah and some some terrible thing was going to happen and it was going to crystallize the moment and it would go from being what it is now to being some eighty twenty issue that you know Republicans are terrible Republicans have done such a good job of taking her seriously and giving her all the space and all the time she needs\nTo say what she she wanted to say obviously\nA you know we were talking about the break you know I found that the testimony to be compelling uh I found a cameras testimony to be compiling a and when you have you have that sort of situation all you can do is go to the other evidence but all the other evidence destroys your story but\nMichel who the prosecutor was hired by the Republican I'll give you that but she was ... she was not ever adjusting her delivery to the five minutes and India and she said is that he said she said because they she said didn't deliver in that we don't know where we don't know how she got home and know how she got there we don't know who invited her we don't know where it took place\nThere was weaker than he said she said but the thing about the Democrats are accusing\nOr this or this woman or being some sort of partisan because she's a Republican prosecutor I'm Sorry every prosecutor in this country ... you know there's not a federal probably every local prosecutor in this country is an elected prosecutor there there are the vast majority are either Democrats or Republicans\nAnd they are slaves to justice they do everything they can they are not joined us part is in ... the vast majority of them aren't they they stand up for victims every single day and the idea that one of the talking points from these Democrats right now\nIs it oh she's a Republican ... screw you may never see her that she looks like a part of an act was her question was as as a profoundly\nLike respectful and a pointed and and we wish you the only person in the whole place that that came off as ... as truly truly just wanting\nTo get to the facts of the story of the most trustworthy\nPerson in a in a way in which I thought we weren't getting there she never even after the break capital question how do you know ... him\nAnd and and and the fact ah the ... the fact that the Democrats on the committee were so upset that a Republican field at her to ask the questions are just proves a whole nother gamble\nThey were going forward just they wanted to stay political they didn't want to write a effect based question\nI I Want you to go down and Dershowitz said about her who you being deferential to\nShe was totally and completely incompetent in terms of asking cross examination question because she has little experience for example the main issue now is whether or not she recognized Kavanaugh correctly she was never asked\nWhether how well she knew him how many times she encountered him before this how close was their relationship there was nothing that could raise questions about whether even if she believes she's telling the truth\nShe may have missed identify so she just did a terrible job and I think the Republicans realize that and they can or right in the middle but it was a very bad choices while\nHere is a Trump going after the people that he could not believe we're treating Brett Kavanaugh unfairly especially with the skeletons in their background cut to\nLook at some of these people asking the question is okay [noise] look at Blumenthal he lied about Vietnam he didn't just say hey I went to Vietnam no no for Fifteen Years he said he was a war hero he fought in Da Nang province we call him\nDon King Richard downing stick them done a she never was the Vietnam\nWar we take a look at Cory Booker\nHere in Newark New Jersey answer the ground [noise] he was a horrible and they're looking Dianne Feinstein you're telling me about time\nFeinstein knew about this two months earlier\nIt was confidential until the hearing was over after the hearing was over\nThey went public you know why because they're dishonest people [noise]\nTo a went ahead and took it to the big stage now this is going to blow up Blumenthal in particular there's going to bring big time he's acting sanctimonious and said if you one lie but they get to another ally really general Blumenthal are you kidding I couldn't\nBelieve that we're going back to the judge which was talking about uh you know what he's talking about as an adversarial a questioning and yet she was clearly not are you doing an adversarial questioning she was she was based asking very basic questions\nOr to let it and I think people viewers watch it because this is a political setting it's not a courtroom um but what if anything that only a that that that further undermines the idea that she some Republican partisan hack\nThat's the thing that ... galls me is that the the ... that are Democrats on the committee they do not care that they are the most fundamentally unfair people they don't care they they will destroy anybody's\nA reputation in pursuit of their political goals including a good prosecutor in that case or\nYou know Brett Kavanaugh at ... or ... in in the main\nYeah well a chili her tier of actually it's a commentator a week or where to take a short time I come back with some phone calls and what's your thoughts on this and we look at look the president did something else is pretty courageous also defined as critics and frustrated them to\nHe said yeah expanding investigation if you want to just get it done quickly golden I told the FBI go where you have to but get it done so instead of saying the early reports that the New York times\nWashington Post at NBC that he was only looking at the first accuser the his mark judge and the friend of the first accuser he and as well as Debbie Ramirez who is the second accuser leading up the third one instead of doing that he said no expand it so go ahead take a shot much inside out though\nYeah he uh the ... that's the that's the appearance of a guy who feels very confident in his nominee that they're not going to find anything that this is just a you know that it's a smokescreen and attempted to delay things which it is a and he's confident that they're you know that you have to give it a a full airing a game\nOn friday or Saturday and I'll bring you back when we come back why some people think even if he set this country's institutions are ah are slowly but surely being de legitimize we'll talk about that possibility
