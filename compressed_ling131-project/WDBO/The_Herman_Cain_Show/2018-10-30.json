need in Congress to help create jobs improve our schools and protect our civil rights vote for Democrats Elaine Luria for Congress\nI'm Elaine ... and I approved this message\nOf self and he has to fight back because he can't believe that people are actually saying this stuff about him for me I Would shut it down with other people do you're fighting but she went out and apologize right after and said you know maybe I overstepped and I got a little emotional you think so Bob Woodward trying to sell some more books although he's selling a ton cut twenty two\nWhen he blames the media when he goes up there in in the Israelis I mean they are all designed to\nRaise the boiling point raised the temperature we have to look at what he does and what he's doing here or if it's in plain sight and let's not kid ourselves and that he's stoking the fires and\nThat serves his political purposes or in his view he wants to have a this volatility and politics and\nHe succeeded he wants to change things his way and when he can't get it through Congress he's put it out there making people debate it by the way here's the apology from Julie I hopped for saying the president radicalized more people than ISIS\nI think this has been an emotional and personally painful time for me I think I exaggerate it and I apologize for that\nI clarified in apologized on the air she went on to say but I said here again this has been a very emotional and painful time for me by I was absolutely should not have gone with such hyperbole on the air I Apologize\nFine apologize but that's the reaction is over the top on this president in example the president says I watch meet the press on Sunday I couldn't believe it\nHere's an example of this the first one is going to be Chuck Todd the one the other one is going to be a Matthew Dowd a former Republican under Bush and George Stephanopoulos ...\nWe have a problem and we have a president who doesn't seem to believe he has a role to play and dealing with it I Would put specific responsibility on the president I think what he's done 'em over the course of the last few years as helps foment this epicenter\nAnd unapologetically incendiary president on travelling by traditional norms of civility\nYeah uh that's why he sat down and did an interview on Fox yesterday and said I Can't believe these headlines I Can't believe I'm being covered that's why I came out and said what I was thinking that was the president's thinking is\nI actually blame the media for vilify me and getting some of my supporters exercised about it but don't want anyone to do this government at the cynic I hated Trump\nHated the fact that he's talked with Israel hated that he move the embassy hated the fact that he has a door to the converted and his son in law playing a major role that they converted his daughter and they have three Jewish grandkids\nBut the people's view of the president it's always about the president now the president's been accused of making everything about him but you know what the media makes everything about him an example cut twenty six Chuck Todd\nWe have a problem and we have a president who doesn't seem to believe he has a role to play and dealing with it and I think that is what is making this\nMore of a uncomfortable situation in our politics I don't think it gets better I think it gets worse because at the end of the day the president said the town\nThis and I hate to say it uh but you had a horrible shooting in Parkland does anyone boy and the president for that but we talked about guns and the synagogue shooting is senseless eleven daddy was carnage people say that they witness it was worse than they've ever seen cops come in they're heroes\nNot really debating guns they're debating the competency the president cynically think there's a reason for that because the elections coming up and they do with the gun issue is not going to be a great one for Democrats but the president's competence always is print you see I see problems on both sides cut twenty seven\nFor Trump's failings isn't he thinks everything is about him\nAnd one of his critics failings is ... is it that they do too and this weekend's reaction to the hideous atrocities from last week\nA particularly the one in Pittsburgh illustrate that perfectly people were were finding a way to blame him\nAnd look I I look I think he could elevate the tone of our discourse more living as and so on but the idea that he was somehow responsible for creating a kind of atmosphere in which this sort of Arabs encouraged I think it was not says that I think it's it's basically an unfair to him\nAnd look I I have I have here maybe ten more cuts from Tom dire Joe law card\nJust ripping the president to watch the mail bomb or this guy is nuts he's been arrested since two thousand his own family says he's gradually losing his mind he's living in his van because he goes to Trump rallies avenues for you they're free\nHe takes steroids go who get has bad jobs this strip clubs as a bouncer hops on a raft goes into the ocean start singing rubber ... that's the president's problem it's his fault\nHe's giving him a ghost sign are you nuts that's what drives me crazy but I agree with brick describes it move on\nDon't watch meet the press on Sunday Gulf War come up with a battle plan or make an appearance well watch football\nDon't watch meet the press they're not going to give you a fair shot think Chris Wallace will\nAnd I think John Dickerson I think face the nation does a regular basis but Chuck Todd is just cannot be rational because you just despise\nGet made in my mind I don't really know Chuck Todd never talked to Chuck Todd but I Do watch every Sunday and his monologues and his question don't all have a point of view\nThe president called him sleepy eyes and that didn't help it's called about a few times and that doesn't help out into the White House I didn't interview thought that was fair everything else

president on judges she's voted against him on a border wall she's voted against them on tax cuts every time on every priority that matters\nSenator McCaskill with the liberal Democrats and against this president which is really just to say against what the people in Missouri voted for that's going to cost her\nThat is because they're McCaskill's out pretending she likes Donald Trump and taking on some of the radicals in her party really I Would love to have met this person I Am amazed me that this person is actually pretending to be this person a cinema Castro sat down with bread\nAnd she sounds a little like Trump but the problem is she's not cut thirty seven\nDemocrats are people who walk in restaurants and screen an elected official faces the crazy Democrats or we have a state senator here in Missouri actually advocated for the assassination of President Trump a crazy Democrat and I don't do those things\nI Am not somebody who thinks that we should ever be unsettled I think what most Missourians one is for us to listen to each other\nOr we can compromise not screaming each other's faces not call each other names so I'm really talking about um civility here I'm Talking about being polite having good manners\nA day you go a Senator McCaskill talking about civility and having good matters if she had come out right away when this began to happen I'd say wow you know she's probably playing this right but I just don't buy it I Love the fact that she sat down with Brett\nI don't love the fact that there's really no moderates on either side anymore I Know Republican tape moderates are rhinos do Democrats hate moderates are they're really told what to do by their leadership\nBut I'm not buying this or you cook thirty eight\nI think the president has seen every ...

way that is one of the issues here we've got a search and use technology to address when it comes across the border and they ask us for asylum law says we need to hear on the way way way too long to hear it we need to hear him right away\nSo I Do not on our borders to override [noise] and I support the president's efforts checked shirt or not\nIt would've been great if he had done that when it mattered but she is at least trying to play the game senator Manchin did he actually voted for cabinet\nAnd the president still going to be going to West Virginia to\nUh to ... to ... to protest I always say to run a rally against him and by the way it's neck and neck and now democratic money is has to flow into West Virginia to help save them democratic money has to go into the data to help out a Dean Heller so nothing is nothing is settled\nBut for the most part I don't hear any Democrats say look out we're going to get the Senate\nThe other thing that I think it's competitive now a little bit more than we thought it looked like Senator Cruz was pulling away after the massive rally and showing a little bit of momentum ... who has LeBron James in his corner would run that many people take his shoes when it comes to when it comes to politics\nBecause remember Hillary Clinton he couldn't even sell out in Cleveland when he was playing for the Cavaliers\nWhen Hillary Clinton

match with Texas but I'm not convinced that John James policies don't match with Michigan and I certainly think he's got all the charisma\nOr the million dollar smile and the presence in the military background and discipline to be a solid cat it and we really have a shot at a massive upset I Know Don junior was there last friday but I Do wonder why the president doesn't talk about a more you

down for me and enjoy some fresh air top story is a big talker in the morning lots of analysis and debate on this one [noise]\nWe're the only country in the world where a person comes in has a baby the baby is essentially a citizen of the United states for eighty five years with all of those benefits to kill us tenant has to end them have you talked about that with counsel young wearing the said it's in the process it will happen when an executive order that's what you're talking about\nYeah wow a activist with the big story and the big revelation President Trump plans to give an executive order that would remove the birthright citizenship for babies of non citizens born on us soil plus there is now a plan for the caravan which I just mentioned\nBefore we go any further and bringing my first guess let me just tell you here are the places here the nations that have repealed birthright\nCitizenship Ireland in two thousand five India in Nineteen eighty seven Australian to thousands to have a New Zealand to two thousand five France in Nineteen Ninety three so this is not some crazy a theory by countries that or don't understand our culture a step guy joins us now\nHGF Hi how are you self were you surprised to get that story\nI think certainly surprised to see the president answer our questions so directly my colleague Johnson's run has a chasing that he had gotten his starts at the White House and decide to go ahead and act because while he was interviewing him yesterday so I think we wear it\nAnd uh just how can the president was an answering the question saying yes he is looking at issuing an executive order that he's already spoken with his count so\nUm so I think that tries to maybe a little bit but we also know that President had uh this isn't the first time the president has talked about this idea and he has made it clear that he has a very strong a hard line immigration policy that he would like to enforce\nHere so we hear is a you know the president was speaking to you guys are just human error and HBO what is what kind of do they actually make with HBO jak\nCEOs is I'm coming out with a show on HBO HBO is I'm heading out for us it goes live on Sundays every once said tune in Sunday evening and watch the more clip from our interview with President Trump as well as some other segments\nOkay here is the president and general just one\nRation some legal scholars believe you can get rid of the practice in doubt tension becomes chicken wing executive order exactly right have you thought about killing all it was always told me that you needed a constitutional a member in but you don't get on\nThe other one number one you don't need that number to nothing to do as well and you can definitely do it with an act of Congress but now they're saying I can do just with an executive order so\nThat was a bit of a surprise although you have ... the president said that if the game on I'm not sure that whose political people thought there'll be a good thing to say before the election\nWell I mean immigration is always an important issue especially for the president and for Trump supporters integration\nAnd a key issue but of course we're going to see a lot of pushback against the story from others as well there's a lot of debate with this is even\nA legal possibility for the president the vast majority of constitutional and legal experts on both at the Iowa Republican Democrat conservative most would say that it's not within the president's power to issue an executive order and change the way the fourteenth amendment is being applied but there are a few conservatives who have\nArgued 'em over over the years that there is a possibility because of the specific language with and the fourteenth amendment and that sort of a person was referring to when he was discussing this with my colleague Johnson swan\nThe saying that oh well some people say I can't do that um but this was certainly face legal challenges if and when the president does go through with us executive order\nI talk to you I I just asked Jonathan Turley this constitutional attorney and here's what he said\nThere is a third interpretation which is that by saying that it's if you're subject to the jurisdiction the framers may have just wanted to leave this to Congress the Congress can change the jurisdiction can change the definition of citizenship under that interpretation of President Trump still could not use an executive order so of the three interpretations\nOnly one of them would allow him to use the executive order and that's the one that says no they always intended this to be just for citizens and legal residents\nSo he went on\nTo guys are the I'm not too sure how strong of a case because the amendment itself is hopelessly ambiguous says to six words\nThat the amendment states quite clearly that all persons born or naturalized the United states are Citizens United states but right in the middle of that line are six words that say and subject to the jurisdiction thereof and it's sort of a weird cause and ever since it was ratified\nThere's been a debate over what it means so for for many people the amendments suggests that we have unlimited birthright citizenship and the country\nWhile many including some of the draft or is indicated that they believe\nThat they that the amendment says that you have a birthright citizenship if you're subject to the jurisdiction you're either a citizen or a legal resident but not if you are undocumented or a diplomat or a tourist\nSo get a little complicated but there is a case it's not just somebody who has to necessarily get another amendment to the constitution to tell you interpret within the constitution exactly\nAnd that's why this is such an important issue and if it hadn't goes through with it I think we are going to see that likely make it to the Supreme Court Supreme Court has\nRuled on similar cases indicating that uh there is birthright citizenship for uh\nThe the children of immigrants who are here legally who are permanent residents but do you think at this point at them and that does not apply across the board will say yes sure that's correct that's interpret interpreted correctly\nBut there hasn't been willing specifically on the children of undocumented immigrants are those who are here on short term on temporary visas so there is still a question there is something that we're likely to see the courts decide on and of course Congress can always act and you can always come to Congress to um\nTo to define what exactly that that means but I think we're going to see the president does go through with a defective order the court have to have to make a decision on on what that what that means and how that needs to be applied\nRight with other uh so we have a a midterm election one week you must have noticed and now we have two major stories that bomb or the mail bombs which thankfully didn't explode and we have the uh the synagogue assassinations and deal with their president get a lot of scrutiny about how we handled it he's upset about how he's the scrutiny she's getting and says it's unfair\nDo you think this will have a major does your reporting show this could have a major effect on what happens to say\nYou know I think immigration is an important issue for certain people in certain states certain districts especially along the border\nPlaces that have voted overwhelmingly for chopping twenty sixteen voters tend to have immigration high\nOn their voter issue less than this is the president again uh flexing it immigration arm he ran on a campaign that said he was going to be tough on immigration that he was going to be tough on the border and so I think this has provided a platform for him to discuss these issues\nBut again it's going to be highly unpopular for many many left leaning on voters any Democrats are people who might have been swing voters so I I think it's a risky it's a risky but it needs to come out right now but when it comes to Trump's base I think it could play while there\nI think you're right uh well see that any would go for the middle anymore it just I just wanted to people that likely to make sure to vote on both sides known to even going for the gray area um you know what is a good photo senior show on HBO steps a kite I appreciate it and of course actually
