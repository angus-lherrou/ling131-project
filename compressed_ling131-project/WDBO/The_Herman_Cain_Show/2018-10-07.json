talk future\nDot com could grab your recall with lots of resources up on the website or we also post or events there we do Social Security and Medicare planning events we do a speaker series where we have\nSome CPAs and attorneys and and different people that are important to your financial plan come out and talk so I'll be sure to check the less talk future dot com website frequently\nFor those updates off the top of the hour we we read an email from a listener again I'm John it let's talk future dot com and Michael at let's talk future dot com you can send us an email\nBut they supposed to be talking about what to do with their inheritance and we talked through everything we're not going to recap everything but the other point that they made\n'em we we we had some mechanical issues with how they're going to save it we address those but I talked about growing the money to three point two million yeah they're a project or whether I think is pretty good I think they're factor in in like a ten percent eight percent return there so they are planning on investing that money very aggressively over twenty five thirty year period\nLove the idea I think that's possible they need to change some of the mechanics of it\nBut the good part of that um email is I think you have a long term perspective emotionally that's gonna benefit you I'm In your uh you know financial plan picturing that in game I'm going to have like ... points\nMillion dollars and um that's where my goal is that is what it said at that mentality is what's going to carry you through and help you build wealth a long term stick to it mentality I'm going to have three point two million dollars twenty five thirty years from now\nThat attitude is what is really going to propel you into the future and keep you from making mistakes\nAnd I think the aggressive nature in this case is fine because these people are in their third yeah so if it's truly Hammond inherit money and I'm going to set aside for retirement purposes then yeah that makes a lot of sense yeah now our advice would change if the person was saying maybe they were in their fifties or sixties\nThen it may be a different story hey\nI'm going to retire in three years and I'm going to need this money to start producing income right well then we're probably not going to want to take as much risk with that money now obviously depends on your situation and how much Social Security is going to kick in and in a lot of other factors but as a broad brush view of everything\nYeah I I think they're aggressive nature in this case as long as it's diversified ... because there is a fine line between being aggressive and I would say irresponsible stupid [laughter]\nThey need to be very careful on that because a lot of times I I feel like people say oh yeah I Want to be aggressive and then they put all the money in one stock right and it's like well the yes that is aggressive but you crossed over the line into aerosol\nSure sure you want to eliminate you can eliminate concentration rescued literally some unnecessary risks and still be aggressive but um\nYou know ... or the other thing when you get to retirement like the Michael is saying well be or vice would be a little different if you were fifty well we we still encourage you to have a bucket list right let's write out what our goals our retirement what our long term\nGoals would maybe we want to travel maybe we want to uh you know leave money for the kids maybe want to be charitable maybe we want to you know take a motor home around the country whatever it is having those long term goals carry through into retirement make all the difference I think that's really what we're talking about here is having the\nUh mentality or the uh you know goal plan for your future and you know that's not necessarily like you can't really put a number on it hey what am I return is gonna be what am I a you know monthly amount it's going to be but if you keep that long term focus is going to keep you from making mistakes\nYeah absolutely and again if we can be a resource to go to let's talk future dot com once you're on that website you'll notice a tools tap it's a whole bunch of tools and resources that John and I have created over the years there's three mistakes we typically see with a new lease\nAnd so if you're thinking about buying a new a tea or maybe somebody trying to sell unanimity or perhaps you have a CD right annuity coming due Yup I would highly encourage you before you do anything go to ... dot com and download that piece on the three mistakes we see people make with a new and\nYou see a lot of moving parts when it comes to a nude is you want to make sure you understand how they work\nYeah another tool is a four one K. resource guide so again maybe I'm an old four one K. that you know you probably should do something with we have a guide for\nDealing with that 'cause there's some mistakes you can make yeah from taxes to move in getting correctly you want to make sure you get that correctly you know we talked about this a little bit throughout the show with Katie\nThe caller five twenty nine there's a whole piece on how to save for college so again if those tools can be a resource for you\nAt that school so but that is the law now if your child's a victim of bowling\nOr you can get a voucher\nA and pull your child out and put your child in a private school\nAnd it's an interesting change their cars yeah you're right it is it is interesting\nHow that affects the bully right exactly there's no punishment in that event for the bully but it does we moved the child from the danger\nAs writers have come out of ... that they probably weren't comfortable and but again there probably should be\nBut I guess they can really put it in a law to punish a child\nIn a school ... well I'm sure they can I mean that's why they have detentions settled or had a right and there's nothing will do any more so in that I mean that's something that's controlled by the school itself that's not something that Florida lawmakers could intervene on or is it now they could and could not sure they could they could\nFind that you know somebody is I'm a found\nTo have bullied say more than one child then they're put into a special program or they're ... they're all kinds of things that they could do interest if that's how they wanted to address the problem figure that would have been so decided by the school looks at\nUm the school could decide to do something independent of the legislature if the legislature does that then it's going to be affective state right yeah right right\nWhat's the phone lines Uri for for two two zero zero nine six five if you ever questioned for ... attorney shared with aid for for two two zero zero nine six

[noise]\nIt depends on how that is the deed is structured rich but if you structure the deed so that it's yours right and the only thing that you give 'em person you want to give the house too is a remainder interest in the event that you die\nRight then you can do anything that you want to what the house\nUm [noise] because ...\nI'm Sorry to cut you off\nBecause the remainder interest doesn't kick in until you die\nAs a child though ... says it's that's what we'll talk about that yes uh-huh\nOkay if I have three children I was trying to get a little closer to want to leave the house to kill them this is the third one who am I had a relationship with a year's could possibly a on a question is ah is that a possibility or would I have a ...\nWell I your children adults rich ...\nOkay All right um well the the easiest on say the easiest way the most the ... the the most um [noise] the way it is going to\nGive rise to um the least issues down the road them in all likelihood let me say it that way is to establish a trust\nRight and then what you do is you put the project and you make your two children in the beneficiaries of the trust\nAnd and then when you pass or if you pass the um [noise] the house is still in the trust there is no probate there's nothing that you need to do\nAnd it passes to the trust and you make yourself the trustee of the trust but then you name a successor trustee\nSo if you were to pass somebody else would be the successor trust day\nAnd then whatever then it would be clear you know the percentages of the interest that your children have\n'em and who the beneficiaries are and what happens\nIn the event that one of those two children path right\nSo if you just have it to the two of them um then what happens if one of them passage does it go to the other one does it go to the one who's passes the state to their children it just leaves some open questions that need to be drafted around\nUm whereas if you put it all and that trust then you can leave them not only the house by putting the by putting the um the house and the name of the trust but other things as well so it's not just the house um\nMy oldest although of course all along like close to it I don't want to have all the trust us or is that said that it was only going to the trust on my ... I don't want to complications from my cell case I decided to sell and look someplace um\nYou know it goes into the trust and you still own the trust in um if you make the trust revoke a ball you can you can revoke it at any time but us the trustee of the trust can go ahead\nAnd um and sell things and do things with it um [noise]\nBut it but whatever you do like if you sell and you get money you put it into the trust and then with whatever\nWhatever money you make if you make another investment then that investment is and the name of the last\nOne was just a little tiny you know work could at general ... ... ... it's going to be able to put this together formal\nI'd suggest that somebody with a background in in real estate do it for you and and we can do it for you if you want which is something there are office does fairly right your\nUncle so I I Will say oh\nYou're welcome and if you did want to follow up rich with the office you and give them a call one eight hundred to wit law one eight hundred D.

I admit I'm a little cynically or what would be the uh uh you know to keep people from\nI I don't want to say guinea and the kid to the people lead or acting like used to get into a private school and and could become very costly to have all these kids getting transferred the private schools so that was basically what I was after\nWell yes I mean generally speaking when the legislature passes a law like this they have a um a definitional section right now so there would be some kind of parameters to bullying however you raise a good point\nIn that whenever there's a definition um it's always subject to interpretation right no matter how carefully drafted um we have you know lots of cases um that are decided around water particular word means in a statue\nUm so um you know in all likelihood that their definition may be challenged in the courts um\nDespite how uh the legislature addresses and um you're right you know I'm there may be a parent's that would watch a very desperately to get their child out of the particular school and and go to private school\nThere's always the possibility that laws that are passed can be ... manipulated\nOr when the legislature decides to implement these laws oftentimes they will weigh a those possibilities against what they're trying to achieve\nUm and make a determination that it's worth the risk or that there will be policies and procedures in place uh to just discouraged those kinds of manipulations\n[noise] um but you do have some good points and some points that uh we may see being fleshed out in the courts um as the law is applied which often which often happens so that's why we follow the laws when they're implemented and down the road um when they're interpreted by the courts\nI I I guess it's each individual school board or have some input as to what they how they deem this uh\nLaw two of you know be enacted or whatever\nWell the debt ridge definition the definition applies state\nWide right as as the schools and they have um administrative procedures um that they go through and making the determination whether or not um the the laws applicable\nOkay well thank you I just want to weigh in on that and to see what's your response was appreciate your show\nThank you for your call David appreciate the call David let's go to Barry in Orlando barrier on with attorney shared with what is your question\nFishery I've got a question regarding the uh the business has been put together and I want to put together by show was unarmed that'd be done was dark and look\nUp by Sal Anna non compete\nWell usually we usually yeah usually we do it into documents\nI'm there you know it's just a lot easier to do it that way\nI'm there maybe some references in each document to the other um but uh by cell agreement I'm you know can ... their their stock restrictions so you put the by cell agreement on the back of the stock we start at the back of the stock\nAnd let's say you and your partner you buy your partner out\nUm and then you sell his interest or he ... to another party\nUm the by cell agreement will still apply right you know apply even if you have new shareholders um but non compete agreement I'm may not right so that's why we we generally keep them separate\nOur garage or do you have a lot of work or will it will cost for the girls\nAre you talking about just two people\nYes with two people oh\nOkay and you want both by cell agreement and the north and the non compete you're probably looking at about Fifteen hundred\n... okay I've had to both of those we do All right thank you here welcome\nIf you want to give her a call at the office burying follow up you can give a ... a hundred ... law one eight hundred D.

three\nInjured things are when we have a car accident\nBona gets back is one of 'em back is one of them back pain\nNeck pain of course from the whiplash\nAnd headaches which people don't realize or many times related to the next issue\n[noise] looking case this is there for your first time listening to the show I Want to let everyone know what my show is all about I've narrowed it down over the the last few months to two words truth and options when it comes to health related things I'm going to give you the truth the whole truth and nothing but the truth so help me God\nI feel like I'm In a court of law right here speaking of attorneys and I'm going to give you options people aren't being given the option that they should\nWhen it comes to their health care\nWhy is that why aren't we given the right options why is it always\nTakes drugs take that drug tried to stronger drugs take this opioid try these injections hit that doesn't work we always can do surgery where's all these other options like chiropractic like non surgical spinal decompression like low level laser therapy very non invasive very effective therapy where's all this stuff\nAnd I will get to get into that I don't want to go a\nLittle crazy just yet uh even though some of my family think I Am a little crazy but ah now we're going to go right into car accidents right now we have a ton of information to cover so\nAgain I Want to repeat what Christ said we are live in the studio today so please give me a call we will be taking your life calls\nAnd stories together story call and tell us even if it's not a question aid for for two two zero zero nine six by this aid for for two two zero zero nine six five you can also texture questions although we prefer the phone calls but you can text that two one two three two\nOne hundred and forty characters maximum pleased if two one two three two\nSo look if you've been in a car accident there are some things you absolutely need to know in specially with the state of Florida which has its own unique set of rules and regulations and laws so before we even get into the injury part let's talk about some of this the nuances of Florida so we have something called\nThe no fault law or was recall in the industry ... personal injury protection\nSo what this is is basically everybody in the state of Florida has to have\nCar insurance and part of the car insurance you have to have no fault that if you injure someone\nOr if you just hit a tree or something you have medical protection up to ten thousand dollars of coverage is called no fault and\nSome states you have to sue the other person in order to get the medical bills covered but in this state you don't have to do that even if they strike you you go on to your own car insurance for your medical I go into my own car insurance it's supposed to lower the lawsuits technically uh but I don't know that necessarily happens\nUm however we all have ten thousand dollars a coverage okay now part of that coverage\nThey put it in a new rule a few years ago it's called the fourteen day role so used to be gone in a car accident and you can go to a doctor related to the ... maybe you waited a few weeks and see if it the pain went away maybe it wasn't so bad at first but it got worse over the next few weeks\nWell in the two years ago you can go on the fifteenth day or the Eighteenth day or the twenty first day of your car accident right Chris I mean I don't know if you've had a car accident\nAhead one yeah one then you might not have been too bad and maybe to get treated at all but some people just wait they they have ... you know other things to do they're not that bad initially\nAnd then all of a sudden a three weeks later the arm starts getting numb and ... and they get nervous or the headaches of getting worse or the neck pain is worsening so now they come in and get check well under the new fourteen day will if you didn't see a physician within fourteen days of the date of your injury\nYou are out of luck you paid for ten thousand dollars of coverage but the new insurance law is you don't get to use any of it you get zero benefit\nSo folks I'm telling you if you have a car accident you absolutely should get checked within fourteen days even if you're not in a lot of pain just go visit a physician or preferably one in my clinic so of course but or any position will do to check you out and document that you were seen\nAnd things of documented because if you go after fourteen days you lose you've lost all your benefits screen the extremely extremely important fourteen day will do not forget it tell your friends and families that there are cracks and they must must must get checked within fourteen days\nWhy give us ten thousand dollars of medical coverage um that you paid for that makes sense now if that wasn't enough you still can't get your ten thousand dollars a medical coverage\nUnless a physician declares you have what's called an emergency medical condition or in the industry is recall for short an ENC so let's say you've gone within fourteen days\nAnd you've been checked and you're having some issues and you want to get treated the insurance companies still limits you to twenty five hundred dollars of the ten thousand that you've paid for like your premium is based on ten thousand dollars of coverage but one you don't get it if you wait more than fourteen days into you still don't get it\nI mean if you go within fourteen days because a physician has to say you have an ENC emergency medical condition this is more of a legal definition not a medical definition it doesn't mean it's a emergency to the point where your arm is falling off and you you have to get surgery to re attach it no it's not that type of emergency medical condition it's more like\nIf you don't seek proper treatment it's the medical doctors opinion\nThat this injury could result in long term\nChanges to that part for instance we don't get your neck treated properly and you let it go\nThan in a year from now or for the rest of your life you may have Nick issues of chronic tension chronic pain in the ... last emotion so if the doctrine makes an opinion that you have an emergency medical condition then and only then will you get your ten thousand dollars of coverage so these are important rules don't forget folks um\nMany people think they need an attorney\nWhen they get a car accident I mean judging by the commercials are all my good attorney friends here in town they have you believing that you absolutely must have an attorney when you first get a car accident but the truth is\nYou don't need an attorney all the time or some people need them sometimes ah people think they need them all the time but it's just depending on what the condition is ah what the injuries look like why not call the doctor like ourselves first\nGet your injuries assess getting within fourteen days get your emergency medical condition established\nAnd then if you need an attorney well you can always make that decision later but ah why not you have the medical benefits we all have ten thousand dollars of coverage\nWhy not go in and get checked first and see what your injuries are before we're running around calling attorneys and God I Love the attorneys you know I I work with a lot of them they're great people they do a great service for their clients I'm friendly with many many attorney can sound they're awesome but I don't necessarily think you need to call them first I think you should\nA code orange wellness dot com and see where our locations are and get yourself an appointment to get checked\nOkay so that the attorney thing and we work with a lot of them so if you have an attorney no big deal we will work with them if you need when we always can make recommendations as well\nUm so after a car accident we know that many of us suffering for the types of things that uh we can help

valuable because you know how often do you see a chiropractor and a medical doctor working together\nIn the same clinic it's just you don't see it a lot they usually at odds a lot of time for some
