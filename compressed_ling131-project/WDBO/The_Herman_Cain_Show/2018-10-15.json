I'll be the winery on Sunday early so click on and be part of the fun you're gonna feel even better about our country when it's all said and done and be able to answer any questions\nAbout what goes on a box and the pathway to this place meanwhile this\nIdea of what the king of Saudi Arabia\nIs any knowledge of what\nAs he said he thought he re being\nSaudi firmly denies that I've asked myself\nImmediately got on a plane and go to Saudi Arabia don't feel it's a place that would be probably\nWith regard to this show to hear that\n[noise] so he's talking about the the killing of a ... and this looks like to kill him because he's disappeared of twelve days now and his fiance wrote an editorial today in the Washington Post I Believe with the wall Street Journal\nSaying that he went in to say we had a big day planned who's going to come and get his official divorce papers and we were going to get married and he did live in fear of a safety and he did think the Saudis headed out from because\nThey felt as though he left their prey he was riding negative things about the new revamped as Saturday a government and they shouted put out word that he was a he was sympathetic to the Muslim Brotherhood\nSo together we answered the answers air there's rumors about his apple watch recording the audio they chose he was interrogated tortured killed and cut up\nA distorting the New York times today say someone walked in there with the bones saw I don't know how they would know all this\nBut now they say uh the Saturday the Turkish officials are allowed to go in and investigate inside these Saudi embassy inside turkey notice he didn't say he's going to see the crown prince whose evidently the person that thirty something year old Syracuse grad\nWho evidently dad to everybody's tight with and that so much hope with when he did is American Tour they going to see the king many people think the king has a little bit of dementia going so that's going to open them up there's some\nCriticism although it is kind of smart because let's go to the king if there's a problem but when the crown prince probably knows exactly what's going on\nSo the question is why did Saudi Arabia I think they can get away with this how could they a country like China who thinks they know America is so well play something a misplaced something so bad Marco Rubio is that all the shows talking about this cut thirty seven\nAs far as arms sales I Would not have set up the way the presidents that it harms sales are important not because of the money but because it also provides leverage over their future behavior you know they donate our spare parts donate our training and those are things we can use to influence their behavior but I Would not take cutting that off off the table\nOr the problem is the president said listen I cut off the arms sales but why am I doing that to Raytheon why am I doing it to Boeing because if we stop we don't sell them arms and weapons and planes Russia and China do so why why am I hurting my industry because they might have done something terrible to what they were calling a Saudi citizen\nJonah Goldberg oftentimes you Trump critic once again cut thirty four [noise]\nI Wish someone would ask him okay so how many journalists with Saudi Arabia get to kill before ... it might jeopardize that right I mean this is a problem with the rhetoric is also a problem with the relationship it makes a lot of sense to me or at least is perfectly defensible to have a better relationship with Saudi Arabia to work this out as a counterweight to Iran all those things are fine or at least defensible\nBut has to be when you get into this situation\nIt is clear no one communicated to Saudi Arabia that if we're gonna go down this path you cannot embarrass us or put us in a situation like this\nAnd so now we're at the stage where there are no really very good options um ah the White House is in a bind on this and it's because they went down the cul de sac to begin with without a proper line of communication someone who led the Saudi Arabian government to believe that they could get away with is that this wouldn't be a problem and that's why it's a mess now\nNo I don't think anyone would say I do it's okay to go kill the journalist nobody would say that I think that's too big of a lead Jonah Goldberg one of the smartest most insightful people around I agree with some of what he said they might have misinterpreted that it's okay but I think it's wrong to say that in the ministry ... anyone would say we can and not go kill\nYou can go kill a journalist or a columnist that you don't like no way and by the way the president's been tough on rhetoric but he's being somewhat or he's being reserved because he does not know what happened he cannot believe that they had this type of stupid judgment\nTo jeopardize relationships with a nation we need in the region and where the country they need we have a number one energy producer now they need to diversify the economy they need the American investment\nBut yet they will put an overt rich to take out a columnist 'cause he had to do bad things to say about the Saudi Raleigh role family\nSued princes keeping his powder dry but no he's going to be pushed to do something and he will and so will Congress Republicans and Democrats would you have to understand

under any time soon at least on this week ten o'clock news Ninety six twenty five WD our top story President Trump right now on his way to the Florida Panhandle to survey the damage from hurricane Michael along with first lady Melania Trump spokeswoman Kellyanne Conway was on TV this morning talking about his upcoming trip obviously\nIn terms of the ... it was completely different than the one that really stood out was the one three days after he won the election where it was my impression in total shock right now so much more confidence is truly president I mean ... I felt it\nWas that was as we saw each she was old room and the president was way fighting back the entire time I'll bring you some of the highlights and low lights but it is true he is on a bit of a role and when you have Andrea Mitchell coming out and saying this president's final used to being president I think there's a lot to do with the pause in the ... which is an official ... we haven't heard anything come out\nBecause they don't want to affect the election and went from day one people say you're illegitimate you also popular vote your illegitimate team member the electoral college they're going to get delegates to switch before they actually reported with electro college\nAnd then all of a sudden they looked into well there's a Russia Russia helped in part of the United states over sanctions on Russia and then they started talking about some type of probe and call me and all his all his antics which results in his firing they are questioning legitimacy every day and his family's under nonstop scrutiny as is he\nNow he's getting out from under a little bit and he's almost a different person well still holding the same characteristics Michael good one New York post communist boxers dot com columnist Michael welcome\nBack that could right so do you notice the difference\nOh sure I'm among the other interviews that he did a I had one with him last week also\nAnd it is he is incredibly comfortable I think in the in the choices he is making and particularly I think when he goes out to these rallies and these enormous crowds that continue to grow\nUm I I think that really lift him I I I think they they give him confidence or he said to me you know there's a lot of love and those people and I think that it it like all\nPresidents you know when you get out of the bubble and you get to talk to people and hear them and see how they react to what you say even if it's just from a speech a I think you get a sense of where the country is and I think he feels very connected\nTo the heartland of the country and and to the voters who elected Emmy he he you know he says I I have kept my promise is I've actually done more than I thought I Would be able to\nAnd what he's seeing gives him the confidence that this is the right course said that\nThat are married and of course and you see the statistics whether it's just you know the stock market since he's been elected\nUh the unemployment rate for not just the country as a whole a but for the for African Americans Latino Americans for women I mean this is a boom this is a real economic boom we are experiencing and it is broad base it is not true that it's only benefiting or the wealthier people this is a true\nA growth a agenda for the middle class working class and I think all Kanye West thing but it's another example of Trump breaking down barriers I mean I don't know that Kanye West is going to lead a revolution\nOf black Americans becoming more conservative\nBut I think the mere fact of what he's doing and the reaction is getting from some other black conservatives and the attacks that he's taking Kanye West is\nFrom black liberals tells you that there is there is movement think that the old the old a gridlock of group think a and a party allegiance is breaking up you have the never Trump or is just going crazier and crazier these are these are Republicans essentially conservatives\nOn the other hand you have people like Kanye West coming over to the full so there's there's a realignment going on with in the country which I happen to believe is very health very healthy for our republic because every vote\nBut it's it's something that should be earned by every politician there should be no group identity with a party I mean I just believe that that has been a killer for our country\nCouple of things he made it clear to us we stall\nI don't trust everybody around me that's working for me and that's where I'm allowed to use to do when she was in Africa and talk to ABC\nShe was interesting but ... you know we'll see we'll see there's going to be some changes uh I think they would you see what he said about Madison was kind of interesting to a Chris Christie thinks that the man is getting a message he was asked about the secretary of events she says well he's more of a Democrat will see ...\nWith the president managers and I think what he was doing there were sending to Madison message\nWhich he when he was sent out no no what do you think was if you want to get out now the time if you don't\nThink the whole twenty twenty I think that's the message he was saying about it that I I like him I think he's going to get along great we had lunch all the positive things might be a Democrat maybe it's going to leave everybody is going to be back with the president managers George and that's what he managed the Trump Organization\nAs we've managed his White House for two years when he's right right\nYeah look I think I think the president as you said earlier Bryant has gotten more comfortable and then you go back to you think of that White House was Sean Spicer\nWith a Steve Bannon with Gary Cohn is I mean people who weren't really even McMaster\nPeople who are sort of all cobbled together because the president and was such an outside or that he had\nNo sort of government on the shelf as most presidential candidates to\nForget for rock Obama took a lot of Bill Clinton's people uh\nGeorge Bush took a lot of the Reagan people on his father's people uh everybody needs some government to start with Donald Trump had no government to start with I think gradually he's an outsider\nHeap cobbled together and administration six months later he changed it and he continues to change it I think if she gets more comfortable and and as as look\nThese jobs don't people can't stand them forever I mean there there are a lot of these jobs are burnout jobs\nNot everybody can has the stamina of Donald Trump but I think I think he is getting a government\nThat matches his personality and his policies\nYeah I think you're right so what other things that you gleaned that maybe didn't appear in your column about the president when you were with them you know to ... years\nYes look I I think that they um you know the issue of who he will run against is is of course very much a on his mind in twenty twenty I mean I think obviously he he\nBelieves the crowds are a good sign for the midterms job but we talked we talked about a Hillary Clinton book tour for example Hillary and Bill Clinton he said he said he he doesn't think it's going to help the Democrats at all I think it's going to hurt the Democrats\nAnd he relishes the idea of running against Elizabeth Warren whom of course he calls Pocahontas of of Cory Booker things that Democrats are going so far left\nThat there'll be unrecognizable by twenty twenty\nAnd you think that he wants Hillary per rematch\nTire he doesn't think she was going to run he said it was ... he doesn't think it's likely I disagree with him on that I think she wants to run and I think this speech speak speaking tour with her husband\nIs all about testing the waters without having to announce his keeping her front and center there'll be out there raising money by selling tickets she's got her little slush fund already that she's a raising money was called onward together I think she's setting up a potential rematch\nHe's saying he's saying not persuaded of that uh although he does think that her going out there is bad for Democrats but why should going out there I mean she doesn't need the money I think she's going out there\nTo test the waters to see if there's any receptive to her candidacy again look as a as I said before Brian\nShe is kind of default nominee until somebody knocks or off and I don't know who that can be right now I just don't think any of the Democrats we hear out there has any kind of a national following yet that make that may happen soon but as of now none of them have a national following the way she does\nSo I think they're the most part is the president ready starting to bulk up with a replacement for Don McGahn I understand is going to be a fish will soon but does he ready poor light if the Democrats get the house\nIt's going to be a tough situation for him um I I'm I think if the you know he's clearly hoping that if they do take it will be a small measure\nBut I think that ah the crowds that each generation you know when he goes out there he's talking about both the Senate and the house I think they're picking the districts that they think are winnable or the Senate looks pretty good at this point for Republicans\nBut the house as a problem I don't\nI don't get a sense that he has given up on it but but I think that he is concerned that uh it's gonna be hard to get things done and I think part\nOf what you said with his attacks on the Federal Reserve\nIs very much in keeping with that that the economy is so important to his re election to this fall that they that ... when I spoke to him was in that swearing up a couple of days or with the stock market and he was out there and he said and I said to me too that you know they don't know what they're doing they're making my job harder\nAnd he compared it to the European Central bank\nThe Chinese banks which which basically are funding these deficits for their governments to to\nThe central banks that to be accommodating he said you know they're much more accommodating but those are our competition\nSo our job is harder and harder than American businesses and\nSo I think he's very attuned to the political impact of everything he says and does\nVery interesting and what about uh what about in the in the big picture he wants to go out and he wants to campaign he wants to nationalize this whole election or in terms of in terms of where we're at right now as a a as a race\nI think it's a very interesting to see a lot of experts not willing to guarantee that the house is going to go to the Democrats here is Loni Chen or the Hoover Institute on meet the press got twenty\nMid term elections are a lot about convincing voters what is it you stand to lose what isn't you stand to lose and and for Republicans the pitch is if a Democratic Senate gets elected you're going to lose the judges for Democrats is if you have a Republican Senate gets elected you're going to lose Obamacare\nThis is news ... window turns first for breaking news\nGood morning ten thirty and needed anything by Wu media right to our top story not much time here at the ten thirty cat comes home at Washington watchdog Jamie prey this morning\nPresident Trump gets ready to land in Florida to survey the damage from hurricane\nMichael we're getting an inside look at how FEMA is responding and the cost of it\nThat Congress won't have to approve new aid money for victims of hurricane Michael immediately ... said last week at it over twenty eight billion dollars on hand in disaster relief funding but with the scope of the damage from the hurricane lawmakers might need to add more to FEMA before the end of\nThe year ... we'll be back until after the midterm elections but ... says the money should hold until that kept the gym in your pre button in Iraq to read about how much food and water FEMA's already applied to the hard hit areas\nTo point five ... or\nOrlando turns burst for severe weather channel nine I wouldn't ... Brian shield ties today in the lower ... coming up we're tracking the heat for the week ahead it seemed like here already seen in Haiti pouring rain\nLord I hadn't seen it personally Lou Gehrig's disease and\nTo the Florida department of health the child who died was not vaccinated and before contracting the flu is otherwise healthy they haven't said where the child is from ...\nOf the things that he promised during the campaign and delivered on just like you know he move the embassy to Jerusalem three previous presidents all promised to do that and not one of them came through he did it he promised to destroy ISIS there now launching the operation on the last uh on the last section of their of their ... when that city has taken in in on their rocket certain border the Calif\nIt has gone he promised to impose a travel ban I'm not a fan of the travel ban personally but he said he was going to do it he did it uh you know he said he kept Obama's\nPromise of you know that it's Syria's chemical weapons that he'd he'd he'd he'd do something about it and I'm like well\nMama he actually did he promised\nSupreme Court justices like me in this ... we've got two of them he promised to transform the bench with the way he's confirmed twenty nine\nAh the appellate court justices with most of any president in history a tax reform regulatory roll back you just go down the line or even on trade again an area where I'm not I'm not a fan of terrorists I think terrorists or a bad idea but\nHe promised that during the campaign and he's doing it so you just have to go go down the line of everything you said for better or for worse ... a lot for the better some for the worst he's doing exactly what\nHe said uh so that's you know that's it that's the standard that most Americans care about the most\n... also you could say hey I got to redo NAFTA he'd read NAFTA and the south Korea the only read the daddy said the European Union bin ... he's got a framework to redo that and I'm going to hook up China in the beginning I thought wow he's kind of backing off a little bit well he was for a while and now not any more\nTo the point where the pressure is so great it's affecting the market and he says I'm not even ready to speak to to a chairman or our president Xi\nRight now so this is what he's doing\nAnd I mean look you've got he signed deals as you say with Mexico Canada in South Korea he read those he's close to getting a deal with the European Union China's gonna be a much tougher nut to crack because it's not just tariffs its industrial policy there where they're subsidizing are\nAll sorts of sectors where we can't compete and also there's there's intellectual property theft so that's going to be the hardest thing but one of the things also is that you know the U.S economy under Trump is booming and the rest of the world is slowing and so I think\nHe's figured out that we've got a\nBuilt in advantages right now that we can sustain a showdown on trade in a way that some of our trading partners trading partners are trading adversaries in the case of some of these countries can't and so you know if your economy is slowing\nA and all of a sudden credit Trump puts terrorists on you that's going to put a lot more of a squeeze on\nYour whereas in the United states is they're going to we're doing so well right now that we could we could we could absorb a some terrorists for a short period of time in order to in a showdown and they're going to in a game of chicken they're going to blink\nUh so that's what he's doing but I mean ... you know and even in the areas\nWhere he hasn't kept his promise like building a wall of repealing Obamacare he's been trying\nA you know that that it's because of democratic obstruction that he hasn't done that and then you know in the ... the few rare instances where he has backtracked like you know he promised during the campaign to pull our troops out of Afghanistan he actually studied the issue very carefully if you read the Woodward book it's actually very comforting the process by which he went through or yes\nYeah and it just to handle it yeah\nIt can handle that he'd do great I mean this the the the there's knows what the problem with our politics today on both the left in the right seems you know we talk about the forgotten Americans you know where the forgotten Americans the people in the middle\nOf forgotten Americans today because the Republicans are ... Trump is just trying to wrap up the all of elections elections used to be you'd get your base energized and then you're going to go out and try and persuade the persuadable right\nNobody's trying to persuade persuadable anymore it's just about it's bad enough motivation to leftist throwing you know we're going to destroy Brett Kavanaugh and accused him of gang rape and we're going to destroy these people and get their people fired up we are we going to impeach Trump and then Trump is out there saying we're going to destroy the Democrats and get it through red Smith sticks to his crowds\nAnd nobody in the ... is trying to go out there and and and when the people over in the middle\nAnd so there's a real forgotten Americans and there's so much support sitting on the floor waiting to be picked up if Donald Trump which would just try\nTo do to win those people over there is no reason his support should be in the forties right now with his record for the economy the way it is and it's just it's a tragedy for somebody like me who who wasn't a huge Trump supporter but wants him to succeed\nWho wants to be successful wants his presence is said it's very frustrating that he doesn't try\nMark Thiessen thanks so much that I guess maybe you listen to one eight six six eight seven six six not\nJealous steady for your brain it's Bryan kill made\nSecurity team traffic\nHey good morning topic is ... by Burlington I bore eastbound debt Iraq's not between Ausiello parkway in the five thirty five eight that strong top of the breaks their last may the crash not helping things John Young Parkland central Florida parkway colonial Dr phil wrapping up that racket like picket relish\nMake Berlin tenure headquarters for your family how are you in Marlin save on on Iraq's first and the hottest logo looks plus boots cars and ...

hurricane Michael it destroyed certain cities such as Mexico beach in Panama City\nLike Michigan or Pennsylvania Wisconsin has been more democratic than not you you had Iowa was another example Ohio\nYou had a these these states in Ohio and I really normally democratic the other ones are you have them going I'm more Republican for Trump and twenty sixteen and they often return\nTo their original voting a inclination in a midterm election this happens in both parties depending on who's operating and who's controlling the White House so I think that's the that's what it's\nDoing it for the governorships and the fact that\nRepublicans as you mentioned have twenty six of the governorships Democrats have only nine it's exactly the mirror opposite of the Senate where Democrats are defending twenty six seats and Republicans are only defending nine it helps to be defending less territory\nIt helps to ah to be the opposite party are controlling the White House in a midterm election\n[noise] Ah yes in some of the big stories I think he's going to be first off on the Florida Senate race Bill Nelson and center Scott\nA choose me Governor Scott he wants to be centers guy now do you believe that this is going to be an action based election where you gonna watch Scott again in the ... doing something he's been pretty good at and that's reacting to a natural disaster which is\nThis hurricane that will help I actually see the mayor of Tallahassee are doing a little bit more Gillum then I Do dissent is as the next governor I don't see just said this anywhere\n[noise] yeah I think the saved his his campaign needs a shake up where they need to shake the candidate up one way or the other but on the Senate race it's very very close and you were right to point to the hurricane because uh and it's horrible to talk about a disaster like that in political terms but that's what political analysts\nDo and clearly it's helping Scott because he's in the news every day he's down they're surveying the damage and trying to\nFix the damage US Senators can come up with money you know they can pass and appropriations attend them or something like that but they can't they can't actually be doing what a governor's doing so that's a natural advantage for Scott\nI'm I wanted to go to or the other Senate races number one in Arizona mix Sally in cinema\nI've I think they make salad just dump pure merit is going to pass some of the edgy running a phenomenal and they just highlight what she's done she was the first female fighter pilots he's been in Congress been affected she's a good communicator and from actually from Arizona so I mean I look for her to pull away to your polls reflect that\nWell I'm going to know more than flying to Phoenix today and there'll be there tomorrow and I certainly want to take a closer look at that Senate race I think that's a really close when a ... and ... Nevada to\nWestern states currently controlled by Republicans those are those are really really close races and I wouldn't I don't want to say until I see 'em up close\nBut what about that can help my show today on your\nShow is not my priority just ... you went to monitor cello and I didn't see you\nYou were in this area over your system\nYour sister did contact me on friday and unfortunately I was out of town but you gave me no notice when I should have been a priority but who cares really who cares what the president said about about something ... about a very long behind us you know who cares it doesn't matter who care so I'm not\nGoing to hold that against you very long\n[noise] well I was in my show for Fox Nation a beginning a seven o'clock in the morning tour so I could do my teacher before even the Jefferson family woke up still saying there do they stay with me how they do\nThey stay with me on the lawn have comfortable more comfortable accommodations monitor cello you know it's just so wild so many people like you come there\nRight now and I went to ... would you I think is really important going to make sure that besides that that's the work of the slaves they kept that plantation going which was what five thousand acres that zenith and about they said they have about two two point five now\nYes and I'll tell you one reason I'm convinced of genes why Thomas Jefferson live to for them the ripe old age of eighty three\nWas because he ate so much a fresh fruit fresh fruit fresh vegetables grown up there in ... I mean it was for the time just\nOutstanding it was a better diet that almost anybody had he was also a near vegetarian I bet you didn't know that\nNo I did not know that I had it but how did you on the air for those who drank every day and was about sixty pounds overweight it looks like some some of the sketches we don't have any photographer she was\nNot overweight at all he was slim and trim\nAdded God I oh I thought you meant to Thomas Jefferson\nAnd somebody had to John Adams live so long\nAgo John out yeah well John Adams live so I guess it was genes I don't know maybe he ate will too but you're right he ate too many fatty foods and too much\nCarbide right but they didn't know about that back then yeah like the overly critical\nI won't be my last thing was hit by by say they like to the same story election was today the Senate stays there how splits\n[noise] yeah I think the Senate states I think Republicans could even pick up a seat or two in the house I Would say probably it goes over the twenty three I'm not going to save definitely and I'm certainly not going to put a number on it until we get closer to\nTo election day because as we all know lots of October surprises unfold even up to election eve we saw that in the twenty sixteen and we may see it again this year is a\nPrison helping or hurting with these rallies\nOh well he's helping a lot in the Senate because he's going to deeply red conservative states which will determine who's controlling the Senate and whether Republicans pick up seats so I didn't notice that's where he's focusing mainly although he did go down and try to help my former student Andy bar there and\nAnd Kentucky's a tough race for reelection in ... you know he got an edge in my class Andy Barr did he did and that's something for you to aspire to\nWrite I'm I was born in your classes are always sold out\nWell when you retire I figure you come down here you're probably retire down here and then you can take some classes\nIt is beautiful I Wish I could not have been more impressed especially a homecoming weekend and then we can we beat Miami which was highly higher rank you guys were on ranked\nWe were ... they were number sixteen and they they flooded the field normally only do that when you beat a number one number two are number three ... a team but we're you know I'm not going to say we're desperate but [laughter] but we were just thrilled to to have a victory against ranked team\nOkay let's see I just think he's keeping an eye and John James you have that as a safe democratic seat just keep your eye and that guy he could not be more impressive\nAny ... and and I believe that he's the calmer I think they'd done juniors going there this week and I think the price is going to show up shortly could you possibly by the I'm looking at the crystal ball now because you may be put down to lean category\nWell I'm going to think about it because you suggested in Michigan was really taken it the last minute by a truck by about ten thousand votes and twenty sixteen so\nYou know upsets of happen there in recent history I'll take a look at it I have heard he's he's impressive it's just that Michigan like so much of the mid west has been flipping back to the Democrats in a midterm year\nWell you you and your trends\nData me me and my data ... out of ten the data's\nWrite to us because there was twenty sixteen all of you are dumping on data and I think it's terrible\nYou know sometimes you are dealing with bad characters that said um this is pretty brazen and pretty stupid here\nAnyway every way it's stupid\nIf some if somebody did this a thinking that somehow it wasn't going to get a figure it out uh I I think\nThis is a really dangerous thing for the Saudis to have done or should they have done it\nHere or Mike morale weighed in on CBS and here's what he said about what the Turks are saying about what they picked up off the apple watch and would have picked up maybe with the surveillance video Katrina\nI think the Turkish narrative is more compelling um because they say they have evidence um and there's the ... the Saudis have done no explanation so I think [noise] that is more compelling and that's where most people have gone but by the bottom line or is that we still don't know what happened inside that ...\n... what Bob Corker told us this on friday cut thirty two\nWe've had an alliance with them [laughter] but look it's a it's going to be hugely damaged and uh I Know that Congress there at the lowest point\nWith Congress that they've ever been since I've been hearing them I've been up by the way of a friend of Saudi Arabia is okay I've tried I've tried to ...\nKeep a arms sales from being blocked by Congress and have been successful up until this point I Would not be successful in that on the floor to die and I don't know that I Would even attempt to be successful I probably am now moving in another direction with them\nAnd right now the you know the crown prince said he says for the last year and a half the Saudis have been acting very arrogant lay and that really coincides with when the crown prince came here to do as a media tour with the press and let everybody know it's a new day in Saudi Arabia it might not be a new day", "year": "2018", "show_name": "The Herman Cain Show", "city": "Orlando", "day": "15"}
