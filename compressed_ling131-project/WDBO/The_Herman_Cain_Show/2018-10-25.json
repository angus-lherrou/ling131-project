{"month": "10", "state": "FL", "station": "WDBO", "content": "And deniro and now looks like Joe Biden over in Delaware they are ... critics of the president so people like John Brennan Nancy Pelosi or quickly to say the president's to blame with us right now as a Senator John Cornyn of Texas said are you playing the president for this ah for these will be package bombs\nOf course not Brian uh obviously violence is never accept\nAll in public discourse but of course these are some of the same people who are who've encouraged their own partisans to\nTo incivility Andrew confrontation and drew a two\nAnd encourage the mob that we saw during the Kavanaugh hearings obviously this is different in kind and quality the idea that somebody would send an explosive device to somebody is something that needs to be investigated and prosecuted as opposed to the law but the partisanship\nTruckers what would it kill us\nYeah I mean I live down one what's going on right now nothing's happened in Texas thankfully but do you uh do you do know that we've had two things going on a lot of people are focused on the Senate race there you were in charge of putting the Senate Republicans hands and you did it\nAnd now I see very few people who think that you're not going to hold onto it or increase your age do you believe that Senator Ted Cruz has a secure lead right now\n[noise] well I ... secure isn't a word I Would ever used when it comes to lectures but uh that's going to win a ... and I've been on the ... within the are heading out Corpus Christi and used to uh today and tomorrow but a ... a is a nice guy but he's a he basically is running like a Senate\nCandidate from California all of his policy prescriptions his positions are really are more attuned to those are the national Democrat like Nancy Pelosi and Chuck Schumer ... out of Texas a policy position do\nYou worry that Texas is changing some said because it's such an attractive place to live because their tax situation is so enticing that you're changing the makeup of taxes and it might be on their way to turning blue\nWill come on down anytime\nBrian you'll you'll enjoy the uh the pro business environment or we we believe in a less regulation low taxes and the more freedom and it shows in terms of our economy\nAnd you're right people have been voting with their feet\nComing from high tax places like California\nOr to Texas but I consider these refugees are from socialism or they don't want to replicate what they what they are fleeing but we still have to remain a ten of twenty four seven sixty five days you're took what we're hearing from our constituents to twenty eight million people I'd have to be on her representing and I try to do that every day\nRepublicans right now according to the a P earned a pretty good spot that many weren't expecting and believe it or not if the president's popularity that giving some Republicans a sense that they have a shot at holding onto the house\nOr and also the the evolution of this caravan it's got a lot of Americans that just Republican concerned because Democrats don't seem to mind that this caravans creating towards our border it's about a thousand miles away and it's between four and seven thousand people what's your thoughts as it as a border state\n[laughter] well I I I think there's a big and important difference between the legal immigration and illegal immigration or the most welcoming country in the world when it comes to legal immigration\nBill would expect people to follow the rules and to get in line and to and to do it\nThe right way that's the way we've honored immigrants historically in this country by welcoming them\nTo legal immigration the United states but this idea of basically a mob\nInvading United States and in violation of our rules jeopardizing public safety\nWe all know that this is a vulnerability that this uh this pipeline up from Central America that's controlled and Mexico mainly by the cartels and they transmit not only are immigrants but also\nDrugs and other contraband too it's time to wake up call this may be just enough to trying to wake up the American people to exactly what's happening and who's controlling this so I'm the president's committed to stopping at a I was with him on Monday Night in Houston and you made that very clear and I walk that in order\nHe might not have the tools to stop it I mean right now thanks to a law maybe you can expand on it that Dianne Feinstein passed in two thousand eight it told Mac into Mexico a you know you're not welcome here but central and south Americans well if it tip the scales to them can you tell us what took place in the ...\nAnd Obama yeah what what what happened is this was a well intended\nA wall which basically has been exploited now or by the cartels to a\nA treats immigrants from non contiguous countries in other words places like Central America different traits Mexican uh enlist immigrants and it requires children to be a process by health and Human Services put\nWith a sponsor in the United states and then to litigate their claims of course I Will uh later on this is really created a model is humanitarian disaster a backlog in our in our immigration or asylum of processing system\nAnd this is being exploited by the very people who make money off of off of this um off of this flaw in our system that requires bipartisan\nSupport to to solve it but as you saw when the president offered the solution for DACA recipients deferred action for childhood arrivals one point eight million young adults offered a path to citizenship in exchange for border security in six weeks flaws\nWas turned down by the Democrats and this is the price we're all having to pay for that\nAnd but the thing is they turned it down when you guys including chain migration as well as the lottery system but straight out it looked as though uh that wasn't enough for many on the right straight up twenty five billion for the wall and terms for DACA so would you take that deal today\n[laughter] I think it's important we break this impasse when it comes to our immigration system because what we're seeing is this law what we've all recognizes now being exploited by these transnational criminal organizations sometimes called\nCartels who are using this to a to import a heroin and illegal immigrants that traffic and human beings are to the United states we need to stop it so I Would I Would sit down at the table and roll up our sleeves and and get this fixed\nHe usually ... drives me crazy if you have a policy difference alright fine what's ... what's in it lets debate it but if you have a policy difference and you know you don't even feel you're convicted to what you believe what you're saying\nI have a real problem with that because you just spinning your wheels trying to get political advantage and I put that label on Senator Schumer and and Brock Obama because he they could solve the immigration issue but listen to Brock Obama in two thousand five and Chuck Schumer in two thousand nine\nWe all agree on the need to better secure\nThe border and punish employers to hire illegal immigrants we simply cannot allow people to pour into the United states undetected undocumented\nUnchecked and circumventing the line of people who are waiting patiently diligently unlawfully become immigrants in this country\n... go ahead that that Senator Cornyn that's exactly what Donald Trump is saying\nThat's right that's right and I guess the best thing you could say about that or the most uh\nWould be that was then this is now but I Would call that plain and simple hypocrisy it's just a those to cause issues are inconsistent and what they said that is exactly what the president saying now what I'm saying now let's fix our broken immigration system let's\nHave a system to legal immigration that can be up that we can respect that honors and those who try to do with the right way and then to deter those who try to do it illegally\nHow hard was it for you to get used to the president's style and approach\n[laughter] what the president\nIs a unique a political figure I mean that's ... that he was selected the the ... all the more congressional politicians and the Republican primary and I would say now two years in you can't uh you know it's I Can't really argue with the results are the results have been tremendous\nForking with Republican majorities in the house the Senate and not only we confirmed eighty or federal judges including two members of the Supreme Court\nWe've lowered taxes we've reduced regulations and the sleeping giant\nThat is the American economy or was the American economy has now taken off\nAnd people are confident and optimistic again I think that's the results you can't be denied and a while the president's style is as unconventional for sure uh I'm all for the results\nBecause you are just the opposite view of the same beliefs but you have a totally different approach you're gotta legal background you were a GI your understated but you're strong in your beliefs and there's the president saying whatever's on his mind at all times did you ever think you'd have this positive relationship or that you have now when you first met him\nWhile I think it was I've viewed it as my responsibility Brian I'm ah\nIn the leadership in the Senate is the majority whip and working with Senator McConnell and the speaker Ryan I thought it was my responsibility relationship work or where we can find common ground and we have and I think the American people or the or the beneficiaries of that\nI agree a Senator John Cornyn is going to be an exciting twelve days as soon as we get this bomber I'll feel better thanks so much for joining us thanks by\nSenator John Cornyn hey I don't forget you can get Brian kilometer or go to Bryan told me that Comey get Andrew Jackson the miracle of New Orleans and speaking of New Orleans I'll be there Sunday [noise] uh and I want you to join me and on Saturday in Baton Rouge I Want you to join me in St Louis at the St Louis\nThese pipe bombs out to a variety of as you said a left wing critics of President Trump\nHaving said that and and you know and I think that that's the main lesson is that the the the ... responsibility is to that individual there is no question that there is a an inflammatory a polarized an ugly\nDiscourse to our politics today not say that it's responsible but I think that it's the it's the environment in which these kinds of things happen if a President Trump goes over the line in a lot of his rhetoric I Know you've you've called him out\nOn some of his attacks on his his opponents or the media\nUh and I think that that the Democrats do it as well nobody's got clean hands\nAnd you would just hope everybody would lower their voices a bit I don't know that it'll make an immediate difference\nIn terms of this individual or or other\nDeranged individuals but it would be better for the country if we could just disagree about policies without demonizing the opposition\nIt would and I thought in a couple of days maybe friday night or Sunday shows they'll have people\nCondemning the president once we get this guy and most experts believe that he left so many clues we're going to get the guy or the people who say but I thought maybe Sunday you'd have people on and they'd be saying I blame the president or I blame a Nancy Pelosi where Madonna whatever\nI was shocked to we're seeing it last night as if he was the one who seal the envelope\nRight and and and that's my point I I Do think the he bears some responsibility as do people on the left Eric Holder and when they go low we are going to kick them\nAh other other people on the left or the flight that nobody comes with clean hands but there's no question the president has got the biggest megaphone as the as the president uh and he has said unfortunate things things that I I don't take a defensible in terms of\nDemonizing enemies talking about the Democrats as a mob a ... you know praising this reporter does Congress men in in Montana who body slammed a reporter you could say it's a joke it's not funny joke and and particularly to reporters\nA ... and ... who were covering the president particular interest those rallies where there are tens of thousands of people\nBut having said that do I think he's responsible for this particular bombing or does it uh no but I Do think he he goes over the line and I think a Democrats\nLeft wing or as have gone over the line as well\nA cruise while I was with us Chris let's just move I've been covering this all morning you've uncovered we've been covering it all night to so as they try to find that the origin of the ninth package now I Want to move on and talk about the mid term elections\nTom Bev and like many experts are saying this does this thing is changing with the advent of the Kavanaugh hearings with this uh the caravan and the Democrats are radio silent on it\nHe thinks the the blue wave is dead or especially cut forty one\nIf you were talking about a blue wave you would expect it to be cresting right if it way was coming\nA mute expected to be building and building here we are Thirteen Days out from in terms of that's not what I'm saying that we're seeing the presidents ... and going up we're seeing the the generic ballot number holding Democrats and the advantage but not building\nAnd and certainly in some of these swing districts we're seeing sort of a a hand to hand combat it is that race by race and battle\nIn these house districts around the country and obviously in the Senate or it seems to move to the Republican's direction so he put all those components together and ... Democrats still may there slight favorite so when the house and they may still in the house but this is certainly not shaping up to be the sort of big blue wave that's gonna wash everybody away\nIs is with the uh when the while when Chris you put your voicemail down in the morning is this some of the things that are on your voicemail [laughter] well you know I I got to say I think that we should have a little humility\nAnd and the reason I say that as I look back at twenty sixteen yet when you know all of those so called ... no ... all the all the so called inside the beltway experts were saying\nDonald Trump didn't have a chance and Hillary Clinton I remember I was in the exit poll meeting with all the top executives at Fox at at five thirty six o'clock I guess I was five thirty on election night and twenty sixteen Hillary Clinton's going to win Florida and Hillary Clinton will probably be able\nTo call the race for Clinton by eleven o'clock and of course all of it turned out to be false\nI you know I I I Do think that clearly the blue wave and the sense that this is going to be a big sooner nominee for the Democrats is a it doesn't seem to be holding up but but we don't know and we don't know what turnouts gonna be turnout is is very\nFickle in mid term elections we've been surprised more often than not in ... in the last year to the Democratic turnout I mean look at the Doug Jones race in Alabama\nA against Roy Moore that the Democratic turnout of women are of young people are minorities has been bigger I I you know I just think I I a little humility in terms of predicting the future I it's clear\nThat the the sweeping blue wave\nA ... ... it is not going to happen and a ... and certainly it seems in the Senate that Republicans are going to hold onto their majority in the Senate but in terms of making some big production about the house I'm you know I I feel like let's just wait and cover it when it happens that as a\nWriter [laughter] we've been so wrong so often\nAnd now we're meeting people you know like not me\nSo uh you're in a category by yourself thank you\nAre listening Chris you put your analyst hat on for a second the prison United States had in two years had three major hit books on him he got to ... book um who's always been my article of wisdom you have to Michael Wolff book who doesn't really back up to ... some of his queens but it was definitely shocking you edited anonymous\nEditorial that talked about from the inside perspective the president's incompetent you had Bob Woodward's book fear that says or how the president is dangerous\nAnd all of a sudden you have a president with between forty four and forty seven percent approval rating exactly where a Bill Clinton was exactly where a little bit above Brock Obama how how did he do this with Ninety two percent of the coverage negative\nWell he's a force of nature\nAnd he is able to look this is basically a fifty fifty country and the reason\nThat that he was down a solo it in the thirties at one point wasn't because of the Democrats I I don't know that he's turned a lot of Democrats around it was a lot of the Republicans\nDidn't buy it now his his support among Republicans is up in the high eighties or Ninety percent so in a sense that we're the Republicans\nHave come home to them I Would point out you know people are making a big deal about Trump and forty seven percent it's a lot higher than it was it's a good number\nObama was in two thousand and ten people say well it's above Obama Obama was forty five percent and they ended up losing sixty ... or ... so you know you can be I don't think there's a huge difference between forty five and forty seven percent in fact it's within the margin of error in these polls\nSo you could be forty five forty seven percent and it's still take a drubbing lecture that I'm not saying it's going to happen\nI'm just saying that uh it it it could happen so it you know I don't I don't think the Republicans are out of the woods but Donald Trump as a force of nature we have never I've been covering\nPolitics and the national level for over forty years I have never seen anyone liked him as a politician as a policymaker as a guide dealing on the world stage with everyone from ... ... and\nThe European Union it's amazing yeah I mean the big time magazine is is is trumped just the beginning of the new type of leader or is it does the people like President Trump and with President Trump is he a unique character was the beginning of the change of a personality driven political political leaders to a certain degree\nThere's always been a politically driven a politics I mean oh Brock Obama was approached said he was always a politician for for ... yeah for a couple of years but come on when he when he ran when it was so much about you know we are you where the change we ought to change that we are seeking and the U.S we can and ah\nI Hope and change it you know it was it was more about his personality than it was about his policies\nHaving said that we know when you say well is is Trump just the beginning of this to somebody like Donald Trump okay you can say that for good or real I mean I'm I'm making a value free judgment there but he is one of a kind I mean the ... I don't know who who's another Donald Trump that ... that is out there in the political scene that you say well you could be the next Donald Trump\nWell I mean you could say the rock you could say Mark Cuban via I mean they both have they have to make huge leaps to jump in but these are the types of people non politicians who would get big crowds that people might look at\nA I mean ... I you know we ... we don't even really know that I mean yes they're interesting personalities but I don't have a sense necessarily that up to the rock went out that that a thousand people would come to see um I you know we don't know that in ...\nAnd honestly sexy and he's a box office hit wow okay I have with attractive I I wanted I didn't realize that and who died I think you're\nVery secure in your masculine or the way that when you talk about how sexy the rock is I I actually praise you for that thank you I'm so Chris I'm excited for the weekend because Sundays on\nI also have done something I never do\nI actually have looked into my weekend wardrobe I don't really care that much about what other cook on the weekends I bought three on TALK at church I now we'll look right casual and I've never looked good casual ever and I want to know how you feel about that the shirts that are supposed to be out well you\nKnow it's funny because it's a little rain my wife ah is now telling me to talk to my shirts and I can't tell if she thinks it's because I I look cool or because she thinks when I talked my shirt and its unsightly so I haven't quite figured that one out she keeps telling me it means I look cool but I'm I kind of thing maybe she thinks I'm a little lumpy\nI have to watch cartoons so I don't have nightmares I think we need to know that but when it comes to insurance the more you know the better like knowing Geico is the number one on er which are in your area in the second largest in the country plus they've been around for over Seventy five years and have a Ninety seven percent customer satisfaction raining I have to use a calculator on my first graders math homework\nAgain I'm not really needed but knowing offers more than just car insurance is important they offer a motorcycle army and vote insurance and the guy to insurance agency can help them with renters insurance as well\nI practiced taking my glasses off and the mayor because I think it makes me look cool and not needed\nBut you shouldn't have local agents in your area could help you find even more savings what's like military or federal discounts and I go on for emergency roadside service switching insurance is an important decision you can never know too much about it so Florida contact I go on line over the phone or at your local office for\nAll the information you really need to\nThem up as a ... bears or noticed there was get a rebate reserve guard worth up to Seventy five dollars between now and October the reverse of ... just a little tiring autos big or underwriting\nArea here in closed down at universal Hyundai factory rebates or triple your down payment or travel or trade acrimony Eighteen I'm not a fan who's not by his ... he mows in dollars zero percent of the animal\nThis is six point five ...\nTree houses really insensitive killing something and it made me wonder it's friends holding [noise]\nSo looking back at one way to fix for like seven six six I'm Mark listening in Leesburg, Florida hey mark\nHey Brian how you doing good where do you think about all these ... we have nine separate packages now what do you think the overall aim as it's got to be from the same people\nShare um first of all you can leave your shirt and talk and you've got to make a statement gets a little God she's Robert Graham search oh really okay yeah\nI'm I think it's a group of people I think it's multiple people that are doing this um I don't think it's just one person I think they want to make an impact they didn't go after the Democrats and they didn't they didn't target both of them\nBecause they wanted to make an impact so they just went out with the Democrats debate you know give Trump a hard time I think it's um it's a group of them not just what mob mentality work in a group like they did with cabin on I think that's what the problem is and I think you're going to find that that one it's a bunch of\n... the you know mark they got to balance you know that there's some they put this together like we can't even imagine I Know show a show runner has ever put together any type of drama on TV they're putting something together I think maybe even within our show we're going to begin to get some clues on this\nBecause you're delivering nine shepherd packages in five different states to all these different locations somebody slipped up\nBefore they all went to one place and found out when we can track it that way they're even tracking where the envelopes were made let alone the labels who may let alone with the aim was bought they could do all of that thanks so much more of an interesting theory one eight six\nSix eight seven six six sides FBI's run hospital next [noise]\nThis is news Ninety six point five or ...\nOr ... turns first for breaking news\nFour hours a day\nTen thirty or news on his ... we are finally breaking news this morning to more suspicious of packages President Trump blaming the media for what he calls the anger in society NBC's Peter Alexander outside the White House\nAnd said a very big part of the anger we see today in our society has caused by the purposely falls at an accurate reporting

O.\nWhat you might tell retired auto service Lenny clouds round throughout the day and scattered showers moving in from the coast we'll see about a fifty percent chance for today then for tonight's

address the misspellings same stamps same a ... that has some bubble wrap in it same looking bomb we understand with shards of glass on the inside\nDo you believe that there's some some pathway to finding out who this is and it is a is it any easier than most pathway\n[noise] well I think ah there is a pathway I think they're probably multiple pathways one could be someone out there Brian we often talk and in the wake of at an active shooter incident where a lot of lives lost [laughter] you know the FBI studies suggest that probably at Seventy five eighty per se\nAnd of those incidents there are prevent indicators that somebody ... somebody else has seen us observed and is it a in a position to contact law enforcement say hey you know so and so Brian ... taking\nUm he is going to go um I I suspect strongly that that exists here this you know even though a person may have acted individually as a soloist\nA bear off and prevent indicators that might tip off a neighbor or a friend or family member or to say hey this is you know my cousin this is my brother this is my father he's been angry he's been communicating\nIt would not surprise me in the least if we see prior threats and angry language directed at some or all of these folks from this person whether it's through the mail\nOr through email some other form of communication so I think to prevent things may be certainly that's what law enforcement as they're waiting for the the forensics on these devices [noise]\nThey will be combing through those those prior communications with all of these folks as the recipients to see what ties them together is there anything in common here that we see an uptick in in a particular persons communications and the anger\nOr in the victory all I'm ... that somebody that they would put on their list of a let's look further so I think there's multiple opportunities as we wait for the death of renting part of this to come through\nTo kind of interesting they look to X rays and somebody gave some information to the a P and see what it has in there\nThey have actually images a condition of anonymity said that the is PVC pipe it's covered with black tape or there is a small battery in there along with about six inches a pipe packed with powder in broken glass there's ... there was no blasting cap\nOn it and the fact that none have gone off what does that tell you\nWhere I first ah if if we're talking about a gunpowder black powder or something pyrotechnics um it doesn't need a blasting cap or sometimes those things can because their their heat sensitive their friction sensitive\nOr they can detonate with the right amount of friction just putting on the end cap so there's risk to the person constructing these devices\nThere's some risk to somebody that that might a or a machine if you're standing near a machine that may be begging the devices around as being sort of in the mail facility there is some risk to those folks\nThe question I have is as designed could the device have functioned yeah um and that is it could be the uh the the clock mechanism they uh\nHave actually been set to trigger these devices at a certain point or if there is a battery there there's a power source if the batteries were good hum could they have designed and when was the design to actually function at a certain uh our\nUh ... you know after they were received the answer to that might be no that that this is really a a a a dangerous device because it has black powder in it but it's really a movie device it's a TV show device because it you know it looks threatening at X. threatening but it actually would not detonate a intentionally by design\nI tell every stray student on meet the same day life has its peace and values it's all about how you handle

watch the rhetoric that we use it makes a different people here that and they follow\nA that is Jeff Flake for a change is being critical of the president I had no idea he felt that way\nA one eight six six for all eight seven six six nine but I'm not saying he's off base I Would love for everything the changes that will be great to president fights fights in what people don't understand about the president which I Do because I had a chance to known before people to know him no it's not personal he'll go out there and he's got a bit for a deal he's got to go out there and go for his point of view\nAnd then when he's done he's done it almost reminds me of what they do at the end of UFC in boxing fight say go at it they they have a huge pre game there are a lot of bluster they sell tickets at the end they hug\nNot to the other stuff was authentic but they're out there to win but after the competitions done it's done I give you an example Marco Rubio how ugly does that get how did it get what Rand Paul managed to get loaded with Mr ... percent Lindsey Graham\nGuess who he campaigned with Ted Cruz for Ted Cruz he calls from Texas had not lying to anymore do you understand so she is not taking it that way he thinks his opponents don't take it that way but the deranged might be taking it that way so I Would love for the president sit down and give it one more shot not that he has to\nBe good just for the fact that the leaders do stuff like that\nTake risk taking for the time for outlets at a time go meet can't find out what their biggest problem with him is\nHe can go out and tell them what their his big it from a dead in his his staff goes out and get some stats hey NBC Chuck Todd I watched your show Seventy five percent of your panelists are against me every single weekend most of the rhetoric on you MSNBC show is it against me are you of said this monologue system monologues\nAnd I would have all of them CBS has at least offensive on the Sunday shows anyway\nSo I Would say let's just aired out and see if they could ever reset and worst comes to worst prison will get less than Ninety percent negative material and the president in turn will say no

Ryan how are you good so Martha you're heading down to\nA you're heading down and the caravan heading up\nDo you have any idea what to expect when you speak to the homeland security secretary today\nYou know I mean obviously there's a lot of questions for her where I just ... at this point we're going down to the doctor and we're going to talk to ice officials their tactic Christ kitchen ... in there as well\nUm she has a ton of I think think about what what the secretary out on her plate right now she's got disasters that she still dealing with hurricanes in Florida and damage in Georgia she's got the pipe bomb issue which also falls on her and she also has a caravan which as you say it that way right\nNow and one of the big question is you know there are potentially other caravans or maintenance that to be another one that's getting together to leave October first found out that there are so this is not going to go away anytime quickly and we understand that the president is out there I think eight hundred eight hundred members of the military to join that Twenty one hundred national\nGuard currently serve on the order\nI just don't know what they're legally allowed to do I mean there's a reason why we don't since ... rate you know after the civil war we were sending troops out to kind of forced integration\nAnd we got to stop that so what are they going to be allowed to do with going to go to the Mexican side and stop them from coming into our soil\nYeah that that is definitely one of the key questions for secretary Nelson um we've heard the president\nSay things like you know whatever it takes I interviewed a like a call the chairman homeland security the other night he said well do whatever it takes so one of my big questions is what does that mean what's the definition of whatever it takes nobody wants to see violence breakout at the border between the military and you\nKnow members of this caravan but I'm setting as parameters understanding what their marching orders are it is the big question\nHere is the president last night at forty three [noise] those\nLaws across our borders illegally will be sent back home when [noise] we told them or does have gone a long hard to get 'em they cannot come and\nThe way they want a government doesn't work done we don't have borders we don't have a country and we have the greatest country on earth [noise]\nSo if they were pumped up in Wisconsin and that message on the Caribbean and stopping it his resume with Republicans and was so strange Martha is I don't hear anything from Democrats\n[noise] yeah that is very strange um and you know I mean one can only surmise from that that they don't know what the politically advantageous a response from them with me and you look back at comments by President Obama in two thousand addicts you look at the trip orders a fence act that was put in place in two thousand six by President Bush which was supported\nBy Charles Schumer it with deported five ... on that was the what if I heard Clinton all of them saying that we have to have a secure border that you can't\nConduct the sovereignty of a nation without some sort of water and they all supported the eight hundred miles west project along the border at that point so I it's it's I understand about the Democrats don't know quite what to say about it as they see just gone so far away from that stance\nMore through the other thing is the word is we're both twenty Kelly were going out last week it wasn't over an issue it was over Houston Nielsen and we know the ... the general Kelly the chief of staff is a huge fan of his replacement and former deputy ... what do you know about that and will you approach that today when you speak to her\nYou know I mean I think that those issues of sort of you know and we put them in the palace intrigue category at the White House I you know everyone that I've spoken to in the White House is very supportive of secretary of health and\nUm and believe that she's doing a very good job of it you know she's always said that she starts at the pleasure of the president and that she felt that there is an enormous a jet that falls under her job title that she's very committed to carrying out a but certainly you know\nQuestions along those lines of of you know because it's difficult to do your job and if those kind of corrections that are in place and and yeah we'll get her response it up\nYou know I Believe the U.S though you're also going into and I'm not going to be able to cover this one likely but this Arizona Senate race I find endlessly intriguing more Dolly the fighter pilot on paper I thought we'd have their seat but I guess the primary so brutal she's had trouble getting momentum but now she's got it here she is a with you last night", "year": "2018", "show_name": "The Herman Cain Show", "city": "Orlando", "day": "25"}
