complementary consultation to give us a call\nFor a coke on line I have a great weekend everybody I think that's going to do it for this week's edition of all the money the tune next for Florida homes and gardens right here on news\nNinety six twenty five WTO [noise]\nThis is news Ninety six point five your baby ... into it turns first for breaking news\nYou know some of the reasons that people do these projects are like William said you know it was old well in in our case our house was built in Nineteen Seventy six [noise] um and we purchased a house in Nineteen Nineteen Ninety six and renovated to catch it about five years later\nI'm you know and the reason that we did it because\nUm it was outdated so the cabinets where these old shop style\nCabinets that you've seen that and um\nYou know their locally produced cabinet tree um they had all laminate doors old from Ike a counter tops uh I forget the ... we had an old almond refrigerator in there the old style try level range if you still have one of those try level ranges\nIn your kitchen drop whatever you're doing and called now so we can set up a time to take a look at your kitchen and renovated uh those were very popular through the\nEarly and mid seventies into the eighties as well to try level rangers are the ones that it's all one piece unit that has the oven at the bottom the um the electric coil burners or the the next level and then up above there's a a sometimes it was a microwave and more often than not it was a\nA just a second album that was up there as well so uh if you do have one of those you need to call us right away so we can\nRenovate the space so that that's one of the reasons that people would\nI wouldn't want to renovate their space because the space is old and outdated ah the style of the cabinet trees outdated or the appliances are outdated like that I'm try level range maybe you have one of those old avocado um refrigerators with the top freezer\nUm they used to make them much narrower and not as tall as they make them now so you have less capacity\nAs well plus everything's more energy efficient now as well no matter what you buy 'em over the last many decades you know technology improves and manufacturing processes\nImprove and you know you're always going to have a bit of an advantage um with the newer products on the technological aspects of it so you know a lot of times people a lot of times a new appliance someone decides hey we need a new refrigerator\nThat alone will lead to a renovation project because they'll say look we're going to get this new refrigerator it doesn't fit right into the same spot\nWe had before so we're gonna have to modify that and that's going to cost X amount of dollars to do that well if we're going to do that one that we've replaced the range as well and if we're going to replace the range we may as well you know get a new microwave and\nAll right let's do new cabinets and then it's counter tops and then it leads into the other things so I'm so be it be thoughtful about that you know the other thing the I Would say that a third of the reasons on why people do it\nProbably more than than others and there's obvious reasons as well you have water damage so you have to do it or you're building a new house you have to uh you know do your kitchen so uh but bad function is another one\nUm William wouldn't remember this but in our kitchen or our refrigerator was in the exact wrong spot when the house was built um it was one of those bigger older bulky\nTypes of refrigerators and it was right near the dining room or that you know the opening from the kitchen and to the dining room a it was just in the wrong spot it was an eyesore\nAnd um it didn't function well because it didn't give you your countertop in the in the proper space so we took our refrigerator and moved from one spot to another and\nUm that that alone improve the function while the other thing that we were able to do\nWhen we renovated was um improve the function by I'm adding accessory items were there hadn't been accessory items before William what do we have in the cabinet that said the immediate left of the microwave\nIt's not a trick question some\nAs you're facing the microwave what's to the left right there\nOh spicy there's this awesome spice racks that we have in their\nBuilt in ... uh it it is a built in spice racks but it has like it has two sides to the Iraq there was a a a front side and then the back side of it and you grab the bottom of it and you poll added twist itself out and then you push it back and so you actually have two layers\nOf spices in there ah every once in a while when my wife doesn't have anything left to do\n'em in her daily chores she'll go in and she'll alphabetized the the spices in there right will have\nA all spice on the top and then ... and send them in and human and she has all the stuff in there a alphabetized so that's that's kind of cold so you know the ... ... improving the function of the space\nUm and and the static says well so even if you're improving the lighting um you're improving the function by adding these accessory items that are that weren't included in the builder grade kitchen\nOr or in the flipped house that you bought maybe five six years or so ago um you know you can improve the function that way as well [noise]\nWhat was that good Carl\nYeah you know it was All right okay yeah I thought you could have done a little better now are [laughter] I Know I'm just getting was excellent now you can go to these and yeah it's so funny 'cause you go back to these some of these older houses in the seventies and eighties you could tell they were designed and\nYou open the kitchen door or because the the kitchen was designed when refrigerators were different sizes somebody goes out and gets a new refrigerator some of the new stuff they got coming out now and they open the door boom and hits the wall or closes up the pathway\nInto the kitchen completely Jeff and I'm like oh or it hits the counter across the way across from the entrance and you know sometimes appliances have just like when we went from two TVs the flat screen TV Jeff\nThe technology outweigh the wall unit well now we got the technology and the function of the way we use technology day outweigh the desire to kitchen\nThat absolutely yeah I Can't tell you how many times we'll have someone call us\nFor renovation project are and what they didn't tell us is when we see when we go out there\nIs they bought a new refrigerator and it didn't fit into the existing space so they take the cabinet above the refrigerator and either remove that cabinet or someone takes a circular saw to it in the garage and cuts the bottom or the top of it often they cut the doors\nUm you know or there's some other things sometimes the countertop edge sticks in to the refrigerator space or you have your base board trim that goes around on the floor around the opening where the refrigerator is that sticks into the space as well so you get a refrigerator that while it's a little bit bigger I measured the space it's\nThe spaces are thirty six inches well it's not really thirty six inches when you measure\nAn account for the baseball trim that's there or then also uh the countertop overhang so we see that a lot people they'll cut the edge off the countertop in order to jam the refrigerator\nI'm into the space and that's not a good thing in and of itself right there Kyle I'm not sure if you know but you know there needs to be a little bit of space around the refrigerator so ah so it can breathe 'cause you know the coils after time are going to get a little bit um you know they get a little bit dusty over time I'm\nUsually up the water offer some fall in between sure have you know leaning shore you have to be able to to move it in and out of the space as well so if you are one of those with really unlucky where the filter you have to change on the back side of the refrigerator and you got to pull it all the layout yes yeah absolutely yeah\nYeah I mean I'm sure that uh you can get it in and you can get it out we bought a fridge once it didn't even fit through the hallway they'd taken apart yet to get it through re assemble it and put it back in his position yeah we've seen them how to take the doors off of refrigerators in order to fit them into the house yes so exactly why are we doing this that is a huge\nQuestion you need to ask yourself and function is probably should be the top thought process on your list right yeah and you know I I didn't mention it but a great one is um they're doing it out to spite\nTheir neighbors did theirs and just ... they're going to do one and make it better than right in their neighbors yeah there we know is keeping up with the Jones and I've gotten to the point where now we're just going to keep up with everything and it's like\nSomebody comes in and you're you're a master bathrooms not very good angle completely erratic agree with you I don't feel like making it updated ... says since we're talking about kitchens I thought I came across as

W.\nKitchens dot com so the three big things we covered the first of the three big things which is and the question was ah or the the big things the three big things are the questions to ask yourself\nBefore you decide to renovate a not after you've already door out your cabinets and cause then your priorities are going to switch around a little bit but that is the number to a question is what are your priorities\nAnd what I mean by the priorities are I'm Talking about specifically what are the priorities in the kitchen\nOr or the bathroom as well you know I I've done [noise] we live in a three to house up in the long would area\nUm built in Nineteen Seventy six so almost everything needed to be done when we bought the house and we've staged it over the years and we've done practically everything on the inside of the house at this point so\nUm what that's left us with is um I think we have very little to do we haven't really done any other closets\nOr frankly and in the house but uh that's probably the last thing that will do we've done the kitchen and both bathrooms so I'll just give you a for instance in the master bathroom um\nYou know we got to the why why are we going to to do this or that was bad function was outdated I'm just the style of the things uh you know the specific style the colors and the the um just that you know the shapes and styles were just out of 'em\nOut of date so that was the lie in our bathroom or the function was very poor so then we got into what are the priorities and we made ourselves a priority list we literally ... sat down my wife and I and made out of the priority list\nUm based on on the why of we're doing it so that was bad function there was um if you live in one of these houses you know exactly what I mean but\nI'm the vanity area with the sink was open to the bedroom\nSo I'm at the time uh when we when we did this renovation I used to get out much earlier than my wife and brushing my teeth in a vanity [noise] excuse me um\nYou know I turn the light on in the water is running and you know you can hear that right from the bedroom so we wanted to door that off we wanted to put a door on there so that was that was one of the the priority so that went right to the top of the list and all of the associated\nWe'll navigating the closures somebody project\nOn my ... still closed until I heard your\nTraffic

have a ... I asked the question I Try to [noise]\nI said I are trying to get my butt heads the money that I trust right and it's not sure what we need to do how do we start where do we go first\nWill step number one is ... is finding out if I trust is really the right tool for him now people are generally using trust for the purpose of avoiding probate Tammy is that what you have in mind\nYes so tell me we like to use when we can simpler tools for avoiding probate not necessarily a trust me it might start by you or your father to come and meet with us and\nWe talk about what his assets are how many kids the house and think about what kind of a state plane Tuesday might use for him maybe it's a trust maybe at some simple tools [noise]\nOh okay what what is simple that told me\nSo for example is some of us are from the beginning of cows Potter down because we have some background noise going\nSo first of all we're talking about easy ways void probate some kinds of assets don't go through probate like life insurance and retirement accounts annuities anywhere you get the name beneficiaries they're not going through probate than cars vehicles don't go through probate don't worry about those\nThen bank accounts checking savings CDs money markets it's easy to avoid probate on those by making them P. O. D. payable on death to your children\nAnd then for your home we have a great tool for avoiding probate called Lady Bird deed it's a D that we would prepare it would state that as long as you're alive and is your home and do it as you please but when you pass away your home would automatically go to your children no headaches no hassles no probate\nThat process is simpler and less expensive than a living trust as a general rule Tammy now sometimes of trust can be the appropriate tool for voting probate for people\nIf you got a spendthrift child that you don't want him or her to get his share outright when you pass the way you want to do that to them over a number of years or if you want to include your minor grandchildren as beneficiaries of your state\nThose will be good reasons you living trust\nTammy we'd love to help you or off next week that's the ... group in a land do call us at four O. seven for two three five five six one\nLet's go to Peter in Orlando Peter you're on news Ninety six five go ahead\nI'm like yes this is Peter I'm I it's kind of a long story I don't know I don't even know how to start\nWell Peter we don't have time for a long story but I can see it has to do with an online purchase\nExactly uh what happened was in a nutshell I bought something to say the name of a company that I bought out there was no you cannot\nOkay okay so much on the line\nOkay I bought something on line using one of the major retail lead a\nStore I'm from and\nThe bird the item that I bet I purchased a came in from somebody else a defective it can mean damage the box ... how to hold in the uh take hold in the box at the bottom he was state job\nAnd the product inside was damage I contacted a vendor the vendor said that he was my responsibility to send it back on my own cars and they were going to charge me a twenty percent ... feet out told a rainbow that that was not fair that they knew that that Bush was damage and that I needed my my money back the vendors they know\nThat we're not going to a refunding the entire the entire money I contacted the company that I have a credit card from and I told him what happen daily daily from me all my money but it but in the process they're telling me get into the merchandise throw it away\nBut that's not the company's uh you know what I'm saying property it belongs to the vendor so do ...\nDo I get in trouble yeah can I Do come and pick it up\nWell how much would it cost you to ship it back to the vendor\nA lot because this is a fireplace and weights a lot in the ... one to pick it up they wanted me to ship it on my own cost\nSo Peter I cannot recommend that you throw it away without like for you to do is Stuart for a period of time I'd like to make sure that your credit card really does get credited back\nAnd don't forget that they could credit your credit card and then they could yank it back out again so you don't really know that I'd like to think that this has been resolved for you as far as financial but it's still not over with yet so hold on to appear may give it a couple of months to make sure you get your money back on your credit card and then you can think about what to do it that fireplace\nWhat he said don't say what if they don't see anybody to figure out why do I do\nI think eventually it's gonna be yours do with as you please\nOkay is is there any time limit on that\nI don't think So Peter but I just want to make sure that you know you've gotten your money back no ifs ands and got to do I tell you get rid of that fire place\nGot you I drank too much for what\nDo you think ... I think a reasonable time and I also would suggest that maybe he sent a letter to them so that there's also something in writing document exactly what took place and that's and also for the record so he sends it to them and then he has that that for his records\nI think that's very wives so that the letter my bait and might be to the vendor and say look number one I've got my money back so you don't have my money I have your defect a fireplace I'm going to hold a here for sixty days\nFor you to come pick it up you don't get in a sixty days and putting it by the side of the road exactly that might be perfectly reasonable now he may be doing everything by email and that may be how that noticed goes out to the people not necessarily by certified mail\nIt could be either or I'm probably it would be based upon the communication that he's already started with them and so you're right very likely it could be email however I think that I Would probably back it up with a certified also in this situation\nVery good hey the great question Peter and good luck to you on that if folks that opens up all of our lines for your legal questions right now you want to reach us here in uh W.
