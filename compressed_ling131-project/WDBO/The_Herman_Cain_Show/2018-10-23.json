{"month": "10", "state": "FL", "station": "WDBO", "content": "It's like being a salesman you have to always show your handlers that you're doing your job even if you're making it up so they threw he threw an Audi under the bus\nBut ... was arrested a few years after the Hanson takedown of because the Russians believed that he was the one that got the file a for jak Platt when that when we can discuss how how we got it but ... he was framed for terrorism\nOr he was thrown in jail or the Russians then when they couldn't make terrorism charges stare ... they they dusted his clothing and uh his belongings with explosive powder\nThey kept keeping them in jail when he was on the verge of getting out ah they ah put a cell phone in his cell and he also got in a tough situation with the Russian Mob when he was in prison and that's when Robert De Niro came in\nWhy would deniro even take an interest in is how to get exposed to this\nGetting audience jak we're both consultants on the film the good shepherd which is about the spy world that Robert De Niro did and they became friends [noise] after getting out he was arrested in two thousand five jak was panicked because cannot he disappeared off the face of the earth and asked everybody he could for help the CIA\nIs a friendship or his own security he was panic\nBecause he thought his friend got in trouble because of him he felt guilty and the fact is is he wasn't entirely wrong I mean ... and Jack were very flamboyant about their friendship and if I were a Russian\nOperative I might suspect ... two and one of the reasons by the way they suspected ... is one of his jobs in the private sector is he helped to facilitate Russian business people who wanted to come to America and he would help them get passports one of the passports\nApplications that he signed turned out to be\nThe KGB man who ended up giving up the file so even though it wasn't intentional ... had basically as a matter of routine helped signed an application that brought\nThe real KGB guy who had the file to America so Robert Deniro became concerned he asked some Russian director friends where you're not he was in the prison system he found out and then sent ... a Christmas card with a photograph of the two of them together and the Russian Mob boss in prison\nKnown as ... saw this and said Audi\nRobert De Niro and and your friend\nAnd ... he said well you can see the picture and he then he fell under the protection of the Russian Mob and just like\nThat just like they think today or did it on purpose\n[laughter] oh I I I don't think that ... that\nYou know it had that kind of him I don't think\nThat he knew as have that impact but Robert Deniro I mean when it comes to mob films and things like that the Russians watched\nThey love they love it Eric Dezenhall is our guest um he has written the last great spy story of the Cold War was a big assist from Robert De Niro and the big picture I have never seen a ... a I've never seen anything like it where somebody a tries to flip another one that spies and when they don't they become public with their friendship\nThey had you know on some level this is almost this is something they don't even know that if you want to write this some people would say the and it's just not authentic and people who know spies know this would never happen you know that right\nWell you see things in the book that you can't believe I mean there's all through it's all true and there was a there's a scene at the bar where jak who had had an alcohol problem or the CIA guy\nUm ended up in a bar with getting audience some FBI guys and some of them got drunk and they and somebody said to people at the next table hey you know who we are we're CIA this guy's KGB and we're going to get them to spy for us\nI mean you know if you will never again after you read this book believe that CIA and KGB goes through the night and there's a lot of recklessness carelessness drinking women in this book but there's also plenty of sales and not not to mention a lot of accidents\nRite Aid you have to wonder to judging by the way that they that they are trained if they ever really our friends or if they are on some level or are they playing each other let's go really deep and his friendship to the point where the very last minute I tell them I was\nSo he never aboard I I was ...\nWell that was a very astute question because one of the ways to get by getting to know ...\nJak over a forty year period got to know other Russians by getting to know other Russians he was able to stumble upon a situation where it turns out and I won't get into too too much detail because it'll ruin the book\nThere after the fall of the Soviet Union it turned out there was a KGB guy who walked out of the building when everybody was stealing files and he had the file the file on ...\nAnd he grabbed it figuring I could use that some day and it turned out he was right he ended up walking away with about seven million and I think the important thing is is jak played the long game\nHe was right to befriend Russians and one of the catch twenty two sides of the spy world is you're told to get close to the enemy and if you fail well you're you're a failure if you succeed hey Brian what are you doing hanging around the enemy\nSo you can't win but jak you know the Russians are known for playing the long game the Americans just like an American corporations are in your media world ratings what have you done what are they up to date today today jak played a long game and he was asked ones\nDo you really think is what friends do putting other friends in situations where they could get into trouble and Jack said no but it's what good intelligence agents do\nRight and what's more important and Leslie or do you look at this to be a movie\nIt has been optioned for film um and we hope it will be a movie or it's one of those things you can't really make up and be one of the lines of that uh that we have in the book is that it is the job of the CIA to break the laws of the country where it's operating which is true for Russia to end in this day and age where we're all talking\nAbout spying this book is about human intelligence and what spies do when they get up in the\nMorning I get Audi is where ... living in the United states keeps a low profile but he's not in hiding a there is some concern because he was dropped in two thousand pen with among other people's Sergei Skripal who was poisoned in Russia or a few months ago I in England I'm Sorry I Would\nHope they wouldn't try that here but who knows today\nWell there you know the Russians are ruthless or they don't have the scrutiny that the CIA does they don't have the Senate if they don't have the media they do what they want to do right ah well\nCongratulations I find it a story of Robert De Niro trust you with the story and then bring it out the less raised by sort of the Cold War\nEra as a whole has made it happen Terry ... thanks very much Brian\nHi folks measured mechanics\nBefore with clean that he was always my parents' dream for me to go to college and to the day one

there they'll find a very very close situation in a maybe a handful of votes determining whether Democrats getting control of the house\nReally Bernie Sanders maybe he's low balling it or trying to motivate people I Am not sure maybe he's right on the money because so many others agree with him midterms two weeks away in a show of hands how many believed there'll be a blue wave\nNobody didn't think so those days are done but what can we expect into Tuesday's two presidents do it out from stage just age hoping for different results well mocking each other's record\nSure let's bring civility back see how that goes but I took about two presidents I'm not talking about Bush and Clinton I'm Talking about Obama and Trump man you have to believe they legitimately hate each other the president's been relentless on Obama and the bottom of been relentless on Trump\nAnd yesterday Brock Obama was in true for\nI'm not sure what he can do in terms of getting people to vote for anybody but him\nIf you look at the record he's lost more seats than almost any modern politician for his party when you look at the record he barely did any fundraising for his own party the DNC they were buried in debt went down to Brazil took over and she will tell you that his fund raisers wants to his superPAC not to his super party\nSo when he decides to take his case his charisma and he's got a lot of it\nOr to the people even if it sounds good I'm not sure anybody's listening but it's pretty clear that this was about Brock Obama evidently he mentioned I may be over three hundred times really\nAren't you supposed to be there for other candidates cut sixteen\nSo by the\nOn insurance rate was falling\nAnd that's what I often\nTalk about economic miracles right now\nIt okay oh no doubt about the economy was in trouble no doubt about it all I had to do with the Democratic Congress it all started back in Nineteen Seventy two it was that reigned in by Bill Clinton and George Bush didn't have the power to do it maybe\nCould have found a way it went to the American people had a big speech and said Barney Frank is full of at Fannie and Freddie orange fine we're over leveraged in what Wall Street and then they would say what kind of Republican president metals in free enterprise but having said that he\nGot a hundred billion dollars almost a trillion too infused into us a call our economy for shovel ready projects that didn't exist he got\nTarp money to rebuild the auto industry which President Bush\nAnd they go with him on to make sure he was okay with that policy and still the recovery was anemic pilot economic super mine's debated over rock Obama to take credit for Trump's first two years and blame Bush for his first six years is really takes a tremendous amount of our destiny\nEven for a guy that wrote a book with our destiny in the title\nCut a T here's one from\n\nOne point five trillion dollars\nWas not done or you may didn't even pretend to pay for\n[noise] [noise]\n[noise] oh let's talk about the bonuses that came out of that of course he's talking about corporate tax rate that wasn't competitive internationally\nIt was a thirty five percent now it's knocked down to twenty percent because of that a lot of people got hired because of that a lot of people got bonuses because of that a lot of industry spread out and took chances are bought companies went to real tourist expanded their businesses but bigger places or one internationally and are beginning just now even though we should have happened earlier\nTo repatriate their funds because no longer will they be penalized for doing so you don't need the Cayman Islands or Switzerland if the U.S is getting more in line with what Ireland is doing but not quite that good and for those who say that President Trump doesn't tell the truth\nWell one of them is Brock Obama this is the president just make stuff up cutting Nineteen\nUnlike some ads really trying to say\nBelieve in a fact based reality\nThey call a ... [noise] I don't\nBelieve in just making stuff up there was actually say to people what's true\nRight and I appreciate that and I appreciate your charisma and your confidence on stage I was wondering if you thought this was true President Obama cut twenty\nIf you're white your doctor you keep your doctor like your current insurance you keep that in Trump's\nPeriod right or the problem was you couldn't and you didn't\nNow were you screaming get on stage where he'd being flamboyant when he did it where you mocking reporter afterwards now to your credit but the president says things sometimes they don't turn out it doesn't mean he was lying remember this cut Twenty one\nA red wine for us is we start saying a whole bunch of chemical weapons moving around for your loss that will change my calculus\nRight or they were moved around and they were utilized nothing changed\nYou punted it to Congress and one golfing you foresee that President Trump so remember you know I Believe in fact based reality well you say it like a professor it seems like you mean it but it turns out you didn't do it\nLet's move on and talk about President Obama and what he thought the economy was capable of doing after all this president promised four percent growth and we're right there cut twenty two\nWhen somebody says\nHe's going to bring all their jobs back\nHow exactly are we going to do what are you going to do\nHit a says while I'm ... I'm going to negotiate a better deal well how\n... how exactly argue wants to negotiate\nAn apology letter Kwon do you have\nYour answers\nYou're going to have an answer right a movie had is he's got to cut regulation\nHe's got to cut taxes and together along with giving the ... the message to the rest of the world's going to restructure trade deals people are feeling confident although the market's down today\nIt's still exceedingly high so you didn't need a magic wand and it turns out his policies did work so may be mocking President Trump is somebody who just make things up is not right let's move forward\nOr another prediction for Brock Obama that the dot com crew member of the state's facts got twenty three\nI continue to believe Mr Trump will not be present and the reason is because I have a lot of faith ... and I think they recognize that President ...\nOkay keep in mind Mr President in terms of a record which no one calls you out on during your time you lost the house she lost the Senate you lost almost every governorship he lost thousands of seats in state houses literally thousands\nAnd in the end the president's he went to the other party even though you had your former secretary of state representing you which would have been more of the same but I'm not done yet because the president always tells the truth he believes in a fact based reality if you still believe that maybe this will put the nail on that cough and cut twenty four\nI saw as a direct outgrowth of our ... in Iraq that grew out of our invasion\nWhich is an example of unintended consequences which is why we should generally\nHave before we had it in a magazine he said when asked about an insurgency there's rising up in Iraq he says I'm not worried about it you can put a Laker Jersey on somebody doesn't mean they're Kobe Bryant\nTurns out ISIS was every bit as lethal as al ... and it's run and they're still out there and just as brutal and it was Americans getting decapitated afterwards he made a speech and then immediately went golfing can you imagine if our president the current president did just that today\nPlease just know this\nThe double standard and the mocking that take place on the hill\nPresident Bush President Clinton President Carter President Reagan\nWould go ahead and attack his opponent but the constant mocking when he was a candidate and the mocking now with an economic record that he had with a reinvigorated defense to renegotiate trade deals takes a lot of detachment from reality and hope spot\nUh so that's how he feels but if you're going to CNN to get a fair balance look you might want to keep flipping Daniel Day I was on that same channel where he's with the Toronto Star fact checker he goes through what he claims of Donald Trump's allies last week touch with the\nFact check every word his bad for the last two years I don't know if I'd heard more false claim this week that he has in any previous week\nWhat something magnitude and the complete a fabrication that he was doing\nIn different so there are a week working you know exaggerated the trade deficit or to or have exaggerated the crowd size or to what you're doing this week it took making things up [laughter] actually about immigration especially about health care but also a lot of you it's also about tax cuts and strategy seems to be\nYou know why as much as possible just flooded his own with nonsense and hope it gets it gets picked up by enough media that it'll work for\nMark associate W.

I don't know why he would go there and why they wouldn't show all evidence um but the president is sending Gina Haspel the CIA director over and that's clearly I think what's going to be on the table as what evidence do you actually have\nNo there's no doubt the Saudis have admitted to right there's no doubt that that uh Jamal was murdered clearly quite brutally or in the in the conflict the question is is how far up the food chain did it go\nI Would note to think of significance happen in Saudi Arabia over the past few days one the eye of conferences today that's the big international conference ... pulled out of secretary of the nation\nOr the New York times is reporting that uh the crown prince who many have accused of knowing about this pot went into the conference received a standing ovation over three thousand people their\nNumber two over the weekend the king ah reaffirmed the crown prince says I'm authority over the intelligence agencies there's two intelligence agencies my ... which is like sort of similar to the FBI\nAnd G. I. T. which is more comparable to our version of the CIA\nAnd the and the king reaffirmed his son's authority over the intelligence agencies I actually thought that that might have been something that they would strip away given all of that so I see the kingdom doubling down on the crown prince standing behind him and and so no matter what happens it's clear to me now but it will not let the crown prince be blame her\nKey is enjoying this way too much there were only regime that kills journalists over two\nHundred journalists jail right now and then there are no way that they're all\nI mean what are interacting why the or they could never understand this behavior when they basically wrote a book on this behavior and the liver his opponent when he was running for reelection was in jail had to run their head they're on their campaign from jail\nSo the cameras there they must have gotten tipped off there's going to be targeted now he gives a speech in the morning about this outrageous killing\nSo knowing the turkey benefits so much for the spring of Saudi American relations should I keep that in mind at all as a wait for the results\nAbsolutely I trust the Turks as far as I can throw them\nAnd I think that first of all full stop with the Saudis did was wrong or as the foreign minister said it's a terrible tragedy right there there is there is no excusing what happened to their behavior\nThing that I think they were getting to a much larger question is which is how do we treat these regimes turkey a NATO ally has over two hundred journalists as we just sat in jail and they're you know I mean give me a break there's no way all two hundred of those people are still alive\nSo do the same questions that that many people are asking about Saturday I think you have to ask about turkey you know do you people are saying should we do business with Saudi should we sell arms to Saudi well the ... the Turks have decided the Russians they have the side of the Iranians they jailed dissidents they jailed journalists why are they in NATO or\nHave no idea whether NATO it might be George vantage totally somebody there but why would we tell him everything because they have access to her intelligence apparatus so the Turkish president had his speech today\nIt doesn't take away the fact that the crown prince and this out as you told me you work there\nThey seem to know why China seems to understand America go out of their way to understand what our issues are Saudi Arabia so ingrained in American business in American politics\nThey thought I thought they were the one of these countries as despicable as their system is in ... and we can grow up or hedge around here to to understand what would fly in what wouldn't why would they think this would be okay how could they miss a cat miss calculates so much have you put wrap your head around that\nA little bit yes if you look over what's happened over the past two years when you have this young leader and B. S. so I Would say that I'd spoken very highly of publicly right and then I had been very pro his the reforms that he was pushing in Saudi Arabia on the economy on women you know a number of things that I thought were were crucial for the future Saturday\nYou've seen the Lebanese prime minister um you know essentially jailed and Saturday you've seen a complete blockade of Qatar you've seen a disastrous war in Yemen which you know again the Iranians are are behind and fomenting with the face but you're you're still seeing it ah you're saying\nCut off relations with Canada you saw the the members of the royal family are jailed in and the Ritz as much as we sort of poke fun of it\nSo this this young girl as had a lot of hubris over the past two years and he's\nA lead with impunity and he's taken a lot of actions that you had never seen before in Saudi Government history because you had older wiser rulers now that came with a series of setbacks as well like with the older crowd there were way way way too delayed on reforms\nBut but but I think that um you know this that whoever is you know the the Saudi is not going to claim the crown prince didn't find that the people around him did okay whatever clearly the people around him did not understand the United states did not understand our value system\nAnd I think the gamble is that they can pretty much get away with whatever they wanted because we were more interested in two things one the the public pressure campaign to get the Iranians and to be a peace deal that Jared was working on with a between Israelis and the Palestinians in which reportedly said he was being helpful\nJericho she gave an interview yesterday with CNN\nAnd that which time there's one of the stories that they think is under reported\nSaudi Arabia is making great progress earning trust he used an orthodox Jewish American men right and he's dealing with the Saudi Arabians who weren't known to be very open to the ah the

they are ... are starting to realize now is that this moment in time what has happened is another incredibly dark period of history took ... years of relationship building and I was a part of that it

well come on the on a Tuesday\nOr you want to defer a schedule\nI'm In Guatemala City right now I spent the day yesterday along the ... border\nSo it it it's been definitely an eye opener and uh you know as I've been telling people you really have to be here to understand what's happening you can't\nReport on that uh from the sidelines or in the U.S to get the ... the information that we're receiving Israeli sporadic it's not a whole it's not complete a you know when I came down here you know we see a lot of pictures of women and children over and over again\nIn the media mostly coming from\nLocal media here which is very very liberal remember there's a there's a lot of conflict here I'm politically between the governments are\nParticularly between conservatives and social it's a political parties and so a lot of the media that we're seeing it you know women and children when the children I got down here I'm On the border and I get you some women and children that were at\nThe head of this over Fifteen hundred\nOutlined in a second wave that maybe its way through a lot of all it's an exit go to the Mexican border and but they were very small numbers they were at the front of the line when I went toward the back end which was the biggest part of the group that was coming through over a thousand it was meant all men not one woman not one child one guy had a baby stroller\nIt's like okay I found a baby and I ran over to him and I realized that stroller with just filled with his articles of clothing and some water and stuff that he was pushing through 'em so it's it's very different when you're on the ground here\nSo who's financing this who's paying for the food was paying for the clothes so\nLet me let me see this very clearly there are people investigating that right now both in Guatemala government also at the U.S government is looking at that uh the people that were marching in the line all the men that I was talking to you that were coming straight through actually they push their way through the ... border uh\nThey basically would not talk about who paid for them how they were organize it wasn't until I got some guys away from the big group you you could see the ... group leaders there were people coordinating them walking with them telling them what to say they had\nA you know the hundred flag in front of them that they were coming through uh there were people saying don't talk to the reporters come this way that way I said well you obviously have a leader in that group and people would say no no no we don't have a leader world one uh the Spanish they say you know this is a this is a\n[noise] a caravan of poverty a caravan of poverty we're moving through were making a statement ah we were not hey you know it was\nAnd I said well I didn't ask you if you were paid ah that's interesting where you paid because I hadn't gone to that question yet and some of them just stopped and looked at me wasn't until I got a few guys\nAway from the line further down um that they they said you know well we heard from our friends that we were told to come down here at that but they would let us aid to the United states um that we got food ah some people took buses\nAnd that's something that being investigated right now uh by step toward toward the the main character and I guess if you want to say a of of the line I'm so some of them did have buses that brought up there I was looking for you know malnourished men I'd write about this a\nStruggling to survive flip flops I didn't see any of that I saw coordination very well coordinated effort\nA march uh some brand new backpack that people had a they all if you're wearing tennis shoes that um some appeared to be new some appeared to be old or so they were definitely coordinated they were moving through and\nThey were very unified in and how they were doing it I talked to some of the intelligence officials here ... who have people within\nThe group's monitoring what's going on trying to gather information as well I'm In cooperation with the United states are and what they were saying was look a lot of these people that looks it appears and from what I've been hearing that they gathered ... villages certain areas in ... and said okay you guys were all marching towards\nYou know the Mexican border going towards the United states who's going to join us\nUm whether there was money exchanging hands I'm not aware\nOf but there are a couple of questions I Know you might not have the answers this why now why organized in a big march water they think the greater numbers won't cause havoc here\nThe tension that they've gotten by getting seven thousand strong will cause nothing but eggs in America and if they truly planned on blending in and good coming here for a better opportunity why does this work for them\nThis is political this is political both in the Central American countries where one of the things we do know and and this is the information that I was gathering\nFrom uh the the intelligence apparatus here while I was in Guatemala is a very strong political opposition to conservative leaders here in Central America a\nThere was also remember a lot of there was a lot of coordination here under the Obama administration a lot of that stuff with the court on a lot of these leaders ah that especially in the socialist groups out here we are very well connected with people that were in the state department with people at the un\nUnited Nation there's been a lot of talk of that about interference grim holdovers that are still in the United\nStates so it appears to be a very politically coordinated effort to dry attention to the U.S election I'm ... and you know this is what makes these subjects so complicated because not only does it serve a purpose for leadership here especially opposition groups opposition groups in Honduras opposition groups of Guatemala who are against\nThe government here but also it provides fodder for U.S officials right for us election and bringing people in just beforehand this was not an accident that was it um a grass roots uprising for no reason um this was very well coordinated with the intention of doing this right around the U.S election so people should be very well aware of it\nAnd this is something that's being looked into um there were some issues I'm here at the Guatemalan border apparently like when they first came through and they push the\nFirst part of the wave came through and they rushed through what the second group um apparently a child was that because women were way in the front of the line uh apparently a child died in the trampling\nWhen they came first through a one of the things that the government did was try to find out where this child the baby or where the body was people had heard obviously because they have intelligence personnel within the groups that this baby was buried somewhere and the reason I bring that up is because that could be a reason to charge\nSomebody that was organizing this event with manslaughter order charges I'm here in Central America that that to be a significant because they do know that there are people that are coordinating these efforts and we also have to think about the people that they're recruiting these are people from villages\nMaybe even jumped out at some of the prison like we saw it you know with the Cuban ... yup so they think some of these men may have been taken out of the prison and said you know joined us march it had their your green now but you got to do that\nSo and and whether they're poverty stricken and coming from the village is they're they're being used they're being used for political purposes and I think when you think of it that way and you think of what's heading towards the southern border you have to be very very concerned about what's going on because once seven thousand reaches\nThe U.S southern border what are we going to do about it obviously the Mexican government isn't turning back enough of them the Guatemalan government doesn't have the resources to push them back\nThey said there were more behind this second wave that are coming through what is the United states going to do about this when all these people reached that border are we going to stand firm\nI don't know if we're if we're both have you seen other people from other nations from Central Americans from Central America\nSay yes there there it will from Central America we've seen Venezuela there were Cubans in the group actually that that we're in this group that were apprehended by Guatemalans um apparently eleven\nCubans were in the group that I was with um that I was at a there's also people from other parts of the world um\nThey have captured some people from ... from Congo uh other other nation states Sri Lanka India maybe pockets done um those people those are the ones that they just\nNoticed or were informed of because of the intelligence apparatus on the ground that they were able to take into custody and then a report that to western allies like the United states or Israel actually is interested in some of these people apparently according to the intelligence officials that I've talked to so we have\nTo understand that this is not all on during that there are people slipping into this caravan that are pretending to be one thing but our somebody else\nAltogether so arid yeah whether you're going to be using the Guatemalan president surely you're going to be interviewed him\nYeah yeah I Will be interviewing president morale is up later today at\nThat will be meeting with uh the head of their defense apparatus here in uh in Guatemala later today so I Try to gather as much information as they can and see if we can't trace back the funding for that because I think that's the biggest question that everyone has who paid for this how has this coordinated and who are they connected to\nHopefully I'll get the answers to some of that and we'll see you tomorrow in Fox and friends like understand [noise] yeah I'm looking forward to it All right thanks Erik Autor doing sort of workers or to America it's not all about Russia
