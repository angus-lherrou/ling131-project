of dragging me along but that's fine but a lot of people\nAre saying apple that's for another time ah so how do you feel about Eric Holder saying what he what he said in fact let's listen to his entire remarks he clearly is running for president seemed kind of an odd place right South Carolina but cut one\nHe just time for us as Democrats to be as they are dedicated to the army and committed his\nFamily says you know when they go low we go low we [noise]\nThat was his new democratic already\nI should say Georgia what's your response to that I\nThink it's fine it look he wasn't calling for violence there have been some people I'm troubled by uh some of the things Maxine Waters is sad and the idea of confronting people and restaurants or whatever but I think he was he was simply saying he was he said we got to be as tough as they are\nA and he was basically saying the Republicans about top does they they whip this and the\nTwo thousand sixteen election and he was saying I Want to I Want us to fight back up there is a real\nFight inside a the Democratic party has been very interesting to see these this primary season which will begin to to remember some of the day after the midterms for who's going to be the Democratic presidential candidate because I think there's going to be a big move to try to if not out Trump Trump at least to to be on an even playing field with Trump\nAnd to be as tough as Trump is to be as sharp and\nUh you know ... up your base as Trump is so so I I there are some things that Democrats have done that troubled me I think he was just basically saying you know if they punch us we're going to punch back where does the president says cut by\nTheir cannot be liberal with a political party that wants to try what you found for what you

she helps the Democrats at all I don't think that's called the violence by any means it isn't like what Maxine Waters did but I don't know that helps Democrats particularly I don't know that she\nYeah she did have obviously millions of supporters would probably still does but I don't know the tree particularly helps Democrats if\nYou take those two things Jonah to okay maybe Chris falls to the point but if you look at what's going on with Christian Nielsen with a Ted Cruz with Sarah Huckabee Sanders with every senator who happened to be walking the halls and most likely to vote for break capital or had made up their mind yet have you say that collectively\nDo you wonder why some people are getting concerned let's say like a like others in Washington about their safety\n[noise] well yeah I asked to Mitch McConnell about those last week and he didn't want to talk about a particular like I said I don't talk about security matters which probably is smart on his part but I there were certainly things that I saw on Capitol Hill last week during the the hearings during the vote on it I Know it's quite extraordinary\nThat to to see but I'm just looking up at the TV screen and it says Donald J\nFrom President of the United states on Fox it was he the president on Fox and friends this morning for forty seven minutes [laughter]\n[noise] anyway to bother you well I mean I'm happy for you I have in the fact that I haven't had a single interview with him since I since he became president bothers me yeah\nAt the fact that a Libyan knows it you know who you know we're living in those areas now obviously Olympian now so you you should read this is a reporter for New York magazine when's the last time they were fair to Donald Trump she ended up spending half an hour in the oval office with Donald Trump\nJohn Kelly a Mike Pompeo Mike Pence bill shine Sarah Huckabee Sanders\nI dunno I dunno it's very I I'm you know what I Would say how to act sad [laughter]\nI think you've got a few big interviews all the way I think you've got to be OK well say Kanye West is having lunch with Jim Brown and the president today again and he gets in and I was ... west ... I I don't get an interview with the president but I I don't know right and you're worried about being to Chris Wallace centric\nI if I played that open on your television show and now everyone now how whiny whatever and uh and begging for an interview that's all he raised ... someone you've probably doesn't hurt obscene and contributor Kanye West going to the White House cut twenty two\nNow the sudden ... because he's proud of that hats and he's an attention more like the president he's all of a sudden now that that the model spokesperson ... he's the ... of that of the ... minutes facing\nThis is ridiculous and no one should be taken seriously he clearly has already been hospitalized now and that the trivialize mental health here but I mean obviously ... has taken a turn in a very strange way you have a problem with that\n[noise] um\nWell I I I just put it this way I I don't think on the west is a major spokesmen for African Americans but on the other hand he has supported the president and he is a\nCultural figure out of the president wants to have lunch with them or jump around that's fine I don't think that they represent the majority opinion in the African American community but\nFor a while I Will say well I can negro that's okay I I find that a objectionable I Will say this that when you look at what the president has done in terms of jumpstart the economy yeah that the unemployment rate for African Americans for\nHispanics for young\nA minority people are at the you know historical near historic lows so I mean there's no question that the general a rising economy has benefited a lot of minorities as well I Would think\nSo and I think it's okay to me with the president inaccurate ridiculed also when it comes to mental health\nThere's a lot of very productive people who might have be bipolar or have chronic depression and you're trying to tell me what I'm trying to say is why it's OK mocking somebody because of their race and your mocking someone because of the mental health I never I never saw it and this was on their entire panel last night why is this acceptable ...\nYou gotta have something mentally wrong with you and yet there isn't a condition if you want to have lunch with the president I never heard of this\nI've I've become one I did these aren't things worth getting outraged really\nI was about ... somebody criticizing ... west\nI don't know I don't mind we can do but we can do better than that I read the kid and I think we can I mean look\nThere are serious issues here I think that that you know the president has done very very well on the economy uh I think that's a serious issue I think health care which is the number one issue for Democrats I was astonished to see the number of the percentage of of democratic ads\nThat are raising questions about about health care and pre existing conditions and whether those are in jeopardy\nThose are important I mean those are important issues I mean I'm not I'm not trying to tell you what to cover enough to cover but I don't care about Kanye West one way or the he wants to have lunch with President find press wants to have lunch with them find where's my interview that's what I care so I'll Try this got ... Harris does not want to let the Brett Kavanaugh\nHearings go as so in the FBI Director shows up to talk about terror she talks about this twenty five\nAnd like to talk with you about the the Kevin I\n... it anyone in your age and save save any direction that the ... the investigation directly from down again do you know who determine that the FBI would not interview cat cafe now are Dr Ford or the list to forty percent [laughter] [noise]\nShe thinks is a campaign issue\nWell ... okay so now there are two issues there one is do I have any problem with a Kamala Harris asking him about that no I don't I mean it's routine you can say it's good or bad but it's routine when officials testify before a congressional committees they don't always\nGet asked by the senators and this is true of both parties about the quote subject of the hearing they can ask them anything they want\nSo I don't have any problem with Kamala Harris asking that having said that I think the idea that Brett Kavanaugh\nThat this was a cover up I mean the fact of the matter was there was only one really credible charge against\nOr you could say too I mean I think the sweat next door he was obviously ridiculous on its you know I I Love the fact that she claims that she went to multiple parties which women were gang rep I don't know after two or three wouldn't you think this is working for me I'm Sorry yes parties anymore so let let's talk about the two cases you know you have the ... the woman at Yale and you add Christine Blasey Ford\nAnd they interviewed people on both and they could find a zero backup for that so I understand it's an issue and that's that's fine I mean if Democrats want to make it an issue but the idea that somehow\nA there was a cover up and that it wasn't investigating I mean really they thought that this should the twenty more people should be interviewed they interviewed nine and got a written statement from another one it seems to me it's it was clear\nThere was zero evidence that the Brett Kavanaugh zero backup for Christine bloods ... story and in fact that that raises another question for me if Christine Blasey Ford was going to come out and do this in front of the country wouldn't you think\nAnd get tickets for that and again with that you get Andrew Jackson American rulings on paper back and then on the twenty first of the city want

he says a massive operation is now underway wrote clearing making way for first responders utility supplied thirty\nFive hundred for the national guard with more than one thousand high water because Thirteen helicopters and sixteen boats for humanitarian assistance security operations and search and rescue he's\nHow the hearings went and the kind of questions that you were just staring before I came on\nI Want to get to ... she'll get but you were bringing absurd such great points here I Want you to hear what Jeff Flake said on sixty minutes or when he made the St Louis and when he made the movie ... made a lot of people doubt it I said what's going on here it's going to be a week of chaos and it was but I think it helped everything in the long run\nHere's what he said when asked what do you have done this if he was staying in politics\nSenator Flake you've announced which are not running for reelection and I wonder could you have done this if you were running around a track or not a chance\nBecause politics has become too sharp ... there was no value to reaching across the aisle there's no currency for that anymore there's no incentive\nWas it ever different for you Bob Corker do you agree with that statement\n[noise] you know Brian I told people when I ran back in two thousand six that I was going to serve two terms and I'm\nNo doubt I'm you know when you get right actually\nAnnounced you're not going to run your staff tries to convince you otherwise people are close to try to convince you otherwise but I really felt the entire time that I've been here that I was a hundred percent independent because I never thought I was going to run for a third term ever [noise]\nAnd um and I mean there was a moment in time thirty days when I went through extreme\nOr you know thoughts about maybe considering it I've still got to be chairman of Foreign Relations committee for another couple of years so you know we have term limits [noise] but even after my even during my first term I candidly I was never\nStraw going to run for a second term so for twelve years up here I felt like a one hundred percent free agent just to call things like I say I'm and I'm really\nGlad to be leaving the Senate and the uh many in the manner that I've served\nThat I've been able to be a free agent but there's no question that things have consolidated up here\nUm I've done all kinds of by I haven't there's nothing we've done in foreign policy that doesn't start bipartisan in my committee chairman saying we do is bipartisan but looked out outlook I've worked on some of the most controversial issues around\nHere every controversial issue actually and I've been working ... ... with those in a bipartisan way\nBut I think there is some truth to to the fact that both sides have gotten more travel [noise] um and there's less of that occurring and what I Hope for our country is that after these midterms are over and a President Trump still has two years in his first term\nI Hope that somehow or another a much of that will be put away and we'd get about solving the problems that we still have not\nSolved so I knew I actually got word that you ... your booked on the show during our show about this while I was we were talking to the president we talked about forty five minutes on Fox and friends today kind of extraordinary and we brought this up\nAnd I I don't want to pay the ... but I don't want to take a minute fifty one away from you but so I just wanted acted out the seventeenth ... with the exchange about the disappearance of juvenile cause Yogi Saturday born but a contributor and columnist with the Washington Post who disappeared as you went into the\nUh the embassy in Turkey the Saudi embassy in Turkey let's listen\nTo kill you can be killing everything else there is in jeopardy now I could relate to\nWhat happened when I go out and we're probably getting closer than you might think but I have to find out what would happen\nAnd there's widespread reports that he was brought into teams Saturday teams are Fifteen and they were going to have a ring dishing taken mountains something went wrong and he's dead have you heard that\n[noise] because I've read then tell 'em let me this woman and you know we have to be careful about what a ... and I've read a lot of stuff and open source reporting and I think that the reporters\nAnd you and others who who report on these things have generally\nGot a pretty good picture but but look they that I've talked to the ambassador immediately when he went missing and the ambassador told me that their video cameras only live stream they don't record which is ridiculous\nBe the case [noise] um and uh so obviously you began with your antenna way up when somebody gives you a ridiculous\nResponse like that I've read Dan tell 'em and I would just say this Brian I'm a hole that I Am not right and I hope that somehow or another he is produced as a live human being some place [noise] but I absolutely believe the Saudis murdered him\n[noise] and ah and I believe that uh it's something that a ...\nYou know possibly went to the highest levels and if that's the case ah I Hope it's not a hope that he's alive I Hope that he returns to to the United states [noise] uh and ended up marrying the his fiance who's desperately waiting to see any sign of him um I think it's gonna hugely alter our relationship\nA pan as you know uh the entire Foreign Relations committee it only takes myself and Menendez ranking member but everybody on the committee minus one person who generally is an outlier\nPlus Graham and lay he fund our foreign ops operations through appropriations signed a letter invoking what's called the global Magnitsky Act\nAnd what that does is forced administration over the next hundred and twenty day to do an in depth investigation and to put sanctions in place if they find that they actually did it we actually\nAre added language to ensure that they looked at the very highest levels of the Saudi regime and uh this is this as many have said Brian is gonna really\nAlter our relationship with them if they in fact are carrying out the same kinds of things that Russia is dying and that is killing citizens and other countries\nAre like it appears Saudi may have done to an American citizen or in Turkey now the president's wise not to jump to conclusions um state are you what I think has happened today I Hope I'm convinced wrong um [noise] but uh this is this'll be serious not just for them\nKilling a human being not for their family not just for their family this kind of a big impact on chip geopolitics in the middle east\nFeel they felt like they were shut out by the Obama years they felt like there have been ignored he has he tried to cut the deal with Iran the the Iranian agreement and remember they felt personally are printed when Mubarak was allowed to be outside and they they kind of held\nTheir you stop me from ruin your chairman of Foreign Relations they kind of help President Obama responsible for not staying up standing up for a long time ally as he was overthrown and then when President Trump came in he decided as to how we should side with our traditional ally Saudi Arabia despite all the controversies\nThe alternative is not to go back to Iran\nBecause if you read the Saudi Arabia sided America's Best interests to leave all the Sunni sections of the middle east out we don't want to turn Yemen over to the who the rebels supported by the Iranians because of this well we could be a murder of that Americans\nAre a naturalized American citizen so what do we do what's the right thing to do\n[noise] well the first thing to do of course is to to let this uh you know play out over the next short period\nOf time unless let's get additional facts and let's see if we can figure out exactly what has happened not what we think as happened but to to know what has happened to um look they they they still are going to be a country as you know it's very wealthy they have a you know they've had we've had an alliance with them but\nLook it's a it's going to be hugely damaged and uh I Know that Congress there at the lowest point\nWith Congress that they've ever ban since I've been hearing them I've been up by the way of\nA friend of Saudi Arabia is okay I've tried I've tried to kick keep a arms sales from\nBeing blocked by Congress and have been successful up until this point I Would not be successful in that on the floor to die and I I don't know that I Would even attempt\nTo be successful I probably am now moving in another direction with them but look we we we still going to have to have a relationship we've got relationship with other countries that\nI'm On certain things that we disagree with strongly and so you know look\n... NATO ally and yet we got significant conflicts with them and northern Syria so\nSo ah it just will change the relationship the warmth all dissipate uh it'll be far more businesslike and certainly there are going to be put at at arm's length on many issues that we deal with them all and there's an arrogance that has developed\nWith them over the last year and a half a an entitlement there's just something about the way they\nDeal with us now that is very very different you got this young leader whose buck phenomenal from the standpoint of his vision and intelligence on talking about the ... I mean what he wants to do in Saudi Arabia\nBrian as you know is is nothing short of breath taking in a\nPositive way but if you don't nip it in the bud you know we know that torture chamber set up and and the Ritz Carlton he's consolidated power power he's arrested his own family but if you don't nip and the but the fact that you can't go around the world killing\nAmerican citizens then who knows where next they go so we got to have\nA very serious response to this and nip it now he can be around for another forty or fifty years\nOkay Michael downgraded now right now the storm is thirty
