reasons for her to leave that sound rational and reasonable but it was something about the timing something about the resignation letter holding it oh there's a lot of things that just seems strange especially that she told her staff just yesterday morning\nShe asked him about what what is the first time maybe they kept a secret on anything and no one's for opposite in or out of that\nYeah I've just starting to believe all the I guess the staff was in the dark bump a it was in the dark Madison bolt and what is your best speculation of what went wrong some are saying that both in and she had clashed others say that she just uh you know she's not is one of those jobs are just burn you out\n[noise] oh I think it can be so many things at once I mean there are reports that she's a machine or a husband or\nAbout a million dollars in debt and um there are\nUm obviously they don't need to be any reports to know that there is a very intense and draining job\nUm [noise] you have to pick up a you have to pick a time to leave when the world's not exploding\nOr the you know you just have lost the terms mean she's trying to pick a quiet week we you know we hear rumors about man is getting ready to leave a December he too is going to try to pick a quiet time and say it was a two year mark but certainly there are conflicting agendas within the team all we have an impact on people's\nFrustration level and um it you know there's there's a lot of kind of quiet talk\nAbout whether or not we're looking we're heading towards a confrontation with the Iranian regime and there's a lot of internal a debate about that and I can't say for sure that that was a reason but if she was having trouble with Bolton and palm pale and had reached the two year mark and was tired\nUm you know and was just trying to pick a non explosive Newsday chili maybe that was the reason but she also submitted her letter of the morning after the president made fun of a doctor for the last week and um [noise] that's interesting communist walk because she spoke and those kinds of issues before\nSo the president's got an unorthodox way of connecting for relations but for the most part outside of pushing back on Larry Kudlow saying that she was confusing she pushed back effectively and Kudlow apologize\nThey've been pretty much on the same page and I asked her in Studio a couple of weeks ago when the whole world came here I said well you know when\nBefore the whole segment started go where do you think she was a key with me was I have direct access to him and that was part of the deal national security council I'm a member and I could call them at any time so we talk things out\nAnd the thing about him he actually listens and I to me even though she was pro Rubio an anti Trump for a while she seemed to have gotten on board listen to what she said about the president's policies cuts Evan\nCat one half of the United states on foreign policy now the United states\nI said\nIf we say we're going to do something we fall for that whether it was the chemical weapons in Syria whether it was saying that our country to pay their share of whether the main thing and they call it\nDo you agree with their assessment\n[noise] I Do know that Nikki Haley kept very close just for the president or from day one on her job helps her job to job more easily and then also help the president you know have to help regain the trust that\nThe president and I believe she believes everything she said yesterday Ryan I'm just not sure that that precludes tensions with other people and conflicting agendas from um you know making you decided it's time to quit just because you have access to President Trump doesn't mean\nThat something he agrees with you on at nine AM it's still true to thirty PM a lot of people have access to President Trump\nAnd there's a lot of 'em in any administration as we know in any administration healthy\nBates lots of dissent disagreements constructive we just don't know how much of a factor that played into\nIt I mean we know too like for example the Bush administration Powell and Rumsfeld ah what we're fighting all the time they didn't agree the president forty three ah he was always referee between them we know that are going to\nBomb at five secretaries of defense yeah I mean these things happen you know but but it is a is a\nUm like I said I think it's probably a bunch of reasons just the way that she did it was so strange you know her her statements were so calibrated so filled with intent all this stuff about ... and it was just ... it was just incredibly um it was almost Hillary like in its level of calibration\nI thought by so let's talk about possible replacements are people saying Dina power recruit ... I I thought Joe Lieberman might be a viable option Ryan Zinke he\nAh I Know the president probably wants to keep a woman in there they have very little diversity is not enough women or perhaps according to some including to the president he said that other people who do you think could front runner right now\nWell I guess I mean listen he's fond of Powell she left without a blemish quietly and effectively served um as one of the least controversial figures the administration\nUm he he definitely respects her and she is on the top of the list she's a very close with Jared and Ivanka she would be um in the captured seat a boat and ally is Cornell and he is also\nUm you know like it's supported by many people in the national security space and and he I Would believe that he like you said is also on the top of the list um\nAnd Joe Lieberman I you know I think would be\nTerrific but I I I'm not sure what you know if they can\nWhat the actual chemistry and machinations are that would\nThat would determine the factors for\nA for a final pick I think it's um I think it is an important face because you're so public and unlike Pompeo who meets privately you have a lot of kind of public engagement um and and and eerily the face of the un and I I think it is important to to think hard about who that should\nBe a it'd be started with the species associate and columnist for the real clear politics and contributor serious or ask them a Buddhist channel one twenty four maybe a couple of things a number one we remember\nGeorge Stephanopoulos just said about three months ago you know we wanted to send Bill Clinton out for the first midterm do want to make sure that we kept the seats and kept control where we had it and then we realized that the numbers actually go down when he appeared\nAnd of course they went up and he got one reelection again and destroyed Bob Dole and they said the prison Obama he did terrible and all these midterms and he wasn't really helping why is it the Republicans best bet is still Trump\nIt's not Brian it only as the Senate races and Senate races in red states um some of which President Trump won by a landslide proportions he can go and tell Republicans to vote Kevin Yoder is Fattah battling for his life in Kansas three and couldn't make it to the last week what a surprise because he doesn't want to answer in a swing district\nTo questions about President Trump he doesn't go to any house races\nThere are no competitive Senate races in California New Jersey New York and I can't remember the other state off the top of my\nTongue but it's a Twenty one Republican vulnerable Republican House seats there are no competitive Senate races there and he can't go and goes Republican turnout and help them so it's actually a very interesting X factor\n[noise] yeah well he was in our last I go to Pennsylvania today a in terms of North Dakota that's a double figure leader seems that Kevin Cramer has like when I'm when I'm really intrigued by is what's going on in Arizona\nA is about a two point lead a first cinema but you're more than ... out of the first female fighter pilot or to fight you know she's a cup proven congresswoman as Arizona changing\nWell it's so interesting that you say first of all um there's a new mix Sally up pole so it it goes it's sort of an economic and and I think it depends on the week\nThere's like a having a boost for um Arizona has been training for a long time since ... governor and they had a bunch of battles over immigration\nYou saw a lot of uh engagement\nSometimes in some precincts two hundred percent increase in voter registration and turnout among Latinos as a backlash to whatever that was a speech on Seventy that lost so there's been it's been changing for a while a marketing Sally is incredibly impressive candidate a and you would think in a unified two years ago that\nShe'd have this down but Christmas semi has been very bipartisan she's telling a lot of moderate voters that she is before you know she doesn't talk a lot about immigrant rights she talks about securing the border and she's playing to the middle so it's they're both members of the house problem solvers caucus\nThey both have records of of working across the aisle and ah I think they're very effective legislators and it it's going to be I think that one's going to really go down to the wire\nAnd do you believe in and this is on the legitimate threat New Jersey\n[noise] well everyone says oh he has the machine he always turns out that everyone likes this guy he can and you know men does is just bogged down with so much baggage if Democrats just assuming it's going to pull it out to be busy that day is the midterm year you know\nA lot of Democrats don't turn out from it

I mean it could get close to a five before it makes landfall and that's part of the pan handle is never experienced a storm of this strength\nSo that would be easy for the most part construction companies don't build something that's not that they don't have to overbuilt\nRight I mean you'd have to you know go deep into\nThe how construction companies\nConstruct these days for areas that could potentially be hit by a major hurricane but I'm concerned for the low lying areas and that Big Bend to Florida where it's at sea level where we had Griffith Jenkins this morning who if he doesn't move he's going to be overtopped with fourteen feet of water\nRight and he did move he did move yeah but you know that's when I get I understand why we put reporters out there because they want to show what's happening but the mom and me the human being and me is like why are we giving you evacuations if we're putting reporters out there\nYeah it's true I assume that the there'll be saving the trucks so that's a no\nNot necessarily I Am fearful that I don't want this to be the storm where we lose a reporter accrue because they are putting themselves in\nHarm's way so give me an idea of like when you think it'll hit land yeah and how long it's going to linger\nSo the good news if there is any good news with this storm is it's going to move very quickly once it makes landfall but because this is such a big storm and it's so strong it's actually going to take longer for it to weaken because it's got so much energy with that\nUh once it makes landfall that's when it loses its source of the warm water of the Gulf of Mexico so it will start to weaken but we're going to be still be dealing with a category one hurricane in Georgia tomorrow or so you know that's and that's going to bring trees down and going to be widespread power outages\nIt's going to be a rainfall concern not so much like Florence was where it was a matter of days and and inches and inches of rain but it's going to drop you know six to eight inches in a very short\nPeriod of time well that is going to be significant and we'll find out what's going on because I did read up on friday\nThat this hurt the hurricane to hit prior to this was the name of that hurricane what in this area no north South Carolina oh Florence Florence Florence was the most expensive hurricane maybe ever as costs forty to fifty million dollars worth of damage in that area is it hung around ...\nPeople don't realize they're like the category one who cares\nBut we didn't leave we did not leave and it brought a for North and South Carolina the wettest tropical cyclone on record\nWith on real amounts of rain so you know every storm is different this one is going to be a surge and wind event to that one was a full inland flooding disaster this one is going to be and this will be one of the worst hurricanes probably top ten at least top ten\nIt may be top five wow especially for Florida\nJana seeing an artist on hurricane Michael a coming ashore any moment\nThis is a bright kill me Joe Janice oh your favorite actually ended up there for our listeners anytime All right this is the ...\nConference saying [noise]\nNews maybe six point five ...

I Do not know do you know\n[noise] well I don't know but I Would say this to me there's there's less there there were so used to twist interns and things not being as they appear I think for the most part discreetly stressful position I think she wanted a break\nBut it's still going to get it but she would still get the same amount of break if she waited until the day after the midterms\nBut then it would look I'm going to act on her break like hey it didn't go well let me get out\nWell and that's what everybody who leaves after them no matter what it will inherently create the sensation\nUh after midterms when you\nKnow the administration goes through a cycle or as everyone does a and if it happens after what's expected to be a setback for Republicans that it will have the rats from sinking ship and why are they doing that\nSo getting this out early take some of that off of that and certainly that's a reasonable that's a reasonable point of view but there still seems that that the timing is just doesn't\nIt it it's not it's not helpful\nAnd I will say that on our own hit are going to ask about twenty twenty now and not hunting for twenty\nI can tell me she went out and found out where to supporting\nSo that's one thing is clear and she said that to us on our show on Fox and friends last week or two weeks ago now that I'm not running and I'll campaign for him I think he'll he'll pick them up on that especially\nBecause I think she's extremely popular more popular now than when she was a few years ago but what does it tell you in the big picture you just put your I Know his head on for a second that he could have rivals like Nikki Haley who was very critical of him during the campaign and who endorsed Marco Rubio and went to bat with Marco Rubio and still join and have power an exit like this\nIt's a good thing I mean the good cabinets and successful administrations rely on presidents who are able to balance voices\nFrom competing factions most famously a most notably Abraham Lincoln who ... who took not just rivals but mortal enemies moral political enemies and brought them into his cabinet and that was back when Kevin had considerably more power [noise] um but I think in this case\nWe see here are more important question the long term question about what this Nikki Haley do is she going to run and twenty twenty and all of the machinations about is it going to be Lindsey Graham comes in to replace Jeff Sessions and da da da da da da and maybe you know this answer who's gonna be\nFive a few ... entries we came up with and I think they're genius ... ousting came up with Joe Lieberman a you know Alison Mansfield ...\nFamiliar with are excellent work yes or write\nA good she's listening to it was a very good I'd number two I think the Kelly Ayotte remember she was out there to replace Lieberman is one of the three musketeers when they were traveling the country or that will be going I also think Ryan Zinke he would be a good move because\nHe is he understands surprise as well as anybody any certainly he fights wars huge de understands a diplomatic thing and he's already proven pretty effective cabinet member\nAnd of course we got the other ones that everybody's talking about and that's ... and ...\nUm I I Would say right now it would look like from a Washington prospective it looks like zinc he\nAh and up how have the inside track and of course are factions within this administration and you know how the president makes these choices is that if the scorpions in a bottle they fight their way through a and then the winner gets the spoils\nUm and I am sure that we will see a playing out over the next couple of weeks or a tough fight for that but I think that in in either zinc heat or pow totally different ways to go a pow would be in keeping more with Nikki Haley's model\nI'm well how did he described her a glamorous a Nikki Haley um but a more diplomatic or a welcoming face for the world at the un ah but still tough I'm sure\nA drink he goes the other way which is more of a John Bolton approach which says look a you know we think the UN's got serious problems are and uh we are here to demonstrate that and I think he certainly also would have the advantage of a successful mind meld with Trump\nWe want to see what the cabinet that will be on the midterms I Know we're about a month away do you think about any of the way things fade up and down I Believe the Republican uses this momentum to keep it going but I also do as many people do it a couple of weeks ago that the mad aboard story and Michael Cohen's story would hurt the president and then it turns out is such a review mirror right now\nSo who do you think who do you think has momentum coming out of the cabinet catastrophe\nAh the cabinets atrophy [noise] um I I Would say this or you played a clip from Britain earlier I think he was he's he's on the money which is the ... did a great thing for Republicans\nWhich is if it fuse together conservatives in populous um the culture warrior president and his and his base of supporters\nWho aren't idiot logically conservative in the same way the traditional Republicans are but they do see themselves locked in a in a prominent and very bitter culture war with the left\nAnd they and and making this about me too and sort of a reaction to me me too the backlash um brought together the two sort of warring wings of the Republican Party a and gave a reason for everybody to get back together um a month is a long time um but I Would say this\nThe net effect here and we've seen it already in polls\nThe net effect here as if you are Republican running in a a Democrat leaning or a state or district it's bad news or if you're a Democrat running and a Republican leaning state or district it's bad news this is revving up the base for Republicans but it's also further even further intensifying for Democrats\nAre good news for Republicans it will save seats how many will depend on what intervenes over the next month but four Republicans this will definitely have the effect of saving seats for sure\nI'm so I'm going to say with political wrote today and and and they said prior to the cabinet decision a confirmation\nThey wrote this a total of six seats he's currently held by Republicans that are firmly in play rate is lean Republican or worse for the GOP or the Democrats have only about a half dozen like that they say this political two hundred nine seats firmly or leaning in the Democratic column in the house only nine shy of the two hundred and Eighteen that the party needs\nA lot of gray area a lot can happen remember too close to call states seem to all go to Trump in twenty sixteen well Trump's going to lose but he is to close it a lot of these states and they ended up going to Trump and a lot of cases ...\nWell he he he lost some of it too close to call states um any one in places where we didn't expect them to\nUm we didn't think that Wisconsin was too close to call 'em but he did when we didn't have enough polling um and we made some gases analysts made gases based on prior performance or that we're not borne out um what we're going to see this time we would remember this\nTurnout in midterms is about a third less than in quadrennial presidential elections so you have a smaller electorate\nOr in a smaller electorate in which the intensity of base voters therefore ... matters a great deal more um people who are not partisan are less likely to vote in the mid term they ... they ... they care less about the parties and they therefore they care less about voting generally speaking\nAnd as a consequence or it matters\nA great deal that's why we care about these intensity questions so much what we don't know yet and this is the and this is the big don't know is how\nBig is the pool and in Fort Trump he was helped enormously by the fact that the ... got real small and the upper Midwest a lot fewer people turned out to vote in those states than we expected there were millions of missing voters that was a reflection of weak democratic enthusiasm and places like Michigan and Wisconsin\nAnd this had a lot to do with urban voters and African American voters will those voters show up to vote as a proxy war against Trump and if they do and if they if if they if that share shows back up the Republicans are going to get their clocks cleaned in the upper Midwest and that\nThey would lose enough that they would come close to losing enough seats in those states alone uh especially on the governor's level to make it a good outcome for Democrats so we just got to see who who who is really going to show up how many people\nSo he would what presents a of the population being that we are in in this unprecedented time of anger and passion right what do what would be a number that we have not seen in a while at the midterms what can we expect and what do you expect\nIn two thousand four team in the last midterm election we had the lowest voter participation of any ... any election dating back to Nineteen forty two\nIt was thirty four percent it was bad\nIt was real bad um and that worked out well for Republicans in a lot of places Republicans generally do better at any given Republican tents devoted to higher frequency than any given Democrats that has to do with income that has to do with educational attainment\n[noise]\nThis is news Ninety six point ... ... ... ... turns first for breaking news\nAnd it's eleven thirty and news Ninety six point five ... half\nHour until Orlando's News New will
