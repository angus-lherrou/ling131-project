story tropical storm Michael right now hearing on the edge of becoming a hurricane this morning twenty six counties in Florida now under a state of emergency as older by governor Rick Scott declared\nA state of emergency uh twenty six forty counties in preparation for tropical storm Michael\nThe governor yesterday today Michael continues on its way from the Caribbean ... into the Gulf with Seventy miles per hour winds remember Seventy four mile per hour is needed to become a hurricane here's meteorologist Bryan shield the tracks\nWith us right now is Matthew Kroenig he is deputy director of a strategy a disco crops at every strategy and security all throughout the book the logic of America's nuclear strategy wise strategic superior already matters a Matt welcome to the brain kill me Joe\nThank you very much it's a pleasure to be on the show\nMad at all I Know where your focus was whoever was focused up domestically you've seen what's happening overseas do you think the president is right to confront China the way he's doing it\nAbsolutely a China has been a major challenge to the United states and its allies for several years\nUs strategy in the past was somewhat naive with China that we had this kind of sensitive weak cooperated and play nicely that China would eventually reciprocate and we see that hasn't worked so the Trump Administration has\nBeen much tougher on China a label competition with China as the number one priority of the United states national security strategy and we're seeing that in trade military elsewhere are pushing back and ah it's a it's a better approach than what we've had in the past\nYou know the one thing they're saying is trying to think what we've heard this in the past we've only heard it behind closed doors now when Mike Pence makes his speech on I think it was friday or Saturday taking on China I think it was probably friday\nOr the China he called the matter everything's to theft of intellectual property or feeling to play fair the building of those islands and many were stunned that he came out front and center what about that strategy of coming out like that\nI think it makes a lot of sense and it's it's not just the statements such also the actions behind them as you pointed out China's not playing a fairly when it comes to international trade and so the Trump Administration has sitting back\nWith terrorists and and other measures um in the south China Sea as you pointed out China's militarized island so the Trump administration's increasing defense spending so the United states can better deal with that but also encouraging our allies to do more so Australia Japan\nOr India working together to counter China um so it's the tougher language yes but also the tougher a action backing it up\nA and but we are so economically tied to them we will people wonder how we're going to pay the price or are we because they need or market more than we need their stuff\nWell there's no doubt that hum by getting tougher on trade that this could have a some negative effects on the U.S economy uh the the Chinese\nAre practices have been unfair but they've also been beneficial in certain ways by subsidizing their firms are they've Chinese imports to the United states have been cheaper than they otherwise would be that gives Chinese firms and unfair advantage but it also means American consumers pay less for Chinese products are so as we get China to stop these unfair practices there will be\nA some possible consequences for US Economy but I think that the fundamental point you make is is the right ones are more vulnerable to this than we are and so the purpose is to increase the pressure and the short term to get them to change their practices to get them to play by the rules and then a four competing head to head nobody can compete\nWith the U.S economy a ... an affair level playing field\nI Want you are a little of Mike Pence the vice president I'd states are taking on trying to cut the top one\nChinese security agencies of masterminded the wholesale theft of American technology including cutting edge military blueprints and using that sold and technology the Chinese Communist party is turning Ploughshares into sores on a massive scale\nSo that's a pretty direct and but it's not to American companies also maybe we got to put some rules in place and not to be selling this technology for a quick payday helps their family but it hurts our country so do you think that we have to be more discipline here and cracking down our businesses for four of falling prey to big dollar deals\nYes so the national defense strategy of the United states or the national defense authorization act mandated the Trump Administration to come up with a comprehensive strategy to deal with China and that will certainly be part of part of it so serious reforms basically making it more difficult for Chinese companies to invest in the U.S economy in ...\nThe national security areas but also export controls for us and our allies\nTo make sure that we're not exporting I'm sensitive technology that the Chinese can then use a ... in this competition so you know one area in particular is artificial intelligence which many military experts think could be a really the future of military competition or right now there are many American a\nVenture capitalist investing and artificial intelligence in China because they see an economic upside to it and they're very well may be a but it could also mean giving China military capabilities that would threaten us and our allies so reforming all of these things this untangling our economy's to some degree I think is the right stuff\nUm but it it won't be easy\nThey won't be easy let's go fast forward to North Korea this is the I I get it or people that study diplomacy and nuclear proliferation say I can't believe that the template the president's following a first to bring us to\nThe brink of conflict because we're at the brink of conflict we just weren't acknowledging it and then ends up in Singapore summit and then nothing fulfilled so we break off and now it seems like we're back on\nHow how do you view our relations with North Korea right now\nYes I think it would be helpful to begin with the broader context to this has been a major problem that's but dabbled administrations for decades\nThe Trump Administration came in with a clear strategy maximum pressure\nAnd engagement so increase the pressure early on was sanctions military pressure are and that was to set the table for the engagement face and that's where we are now so Kim Jong un has agreed in principle to denuclearization and uh we're trying to make progress on that\nIt's been a little bit slower than I think some and probably even the administration would have hoped but we have to give this some time\nUh see how it plays out but I don't think the administration will have unlimited patience or so and and short I think we do have a clear strategy and we are making making progress\nBut man would you also see I just give you with the president says secretary said the president tweeted out secretary Pompeo had a good meeting with chairman Kim today and uh in North Korea progress made on Singapore summit agreements I look forward to seeing chairman Kim again in the near future so they're working on a return\nA summit the secretary of state tweeted this out arrived in Seoul to brief president a moon and are in their prime minister about my meeting with Kim I look forward to working closely with\nA South Korean friends and allies to ensure progress on an inter Korean relations is a in lockstep with progress on denuclearization so he wants to make sure South Korea doesn't get ahead of us his knee\nYes that's right uh you know one of America's greatest strength says it's network of democratic capitalist allies in Europe and Asia\nAnd so in Asia South Korea and Japan or two of our closest friends and they have a strong interest in this as well North Korea's a in their in their backyard or so on one hand ... in Japan has been pretty hawkish on North Korea may be even tougher than Trump\nAnd so we need to make sure that they're on board with the engagement on the other hand president moon and South Korea or has been moving kind of full steam ahead on trying to improve relations with North Korea and so we just need to make sure that all three of us are on the same page that enter alliance unity is going to be very important ah for for addressing this issue\nAnd that the one thing that bothers me most bother you is the fact that Russia says okay if Americans talking to all talk to them yes America in Russia having better relations me will break these sanctions in these barriers shyness same thing and he was like after we meet with them these other leaders these communist leaders or these dictators want to meet with him again is\nThat to make sure that America knows that they're they're not who really influences North Korea or do they getting panicky there were starting to move directly with North Korea and not going through them\nI I think it's both a I think that China and Russia want to be great powers they want to be involved and so this idea that the United states South Korea and North Korea\nOr the center players in this drama\nWorries them they want to make sure that they are are still players on the international stage but the second part of it is I think especially for food and uh he sees what's good for the United states is bad for Russia and vice versa so I think he's looking to play spoiler here and the economic pressure on North Korea has been important\nTo get us to this point and so I think Russia and China are I'm looking to defuse that a pressure a little bit which is going to make it harder to get a deal by um so\nI Know I Know that you you or your devising Mitt Romney for awhile and Marco Rubio to people that have had conflicts with President Trump when it comes to foreign policy your resume is unbelievable and so diverse\nAnd some people who have been in the establishment for a while have trouble seeing any benefit to a Donald Trump's doing one of which was Colin Powell I Want to get your take on what he said the free to carry yesterday cut forty one\nDo you think this president can be a moral leader for the world I don't know that they can do that because right now that is not the way he is acting well let me give an example my favorite three words and our constitution is the first three words when the people\nWe the people but recently it's become me the president\nAs opposed to the people and you're saying things that should not be happening\nI'm sure you talk to a lot of people in Washington circles they feel the same way who's right\n[noise] you know I was a skeptic of President Trump a but over time I've been persuaded that um he's doing a good job and a better in my view than President Obama did us so we certainly unconventional his style is unusual a button area after area he's been\nI declared a state of emergency at twenty six forty counties in preparation for tropical storm

hurricane for the last few hours down this means that maximum sustained winds are now at least Seventy four miles per hour Brian shields his wind gusts are likely to feed a hundred miles per hour\nWhen it reaches for on Wednesday governor Rick Scott yesterday\nI declared a state of emergency at twenty six forty counties in preparation for tropical storm Michael\nRespected update from the governor at some point today so we'll bring that team what had happened here's meteorologist Bryan shields on the storm\n[noise] I mean what what are you talking about we're more clout are going to be with the shortly\nI'm right there at the bottom of the are more clout or used to be chief of staff for the vice\nPresident United States so that's where we are witnessing I mean if people you can't really celebrated ... capital it's a great moment you've you've earned it your entire career you have people like George Bush working the phones ... Susan Collins four or five times I mean you got to be a pretty good uh aid to the president if he means that much to you\nAnd when you add the vice president of Karl Rove uh everybody that came around and said this guy is the guy and some people got to tell the truth because you could bring Kevin it was too easy to traditional once you take a little bit of a risk you Donald Trump and then we saw what happened\nAnd we ended up with the beer because beer controversy\nOf high school and college hallmark louder comes in will bring him on a huge surprise in the United states is making the official announcement color\nThe vice president on this vote the eyes or fifty the news or forty eight the nomination of Brett Kavanaugh of Maryland to be an associate justice of the Supreme Court of the United states is confirmed and\nJust like that to have a ensued and they needed the ... the vice president and uh of course because they had the ... had his\nDaughter had he had to walk down the aisle and he said I'll come back to the jet waiting for me if needed technically he was not needed so the president is obviously extremely happy and he does not mind deciding that basically Dr Ford is not to be believed which I think is a risk cut to\nStand before you today on the heels of a tremendous victory for our our\nAgo the U.S Senate confirmed\nKavanaugh\nMonday nights at seven PM in the East Room of the White House we will perform the swearing in ceremony [noise]\nSoon to be justice Cavanaugh a great man [noise]\nUh I have never heard his crowd louder I've never heard of more enthusiastic and that includes during the campaign his last three appearances\nAre off the charts the speeches the saying is different topics but every because of the capital situation Republicans are ignited they also know to Democrats are idiots they are coming out saying we're going to investigate them are going to impeach him they were going to teach the president\nThere's a lot of people don't like the president but this country doesn't want to be great to an impeachment process because you don't like him because your last election\nMeanwhile speaking of the ... the United states are within the last ten minutes he was able to speak to some reporters before he got another chopper and rude to Orlando to speak to the police chiefs are here he is a going after the Democrats\nBy the way they behave was absolutely\nSever seen anything\nGoing to be a great\nFought him and his family I thought it was great I I thought it was one of the most is performance is I've ever say well here's\nHere's a thing or the president probably we had a caller last hour to say the president's you bring up that all Democrats are bad we wants the old Democrat that he used to be he wants to them part of the process he thinks that they can he can do what Reagan did they what Reagan Democrats there were simply word or else he wouldn't have one forty nine states Monday at one of his home state in his reelection\nMe think about that that will never happen with anybody now the ... the United states actually brought\nThat up today let's go to the search or the second cut\nI think a lot of Democrats are going to vote Republican because I have many friends or the Democrats the main base of the Democrats have shifted so far\nThat will end up going as well as this country would end up being Venezuela\nI think a lot of Democrats are going to be voting Republican\nThat could happen and I think it'd be so smart to do what do they will find the party vilify what is it has become I think that's the way to go the other point that I have today as we are bringing more ...\nOr the other point is marketed how you feel about this this could be a key turning point for debt for Republicans and Democrats don't want Republicans I don't want Democrats vilified Joe mansion I don't want Republicans vilify Senator Murkowski you can go ahead and praise counts as a Republican\nBut he don't attack her viciously him personally and threatened her or threaten to give her death threats because she didn't vote the way you want to\nYou is the beginning this has to be beginning of stability and I want to see it in those three cases\nI think you're absolutely right Brian we we have got to remember that we elect people to make difficult decisions even if we don't disagree with the outcome may reach with all we have an a recourse for that that's called the ballot box and we can question it we can we can oppose it but these are human beings we to treat them that way all focus on all sides\nOr we think that is the ... the president's McAfee is going to have\nProblems but you should know more you you're going to need Murkowski for other initiatives you're going to need Collins further and issues if you're a Democrat\nYou're going to need Joe Manchin to caucus with you if he goes Republicans you lose a seat if he goes independent you lose a seat it doesn't behoove you to heal shame and his face or a or ignore him in the halls and not including events why don't people understand that\nWell I I don't take one thing as as hopefully a sign of better things to come we didn't get a lot of coverage I Know Senator McConnell talked about it but at the same time we were going through these confirmation hearings in the bitter partisan nature of those\nYou also had the Senate passing with huge overwhelming bipartisan majority or a bill to fight opioid addiction and so we can come together and get things done we have to that's what the the American people are trusting their elected officials to do with us Jen\nPsaki former White House communications director under President Obama he's not over the fact she's not over the fact that counted and vote the way she want it and she like many other Democrats want to make this men verses women issue men are in control men have too much power no one believes women cuts in\nCongress really struck a nerve for me and I think millions of women across the country including in Maine because she's trying to have it always and you can't take somebody as credible and then completely question their story because the second airplane what she said and\nHow she felt it because that political power that um that is somebody who is pretending to be a feminist fake feminine\nPretended he never said she was a feminist which he said is you listen to her speech it was very organized it made it was very linear and makes total sense something happened to her but no one can corroborate this story so I don't want to destroy him why does that there'll be men verses women\n... you're exactly right and unfortunately we've seen this too many times that the left will will\nBasically did invite someone from their own definition of whatever it is they're talking about if they don't agree with you you saw how the left ... lost their mind when Kanye West said something nice about the president you see them calling Susan Collins a fake feminist\nWe we've got get beat on these kinds of labels and\n... it just doesn't do our democracy any good\nMike Pence the vice for the United states a cold out China\nAnd I want you to hear a little of that speech because it didn't get as much play but it did you did it did we hit a home in China because they say a lot of this talk happens behind closed doors but no longer at least do longer with this administration listen\nChina's building unparalleled surveillance state\nAnd it's growing more expensive and intrusive often with the help of us technology for United States wants Beijing pursued trade policies that are free fair reciprocal our message to China's rulers is this [noise] this president\nWill not back down\nSo he's saying I mean it's a president that one of the first guess he had over at mar a Lago was the Chinese leader\nHe said we're going to be able to work this out but now we'll buy literally turned up the heat and you say you know maybe my friendships in danger you were there in the beginning what happened how did what was supposed to be an initial show of trust and disrespect to President Obama no one denies that\nWhy why did the wheels come off\n[noise] [noise] oh I think it's multi faceted one we have our trade issues which most people tend to focus on but also going on behind the scenes and doesn't get a lot of coverage is the pervasive activities that they are also doing in other parts of the reason region with whether it's militarily whether it is trying to influence our political elections in the midterms\nIn including some other activities in in other parts of the world where they're offering basically loans to cash strapped\nAh countries that are barely trying to stay afloat and then when they can't repay them they're taking over key facilities such as ports and things like that in order to build a base of influence that's going to expand across the across the Pacific and\nWe've got to confront all of these things all at the same time we'll get the trade issues worked out China has to work it out we are the largest economy in the world where their largest customer but we also have to deal with these other issues and that's why the president the vice president's speech was so strong on that because make no mistake those were the words\nOf President Trump and the policy of President Trump that the vice president was was a spouse and last week\nThey mark now that you're on the outside\nWhite and we can look at the administration away communications is done in policies is implemented what do you what could you tell them that you feel comfortable telling my audience now about what has to change\nTopical store Michael is now hurricane Michael a category one hurricane
