D question\nCorrect his own party and high probability he just hit the doughnut hole okay I get about two dozen of these calls every fall so the doughnut hole also referred to as the coverage gap\nOr we can really get into the weeds on this one cell keep this extremely high level and we'll talk next year's numbers so January first to go to the pharmacy started filling prescriptions you pay a co pay\nInsurance company pays the bounds that number is added together Medicare calls it the total cost of your medication copy if at any point next year that number hits three thousand eight hundred and twenty dollars\nThat person would then slip into the coverage gap also referred to as the doughnut hole what happens there instead of having that defined co pay that they had during the benefit period things shift and name brand medication they are going to pay twenty five percent of insurance company picks up the balance so somebody might have been paying thirty dollars for a tier three\nThey are the doughnut hole now they're going to pay twenty five percent than four hundred dollar med their costs jump from thirty bucks to a hundred bucks so that's the doughnut hole a person will stay in the doughnut hole until in if\nWhat they spent in the benefit period added together with what they are spending in the coverage gap added to what Medicare is paying in the coverage gap it's five thousand one hundred dollars if that number\nEnds up to fifty one hundred they hit the catastrophic level and then their prices will drop\nConsiderably okay so the key is to stay in the benefit period so long as possible by doing generic medications\nAre begging for samples when we're at our doctor's office whatever it takes I get a lot of people do have the coverage gap and then we'll go to go to our ex they'll go to Canada mail order whatever it is lots of different options are just be just be careful if you're ordering medications from outside of the u._s.\nYeah [laughter] I Would I Would assume that so that's why the costs jumped for this for gas in the sky is\nCorrect in the doughnut hole is getting better or a number of years ago if you hit the doughnut hole you are responsible for one hundred percent of the costs so that's been shifting to the insurance company which of course is Medicare backs that up so this year in the doughnut hole you pay thirty five percent\nOf the cost next year in the doughnut hole you pay twenty five percent and then we'll see supposed to be closing in the next couple of years we'll see exactly what that means\nYeah and from all the classes and workshops that we've taught together I Know one of the big mistakes is not reviewing part D\nAbsolutely and I must be reviewed and that is incredibly simple sure to do by having somebody else do it [laughter] if you just send you a list of medications to somebody you know and trust and knows how to do that myself or any other agent who knows what they're doing\nWe just got to Medicare dot Gov which is a public facing website you can do it yourself just putting your meds pick a couple of pharmacies in the Medicare sorts your list of medications against all twenty seven plans for next year\nSo I get a lot of people that will put in their medications and then they'll just email me hey here's my id here's my password which is again it's just as a public facing website it's an awesome website that being said the plant finders currently down but back up soon [laughter]\nYeah so that's really all it takes all kinds of couple signatures and you're on a new plan for next year if needed if need be so that's that definitely she'd be reviewed it can be a difference of thousands of dollars out of pocket\nSure and that's prescription drug plan part D correct and again we're in the annual enrollment period runs from October fifteenth to December seventh were pretty much right\nIn the heart of it so now is the time to review that\nAnd I feel like that is probably the easiest thing for people to grasp is the part D prescription drugs 'cause obviously those change year by year right we threw out a stat right at the start of the show that only about less than fifty percent of people are only spend thirty minutes reviewing their\nUm last week there was a question by a listener\nWho called in and wanted to know about um like bingo games and things like that at churches and whether amendments three what effect that\nI had quite a few listeners right into me email me about amendments three I'm One of those with somebody who was involved evidently in uh the the drafting in the end the details of it and meant to weigh\nA his position was that no amendments we would not uh\nApply to um\nChurch bingo games and those kinds of things because of the way several the terms are defined and the amendment so I did want to say that that was somebody who um was being helpful or trying to be helpful in response to one of the questions so I pass that along\n[noise] um and again I'm\nThe league of women voters there's an end to an entity called no casino ink and Disney World are all supporters of amendments re in other words they would have you vote yes on amendments re um because they want less gambling and\nDisdain because Disney wants to preserve Florida as a family um oriented entertainment stay here so that's basically the summary of amendments wary and some of the things that I wanted to add to it before we went onto amendment for\nAmendment for basically restores voting rights to Floridians with felony convictions after they've completed all of their terms of their sentences including probation and parole\nNow where does this come from amendment for is actually a citizens' initiative it's not one of the CRC proposed amendments again for\nPeople who are just tuning in CRC fans for a constitutional revision commission on and it's an entity that um [noise] comes together once every Twenty years to proposed proposed constitutional amendments a this was one this was Twenty years two thousand and Eighteen\nSo amendment for was not a CRC recommendation that came out of the citizens' initiative and a little background on amendment for\nFlorida is one of four states in the union that bars um convicted felons from voting after they've a completed their sentences and um and probation and parole\nOnly one of four and then you're not in the United states and it's interesting because this actually goes back to um post civil war Florida um when they were trying to restrict\nI'm freed slaves from exercising their right to vote right um so it goes all the way back to Eighteen sixty eight and\nSo now finally they're addressing it in a different way I'm One governor Charlie Crist was governor he streamline that process so that convicted felons could be part and\nI'm Governor Scott has taken a different position as to whether or not he should pardon felons and has not I'm part as many to restore their voting rights I'm so this is one of those amendments that's designed to correct\nUm something or address something um that was basically initiated over a hundred years ago\nYeah seems like something that might be a little outdated\nWell if people understand the history of it in an outdated but you know there's still some people that don't\nThat will most people are probably looking and saying voting rights that they're just looking at it as the you know plain and what it is on the paper right on really write a during we're coming right\nRight so you know sometimes there's a whole history to these kinds of things that it may impact your how you vote on the amendment it may not a but in any event there is it's a pretty interesting history and um I don't know that very many people would know that Florida is only one up\nFor it I actually didn't know it was one of four I did I knew there weren't a lot but I didn't do was only four states\nRight right so um anyway um you know and and Governor Scott\nHas\nImplemented a more strict rules as to how ex felons can get their voting rights restored 'em and\nThey have to wait basically ... where he he executed these rules in two thousand and eleven and they basically had to wait\nA five to seven years before they could apply to have their rights restored and um then in two thousand Seventeen um six years after he imposed new rules there were about thirty thousand\nEx felons who applied a of those only three thousand ex felons have their rights restored by the cabinet so this is a real this is a real um issue I'm for I'm ex felons ... um and\nYou know and also relates back to [noise] there are some people who believe that\nUm people's voting rights should be restricted\nRight that you need to be very tough on who you allowed to vote and then there are others who believe that you know people who have done their time ought to be able to exercise their right to vote so um there's also that aspect of this amendment\nAnd that's and that's amendment for\nWell it's I mean it's interesting that you know it's well interesting we'd be a little ironic to that this is on the ballot here in a year where in the ah Orange County sheriff's race you have Darryl shepherd who is running with who's been arrested in his past you know and so he's allowed to run for sheriff\nWhere you have convicted felons once they're out and have ... they've completed parole and everything they don't have the right to vote right right oh just a little another little nugget there\nRight and you know and because we live in the United states and you are innocent until proven guilty simply because you've been arrested\nFor something doesn't mean that you're guilty of it or that you should suffer any penalty so um\nPeople are wrongfully arrested in by the way sometimes either wrongfully convicted or or they enter into a guilty plea even though they may be innocent just because of the ah alternative potential dire\nCongress could be a deal that they may have struck ... or ... that's interesting I Do want to just really quickly is so ... and that's the case too 'cause you see these stores all the time of people who are wrongfully convicted of stuff and then they are eventually led free but then or they they wouldn't have the right to vote because at one point they were convicted whether rightfully wrongfully\nWell if they have their um convictions expunged writer All right then I you know it's almost as if since it was wrongful okay um\n[noise] and um\nBut again that doesn't that doesn't apply to people who have been wrongfully convicted buck convicted by their own words basically is you know I mean if you're facing a life in prison and and you say okay I'll take Fifteen Years even though you may not have done it you scared\nScared of the right to life in prison is right way worse than Fifteen year old and if you don't have you know you know a good good lawyer to kind of fight your battle for you or you just don't have the means to do it you're kind of tied there and you're right and you're stuck\nAnd on the other side of the coin there are guilty people who are not convicted yes right I mean we've had a couple of very high profile cases here in central Florida there are a lot of people think the\nThe accused was guilty um but they were not found to be guilty um and they're voting rights are not affected here at all even though when in reality they may be guilty so\nThere you go that's amendment for that's amendment for aid for for two two zero zero nine six five

B. B. O. if you want to join us here on the show\nYou can aid for for two two zero zero nine six five we're talking amendments on the upcoming election November six got about when we say ten a little more than ten days what was it\nYeah just about ten days wait until the until the election starts on November six that Tuesday so we got this Sunday we go next Sunday Sherrie is going to try to educate you and me and you know everyone else out there as best you can on what the amendments are what they pertain to what they include because\nYou know we're we're starting to get into the sticky ones here as well that aren't as clear cut in straight forward so\nUh and again she's encourage your courage to do some research on your own as well or do a little homework and you know study up and compared to the show and now everything will make a little more a little more sense and I know the word homework and all that you don't want to do that but trust me this is important stuff and you want to know and make sure you are fully informed or what you'll be voting for when you go\nTo the ballots right you know most of our ... our listeners are we're kind of like preaching to the choir you speak right they they they really want to be educated on ... things and they understand the importance of these amendments\nThere are a lot of people however because there's so many things that are often times on our ballot so when we go to the polls to vote on\n'em that some of us maybe just seeing for the first time and just read too quickly and say all the yes on this and no one that right right and but yes on everything or no on there are right and it's not a proper way to go right\nSo um but you know a lot of those times when we're asked to vote on things they're not necessarily amendments to our constitution\nTo our constitution are um especially those that are proposed by the by the CRC um are are very important because it's a lot harder as I've said many times before\nTo undo 'em to re cinder revise the constitutional amendment than it is to revise or amend or undo legislation um it's a totally different process\nAnd so constitutional amendments supersede legislation and many times legislation can be held to be unconstitutional if it violates a a a provision of the Florida constitutions so what we're we're we're looking at here is voting on\nWhat I might call almost super law right\nBecause like the U.S constitution the Florida Constitution in our state sets a standard\nIt sets requirements that legislation cannot violate so these provisions are extraordinarily important which is why we're spending so much time on them for them and hoping hopefully helping people understand them more\nAnd then after the election passes will go back into the usual will do it law review where we talk about you know whatever's hot hot hot button topic in the week but\nLeading up to this election the hot button topic will be the election right a for for two two zero zero nine six five votes it back to the phones Christine from a veto is calling interesting good morning welcoming to the show\n[laughter] thank you and good morning I was calling to\nAsk if I'm Sherry could explain to us the distinction between\nLegislative issues that are put on the ballot for people to vote on\nThe campaign or a candidate that we vote on what distinguishes an item that the people are going to vote on during the election period\nFrom the issues that our elected officials and vote for a vote on for us either represented\nIn Tallahassee now what she just that kind of help me understand it a little more but I'm not ... I Wonder if everybody could get a good explanation of the distinction between what issues go on a ballot\nAnd what issues are strictly voted on the legislative floor um and like she she used the term

right here on new Seventy six point five W db oh let's go ahead and go right back to the phone lines you're John is calling in the questions on bumbling John welcome to do it law review what's your question for eternity share it with\nA yeah I had a question because I was able to speak about the constitutional process of Florida and my question was specifically dealing with the bundling up some of the men here a lot of them don't really see any logical reason for going together so I was wondering\nWhat's the last us for millions eating bottle together\nAnd is there any way to limit from the other than a constitutional limited\nOkay well that's a very good question John I'm first of all if if and amendment that has gotten to the ballot suicide citizens' initiative for example um than it has to be one subject matter only there cannot be any bundling\nIn those amendments that you see bundling those are amendments that were proposed by the constitutional revision commission or what we were in calling the CRC\nThe CRC meets every Twenty years once every Twenty years and there is no requirement there is no single subject requirement for a CRC amendment at this point in time\nThere is a single subject requirement for citizens' initiative and for a legislative propose a madman put on by the legislature I'm so that should answer to your question as to why some are bundled\nAnd some are not um\nRight now I'm the CRC is allowed to do that bundling I Would um take probably a constitutional amendment I'm or some kind of other method a to prevent a preclude the CRC from being able to\nA bundle on these constitutional amendments\nThe bundling has caused a lot of confusion for people and and some people have become very aggravated about it because they would like to vote yes on one portion of it for example but no one another portion and they can't do that\nUm the amendment as a whole has to win or lose pass or fail all segments of it um so I Hope that helps answer your question John\nIt yeah it it's just some of the nation with dealing with them and that's where there's a logical tie between the two of the offshore oil drilling in the vaping one it's\nRight there goes the steps between is so hard to make any decisions on things like that\nYou're you're absolutely right and um you know also for example amendment seven which has um you know a a requires a super majority for um for increased existing student fees creates a college system in the same time\nUm has a provision for death benefits to first responders right totally unconnected so there are several amendments like that\nUm and it does force the voters\n'em to take a position on both issues or three issues however many are there\nUm that may be inconsistent with what they believe so you know people are going to have to make that decision on their own terms that it's a very it's very frustrating for voters um and and sometimes can be confusing\nI'm even though only one of the amendments was struck down by the Florida Supreme Court as being confusing um and that when you don't see on the ballot\nOkay Oh thank you very much for clarifying that I Do appreciate here welcome John\nNo alright appreciate the call ... or I'd sure we're about three minutes left here we are put a bow on this where do you want to go\nOkay well um you know we still have amendments a five and forward yeah going I'm I'm very appreciative for all the calls it means people are listening in listening carefully and\nAnd um that's the goal of the show so thank you everybody out there and and please do let me know what your questions are if I don't have the answer off the top of my head and often times I don't I Try to find it out for you [noise] um but yeah when we could\nTry to do next week maybe is we could do you know so that we knew don't normally do which is blocked the phone lines out\nAnd just try to get through the rest of the amendments we might just have to do that I mean I might just be the best course of action as we can get through all of a ...\nAnd make sure that we get everything and then you know right right and if we ever time later after it's All right of Iraq and if we get time towards maybe the last segment we can open the phone lines up and take a few questions you want to get through all of these amendments for you so that way you are in a foreign voter out there come November six\nThat's no good to do after the election unless they passed and we want we need to know more about right so um and and so people know um you know some of these amendments if they pass\nThey take effect immediately um uh some of them you know in October so or January a lot of them in January ... right right turn in the end right right um so\nIs for spine surgery you have to understand the neurosurgeon right and\nI Do not one of my ... year or two actual comments because I started looking at the comments that people were making\nAnd these are actual comments so I copy and pasted them I'm leaving out the names of the surge in of course and all that it wasn't even a local surgeon here but the point is it was an ad and people were commenting every member of the reason I Do the show every week is to give truth and options options in truth so when you read this below I Want you to think\nI think about truth and think about options and let me know if these people are a little bit frustrated\nWith their comments okay some number one's a little bit of a long one I had to separate surgeries on my neck the first one was a cervical disc surgery from ... through the seven and did good\nWith that one but left me with a stiff neck to search was done in the front and the situation was cut increase in my neck today you can't see the crease\nIt took care of my arm pain well that that's good he had a decent result except for a stiff neck it sounds like but here's the problem with surgery for years later now I started having pain in my left arm and it was done showing the disease had progressed to have another surge\nThis one was done from the back of my neck at sea seven to one removing three bones in adding more rods and pins and screws\nAlready had a metal plate and screws from the first surgery here's what he says not once did they explain to me the repercussions of this surgery not once did they explain to be the repercussions of this surgery I have a six inscribed on the back of my neck and I am in constant pain\nEven five years later and they now dependent on pain medicine I had to retire I have no life at all yet I'm Still fighting Social Security disability they say nothing is wrong with me and it should be able to go back and work and do what I did before\nSo tired and so sorry I let them do this to me I think I Would have dealt with the arm pain rather than what I'm going through now later the doctor told me it would be like this the rest of my life\n\nMost of it but not all was caused from working at a computer this was the guy says the ... and his he says the bottom line is you're left with chronic debilitating pain so here it is you know he's not being given the options right and wasn't told about another\n... another lady said my sister Sandy has suffered\nFor over forty five years with her back and six different surgeries she's bed written now such a shame\nSo this isn't a surgeon that's advertising to do surgery and these are some of the comments he's getting back now I'm not saying he did these surgeries on these people but these people are frustrated with the results one lady's bedridden after six surgeries one guy's on his second surgery and says I wasn't even told\nThat would be like this when I was done I thought it was gonna be all better and now I'm Out of work I had to retire and it came to get my Social Security disability\nTo problem folks hey we're taking life cause I Want to break to that for a second uh aid for for two two zero zero nine six five call us we all live aid for for two two zero zero
