this before I've heard this theory that at some time during the day no kidding yes is that because we're batteries are still charged from a good night's sleep well\nI think it has something to do with I don't know all the science behind it it's the effect of its\nLaunch you're a little bit more relaxed because like for most people the hard work of the day is sort of done and then you're sort of

Chris ... the rockets rage on Ron do Lakers there was actually they don't just thrown yes I mean and this one there's usually a lot of shopping going on but this one they actually are thrown a makers but here's the question because the word is Ron do spit\nIn Chris Paul's face ... boy so in that case or in any case we're someone spits in another person's face you excuse them going after and throwing down no and thrown down\nSo you're saying it's expanded mad as someone spits in your face done I'm going yes I'm David [noise] yeah I think so so what if they say something bad about your mother\nThen you keep your head about that right nice but I don't think I'd throw down over that how bad yeah that's true you know are we talking to your mom is so fat joke or is it like the B word dark\nUh your yeah let's just say the B word your mom is or whatever or you say this is that a workplace you throw down you're getting fired for that and I called my mom a B word probably wouldn't get fired for that no\nI don't know man ... ... words are bad but you can't use violent now you got into it I don't know if it would or not you got to do another mom joke after that but I got to believe if someone spits in your face and you ... yeah you're not going to get cancer\nThat are you I wouldn't think so so that's one of those things is right or have understood to honor thing okay but if they talk bad about your wife\nDo you walk that's that's yeah you don't put up with that how 'bout do that that does seem worse doesn't it about your wife yeah and they talking about your mom how 'bout daughter that you just ramped up another one I did see I'm I'm with you on that one to talk about about my daughter would go time\nYes so you said your daughter or something something yeah I I

[noise]\n\nOne of\nThe game show Jamie marching band camp here Abby's racist [noise] always been racist\nOr is this new thing I think there's a new thing maybe social justice warriors are up in arms over the\nDear Abby column this column was recently asked about giving kids quote unquote unusual names meaning not named ... typically are hurt in America yeah so the advice was as such\nNot only can foreign names be difficult to pronounce and spell but they can also cause a child to be teased on mercifully sometimes named to be a problematic word in the English language and that one sounds beautiful in a foreign language can be grating an English\nNow you can't say that though why it's racist and Vina phobic one critic said Abby is clinging to an old America were white is considered the norm and everything else as deviant and inferior\nOkay can really say inferior just said hey sometimes if you if you get a good name it's a little unusual yeah for the culture that we live in your back in ... for some problems when they're in elementary school or middle school especially middle school because kids are horrible in middle school well\nMy brother my sister and I when our parents named is we all went by middle names do just the way they did it and and so you know our brother is a Michael Jeffrey and my middle name is James just always going by Jamie since I was a kid but first name as Mari named after ... all Los Angeles Dodger\nFirst day of school every year Mary markedly Mary [laughter] but I never got teased about it [laughter]\nOf course [laughter] every one of my ... yeah\nYeah of course yeah so if it's an unusual or [noise] you know a name that maybe people don't know how to pronounce\nYeah yeah sometimes it can be problematic one guy who was sort of stood up for the column\nOr he goes by Ike but his name as a ... ... ... ... ... yes he lives in Canada and he\nTold this to the New York times so I changed my neighbor practical purposes she's right get over it because the reality is that long foreign sounding names do not end up sticking the practical effect of that is nobody calls him that so they end up with some truncated name better dangling a angle sized anyway\nNow the other thing I Would like to throw out there all the people who are I mean imagine walking around all your life looking to take shots at the dear Abby column the color you know the name I could check ...\nI'm Sorry I could Chuck will trickle yeah Chuck ... it's a it's a long and I'm sure I'm butchering that\nYou imagine you're the announcer he's planning a hockey game and it forward her for a clue [laughter] you're gonna be pronounced different every night yeah it is\nBut I mean but you know what you're getting into is that why dear Abby you're saying hey you might want to stay away from that\nYeah it could be a problem and the other thing is is that the same people are upset a dear Abby but there's also talked about cultural appropriation all the time\nYeah that's true\nI told my mom when I was a kid I was going to name my son Julius oh yeah yeah after Julie serving doctor Jay she's like I don't know if you want to do that when you're older really I think I
