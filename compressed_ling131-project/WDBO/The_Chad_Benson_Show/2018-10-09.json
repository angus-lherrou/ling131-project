own thing yeah we're good now were good\nAnd when you first said I I don't know I don't I don't know if I like exactly what the president said there he seems still all about it right\nBut you're

major category three storm\nHurricane Michael will rapidly intensified in the Gulf of Mexico should make landfall somewhere near Panama City beach on Wednesday now looks like Wednesday afternoon but again tiny why you'll start to see impacts from the storm well before that probably\nDoes it was very important moment there was a very big journey going into the Washington Post was actually\nJockey Italy or they don't they [noise] that was the I'm very proud of it because we have a very well then they lay blame justice to the brain record for many years that I thought I could make that he got on\nYeah and I don't man for a lot of conservatives that weren't too nuts about Trump ... having these two conservatives on the Supreme Court like it's a win no matter what happens is when it is a win best not every conservative but there is a faction of conservatives would feel that way right\nAnd he was also asked about how this might affect the midterms as well because some are now saying the Democrats are angry enough to rally their voters to go against Republicans the opposite may have been through the confirmation that failed a Trump says hey there's a ton of energy here this was also on Fox News guy\nBut I think they overplay their hand I think there were ... ... ... with the league and the other things that they did even look at the lawyer representing their baseball there right out of the Democrat labor ... river and then it other than\nDemocrats than what they do they end up with all these lawyers better always the same one then I won't even go in the name but I think they over there and and I can bet you that the boozy as the and the love and that\nThe feeling in the Republican Party right now is higher than I'd ever dated\nAnd use involves going up like rock that she had been\n... for the Republican Party the strongest I've ever dated today at an all over the river\nYou know you talked to a lot of different people you know especially with their politics all across the board are you hearing from a lot of Democrats that really feel like\nThey got railroaded on this deal because board was really credible and they absolutely believe her or is that just the talking heads I Do\nActually hear from some people yes personally I Do hear from some people who believe absolutely anyone who thinks that Brett Kavanaugh could possibly be innocent is an idiot I've heard a lot of I've had a lot of those conversations I wind up getting disengaged from that conversation\nBecause\nNot because I'm afraid of a debate but because there's no debating with that mindset if it's he's guilty and there's nothing there's nothing you can say that'll make me reconsider that then there's no conversation to be had but I Do know Democrats who are who are going down that route okay\nI Know it will probably sound condescending affecting said are we talking about people that really get their news from different sources take all of the facts\nThen come up with a reasonable conclusion or are these people that are only listening to say news or watching news from one or two liberal sources frame their whole argument around that without exploring the facts from the right side\nNo you don't have to worry about being condescending 'cause I guess I can take up that mantle and go ah now these are people whose entire political identity is wrapped up in dank means on Facebook okay so yeah it's a sea or reading you know vox dot com all these the usual suspects when it comes to liberal online news outlets\nAnd don't actually pay attention even even to CNN which but grudgingly has to report some facts at some point right\nThat says yes there are some inconsistencies\nWith her story because from those people that really do try to measure everything out just not hear a sound bite or to incite yes he's guilty it's obvious no I'm Talking about really look at everything in play here I don't hear too many of them feeling like they got totally railroaded they're not happy that Kavanaugh\nWas confirmed not at all but also realized\n\nThere was no proof there was never going to be enough proof and I mean it came down to he said she said and the other people said we weren't there and especially again Dr Ford's friends saying and I didn't know him at that you know that hurt a great deal here is a crazy story switch gears\nWe hear about crazy proposals all the time this though\nI'm surprised she ended up saying yes and already tell you she does say yes\nBut this is what happened this guy thought here's a great idea and this is in where was it the Philippines\nThat I'm going to fix my own death okay and this is how he did it off to a great start well he put a lot of thought into it he got the local police involved\nSo he basically stage the scene of a fatal motorcycle accident because he rides motorcycles as his girlfriend arrives on a moped she sees him based down in the street with the bike\nYou know away from him and she started screaming in pain because there is life was on the pavement and the police than rush into restrainer and has\nThe story goes little does she know that this is about to be go what are the happiest experiences of her life arch\nSo one cop is asking her you know the victim of course she's trying to get it together yes she knows them and it's you know her boyfriend Jeffrey Del Rio\nAnd then you know there's another officer asking questions and then all of a sudden Jeffrey starts to show signs of life\nThe girlfriend a shopping and she's trying to figure out what's going on and about that time then Jeffrey pulls a small box out of his pocket gets up on one knee and smiles and says will you marry me\nFake does own death for a wedding proposal that's not bad yes that's a that's it by its original I'll give him that\nShe's still confused and so she just\nThrows herself in the arms of the police officer comforting her search crying again but this time apparently it's tears of joy and then she says yes he puts

from the c._e._o. of Home Depot\nCan laying down I thought he did a pretty interesting interview with Yahoo Finance about a socialism and capitalism and the popularity of socialism especially among my generation the millennials um and he was asked about or in a poor his thoughts rather you know why is that you think that young people are gravitating towards some form of socialism [noise]\nTheir first taste of their first knowledge of capitalism was going to do those that are they they were\nSay nine eleven twelve years old so capitalism does not present itself very well but that wasn't capitalism the regulations they was Dodd Frank that was the guy was going to clean them is a\nLawyer the bully Frank\nAbout nine years before that was a it was her in America right everybody to own a

at all they do they want to take advantage of it\nAnd go everything he laid out totally makes sense yeah yes comes in and says look I understand completely I think I've made this point to is that when you come of age and in one of the worst financial crisis in American history you get a little bit squarely about the system the system doesn't work for you\nYeah and you feel like it's rigged and all that stuff and so you hear a guy like Bernie Sanders talking about you know it's all wrecked the economy is great for the ... percent blah blah blah all that stuff you say okay that guy's making a lot of sense to me\nAnd so it's easy to understand you know why people would gravitate towards for whatever I ... it's easier to understand why they would gravitate toward the idea that more government is better but I think he makes a good point in that\nA lot of times the biggest problem with capitalism is when government does get involved in it when they start playing favorites and picking winners and losers well there are plenty of Americans in two thousand aid\nThat heard someone say we need to be held responsible right and those people are going to go to jail and\nPeople yes they should go to jail they bankrupted a lot of people's world one case the damage that would last for years yes they need to go to jail how many went to jail uh-huh that's the big ... right that's a big zero a way

there was a diary of the keyboard I blame the host about there's Susan Collins missed her moment to be a hero is what he said\nI was never so glad that Dan Rather was out of business I mean it just makes it tough for me when he interviews you know a rock star that I Want to see the value that now I got to get past this with Dan Rather it's just it's so\nCrazy to watch all of this go down that and you had Jen Psaki who worked for the Obama administration she's now on CNN um and she had to take yesterday again calling out Susan Collins that well she really just doesn't white women and she was doing it for the boys on my gosh\nAnd they see something or to me and went to see that and how she voted because that political power then I'm betting somebody who is pretending to be a feminist but that it's fake feminism and that's why I think that she's going to be on the Senate and twenty twenty if she decides to run again\nWhy do you get to decide what feminism isn't isn't why do you get to decide what a woman says or what she believes and whether or not that's right or wrong\nBecause we make the rules and whatever the rules are are the rules and it doesn't matter if it makes sense or not to say there is no way that you could call this an active political cowardice\n'cause arguably this was the what Susan Collins did the big speech that she gave on friday and then ultimately devote that she gave on Saturday you could make the easily the argument that was the harder way politically to go\nIt would have been really easy to stare down the barrel of millions of dollars that are going to be used against you it would have been really easy to know that you're going to take flak from uh from from the left from most of the media are and it would have been easy to recognize all those things and say you know what I'm just not going to vote for this guy\nBut she didn't she laid it out in a really eloquently written I mean it was a\nThe speech was great on friday she knocked it out of the park\nAnd explained every step of her reasoning and the problem is nobody who's against her decision wants to actually listen to the reasoning you come away with that and say well I still disagree with you\nMay find ... I mean that that it is what it is but to go as far as to say she was just doing it because the white guys told her to or it was fake feminism is disgusting\nOh yeah GOP women are paying attention to this if you don't think they're still energized to go out and vote\nThe midterms and and and explain this to me for a second\nSo Donald Trump is is can be can be a jerk to reporters we know that right call him out or you are fake news or you're stupid or whatever mhm if he says that to a female reporter he could say the exact same thing you just said to Jim Acosta but he says it to a female reporter and suddenly that's most sexist thing ever correct we've heard that in the last week mhm\nHow is that sexist but saying that Susan Collins voted for it because the boys told her to not sexist\nBecause these are afraid to make the rules bro I'm listening all these takes and it's like I and I haven't always agreed with Susan Collins I Know I you know look this is it's disgusting the attacks against or\nI I don't disagree at all yet the party that cares about women give me a freaking [laughter]\nYou are angry see the nice thing is whenever I get irritated your anger than it looks as mine laugh\nBoth as it goes into of course he is taking a a ton of flack right now are for voting for Brett Kavanaugh and liberals before you may remember threatened her before the vote raising money to feed her reelection campaign and twenty twenty she was on sixty minutes last night and then ... and asked about that by Scott Kelly ...\nThe legal was that if you voted for camping on the credit card pledges wouldn't be processed if you voted against camping on they wouldn't process the credit card numbers and something over two million dollars was raised\nIn Saint cloud quid pro quo and to find in our bribery lives there and ... is still\nIn it might not get when they were killed nearly ... million dollars is going to go to my opponent I think that our politics has come to the point where people are trained to buy food in my position than we are in very than play\nWell they talked to Dr Ford's friends tried to get her to change your story yeah tweak that little gadget you sure you want to make this statement you know you made the statement for you\nYou don't want to change it at all yeah let's and she's right about the bribe aspect I Know you're asking for the quid pro quo and this is great and and and again there's anybody believe that these liberal groups wouldn't be going after Susan Collins said she voted down Brett Kavanaugh\nGive me a break on that too oh yeah like all of a sudden Democrats or democratic operatives across the country are going to say no we're not going after she was in college because she didn't vote for Brett give me a break okay\nGoing to bring good news story and he okay thing I knew I needed one of the world yeah you hear the story about this army medic Louis oh Campo he left his home in Charlotte that was last month\nIs National Guard unit called them up to help with Hurricane Florence\nWhile he's gone someone broke into his house looted it oh he lost all sorts of stuff gaming system computer a bunch of other stuff and so as friends started go find me trying to raise enough money to replace everything so they had a five thousand dollar goal they raced Fifteen grand nice right yeah well we didn't want to make money\nLaura's panhandle\nSteel under threat from hurricane Michael let me be clear\nOkay Michael is a monster storm and the poor caskets getting more dangerous\nFlorida governor Rick Scott Michael blowing get Ninety miles an hour as a category one hurricane but could become category three a major storm by Wednesday's landfall although the governor says other threats will come first\nServed searches there will also be a significant threat of tornadoes\nToday's are typically that always but typically on the east side of the of the hurricane state\nOffices to be closed on Tuesday and the thirty five Florida counties under states of emergency\nOver one thousand people turned out in Amsterdam New York for a vigil for the twenty people killed in Saturday's limousine crash in nearby ...
