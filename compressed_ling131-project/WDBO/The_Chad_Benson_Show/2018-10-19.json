even if the packaging may claim they're washable please don't put 'em in the trash throw 'em in the trash don't flushing down the drain because then we got to send guys eighty to Ninety feet down into raw sewage\nTo clean 'em out oh gosh I Hope that job pays well I really do ... what would you bet on it says divers swam through wet all raw sewage fleet darkness [laughter]\nYou know these guys halfway down or they may just be rescuing those kids in a tie cave\nCould only do that instead of this [laughter]\nDry divers swam through wet and raw sewage and I feel like I'm going to gag every

come\nThey also removed a baseball bat somehow got down there and a big piece of metal but don't flush stuff like this\nYou should only flush never wanted to and toilet paper\nHow many showers would you have to take them to feel clean after this mission now they said they actually hosed down the divers which ... bleach\nI understand that there there are of course covered from head to toe but do

I'd never seen that before and so that's why I was like wait a second they advertise that way\nAnd so I went and looked up it was dollar shave club they did this like five years ago it was the one white Charlie they did the whole ad [noise]\nWhat's your talk to about one right Charlie yeah it was for ... is like mad sometimes you don't have time to get back in the shower so here's your one wife

and you had them in a multi purpose dude wipes uh this one man I'm Glad I found these you bet your bleep I Am [laughter]\nThese are all the five stars I guess what you got to do is find the one star right yeah to\nTo be fair uh they rip easily sometimes even when taken out of package baby wipes away cheaper and more durable I got these for camping but switched to baby\nWipes a fence either ... or the real ... maybe these do actually break up in the sewage system because if the complaint is on the air too easily maybe they do I not just taking the professionals word for it but people who had to go eighty Ninety feet and it appears sewage I'm taking their word for it wait a second\nI don't know that they're experts they're experts in cleaning do they know what it's really biodegradable or not they just don't want to deal with it again he made an action\nOr the other one star can't pull out a single tissue without tearing into shreds they tear easily many better options is another one\nNot

I I guess it shouldn't be because you hear about how much that sport holes in\nEvery time there's a big fight so I it just surprising to me that that a boxer though\nIs the highest paid athlete in the world are you familiar with ... or I have no idea who that guy is you could have told me he's a soccer player and I would have the same reaction right\nI mean obviously you know money may weather ... you know one of the boxers do you do\nKnow\nOff the top of my head that's why I think there's only so shy or something like that yeah the Russian guy ...\nAnd we were talking about this are fair credit cards was trying to explain that it's a streaming platform this deal is with\nAsian and so\nBasically the anybody that's gonna watch this fight they have to pay them yeah um it's ten dollars for membership for that company in general for any other streaming services and then I imagine much like Amazon Prime you pay for these special sites like a pay per view\nSo this guy could actually make more than three hundred and sixty five million dollars that's just the contract that is guaranteed money he could make additional profits depending on how well they sell\nBecause he broke the record of John Carlos Stanton who signed the deal with the Yankees Thirteen Years three hundred twenty five million dollars which showed again you can't buy a championship and now you\nCannot sense I mean you could end we didn't make that contract that when the Yankees I I I understand okay we just currently pay that contract he held the record until this deal gets ... and before that it was a ride with the Yankees\nBut again for standing by remember right it's not like if you hit a certain amount of home runs their bonus caches there well there was for a ride okay for all those so maybe yeah and if you get MBP is I think there might be punished cast there too\nBut I'm guessing at the end of it all with what this guy's going to make it's not going to come close to the richest athlete ever wow pretty interesting\nA completely separate story but a lot of people's Nicorette these old fossils\nYes they've\nBeen around forever already asleep they were billed as the oldest fossils on

buyer does that make you a question everything [laughter] hey guys well you know this is why they say you know this is ... what we theorized not what we know is fact and all but it's\nAlways talked about like we know\nYeah things this old\nAnd then it's like fifty years later it's like well we used to think\nThat but now we have the technology well this is only two years afterward but they use the version of an instrument of being sent to Mars guy and a few years to create this chemical map of the structure and they didn't have the chemical signature a fossilized life no that's just plain
