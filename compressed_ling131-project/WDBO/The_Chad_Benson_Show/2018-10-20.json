pizza joint yeah that does make sense oh yeah absolutely you got to get something to soak up the poison [laughter]\nSo what I used to say I had one of the ... the boys one of the shady as the jobs I ever had in college I got it and my wife actually hooked me up with this this ... local pizza joint in Denton, Texas and I'm pretty sure I only did it for like three weeks 'cause I'm pretty sure what they were doing was not legal\nUm but what they would do is they would bake a whole or they would they would put together and cook a whole bunch of pizzas you put it in a hot bag you know something to keep it hot and then you went out late at night and stood in front of a bar selling\nPizzas I'm pretty sure the health inspector would have something to say about it for sure you're going to say something about what your pizza delivery I Would deliver we'd no no no no no I didn't like that just health department yeah I'd say that you sold a bunch of ... this was to to get we'd money but no they would stand\nOut of the bar and you would target the drunk person and say hey man I'm selling for five bucks and he says it you could sell it for whatever you want you know you'll you'll make money after two dollars is basically what the pizza shop on her so you could put the price wherever you want but he was on a large pizza\nFor five bucks right there oh that was always wind oh hey man you ate buddy you want something to soak up the boys in something like that now I was outside I think it was called rock and rodeo\nIn Denton, Texas a cowboy bar\nAnd a standing outside and I had to be pretty good night real busy and that bar um and there was like no real other place to eat\nDirectly around there so I Would always come away with a lot of money always I did it for three weeks in that role but uh the last weekend I ever worked for the guy I said that line I use that line big burly dude walking out with his girlfriend girlfriend\nTiny little lady mhm and I said\nYou you want to you know you want to talk of the poison something like that five bucks for a large pizza and he just kind of laughed it off and he starts walking away this lady starts yelling at me like I've never been yelled at before in my life\nShe thought you meant something else she thought I meant something else she was hammered anyway he had to look on his face like don't engage just I Need to get her in the truck and be at home because she is wasted\nShe turns around and out of nowhere cold Cox me wow hits me in the face and I had some dental work done so I just wanted spitting out blood\nAnd it just it was a gory gruesome seen holy cow he knocked the crap out of me because I wasn't expecting and I'm turning around and get the beaches and she just walks up and soul mates me in the face what'd you do I what can you do\nNothing you can do in that situation not that is why I'm asking the dude wound up to the the boyfriend want to give me ten bucks\nIt didn't even take a pizza\nAnd that was my like an awful job and that was my last night yeah doing that [noise] it's easy to make money but man that's a lot of drunks you got to be all added a lot of drunks okay there is a nice story that involves pizza\nUh-huh I like the story a lot there's a guy in battle creek Michigan\nSo I'll start off here Julie enrich Morgan they lived in battle creek about twenty five years ago rich would
