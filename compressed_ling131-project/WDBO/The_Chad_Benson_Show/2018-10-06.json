falsely accusing a person of sexual assault is nearly as despicable as sexual assault itself\n\nBecause again one can think of excuses for murder not for sexual assault\nBut he said uh you know of course this has nothing to sneer at the second moment\nConnected the first is so many on the left saying boo hoo Brett Kavanaugh is not a victim so that was the title of a column of the Los Angeles times\n\nTo say you know because his whole life was destroyed you're not give me a break you're not a victim right so since when did the possibility of innocence become for today's liberals something to waive off with an art sleep on feeling\nBoo hoo\nThey said and connected to the second listening to Cory Booker explain that ultimately it doesn't matter if Kavanaugh is guilty or innocent because enough questions had been raised but it was time to move on to another\nCandidate he said that's the rhetorical sleight of hand in three acts you know\nDuck the one question that really matters raises secondary set of questions that are wholly the result of the question you decided to ignore I exactly and then call for another candidate because it will push confirmation hearings past the midterms\nWhich was the Democratic objective long before most anyone had heard of doctor for delegation\nHe just goes on from there and it I was astounded because it makes so much sense\nWell I mean when when you look at the process when it was announced immediately the hounds run least on every single thing this guy's ever weighed in on from a legal standpoint\nThey're trying to find a bogeyman in there somewhere yes can't find it right now what we wanted the latest thing till the midterms but now we don't have anything we can throw at it we looked at all the rulings we looked at everything you said\nNow we've got somebody that's popped up buying Dianne Feinstein hangs onto this since July right\nWe are getting the feeling now that it's like their\nLife that indebted to raise the yes that is plan B because of everything else blows up I've got this I'll throw this out there now when that doesn't stick then it's a drinking and temperament right that we have to deal with\nBecause if they're sitting on what Dr Ford said Feinstein yes and they're like wow we know there's\nThere's no corroborating witnesses wires potential this could blow up in our faces so we don't want to play this early but his desperation maybe this will play yes\nAnd that's what he's getting at here absolutely and they set forth moment\nWatching Julie sweating like the woman who accused Kavanaugh pretending parties decades earlier where women were gang raped change key details of her story in an interview with NBC News yeah that wasn't good meddling sir I'm from where she is claims border on the ...\nHoly uncorroborated but that didn't keep Kavanaugh's opponents in politics and the press from seizing them as evidence of crop ration with Ford's allegation which he writes ... which is not preposterous but it's also largely uncorroborated yes\n\nAnd with the Ramirez woman also out on corroborated again\nThe wagging right yes though for all the way [noise] that's the medical term I Believe [laughter]\nI'm always thinking about somebody that's got to get in the car yeah I Know I Do but if you followed the story you know what I'm Talking about it I got a ... a better way to do that to use something you want to suggest swinging\nWhatever you could do that shaking [laughter] and then he\nGoes on there's like five moments six moments these mentioning Blumenthal the reading about the Nineteen eighty four eighty five bar fight it Yale after the ... before the show [laughter] just on and on and on\nAnd then he sort of ends with being quizzed in recent days about my teenage years at a New England boarding school the subjects being that I must do something about elite prep schools in the mentality of the boys who attend them\nTo do it was a boarding school where I first form lasting friendships with kids have different races and economic backgrounds and we're liberal leaning teachers showed us how to think critically keep it open mind and value tolerance and respect I have no idea of Georgetown Prep was anything like that\nBut this stereotype of put white privilege that keeps cropping up in discussions of Kavanaugh's background is yet another ugly tactic in the battle due to feed him mhm\nSaid so in the in um I'll admit I'm feeling grateful that in Trump at least one big bully was willing to stand up to others\nAnd mad when I read that it reminds me of what we used to talk about in two thousand sixteen before the election that for a lot of people that felt like they were told what to think\nAnd what was right and what was wrong and felt like you had no voice all of a sudden you had a bigger bully that could put the other bullies in their place and that was from and that's\nWhat we liked about him absolutely he was going to stand up to these guys who had their way and it painted you in the corner\nAnd there was no better messenger for that than Hillary with deplorable ...\nShe thought you were just stumbled bums yeah she thought you weren't educated and wash masses so she was going to make sure that that to everybody knew that in and they did and they have ... bare knuckle that he was the first one to get in the in the minor with them do you think okay I can swing harder\n... Wall Street journal in New York Times also had the\nKavanaugh smear shows world deplorable now interesting based\nDon't have much time for that right\nNow when he got he got his big in there at the end uh yes\nOh by the way there was a poll done and this conversation has come up several times with buddies of mine\nMaybe it has with due to ... I mean I already I already know the answer with you I really don't have any friends but go ahead [noise]\nQuestion do you have any skeletons in your closet that might prevent you from going into politics whatsoever seat it's been such a topic of conversation\nPoll on it what would you think as far as the people pulled what they answered well\nHow many people think they upscale in their closet and just said yeah there's something in my past that would probably be used against me if it were suddenly in the\nPublic eye eighty five percent it's not what no\nNo it's not an who we run with man you want to guess again it's it's lower than that\nI was at least three quarters Seventy five percent it's only twenty are you kidding me that's a lie\n[laughter]\nThat is such a big fat lie [laughter] cowardly\nMaybe it's that does say something about being in the radio business since you know your in your late teens as we both have you been asked what are you kidding me oh my gosh ... seriously sixty four percent claim they didn't have any skeletons\nAnd there are ... mall I find that hard to believe\nTried not to sixteen percent not sure what do you mean you're not sure you either did it you didn't\nWell I think you're thinking okay I Wish I wouldn't have done a B and C but I don't know how to use the ... year before legal ages ...\n...

before yes do you enjoy it\nA ... yeah\nWell there were some people that were taken their family on this cruise yeah um but it was kinda weird because about Thirteen hundred employees\nFrom an Indian company called Campbell cosigned ... boarded the Voyager of the sea ship in Sydney for this conference\nBut once they were on board a ... not much of a conference it was a whole lot of partying\nAnd they invited a bunch of dancers to come on board well sure going to have that like all these were less performers dancers yeah so they basically\nSources hijacked cruised by taking over pool decks\nBars gay parade and they were left okay\nThey paraded dancers and women dressed as playboy bunnies around to perform and party on the deck a yeah concerned family so they were forced to stay inside to avoid the barely dress women dancing on the ships deck\nSome sediment also arrests other passengers would then film young girls on their cell phones oh boy if your dad used to all of a sudden punching people\nYeah or they want their money back you blame them\nThen maybe they should have been charged more I don't know what kind of entertainment man that's you know I'm Talking about the family I think that yeah they probably should it wasn't exactly the Mickey and many Cruz was it\nNo it was not I mean their tails of people like walking down the hall and doors to rooms are open\nYour shielding as a dancer way\nIf you don't have you seen these cruises by the way that you can take now with these rock bands\nOh they did they do 'em all the time it's crazy that industry has blown up\nYeah they get like five or six bands together I like the ... rock cruise with ambrosia and uh you know Toto and I mean oh yeah there's like a middle aged alternative Orrin Hatch but yeah
