first brought under a California regulation that require seatings for employees quote when the nature of the work reasonably permits it now this regulation goes back more than a hundred years it was adopted in Nineteen eleven and frankly I think it's a little sexist\nOr initially the regulation only applied to women who are entering the workforce in the retail industry um goes well you you you know they were the dotted dime was these women can't handle being on their feet for eight hours a day [laughter]\nOkay but it's California so they decided to let it ride and they made it apply to

cool there at the range I mean they're in the stall their\nLoaded guns all that stuff and then at one point he wanted a friend just trying to take another selfie or just pointed right out the other guy loaded gun and immediately one of the instructors comes in and just like both hands puts the gun flat on the counter in front of them\nJust like no you can't do that even as a joke you never know if you're going to ask Rey kill somebody\nSo they were kicked out of the range they are now banned for life they said\nCome on you got to be smarter than that right\nOne of the guys from the gun range that I've never had anybody point a gun at their friends had before that was the first for me\nWhat good is that one of those things you know I think most people you know\nThe sport the second amendment gun owners responsible mean chewing fun target shooting ... oh yeah\nBut some people it's like you know what I got to have all the photos\nOf me with gun rights and why is that is that really about supporting the second amendment or is that somehow making me feel tougher\nNo I think it's no different than somebody who's got a new pair of glasses and can't stop putting selfies up on Facebook and Instagram I mean it's a you're using the gun as a prop not as a tool and not as something that you just like to go do at that point it becomes your status symbol\nI don't remember you
