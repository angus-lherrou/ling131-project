tactic you can't say for sure right\nThe president gave a speech and it I never heard anything like it I've never seen any light get ... but in terms of being simply on presidents and the reason it was on presidential is because the spend that time belittling survivor again now on the record\nWhat is going on it's like he's asked a question like I'm saying to you David Hey what'd you think of that Yankees game last night and you're like yeah I'm thinking about going to ikea this weekend and I'm thinking about buying a desk\nYes can you tell me that this move from Democrats the question was can you tell me that this move is not a delay tactic and he starts talking about Trump's speech the other night what a joke this guy is\nI I Can't comment on that again what I'm trying to do it as something last night the president beach [laughter]\n[laughter] it makes no sense you're looking at a civics an ego way off topic\nRight so then Trump you\nKnow again it has nothing to do with this question\nWhat about the move to say that we have the goods on this guy from past FBI background checks\nYeah down here and they're not right now if there was a problem that Democrats were aware of before even the first theory on Brett Kavanaugh in the background checks [noise] why wasn't it addressed at the time I'm\nI'm not familiar with the town's background checks but I can tell you what I saw last week I'll give you another example damn it had\nA female nominee leave gay male senator on the Judiciary Committee about their drinking habits game would have been over that wouldn't have been that there's a double standard here in America and the other women and we saw that with our own\nOh there you go and you're all out of valid points for women's\nIts its war on women to it I it's just unbelievable that this stuff and I will again I'd\nDo that it's rare that I'll actually uh give it to the cat to anybody on CNN but I thought she did a good job of trying to get him on point rather than most and it's not her fault that he wouldn't get on point they tried to throw this stuff in the last minute and people see through it\nOh man had\nWe gone\n[noise] [noise]\nYeah I can get\nPolling out there that indicates that the ropes that Republicans are gaining ground because of in in large\nPart because of the Kavanaugh stuff because a lot of people do see what's happening right now and say wait a minute you're railroading this guy\nThat nobody else can say that he and Christine Blasey Ford were even in the same house nobody can corroborate that know and with zero evidence you're saying this guy I mean Cory Booker admitted it the other day saying even though we have no evidence this is about innocent or guilty he's his name should be withdrawn\nWhich is an insane message to be pushing to the American people and a lot of people I Know are on board the hard leftist Democrats are on board with that but I think a lot I've and I've heard from him personally even people who say Kavanaugh was not my first choice even people will say I don't like Donald Trump but what they're doing the Kavanaugh is ridiculous\nYou remember there were plenty of conservatives didn't like the cabinet pick fair because he wasn't conservative enough\nYeah were there were there were different issues like the wiretapping program that bad you know he was involved in that civil libertarians didn't like\nRight there there there are a lot of people who did not necessarily like him but this has caused a lot of people to come together and so you've got a lot of people especially to the right of center a new round of Fox News battleground poll showed that a Republican trend\nUh is going up there and the fight for the U.S Senate GOP candidates are helped by increased interest in the election among Republicans and pro Donald Trump sentiment there's been an uptick and GOP interest in all five state surveyed here um so that's I mean but you can say well that's just a Fox News poll right\nYou've also got a new poll from NPR PBS NewsHour nearest do those conservatives right definitely right wing homers right or so in July there was a ... point gap between the number of Democrats and Republicans saying the November elections were very important that's down to two points that is a statistical tie\n\nDemocrats advantage on which party candidate there are more likely to support has also been cut in half since last month Democrats have no real leader\nThe only thing they're campaigning on his hatred of Donald Trump meanwhile a lot of conservatives are saying what's happening especially with the cabinet stuff going on and saying you know what I'm voting Republican I I've heard again from a lot of conservatives who said I wasn't\nAnd I wasn't probably going to vote this time around or I was on the fence about it I'm going out now this man I saw it on MORNING Joe today\nAnd their take from a liberal very liberal point of view was the Democrats overplay their hand on this thing they did and I mean it was easy to see\nBut they really blamed it on that and they were talking about OK what Kavanaugh's through some I said somebody in Nineteen eighty five or he wrote a letter about his drinking when he was Seventeen\nAnd you make a huge deal out of this and there are a lot of people saying what does it have to do with now and who he is I thought the big thing was the allegation from Dr Ford yes but\nThere there is no cooperation there so what are we supposed to do so it looks like it's desperation people see through that\nYes they do what it reminds me of and it's it's definitely a bigger flashpoint topic in our culture but what it reminds me of is when there was a brief government shut down\nOver a over the dreamers ... Democrats made a big deal about this they say we're not gonna you know we we're willing to make the move to shut down the government or if there is no bill for the dreamers\nAnd then lo and behold a lot of people polled said yeah we're not on board with that ... even people who support like an independent a DREAM Act right even people who support that we're saying it's not really worth it's not an issue that's going to cause me to gain support if Democrats were shut down the government\nYes well in some ways you have the far left or the party actually splitting the party and what they've done with the Kavanaugh issue\nIs bring a you know far right and just you know slightly leaning right everybody under the same ten together that's what they've done yeah especially in the last few weeks [noise] um I mentioned the story earlier when it hit a real quick there was a real life home alone situation we got parents of the year possibly yeah or\nCan you see how this could happen\nThey happened in Germany man it's a crazy story\nCouple left her five year old daughter behind at the airport after they return from vacation\nOfficers spotted this kid wandering aimless lean alone like what is going on so the girl was taken to the airport police station and then afterward her mom calls ask hey anyone found uh my daughter\nAnd she explained that the family had driven home separate cars and each believed the girl to be with the other parents well you you got it right now you got her I don't ever\nOh you're kidding No Child eventually handed over to her father who had been come

he's happening here I think it's fine I I don't I don't agree with you that it's the only type of pizza is the only thing that should be called beat or we go out and that's fine yeah that's just wrong it's not wrong you know it is okay but\nThere is I saw this on kids you W. um this woman named joy ... person has been trying to put insects into different recipes for years now for the protein or the ...\nAh for boat to do says huge made pizza now with ah with little crickets\nIn it these are the people you're propping up by your your narrative here that all kinds of pizza or except that these people you're enabling hash tag build the wall hashtags wallet [laughter] but she said it\nStarted out a couple of years ago oh I'm Sorry I actually just over a year ago um start out with some cricket tortilla chips that you tried that you thought they were pretty good and then she said why would she started looking into the benefits of eating insects and she decided dry birth self\nThen you know she's eating ants she's eating all sorts of different bugs and she says that ah she just she thinks that people would try it they would like it if you will write a cricket beats a it would be fine\nNo one has to happen is you have to somehow think it was something else maybe\nAre you what if you put what if you put you like toppings or New York style pizza right Greg I liked that sure I'm not a monster what if what if it was a little tiny crickets on the New York style pizza that that makes [laughter] that sounds terrible that make them stand before you like anchovies\nNo okay have you ever had like the tortilla chips that are like black bean yes little specks on them or if you pass those out what the cricket and he didn't know any butter\nAnd afterwards you like best crickets in their ... that's how you you could actually say okay I'm okay with it yet but no one it's there and what would at least seemed to me be the problem well\nAnd that's her point to is a lot of times you have to make sure that it's not visibly a cricket if you want to get somebody to try for the first time the best way is not the and somebody you know a fried cricket or fried cockroach or something you just have to have a food that doesn't look like the bug that you're eating\nI'm Sorry that's just wrong to defeat means that without telling and we've talked on the show before about on my wife grew up in Mexico and and ate rat uh-huh young but I Try but yeah you're even into it you want it you want to try one of those rat recipes I Am a fearful every time I go visit her family that I Will be unknowingly served brat\nAnd I would be very upset if that happened it was just a warning\nI looked at the the reality is though you have probably eating bugs before and I'm not talking about because something slip past the goalie like red dye bought a time that rushed up little beetles I don't think that's true that is true I don't think they do it\nTheir story about there are there are some concoction that Starbucks that you might get that you would pay a lot of extra money for that may have different food coloring you actually made from crushed up\nBeetles wild woman had well she called them ... ships yeah the cricket chips and the samples were made with cricket flower yeah so\nThat's how you get it by the way that the pizza is it made with cricket flour\nNo this is actually I like

morning which one will give you something to sing along with you know where to turn when the\nYou know where to go\nBecause radio has been here all along\nRadio is part of your community moving into

intern in the office of democratic representative Sheila Jackson Lee of taxes well\nNow he's been fired according to the chief of staff there work for a whole bunch of other people since twenty four team this guy's been an intern which only in Washington\nRight [laughter] [laughter] yeah it seems to be so\nBut if that was a Republican intern oh cutting out the private information it would be ... it would be welcome to Trump's America\nOh dude you know that people need to be held accountable and accountability goes to the top and so on and so forth there's no doubt allowed I mean we live in you know and as far as Lindsay and all this passion he has\nYou know especially in defending Kevin already out it's like good for you Lindsay I keep that passion up when it comes to health care for [laughter] okay [laughter] 'cause I did see the story today of getting health insurance through an employer now costs nearly twenty thousand dollars and\nTwenty thousand dollar so a lot [noise]\nLindsay okay go ahead and get this done but let's make this a priority in the future if we can that would be really good [noise] um ... want to get to this story to you got to tell me if this is way off base or not I know\nAlabama football is a big deal uh-huh okay\nDid you see what coach Nick Saban said last night about some empty seats around the students section at a game last weekend did you see this um he's whining about it I'm sure\nBecause I'm thinking about well the cost of health insurance a lot of people talk about the cost of college mhm is crazy\nAnd I was thinking of that when I saw this story\nBecause this game they play last week was against Louisiana Lafayette not exactly a top twenty team right Alabama was forty eight point favorites going into the game yes so some certain ... you know not going to go ...\nSaid quote I can honestly say I was a little disappointed there weren't more students at the last game\nI think we're trying to address that I don't think they're entitled to anything either me personally I think it ought to be first come first served so they don't want to come to the game they don't have to come but I'm sure there's enough people around here there was like go to the games we'd like for them to come to because they support the players\nAnd this is going off what he said before\nYou say in my players were asked to compete for sixty minutes so he doesn't want anybody leaving early you should stay there and support the team for the game ... recruits are there and we like to see a full stadium\nI Know you probably are the king of Alabama but\nI still say who do you think you are you egomaniac state are you kidding me some paying for my kid to go to school there\nYeah All right you're playing a dog team and you want my kid to pay how much to go to this game right\nWell and I'm sure you'll have people well okay so ah there is a bargain price for I'm looking at AOL dot com here mhm they list out blocks eating partial season ticket packages not every Alabama student wants to go to a game is always able to do so\nBecause of the schools growing enrollment most students can purchase only a partial season ticket package many organizations Greek and otherwise receipt blocks leading preferences but\nIt's possible not all their members will have tickets to every game Alabama students generally pay the price of ten dollars per ticket to attend games but there's not much incentive to try and sell tickets you don't pay that much for\nAnd the conversion price to turn a student take it into a studio guest can be prohibited\nBecause if you want to offload ticket for example the upgrade prices they had listed on the roll tide dot com ... and it's different for different opponents so Texas a and M. conversion prize is a hundred bucks to bought that seat for ten bucks you might be able to sell it for a hundred okay\nAh Arkansas state thirty Louisiana Lafayette forty five dollars Missouri Seventy five\nI think the bigger thing is if you're playing Louisiana Lafayette no offense to that school but there are matched who wants to go watch that game\nOkay are so I understand so the student pays ten bucks or they're paying forty five they pay ten okay because other schools it's different they pay more mhm it's like okay I got other things to do I don't want to see this lopsided bore fast spray or money to come and support\nOur players work too hard and quote deserve to have everything and people supporting them in every way [laughter]\nI mean I bet it'll be packed when you play real opponents when when you play and em it'll probably be packed when you play even Mississippi State certainly when you play Auburn\nYou know a lot of people show up and pay and and show up and support the team but yeah I don't know I kind of reject this idea that any student going to the University of Alabama owes it to the team a show I don't I don't agree with that at all me a break [noise]\nAh another story out their new type of glasses that would force you to stop staring AT T being computer screens by making them look blank ... you would actually buy these glasses for fifty bucks because you can't help yourself I get into\nIt does it yeah it doesn't make any sense to buy another product but I bet the bill ... it's the it's called ... glasses in real life classes they looked like normal sunglasses but instead of blocking UV rays they block light coming from TVs in computers so to screen vote blank\nIt does it in a while myself right if you can't help yourself to turn off the TV or the computer what makes you think you're going to be able to just help yourself by putting on sunglasses when you're inside\nOr is that what it is basically they're like glasses yeah\nWell [laughter]\nFifteen bucks someone is going to buy and sell areas where you need to do is like yeah here's the glasses for the kids there you go you guys were ... don't pay attention to me right now okay [noise] uh and

gun I Need him to handle these poor kids got to do with the article in\nThe legendary got something going on today I should know about all the things I mean I'm for it but if it is today and I'm like okay there's ten different takes on the same thing\nThe whole gamut us as well and Kevin I was so I found this poll in hard that harbored did you know we've been talking about this who's gonna hurt more Republicans or Democrats if he's confirmed\nDoes that help the Democrats maybe not confirmed does that help to Republicans or does it help the Republicans it'd be confirmed conversely if he's not to the Democrats I don't know but here's something interesting\nSome of the findings in this Harvard things said this a majority said the confirmation process was politicized and mishandles sixty nine percent called the process a national disgrace so almost Seventy percent\nYeah and there were several that were blue blue folks blue boaters and said I don't care I'm disgusted by the whole thing\nYes so Seventy percent that tells you something Seventy percent said it was politicized and mishandled and a disgrace after the hearing sixty seven percent thought Ford was credible and fifty percent also thought Kevin I was credible\nSixty three percent sure that they should be confirmed so although they're the majority of people said yeah we we believe she's got credibility there maybe not all but some they're sick of the whole thing and they want it done and they want him confirmed that went down right now\nI just found that fascinating um if you're good at spin doctors going all over the place as to who is this going to benefit and who's going to hurt right boy yeah let me ask you this question did you\nGuys do you think it's possible for someone to say you know what I think she's credible\nUm but I think the capital should be confirmed\nDoes that make sense at all [noise] I think if you change one word and met his credible I think is she sympathetic itchy believable as if you believe something happened to her yeah I mean I think the word credible is very loaded personal\nYou do you think its credit that she's credible that the allegation itself as credible against Brett Kavanaugh but you knew how this worked all the way along right because I remember bringing up man and the hate comes\nWhen you say everyone's talking about she's credible this is before she ever testified mhm like is that because of her profession because right now there's no corroborating witnesses snow\nSo yes that is sympathetic 'em or you could even say I think something happened to her but there's not enough they're dependent to this guy right so because there is no other evidence yeah he should be confirmed\nBecause it seems to me there are a lot of people in that camp and no one talks about them\nSo that makes sense you know doesn't sell papers\nDoesn't move to meet her but do you understand what I don't know exactly what you're getting yes absolutely a hundred percent I Know what you mean I was carrying signs today I and I just got back here in time to do this [laughter] I\nLike Alissa mulatto or didn't sleep at all last night\nWasn't ... will let them a lot of didn't ... you know she did not cheese devastated by what's going on oh my gosh she said today for equality sake men can't not be called the women and men are hatched not born\nThank you Alissa what does that mean things we'd have no feelings called dragon mild breathing cave dwellers that we are\nOkay does anyone believe that if the Republicans would have said you know what a or Trump saying no we're going to find somebody else Kevin ... not going to be the person and they pick one of the other to the Trump was really looking at seriously do we think this would be any\nDifferent [laughter] no I
