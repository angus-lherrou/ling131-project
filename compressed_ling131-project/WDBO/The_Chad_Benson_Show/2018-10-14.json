addresses and law games and then just try the password password one two three because odds are that is what his passport is so then came out the stories about horrible pass for us to have and I learned something which is surprisingly I've been here between sixteen Seventeen years [laughter] I've never heard about password walking\nYou never heard a password walking never that's where you like you walk on the keys in order for you to enter in your password\nMost popular walked password is one shoe to W. E. three four are okay that's the top row and the bottom row and you walk with your fingers across ...\nAnd then some people they make it more difficult so instead of going down to ... to rose they'll go down three\nRight down to the actually the the third most popular is one Q A V. to W. S. X. which is worse to row\nAnd let me tell you something if you were to just look at that as a password he'd be like that's a darn good pass for exactly because it's not a word in the dictionary word at all and it's got like a couple of letters you know\nOr some some a haiku you know a gang symbol almost you know things like that and the and that's the deal but I think so many of us are getting tired of passwords um started down I mean and then you know so let's say you don't know your password well then you have to go through the whole password reset\nLike what was your a second grade teachers middle name\nUh [laughter] well that's wonderful\nTo choose to have verification is so great\nEspecially Yahoo I mean I don't know how many people are actually still using a Yahoo account but I Am for fantasy football and ... and only use it for fantasy football so every single year obviously I forget my Yahoo password 'cause it's been six months and they used it but if I have an Yahoo apple on my phone they send me a message through the roof and I can get in\nYeah and that's really the OSCE yeah the two factor authentication is easy I mean and it really is and we look at people who complain and go oh you know they're just discriminating against me because I don't have a smartphone [laughter] no they're not trying to set up security\nGoing to tell you something now my space in linked him yes they bowls since two thousand sixteen ... huge security breach\nOr you know in their ... can you guess in the category of brands one or two of the most popular passwords that were used

back to the phones we go with Tom\nIn Peoria, Illinois hello there Thomas\n[noise] hello Hi welcome what's going on\nWell the question I had had to do with a if any if you could recommend a website or a resource that folks in something like Consumer Reports for applications [noise]\nAh so you are tired or downloading apps that promise and don't deliver is that what's happening\nYou that's part of it yeah or I I ended up using an app or using a program to to accomplish the task I get done and I go\nThere an easier way to do that I have an example okay we'd babysit our grandchildren for the summer on Tuesdays and show I thought it would be cool to make a little book at the end of the summer that shit\nHere's what I did a grandma's house on Tuesday perfect\nI ended up using Microsoft Word and importing a bunch of photos and putting in check it ended up being thirty five pages long about ... used to sixty photos but it was a short it was really hard you know what I usually there are publishing program that maybe could have helped me do that better\nWell you know unfortunately with close to one and a half million apps right now\nThere it's really difficult to find any type of authentic reviews site\nA there are sites like ours that will do round up some say you know here at ten great photo apps but we would only hit ten out of maybe two thousand or five thousand that could be available\nOr icy if you're looking for a particular after you can always read the the reviews people are brutally honest about what they liked about it what they didn't like about it but Andrew I'd you used a particular site to put together a photo book did you not yet so we used to fly you shutter flies\nAnd because you know important fortunately Tom says it was a thirty five page word document that you could these but you know making photo books as a sense whether on Yahoo Photos Google Photos wherever it may be\nOne of the great things was I misspelled the word in the book no yes and we got it and cause I created a birth story of my son and I misspelled the word I called them up and they're like oh we'll just we'll just fix it and send you know one no charge\nAnd so you so before you look for a particular app\nThat only does one task is that you might want to look at okay uh what is it is John right out of work and work with photos maybe the photo sites will make a photo book because you're right putting it into Microsoft Word trying to form at those pages and getting that that\nThat's a complete nightmare but the other thing that might be kind of fun for you to do is Andrew what you did with the gentleman on fiber where you've created the animated book but that your kids really love\nYes and we I sent them real pictures bang we communicated back and forth on five or ... I think it was in the end it was nine original illustrations based on photos and I mean I Know the websites called fire but it's still only ended up costing like a hundred and sixty dollars for someone to ... to take months to make those animations\nAnd so so and so the next time you have a task foot in front of you Tom\nYes uh-huh call us okay\nOkay [laughter] okay I mean that's why we're here and or drop me a note\nThrough the website and I know this sounds crazy and a lot of people don't believe me but I Do I read every single do that you send me through the website\nAnd I've got a
