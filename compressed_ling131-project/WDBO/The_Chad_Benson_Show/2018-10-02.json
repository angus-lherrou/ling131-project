them attention tried to be the best you know pet owner you can be dogs need attention more than cats who talked about that before\nSome dogs and a new study says might even get depressed when owners over user smartphones I Believe it\nDogs become more anxious and suffer from depression\nWhen their owners overuses smartphones because they're looking at you wondering why you're looking at this little thing you're holding in your hand and not them yes and dogs read body language who said and they read our eye contact facial expressions all that stuff\nAnd so they feel completely ignored oh dear damaging your little dog when you're staring at your ah your phone all the time well see I play with a dog and I dropped my back when you know it causes other problems right but it's not for not paying attention to the dog yeah I mean it does make sense\nSometimes depending on how I'm sitting but if I I'm On the phone or whatever\nSo actually come over with her nose and like get under my hand it might kind of like flip up like it's time to go play yeah the cats do that to me to\nDo I really do nudge the phone to where it falls out of my hands ... at a certain point way usually one of them

something and cat will come up in ... in a bar\nAnd that's hilarious yeah yeah I understand where that happens\nNow we have a story it was an adult taking a whiz on our job as a mailman Memphis, Tennessee is where we go over this one U.S Postal service mail carrier was caught on a home surveillance video appeared that he was urinating on the front porches he delivered their mail and it's the weirdest thing to video to\nKnow some of it it's worked out so it's kinda hard to see what's going on I'm thankful that its board out I'm not saying I Need the until you [noise] but it just it looks like it's such a weird angles because you see them walking up a couple of steps on it as a\nPorch or juggle roof over it and he's just got a trail of liquid running past I guess like he's he's paying on the go while he's walking\nAnd reminds me of the different Amazon workers to talk about I mean I Would go actually in the truck yeah\nBecause I got to keep a schedule mailman has got to keep the schedule I guess so he's got to be with Amazon [noise]\nSo we just got to be on the go and so that the homeowner was telling one of the local TV stations box Thirteen [noise] um I have a touch my mailbox in the day sense because I'm worried what could be on it or in it [noise]\n[laughter] [noise] yeah because does he have any sanitizers that he's going after that now he's just going into kind

does that take here's the video oh yeah hey there Tom right there in time and we need to talk you're fired right such none you can't\nDo that how hard is that okay we got to get to a President Trump

[noise]\nBut is that going to be the one thing where somebody uses it as well I just don't feel comfortable yes and I don't know\nAnd I think the difference here uh this is where I think the president did kind of get it wrong is that he said I think I think that Kavanaugh was a very strong and the fact that maybe had a problem uh but he said he drank and maybe had too many beers but Gavin I was pretty firm and saying I didn't I wasn't a blackout drunk right\nHe did say you know sometimes too many ... yeah you know and that means something different to different people right I mean some people it's like yeah I had a few too many you know that one night I had five\nOther people are like looking around going five five bedroom lunch where I come from [noise] maybe a third of what I used to drink and I'm not you know I mean it's just that it varies person to person of exactly what that means\nSo then the rest of the clip drank a lot and\nSo I don't know whether it be big discrepancy okay yes go ahead please can you ... you know what you really have no ice\nPlease [laughter]\nWell he's he's fired up man he is I I think because you've had enough I Do not because what Trump Trump is saying what exactly do you want me to do about this right now we are the FBI investigating it he did say today again\nWe don't want this to become a witch hunt we don't want this to be an open ended investigation we don't want it to be a fishing expedition but you know what if\nThe FBI feels it's worthwhile talking to the three women who have come forward so far\nWith different vastly different stories if they are willing to talk with them and they should\nAnd Trump is still under attack for this I don't know what you would want him to do differently here but I Know I went through there and he said you know what people better be careful when they start digging into the past the way they have with Brett Kavanaugh might have some something else on the demographics of\nAnd frankly you take a look at that bringing up subject we wouldn't know about this over the last Twenty years Thirty years of his career you know what happened to go back to high school and they're saying he drank a lot one evening in high school\nKnow I I tell you what I happen to know some of the United states senators\nWho is on the other side\nWho's pretty aggressive [noise]\nI've seen that person in very bad situation oh\nI've seen that person in very very bad\nSituation somewhat compromising and you know uh\nI think it's very unfair to to bring up things like this however what ever the senators want is okay with me they're going to be making a decision what ever they want is okay with me go ahead\n[noise]\nYou know and I think I don't think he's be asking there because you know he\nWith a lot of Democrats that was what a lot of Republicans had against him in the primaries that well up until a few years ago he was a Democrat patted these fundraisers oh he was around with high profile Democrats all the time who do you suppose he's talking about Senator Schumer is a bit later I have a little white that split [laughter]\nDidn't mean to play that clip and now maybe here we go we got to have it on to find out who is the senator that he's talking about him somewhat compromising positions I don't know who that is\nWho is the first person you thought of yeah Chuck Schumer was the first guy I thought I don't know where to shock but well [noise]\nI've told porn chalk we don't want to be unfair to Chuck I'm just sitting there in New York right so they ...\nIn the same circles they've known each other for a long time that I'm not saying anything because\nMan Chuck kicked him back ... ... no I don't know Chuck Schumer is just from vicinity yes that's the first person you think of\nFor a while somebody you're sweating right now yes like uh what's he going to say well if they're real heavy booze or you might be able to smell the booze there sweating out right now so let's go ahead get this ... on it [laughter] just walk around the halls of the Senate and see who sweating out vodka\nAnd the thing is this goes on and on right\nBecause he's probably going to be asked about those who are you talking about yeah could you see I'm actually talking about that person yeah yeah\nYeah that's probably what I Do best [laughter]\nOh my gosh so interesting it's never boring Betty is for sure um earlier the show we talked about Kanye West make it a whole lot of news over the weekend because of\nHis pro Trump statements on Saturday Night live one story that's not getting a lot of attention but certainly caught your eye\nDavid I'm I Am fascinated and I don't know what this says about our news culture right now but I Am very surprised that this was not a bigger story than it is and It's Wednesday allowing Lindsay Lowell and may have tried to kidnap a couple of kids\nTheir heart was in the right place so she's in Russia and she followed a family a homeless family that she described as a Syrian refugee family\nAnd she was worried about the kids she thought the kids are being trafficked so she stuck them in live streamed on social media and the edge you wound she winds up getting punched in the face by the mom and she tried to grab one of the boys\nPlay you're going oh my God\nI won't leave and and I think you\nKnow you don't\nMind the game unless you have quite the way\nI don't know what that accident [noise]\n\nOh man [laughter]\nIt was weird because right after that video the accent went away I don't know why you just sheep punch the accent doubted her well I think she was trying to somehow relate to the kids and maybe if I put a little accent that you'll understand me better to help she was using some Arabic phrase is\nJust to try to help I guess so but this is this is a bizarre story and I just I I've asked a few people around if they'd heard about this and nobody has heard anything about it I saw a little headline but it's not getting covered that much\nUm I mean where's the media focused right now of course it's on Brett Kavanaugh and it's on Trump and all that stuff we're usually is\nAnd yes Matt Damon and I'm like guys we can spend several minutes talking about Matt Damon performance on Saturday Night live but you can't bear sixty seconds bird Wendy Long hand in Russia kidnappings and homeless\nReally this is where we are okay hold on [laughter]\n... he made the news because of the Trump Bengal yes this has nothing to do with Trump no till the media is not going to pay a whole lot of a day but it has to do with Russia ... but what is it a really about Russia we're talking about a former star yes\nThat the name doesn't mean much anymore in her mind trying to do something good if she's trying to kidnap homeless children yeah but in her mind that get out and do it all in favor I did see one in one of the few places I saw this the headline was the parent trap too [laughter]\nWhich was just beautiful [noise]\nShe's thinking I'm here to save the world I'm not a live stream this thing I just look at me doing good and things yeah MSNBC though is reporting that Bob Mueller wants to talk to her really just ... that was a joke okay\nBut you never know right now right Lindsey low in this part of your childhood I think is very close to you yeah somewhat yeah do you want to save her from all this\n[noise] ... not not quite the

it was a black woman [laughter] it would be worse\nThe truth is it doesn't matter black or white male or female when it comes to reporters he will go after him he'll make comments like that all the time we we know this I think it's like you have a whole collage of audio to prove it every time yeah\nWe don't need to get into 'em but it's one of those things than if you're a supporter of the

U. C. yes\nUh-huh mhm [noise]\nSo is that a pop is the last name a popular name and Belgium no okay there's about forty six people with the last name Maine is okay yes so sad\nThe guardian point out though that this has been an issue for other candidates because\nFacebook wasn't as big a deal back in the day or didn't exist for other candidates um there was the former mayor of Nashville named bill Boehner for [laughter] me also another elected official may lady garden [noise] and then\nThere was a Dutch senator named tiny and last name as K O X\nOh wow\nThat those are things that I've noticed that and then of course one of the greatest local news factors of all time from Fort Wayne Indiana Oh yes yeah people\nOh did and the topic so far with more than ten thousand boats his uh Harry balls government center named after one of the city's longest serving mayor [laughter]\nYeah it was a story for a few years ago the convention center yes\nCarrie balls was the mayor of Fort Wayne back in the Nineteen thirties and forties even serve the term in the Nineteen fifties right\nYes yeah there are people wanting to fight that was her I'd certainly more ahead this is [noise]\nNews maybe six point five ... you\nProgressive present yet but we should help you do insurance stuff\nOut of your budget to Boston\nWill do what you want to pay for sure and I hope you find out you know that you're going to get you know you don't you don't know I hear your budget oh wait that's just those kids laughing at me\nAnd of course the casualty insurance company at at the expense of protests by state law\nCongress is proud to host the forties that will Winter Park out in large festival presented by axiom fine arts the free time last hard shell has activities for the whole family that\nCentral Park on Saturday consumer Thirteen or fourteen Ninety five pm each day more than one hundred eighty for the artist will be on display among the live music the retarded children aren't activities sidewalks the local market in the\nFlorida distribution for more information things that aren't that double ... or men\nFor you so bring from E.

statement about him he's led I mean I think it was number one and just last it yeah she was number one in this law school at Yale and then what he's gone through over the last three weeks his incredible\nWell\nWho knows where the sense but I Do think the whole drinking issue is going to get put in the spotlight because in the end you saw the different analysis all we can we talked about it for a few weeks where do you suppose it ends it's going to be what Dr Ford says and then Kavanaugh ...\nAnd the people that Dr Ford says we're there said no recollection wasn't there even her friend we only geyser yeah that wasn't there so when you just play that out it's a he said she said and then she's going to be talking about how drunk\nKevin ... and his friend judge were\nAnd then that's where it picks up with well some people at Yale or say man he drank a lot more than he is leading on you know he's not being honest about that and that's where I think the media will really spotlight it breaks and they all Trump about it yeah they\nDid that he did live out his drinking does that mean you'll pull him I don't think he did\nLook here's here's what I'm just saying I'm not a drinker\nI can honestly say I never had a beer in my life okay right so one of my totally good traits I don't trust\nThey're looking for something that is I never had a glass of alcohol I never had alcohol I guess you know for whatever reason [noise] can you imagine if I had what a mess that'd be that'd be the I'd be the world's worst but I never drank I never drank okay but I can tell you I watch that hearing\nAnd I watched demand saying that he did have difficulty as a young man with strength the one question I didn't ask is how about the last Twenty years have you had difficulty last Twenty years 'cause nobody said anything bad about him and many many years they go back to high school\nI graduated from high school and and I I while I did not drink I saw a lot of people drink they drink beer and they go crazy and you know there were there were sixteen Seventeen years old and I saw a lot of it [noise] does that mean that\nThey can't do something that they want to do with their life so it's a very tough thing I I really believe that he was very strong on the fact that he drank a lot and so I don't know whether it be big discrepancy okay yes go ahead please can you probably you know what you really had a knife or you've had enough place [laughter]\nEnough questions not drink ... right I mean the only\nThe only difference again with with what how the president characterized Brett Kavanaugh as that Brett Kavanaugh was pretty adamant in saying I I was not a blackout drunk didn't have a\nProblem with alcohol [laughter] yeah I mean ... years saying they're already mentioned yeah sometimes too many beers yeah I don't know but I think that's going to get played up a lot yeah\nBut then where does it go and you know it's difficult to even have a conversation um if someone that has a different opinion on just whether Kavanaugh should be a Supreme Court judge or not yeah\nAnd so you really see people just kind of seeing through the lens they want to see through because if you're just talking about evidence what you're saying you don't believe this woman you don't think she's been through something terrible it it appears to be so\n... is there enough evidence to put that guy there you know it would be a lot easier to believe if Dr Ford's friend was there yeah if you ... that would give a a different angle to this story yeah I think if you have one other person who can\nPlace them both at the same house together on the same night I Know my my opinion of this story changes\nThat are brought it up before the comparisons that keep getting made to to Roy Moore for example are ridiculous because row yeah are you not only had people who heard about what happened or or what was alleged to have happened whatever a\nMany many years ago who remember being told about that by what was your namely Kaufman right skip a you're not only had people who were saying at the time yeah I remember something that happened\nYou also had people who worked at a mall saying Roy wasn't allowed to be in the mall\n'cause he was written up high school chicks people in Kaiser promote we understand since she doesn't remember Brett Kavanaugh you know is that going to be different with the FBI you know questioning her we'll just have to wait and see you know right now I just don't know\nBut it was interesting over the weekend what Kellyanne Conway had to say\nYeah and this got misinterpreted I Know you're going to be shocked to hear this by by outlook like the Daily Beast they they totally took her comments in a direction I don't think she meant them to go a so Kellyanne Conway open up better own experience with sexual assault while defending judge Kavanaugh so this was on uh CNN state of the union with Jake Tapper\nShot and killed fifty eight people and
