night\nI'm it's making some news different things that she has to say I don't trust the people in the White House is what she says and I don't blame her oh no but it's very interesting um but I mentioned it to you have a talent that may be few people in America have are fewer and fewer I Know I've been curious about what that talent is I I I don't have many talents so\nI'm curious now it's not that big a deal I'm I just saw this that less than four percent of the cars that we buy our stick shift okay do you have one I Do\nMean less and less people are driving a sick I mean I Know how ... but it's been a while yeah yesterday is one of those things where it comes back but it might be rough for a few blocks yeah probably just to start to stop [laughter] yeah but as time goes on destroying your dad\nYell and your head damage Kelly\nEasy but I'll be okay no I like I like driving a stick shift because it's it's it's fun to drive\nAnd also it sort of an extra security measure because how many times it it's at least twice a year you see some story about a car thief who tries to to carjack somebody may get in the front seat and I realize it's Emanuel transmission they don't know how to drive and they have to run off yeah at\nLeast twice a year that story happens and then you run into a ballet guy to do\nSo we've been traveling a lot uh recently and I'll be specific about it I'll just say we we wound up at a hotel or that the only option for the car was to a valley park I don't like the valley part but there was no self park option here guy so I hand the guy to key\nA younger guy a hand McKee he gets in the front seat of my jeep and sees better to Manuel transmission gets immediately out because I got to go find somebody else 'cause I Can't I Can't park this I don't know how to drive as I was a little surprised I never run into that from somebody whose job it is to park cars\nBy being too critical some say that's one of those things you probably should learn 'cause I Know it's less and less but this was a nice place [laughter] okay\nSome people you know we'll buy a car with a stick because they want the cheaper option yeah there is the chief of it there's also fewer things to break\nI understand you know if you were like trying to ... and all that stuff yeah but there are other people that want the driving experience especially with a sports car like all if you're going to get this kind of car you got to get a stick you know some of those are very expensive which I'm guessing would be visiting this particular place yeah\nIt's got to be at least once a week twice a week you know you got to park your car that just that great you would think so maybe he was new\nOkay maybe it was like he'd only been on the job for a couple of weeks or

fixable it's it's not as bad as it's made out to be just like leave it at that um what is the store with someone getting stabbed at a haunted house\nThis is in Nashville, Tennessee someone accidentally stab their friend at a haunted house there was an accident yes uh this happened in a place called Nashville nightmare uh people their dress up and Halloween costumes walk around the grounds tried to scare people of course you know the drill this was from W's ETV on your side\nAccording to an incident report for metro police officers were told that a group of four friends had gone to Nashville nightmare and while inside the venue area they were approached by someone who they thought was a character there Nashville nightmares as they also believe the person involved was an employee or who has since been placed on leave now Fox Seventeen spoke with a a spokeswoman\nUh and then another person named Tanya Greenfield who says the group had already gone inside the haunted houses in was playing a carnival type game when it happened inside the robot roped off area now the possible possible employee dressed in talking to and character\nI'm a ... walked up to ah the friends that have people who were there and they were messing with the people and playing along with whom she thought to be a character from the attraction apparently she was handed a knife\nDesigned on person handed Greenfield a night what you thought was a prop knife and the person speaking in character said well here's stabbing\nGreenfield only playing along and believing the night for the prop stabbed the victim Greenfield also said gee even joked ha ha gotcha she thought it was a prop knife again it was a real night and it was happening\nAt a haunted house what'd you pulled back she realized the terrifying truth\nHis arm was gushing blood all that there was blood on the night a hole in the victim shirt blood squirting from the victims left arm oh and Greenfield as saying I didn't mean to hurt the person I really didn't I was playing along somebody handed me what I thought was a prom night and I was\nJust going to stab a friend of mine has a joke\nI mean I really fabulous [laughter] but you're glad that everyone's\nOkay yeah everyone is apparently OK here now to others and the group or a man and or\nWhat the woman in the victim who corroborate the story about the prop night they thought it was fake so this the person is not going to be basically any charges at least the person who actually stabbed their friend because everybody everybody around and saying no they they thought this was going to be a joke\nYou haven't seen the movie game night with Jason Bateman and Rachel McAdams have you know I haven't I don't know I don't want to spoil it okay\nI can only say this right mhm yeah 'cause this doesn't really give away much a scene with Rachel McAdams thinking it's a prop gun\nOkay we're just reminds me of actually is one of the reasons why not now because I'm afraid of stabbing a friend of mine or anything like that I don't go to haunted houses I Love horror movies I've never gone to a haunted house before never\nI never want to because I'm afraid that I'm going to punch somebody and it's going to be like my the fight or flight will kick in and I'm going to wind up just somebody all jumped out the scare me which is the point of the haunted house and I'm going to like shove them or whatever and I know that's frowned upon\nWell chalk this up to the list that was okay back in the day yeah but isn't any more when I was a kid like six years old it was a terrifying haunted house our family went through was in an old jail\nAnd there was one of the characters is all mangled and and dressed up and it's right near the end and he comes out like kinda right at me look at it\nAs a warrant you and I'm like ah any actually grabbed me and then my dad grabs my legs and it was you know\nMy dad's kind of like playing along with the act but unlike terrified for my life now it didn't keep me from going again but I don't think that would be allowed much anymore\nBut I Will tell you this the person that did that to you yeah we'll never served on the Supreme Court I Hope they don't\nGet me\nA by the way there's another survey out you know some of this stuff comes out around Halloween like have you ever seen it goes before a lot of people took this uh survey mhm\nAnd what would you think\nHow many people say they've seen it goes before thirty five percent Mm sixty\nWhile\nYou're trying to be respectful I can see it but you're you're about to say what a bunch of cooks I didn't but but you're going to be very I mean\n... somebody who wasn't trying to be respectful would probably say something along the lines of I I didn't know there are that many dumb people in the country\nBut um women were twenty percent more likely to say they've seen it go uh-huh\nOnce again David trying to be respectful I can see like Barry yes but here's the other part men twice as likely to say they screamed and ran away when they saw one which is also funny\nBright but what are you going to do you get broke down with a ghost Kenya you can't you can't like punctured ghost in the face\nSo you're just going to run these is gonna run yeah right I have never seen I I Know people who claim that they have sensed a spirit or seeing a ghost and all that I just I've been on a lot of haunted tours I'd ever seen one I've worked\nYou know when I was Nineteen and it was overnight and I was the only one of the building TV slash radio group of people would say stuff haunted here it would freak me out at three AM you hear somebody like oh my gosh okay we'll get to this other ball coming up this is Marvin game show [noise]\n\nLand that was twenty four hour

biggest regret is that I never finished I'm sure they were they treated any of my walks down and read it could be any walking ... again\nMy mom always told me education is the key on knocking you dream that kind of believe stray has to do I'm not saying it's going to be easy and that's what makes every class every damn all the hard work\nAnd be diploma more rewarding and makes us all proud\nEvery stray student on meet the same day life has its peace in the mountains it's all about how you handle yourself to the valley\nDoesn't matter how long you been out of school\nFor the the first in your family to go to college is the time wants to raise your kids [noise] boy if you want to leave here\nGet it together as straight university\nIllustrated that ...\nStray or university a

imposed a moratorium on executions those twenty four team the ruling converge to life sentences of eight condemned inmates in Washington to life in prison\nThe latest lecture from Kanye West school of political science [noise]\n\n\n\nOkay All right the people are freaking out on line\nItem about just old by the man you got to just relax if this is the worst thing that happens in your Dave this is the thing that occupies all of\nThis space in your brain and your capacity to worry this is what worries you the most all day you got to find some new things to worry\nAbout okay I shouldn't even do this and it's almost irresponsible of me to do the okay to trigger you like I'm about to okay I just thought what are we doing here [noise] while President Trump meets with Kanye West and kid rock today\nPeople in Florida are struggling to survive ... it\nIt never ends it never ends I saw another there was another column and says that Donald Trump wasted forty seven minutes doing an interview with Fox and friends\nHe did that while people are suffering in Florida can you believe it yeah the president of the United states was addressing the nation via the most watched cable news morning show re in America\nYeah I think I\nLooked at how is that an irresponsible thing for the president to do okay yeah I'll go back to the premise that I that I brought up earlier in the show today what's that ... all these people who are\nThrowing darts towards Donald Trump for meeting with Kanye or doing an interview with Fox and friends are having a rally or like you did last night\nAll of these people also spent all day every day thinking that this president is on hand just he's insane and he's incompetent he's battered his job he's\nDumb all of these things so again if that's your mindset wouldn't you want him to be doing anything other than trying to help Florida recover from hurricane but of course that's not what it took out if we're just being consistent do that should be the case\nWill be all aren't going to be consistent kind of get used to be a hero remember\nRight George Bush doesn't care about black people [laughter] gun your wife the knows everything right you get drove\nAbout all this was if I read it right it was before lunch they hadn't even had lunch when they did this whole thing\nWith my damn 'cause that's [laughter]\nThat's exactly what he said well okay maybe that was out of context itself [laughter] getting launch around here [laughter] I've had enough\nI mean she meant I did see something that was kind of funny what's that okay [laughter] it's a side\nBy side image of Kanye West holding up his phone to the president and the ... that was from today from the oval office showing them something and side by side is white what Trump is looking at and it's the uh came crashing sex tape [noise]\nI'm really glad I heard that [laughter]\nOkay [laughter]\nSo as I mentioned earlier we were going to get into this fall talking about [noise] Americans thinking we're more divided of the country that ever [laughter]\nHe had to go on Twitter ... and go under trending Kanye and you'll see it right there uh-huh ... eighty seven percent of Americans say we're more divided than ever but Seventy seven percent say we can still get past that we can come together we can\nDo this there's some interesting stats here only fourteen percent of Americans fall into the categories of extreme left or right eight percent are extremely liberal six percent extremely conservative everyone else falls into the middle\nBut as the story goes that is true a lot of the opinions you will see cable news or on line comes from that fourteen percent ... because that's where it gets a lot of clicks or you know viewers but most of us don't disagree on everything\nAnd this is the example they put out a two percent of people in the poll said both countries still has a serious problem with racism is gotta highlighted today right\nBut ... percent also agreed that political correctness is out of control eighty percent would you ever guessed that\nWell yes I Would actually because I hear from both liberal and conservative friends of mine who always say you know you shouldn't have to have a P. H. D. and humanities in order to have a basic conversation with somebody else and with all the tiptoeing around of different words that are problematic and all of this stuff\nPeople are tired of it well you know I was having a conversation last night talking about you know\nWhenever you're doing whatever it is you know and there's diversity and race whether it's music sports I'm working together whatever\nYou don't see the quote divide like it's being projected through media\nYeah it's just people getting along and working together living life together\nWell that's one of the reasons why I said it before and I'll say it again and it why I get I I think that the and you hear it from the left and the right\nIn some of the more extreme circles on social media or cable news\nThis idea that we're heading towards the second civil war yeah it's not true that is fake news and it's freaking irresponsible for these people to be going out and then banging the drum because most Americans let's be honest most Americans don't pay that much attention politics\nAnd most people aren't just\nAre not going to be so obsessed over their political leanings that they're willing to fight but they're willing to go to war you're talking about angry people on Twitter yelling at each other it's not not barreling towards the second civil\nWar right well and if you think about what was on CNN the commentators talking about Kanye a before he met with Trump calling him quote\nFlorida governor Rick Scott surveyed the devastation by air\nThere's a lot of downed power lines [noise] there's a lot in Panama City there's a lot [noise] um so be careful about that there's still a lot of ground down trees and stuff like that to be careful about that\nAcross the Alabama Florida Georgia the Carolinas and Virginia almost one and a half million homes and businesses are in the dark no electricity storm was blamed for six deaths so far what's left of it is raining itself out over the middle of land that gives it heads out to sea with continuing coverage of Michael Richard can't to ABC News\nWith twenty five percent off on new and up to Seventy percent off previously refreshing you really need a better reason a party we don't think south or new correspondents are clear and center was more than nine thousand square feet of new and previously in these furniture and acorn for your home and now for those of us I'm One Ninety nine Ninety nine bedrooms that sounds really Ninety nine Ninety nine\nDining from two Ninety nine Ninety nine Anwar presented prizes and find all weekend long ... clearance are at one three nine for sex lead Jackson memorial highway or go on line that court Clarence furniture dot com\nMetro PCS is now metro buy T Mobile\nNow you get new plans with unlimited high speed data all month long all into the mobile network check out the new metro buy T Mobile today and discovered the smarter way to get unlimited metro buy T Mobile\nDuring ... customers even greater than thirty bucks for a month later this reduced immature customers ministry speeds versus some customers video streams forty one some areas the store for details terms and conditions\nFor Russia's present yet but we should help you do insurance stuff\nAbout your budget to Boston\nTo do what you want to pay for sure and I hope you find out you know that you're going to get you know you don't you don't you know dying I hear your budget oh wait that's just those kids laughing at me\nOut of course are casual insurance company in a person that's limited by state law\nHe reads the high bashing hotline good news bad news my family style has fallen out of\nThe old navy all maybe thoughts that dial on the ballot or maybe up to fifty percent off or why did well maybe maybe not going to be present I sure am I I think I'm\nFalling in love plots grab genes were just Fifteen bucks for ten bucks for kids because he's a letter to for from just Fifteen that's twelve bucks for cats newsletter engine oh maybe\nThat's an old maybe that would tend tend to Nineteen like only\nA few at Cornell Cornell remember where the partner men can count on by the way unless you're in Missouri or Illinois I'm not licensed in your state but that's OK are attorneys in your state or\nContact Cordell in Cordell to schedule it a point where it was one of our firms Orlando area tour NATO support their men can count on for zero seven two for one twelve twenty two online at Cornell Cornell dot com Mets Cordell Cordell dot com office in San Blake\nCordell unquote ill or Leno Florida at least ...
