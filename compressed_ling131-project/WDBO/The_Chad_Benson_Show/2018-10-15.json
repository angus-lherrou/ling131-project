gets a little uncomfortable but how does it feel to be at the mercy of someone who thinks a random taxed and more important than your life someone who take their eyes off the road was speeding\nAnd a three time hunk of steel breaking right well why not just to ask them to stop or better yet the Olympia to text for them it might be a little awkward but believe me laugh\nLearn more it stopped ... by the ad council and the national Highway Traffic Safety Administration\nIs news Ninety six point by your baby were Orlando turns first for breaking news\n[noise]\nFrom ABC News\nWere going on a week since hurricane Michael made landfall and President Trump and the first lady will go to the Florida Panhandle later today to survey the devastation federal emergency management agency chief Brock Long called the damage some of the worst he's ever seen in Mexico Beach Florida which took a direct hit from Michael forty six residents remain missing\nWith dozens of people filling accounted for here in Mexico based there are still in origin search and rescue going on there looking at cars in both in when they clear those they smack green stickers on them as they continue to look for the people who are met the ABCs\nYeah and if there weren't any party has been calling them out for certain come on there and let me let me let me will cost more because I feel like that in part of the weaponization of what's happening now on the right\nNow the other female Mary Catherine hand and then we get to ... with the weaponization yes it's the N. word UC the N. word is the next band word\nIn America you can't say you can't call it a mob don't ever do at home I have full it's all of the ... what are we talking about here why are you defend why why is why as a CNN News anchor defending\nThese groups of people it's\nBranding Baldwin man I always love to have the Packers she knows no and she's the one they're all a show some cleavage now and again and when someone is on the show and says boobs she freaks out right upfront\nUm and so I I Love what always happens here in this conversation is they bring up Charlottesville I Would classify that as a mob is well I went in and very sadly young woman had their higher was killed\nAnd yes that\nWas a mob ... the media also use that example as a this is the template for what all Trump supporters are\nSo give me a break with this we don't want to go abroad brush on these leftist activists more threatening public officials we don't want to do that you did it with Charlottesville right give me a break\nOkay so mad Louis then was later back on with old Don Lemon ah who also has hurt feelings about it being called a mob here we go\nOn it and how he bought people hounded me when I went out to them and you know it was their right to do it because there are American Don\n... they started following you around a restaurant and running you out of places ... and ... and\n... because I'm not an elected official no it's not my\nMan citizen or that and they don't have you with the way the ... the way the country's going in the policy ... there was we were saying that a man\nI bet there's just so many people in America right now that want to run for office or have that dream of being on the Supreme Court some day right [noise] yeah this is the path I Want to go when you say oh you're an elected official you get the mob chasing after you and that's part of it as\nPart other than that I'm a member of the media right I don't I don't feel safe or I get to feel safe somebody who's an elected official doesn't I like how he also brings up the Tea Party the Tea Party would also\nHarassed me that's what he's saying you went to go cover them do and I think Matt Lewis comes back with a with a great point which is these activists are seeking out public officials they are stocking public officials true\nIn the policy ... there was we didn't matter\nLeaves before you jump in in the constitution\nYou can protest whenever and wherever you want it doesn't tell you that you can't do it at a restaurant it doesn't tell you that you can't do it on a football field doesn't tell you that you can't do it on the cable news shows you can do whatever you want them to call people moms because they are exercising their constitutional rights is just beyond the pale\nYeah and they say that somebody making death threats against elected officials is just a protester trying to make the world a better place is also beyond the pale Don well ridiculous\nI like he goes and what the football field to uh-huh mhm right of course do we can protest right now during the show\nOr employer might be a little upset right [noise] you have a job to do to write [noise] it's so ridiculous man and the hypocrisy isn't crazy I mean you have\nA lot of government officials anything about their wives like freaked out yeah\nNot ... you don't feel safe around you have to get security yeah Rand Paul's wife was talking about how now she sleeps with a gun next the\nBed 'cause their husband has been the target of two different attacks\nOh yeah you got attack and then I lost a lawnmower\nRight tackled off the lawnmower and then also was on the baseball field winner due to open fire on Republican lawmakers where Steve squeeze was almost killed\nDuring the baseball field when that happened\nAnd he talked a little bit about this too about the the heated rhetoric in what you're hearing from the likes of Hillary Clinton\nNow who's saying like well disability can come back when we win an election nuts man\nSo yeah and he talked about it on our Kentucky radio show to gang Rand\nCurling people like Cory Booker said get up in their face\nHe may think that that's okay but he doesn't realize is that for about every thousand person that might want to get up in your face what I'm going to be unstable and other glib violence when I was at the ball field which basically was nearly killed the guy shooting up the ball field and shooting I think five or six people were were shot\nThese college was almost killed he was yelling this is for health care get a list in his pocket of conservative Republicans that he wanted to kill\nYou know what I was attacked in my yard and had a line ribs broken on pneumonia lung condition all of that we are people that are unstable and we don't want to encourage that we have to somehow ratcheted down and say we're not encouraging that volunteer ever OK\nAnd real quick remember how the shooting of Steve's college was covered it was a massive new story yeah but not to the degree that it would have been had been a Democrat but it was pointed out at the time and it was absolutely true well and also how how often\nDo to come up with the dude was Bernie borough and I'm not blaming and I said at the time and I still believe in now I don't blame Bernie Sanders no forever so usually not least getting shot and and the author getting shot and all of that I ... yes right if that's a Rand Paul supporter for example\nAnd Rand Paul you could never accused him of trying to incite violence it Rand Paul or one of his big fans where to go and shoot up a baseball practice attended by democratic lawmakers you it'd be it's Rand Paul's fault of course that's the way it would be covered\nAll right I mean there may be outraged these guys on CNN if they don't go at a mall it hurts or feeling\n[noise] give me a
