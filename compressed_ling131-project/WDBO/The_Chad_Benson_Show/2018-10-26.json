you this investigation you're going on two different tracks can you explain that\nYeah and this is what we have to be careful of you know we are such a politically divided country chit today that

to Nineteen Seventy one and the anarchists cookbook or you go to a ISIS a\nWebsite or any place that we can find out unfortunately\nHow to build a bomb and this particular case this guy must have had a bomb factory in his basement or a garage to make all these devices but so far nobody's been hurt now the question is\nWhen you look at these bombs you know some of them have some you know which we we know there's some writing in some pictures on them that are almost comic in nature that's included with a device if it wasn't so serious we know that there was an envelope at least one or more of white powder but\nWhat's an anthrax but someone who's going so far to get our attention look here's a bomb but it doesn't blow up here is a novel or a white powder but it's not really anthrax\nThese are all attention getting methods but it it seems like a the motive of them said the vigil is more to get back to the child that to murder somebody and we hope we're able to find him and stopping before that message flips over\nHere and just dumped tailing off of that I I just I was curious hearing you lay out the case that this seems to be just getting a message more than it does to be you know killing anybody\nBut have you ever seen in your experience somebody carry out something like this it's this orchestrated or at least appears to be this or distracted and the bombs just like accidentally didn't go off\nAnd and that could happen you know ... call back on bomb is of course\nBombers have been around since the invention and gunpowder but if we go back to Nineteen forties Nineteen fifties there was that got the name of George ... he was the so called mad bomber in New York City over almost an Eighteen year period\nThis guy do pipe bombs planted them all over New York thirty three of them twenty two of them went off\nA and then of course we know just a couple of months ago in Austin, Texas we had a twenty three year old young man who is building he bought five different pipe bombs they were used to kill and maim other people before he finally committed suicide so in this particular case\nWhere we I think the bomber the bombers have reached their juncture right now because you and I and other people are saying well let's see can make I'd be dead and that that all tend to buy\nDevices don't work I think this is the optimum moment\nFor these bombers to either come forward and tell us what they want us to do\nAre unfortunately uh build a better bomb and we hope to stop that letter\nBy Clinton I Know you're so busy appreciate the time there was one of the thing I just wanted to ask you real quick as your\nExperience as a profile or a hostage negotiator you understand the human mind and I'm just curious in your regular civilian life can you just
