yes okay All right well obviously we've got to get to the big news today like Nikki Haley resigning\nAnthony wiener back in the news uh-huh uh we'll get to that by the way that does your nose story

hear it more like yuppie like kind of a snob about food and I know I'll I I Love the bell whole you know all you know you need to Taco Bell but there's all like there's this judgment day comes down on me because when I cook because I like to cook at home and I like to use it other than salt and pepper\nIt's almost like when I'm Talking about food I'm like I don't know if this would be good to you because you're very particular about certain herbs and spices you know the all sorts of words that I'm like I don't know man it's good tastes good you know but they just released the best foodie cities in America\nAnd this was maybe one of the reasons why I shy away from the foodie term because you look at the top five here are and well to have a number one is Portland what's wrong with that and now they're ... they're interesting things to eat in Portland obviously but Portland across the country has a reputation because of it not in in a small part because of the show ...\nWhat a bird

warning seriously and most of the middle east are preparing and and trying to get out quickly\nAnd I can't take another day ah it it could be a ...\nI wouldn't say oh is that upfront about it but there was a job where I told the boss there I said well uh I have another opportunity somewhere else and he says is there anything I can do to get you to stay and he started putting a little bit of money on the table and it my response was no not really\nI Need to I Need to move on from here while and it was that that's all it was it wasn't bad blood or anything like that I mean I could have gone scorched earth I didn't okay I'm just because you never know who will come back in your life that is true that there was one bridge I torched\nBy never regretted it to be honest you know but anyway the euro that was back when you had the mullet\nActually post Mullen as post them all at the allow yeah it was the mole it in your soul though oh never dies [laughter]\nNever dies bro [laughter] no way no how All right well ... I said we get to the Anthony wiener story yeah you get to that in a second because there was another story out there ah from Business Insider and is Nikki Haley story just made me think of it\nAbout this guy that took a fifty percent pay cut and doesn't mind it because he loves where he works yeah this is a guy named\nA daring a Mac who left Google a couple of years ago and he took a half a world fifty percent pay cut up and pay cut that is and wound up a loving his wife even more\nAnd it's it's the it's the classic story about what would you rather have a higher paying job or job that gives you more satisfaction and what you do everyday job where you're happier\nOkay have you ever had to dig that you love so much you take a fifty percent pay cut no no and I guess it's all relative as an example if you're making two million a year fifty percent pay cut\nI get by and you're still a millionaire right and then if you're at fifty and it's like twenty five yeah that becomes a\nBigger chunk out of the wallet yeah I saw it that part's relative but this is still interesting yeah they don't talk about what his salary was you assume it was pretty good um so he went to go work at the start up a and as the story goes even though he'd be taken a fifty percent pay cut the temptation to lead Google was strong\nBut he was still concerned you wouldn't be a good fit for the new company a which is a tech company that facilitates payments doing freelance workers and companies they work for\nUs so we told the company is called Quil told the c._e._o. that he had his eye on her return video game industry where I work previously you said I told him I Would feel bad if I joined it ended up wanting to leave after a year\nNow the boss and the bosses response to that made this guy want to go work for them because the response from the boss said if we can keep you happy enough to stay for more than a year that's on us\nThey love the worst time I ever felt like a company not just the people in it would share the responsibility of my employment and it's something I didn't even realize I needed man now I Will say I've never worked for a company that said that to me either\nNo have you ever known anyone that say worked at a fortune five hundred company was doing really well in the corporate world\nAnd left it to do something that they thought would just be more fulfilling yes in their soul and they took a huge pay cut\nAnd they actually ended up to be happier\nI I Know there was one person a longtime family friend of ours who had worked in the telecommunications industry\nOr for like a major cell phone company decided that pretty high up in the corporate ladder making a ton of money or what was miserable because it was I mean you're talking eighty hour work weeks at least you have no vacation time to ... or you have the vacation time just can't take it right because all the responsibility um she wound up quitting her job\nAnd moving to Santa Fe 'cause you want to be an artist\nSo he regrets a well\nThere were five and there were some financial [laughter]\nI don't think it worked out quite as well because Santa Fe a little more expensive and I think people realize it'll it'll be winning in there are before they get there but uh I don't think that she regrets it at all\nShe looks happier I've talked with or a few times and it's it seems like she is happier it's it's a harder life because they don't have the money anymore but they used to yeah but it's fulfilling well\nI've known people that went the quote fulfilling route and it worked out okay I've known others that the fulfilling route wasn't everything they thought it would be there either yeah it's like man can I meet somewhere in the middle yeah well not nothing is perfect that's what I don't know or you make a huge\nLife change one way or the other you have to realize that the grass is always greener I mean there are still brown spots no matter how much you want to be on the other side of the fence\nWell said that I find all that stuff very interesting and that is a long conversation about why did Nikki Haley quit that gig [noise] not quite sure um I suppose really the Santa Fe to become

play\nBy doing this if you're not going to run I don't know because it just because you need to be in the spotlight well I guess that's true\nIt's it's gotta be 'cause I don't know any I really don't I Know a lot of Democrats who like Hillary Clinton who wanted to vote for Hillary Clinton wishes that she had won the presidency right but I have not heard personally at least\nFrom a single Democrat who wants her out on any campaign trail and I know this is after the midterms this particular thing they don't want her to be\nIn the spotlight at all because it just goes right back to that twenty sixteen election and just bad memories and for a lot of people you know the line as bad [laughter]\nBeen she lost to a game show host [laughter] I mean we've heard that from Democrats\nAnd so I I buried there is a lot of there are a lot of hard feelings I think and it's not even that they're all just angry with Hillary Clinton but they're recognizing that her brand is toxic to the Democrats\nYeah back up you create [laughter]\nStrong words for you David I'm Sorry Adam secretary I'm just trying to analyze the day's news here is weird and the me too movement to that they're going to be charging seven hundred and forty five dollars a pop or to to speak in front of a crowd and you know Bill Clinton hates being asked the questions ... okay\nYou had a lot of liberals after her when she chose not to terminate a campaign staffer accused of sexual harassment was that whole thing and then it's all this stuff again because the comparison in\nThe meat to era goes back to Bill Clinton yeah and the way those accusers were treated\nRight and it's and it's even if you don't even if you don't believe you know they're very serious allegations from Juanita Broderick\nIf you believe just sexual harassment allegations and then also we know what happened with Monica Lewinsky yeah isn't that the power dynamics thing which is also part of the me too movement which is apparently something that is bad for people to be a it's a bad way to conduct yourself\nThough I mean I Can't imagine that allow or got fired for less\nYou better believe it I mean it due to its vox I mean it goes on and on all of these liberal outlets I mean don't want any part of her she's not going to get the support\nThere is not going to be the coordination van right I mean is this like just sort of testing the atmosphere right now for them\nI think you could also be just they want to make money they've always been really good at making money\nI yes I mean obviously I Know that and then others so many people the first thing I think of is don't you have enough for people like that\nNo you always have to be involved it's it's the idea of the power of being in the in the spotlight is the origin ... like more than the money um\nYou know what sometimes you get frustrated here and some of this stuff and we do Clinton says about with a nice story yeah I Want to do that just real quick
