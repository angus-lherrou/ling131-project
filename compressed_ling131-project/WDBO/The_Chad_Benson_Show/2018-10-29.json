the crowd\nAnd so this actually went to a violent attack whoa do what happened was uh at first the woman who Russell the paper\nWas confronted by a young man nearby grabbed the baggage gum from her and throw it on the floor\nHang on a second\nSo I make sure that I'm following it wasn't that she was gone it loud and more and more and it's not none of that there was a ... right\nBut it's a bag apparently it was a bag of gum okay and so then the guy takes the bag and throws it on the ground and so the white ... percent body but everything apparently seemed fine and then the woman though she was just lying in wait because ten minutes later as the crowd was applauding\nThe gum cure\nSmack the glasses off the man's face turns around and ... pops him in the face okay now her male companion wound up Berlin down with another guy in the crowd he got no choice\nRight well he's got to defend her on her now you got that one of those situations where it's like well [noise] I knew she was a

president and the president he said quote make no mistake despicable acts of violence and harassment are being carried out by radicals across the political spectrum not just by one side\nRegardless of who was responsible these acts are wrong and must be condemned by Democrats and Republicans alike period I agree with that I agree with that to your soapbox but call Hillary Clinton\nSaying knock it

[noise]\nBut yeah good times everybody's got great character is through adversity it gets absolutely revealed mhm everybody every individual has you know their own things to answer for with either what you post what you say all of that right mhm\nSo when the blame goes to one guy who is all Trump Trump sorry hold on a second\nThere are things that have been going on for years or eight years let's not blame one person for the state of where we're at right now\nThis has been part of us for a long time and it's just getting exposed and I think when you're talking about social media man one of the things the right upfront exactly there are a lot of different things the world we live in now you can't blame one person you know give me a break with that so\nBut the story is hardly do stand up they both collectively need to stand shoulder to shoulder look in the camera and say enough\nI normally agree and like and\nAnd I'm Talking about anti ... out of all the jobs that is writing about law\nStop it stop\nBut it does get to be okay there's also got to be law and order yes that's what people want right and then you've got this caravan coming yeah\nAnd it's what a political issue it should be simple there's got to be law and order and I mentioned that another one started I Know will be another one after that and another one after that you know a completely switching gears um played this for David earlier and you should hear this Scott\nBecause yesterday David at the story about millennials saying they have the TST from the last election but like twenty five percent\nYeah but that's also because you're you got people during the pot on social media all about it's time to take a step back from all of it\nAnd just realize that your life isn't that bad it was the survey from Arizona State university ... where they yes a quarter of the respondents said that they had P. T. as the when you have this guy George Jones is combat veteran a double whammy tea\nYeah he defused bombs that was his job in the military he suffered from the TST right and he was on Fox and brings this morning and Fox and friends asked him about this particular story that it was interesting 'cause he starts off by kind of explaining what we know about pi TST right now and why it affects particularly combat vets because he says it's not just\nThe act of being in combat a lot of times you have other underlying issues that wind up getting exposed I'll just let him explain to\nPoison first of all I'm most stress disorder as a as a negative thing it's something that a lot of men and women suffer from because they were put into a traumatic experience\nBut when we really started to pull back the layers on these thousands of military service members who are diagnosed with peaches see what we learned is that it's a it's a dramatic and it's a boy a misnomer across the board when Paul peeled back the layers of the onion these men and women ad\nTraumas a child they had a divorce they are things that happened in their social whereas with the people they care about before they ever went to war what happens is war kind of rich that scab off\nAnd it reveals these things we have a lot of people diagnosed with David ever went to war [noise]\nSo what I'm getting at is this misdiagnosis this let's let me take that\nThe banner and put it on them all life is creeping into our civilian lives as well so you know I have people claiming to have posttraumatic stress disorder because they felt this comfort and uncertainty and I tell you something what these people tell me a self imposed stress disorder but it's the equivalent to a bad hair day\nHe's right this is a bad hair day is one hundred percent right go through words have lost their meaning mhm I've gone over this a hundred times these words used to mean something post traumatic stress syndrome meant something you know it means bad hair day as he just said\nWell I get triggered it and I have a ... I mean my gosh man I feel like I'm facing a challenge right now yeah and there's uncertainty that's not the tea as the you know that's the reason to drink it's keeping things in perspective\nThen there's a follow up here but I I think is interesting\n... what is your message to the stats are claiming ... seen that a war that had friends in body bags yeah\nAbsolutely listen you can take your study or degrees are entitled opinion and claimed whatever he was like\nWell this country needs are men and women are strong line is strong faith that to serve this country and fortunately those are the people who are truly have suffered from the uh but thankfully there are strong enough and we believe in them and that that will get them through it uh men and women recover daily from disorders of post traumatic stress\nA and simply being upset over an election in my opinion doesn't raise something like that\n[noise] well said perfect thank you where do you add on to that not\nA real quick I

T. six andme with one hundred eighty nine passengers and crew aboard ground control was lost contact with the Boeing seven thirty seven shortly after take off from Jakarta on what we're supposed to be a domestic flight\nABC News aviation consultant Steve danger to retired Marine aviator says foul play possible\nWe have some very interesting flight data that showed that the aircraft dropped off radar very very quickly with a very small what to say and then nothing and so we just got to go back and look and make sure that there is not an all it's not the most likely scenario at this point but it's definitely a possibility\nOkay because you know one of the parts of this story especially with CNN it says it was handled by a courier\nYeah ... and it's and\nIt's it's interesting because well CNN\nLocation on that last mile delivery to pick on the postal service but you can it's not a liberal or less populated area right but it does raise the question of what kind of\nTraining on the private carriers have in terms of at this stage of processing as well as individuals getting ready to deliver the package on to try to detect suspicious items\nIt just seems weird to me as as we've been following this story you see the packages or you see the the images of these packages and they're just in on below person you're talking about training a little bit it seems like excuse me if you have something being delivered\nA to a place like CNN right as with everything going on and all that and there is a bulky package it's not like in a box that you can feel something how exactly what a courier\nAnd you know dropping it off how would they are how are they supposed to respond to something like that are they supposed to raise the red flag or are they supposed to be worried about it or just buy whatever my job is to drop off his back and you go\nWell part of the problem too is that they handle such a high volumes and it's that it's difficult for them to to on you know be\nAble to catch you know suspicious packages at every step of the way but it does argue that it's better to think about how to try to have the technology capabilities as well as a trained troops now at the distribution center it's promising to the centers um they may be looking not only for\nDetecting no chemicals like pattern it you know on particular types of packaging but also even non believes in the house the packages being at his address\nIt started with lowest Davis she's the senior policy researcher at the RAND Corporation you know to just make it like a very simplistic sort of question\nWas are you surprised that a package to like what we've seen here that was delivered to CNN with this you know to be in like this this on below um made it all the way through to the office there does that surprise you\nAnd it's it is that's why on\nThis survey and that that that's something like that whether detected earlier on in the process the stages but also\nIt it doesn't surprise me since then on the middle and you know for example on have such a high volume of being out my period both private couriers postal service and get it raises the question about what kind of training the technology\nOn do they have to detect suspicious packages and I'll say to a degree are they coordinating on their training and in Syria on so I think in this\nCurrent environment it's something that we need to take seriously and and and take a look at what is being done on in terms of de detection and chicken handling it pushes no\nYeah I think you know lowest it's your buddies look into say man people are doing their jobs it's just\nTo the common person the oh my gosh how did this actually get through that that that is crazy\nRight right now it's it's very unsettling and um you know it's it's definitely underscores and\nThen they had for particular on it's not just on\nPolitical targets but also we've had examples in the past of course but everyday citizen and it becomes targets right the bonds and it really is on something that\nOn\nThe News Corps the need for it of social service on have done a pretty good job but we're on in their detection and training in this area but also to on credit private carriers\nTo look at their training and to see what kind of coordination needs to be done with the postal service says say now are part of the same delivery system\n... lowest thank you so much you know you're busy today at the time to talk with this lowest David senior policy researcher at the RAND Corporation a hope you have a great day thanks lowest thank you so much\nHarder to care very nice yeah and she mentioned the or the technology aspect more than the mail carriers are more mail carriers I should I guess what I'm kind of getting out here what seems weird is I have to put my shoes through an x-ray machine at the airport yeah but there's no scanner\nKind of alluding to either she ate that she says she's being nice you know what I mean and we're actually seeing how the heck does is this is either ... can't do their job or we got something totally jacked up the security how does it not detect this stuff\nYou know and so they're saying now yes this suspicious package was not mailed it was dropped off by a courier\nUh and so then you also have to follow up questions why the postage stamps all of that stuff is just supposed to look like it was through the mail so that it wouldn't raise detection because if you get a package and you're just going through everything you don't necessarily think oh jeez this isn't this isn't stamping signed off on properly you're just thinking oh it's a package that I'm getting in the mail\nBut before he goes out but that also would mean that a lot more people are involved in this than just one not absolutely oh more questions than answers as we get through all of this stuff that I\n\nGet this doesn't add up man I'll put it this way if it does add up all the at this could just happen you know it's even more frightening\nOh we got a bigger problem and yes absolutely that's terrifying if it can just worked out this way if some dude wherever he is just put this in the mail and go\nOr just randomly hire people on Craig's list to drop off packages like there's yeah there's a bigger problem\nAnd then you know the one thing that at least we haven't heard yet\nOr maybe you've seen is that I just have it is okay they're taking these devices somewhere they're examining them\nBecause the the first thing we heard they were like active like ready to go yeah thank God none of them have so I mean\nWe'll know I guess in time what does this sophisticated is a very just simple things were they dodge where they supposed to go off at a certain time we don't know so that's all the stuff that we're trying
