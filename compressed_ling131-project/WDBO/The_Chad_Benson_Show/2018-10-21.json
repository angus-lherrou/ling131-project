I don't want to name a possible out your boss will sponsor a future sponsored so I'll just say there's a place it is called but narrow bread [laughter]\nI was talking and code and they have their yesterday [laughter] have amazingly delicious food yes did the Greek salad ... invest out I've ever had booked\nEvery single time they ask you if you would like to tip the person that is just standing there at the register\nSo because of an era I developed the seven foot wall with that if you have to go farther than seven feet I Will tip you\nBut if you don't [laughter] I Am probably not going to do that if you're just taking my credit card right my apple pay my Samsung Pay a farmer's market I bought spinach pasta\nWas twelve dollars for one thing of pasta\nAnd they asked they asked for a tip on the app that you tip of course not\nOkay so my hair stylist lovely lovely young woman named Nicole\nAnd you know like a lot of hair stylist she she rents her station right\nAnd so this is pretty much her business well it is for this and what I Love about the call is she treats her\nStation like it is a business so she's professional sheets on time if I say I need to get my hair done this afternoon show part the water or she'll make it happen and and for somebody her age to have this type of business jak humanity something she uses a square\nPeg into you know when you pay and so you don't go to the front desk for anything anymore and so I was talking to her and she had it set up that if after you get your hair done and you can tip ten percent Fifteen Percent or twenty percent [noise] so I told her I said\nYou know I said you got this all rock and she's like what do you mean and I said you know research has shown that whatever you put in the middle that's what people are going to have and\nThere'll be a certain percentage that will that you can guilt them into going to you know the third call it which is really the goal of all businesses fail that people out of more money Seinfeld explained to her I said so\nYou know you're married you got a two and a half year old and a ten month old little pictures up there the kids you know and they you know and they're trying to get to they need new you know they're getting ready for college and their cheek bones we can really hungry [laughter] whatever it may be\nA said seriously research has shown so instead of doing ten Fifteen twenty per cent on just do an experiment for me do twenty twenty five percent and thirty percent\nAnd see if anybody says anything so I get my hair done every six weeks right I'd go back six weeks later and I felt so out of work out she goes oh my gosh everybody's tipping twenty five percent and\nSome people are going like thirty percent\nBut ... isn't that different though because that industry has a history of gratuity\nBut if the psychological aspect of the way that it gets presented on this great so when you're a bone marrow\nDo you tip yeah really I Do that's why they keep asking because people like you keep tipping okay\nHere's the reason why gay many many moons ago I worked at ... which is a bar like Houston ... and when you will eat table and I also waited tables and when I was at ASU\nAt a sports bar downtown tempting when you wait tables and you're a waitress you suddenly appreciate all the work that somebody that\nI understand but that's not their role at that so if you're at target would you tips the person who was checking you out at target not the guy who was checking out the person that I was working the register no of course you want but if I had but ... okay\nBut sometimes they do like I was at the gas station the guy but Aaron my tires and it and he was using square and I got gas and he said in and said like ten percent for air and the tires and I'm like am I supposed to tip the gas station guy now what does that but you're absolutely right there are some places where it's I don't think just because they handed me a muffin\nThat if I mean that's part of me going there you know there's a a there's the Starbucks I was at the Starbucks in Honolulu and I'll never forget\nThat ... percent like eight hundred dollars or something and they had to tip jars\nOkay and so you know not only can you tip on the receipt but they actually had tip jars right one was once and for all you Android people\nAnd the other ones had for all you iPhone people and the iPhone tip jar with like overflowing [laughter] and the Android One didn't have anything\nYeah I was at a a video game thing and they said if you think the X. box sucks to appear if you think the PlayStation ... it's just a ploy it's just like you said before guilt and people out of their money\nAnd now let me tell you something I Can't imagine I don't know why that you chose that over me but for everybody who is not a regular listener Jackie was my assistant for over ten years and she became a dear dear friend of mine and we put up with her husband how just because we have to honor\nThat and they are they retired they sold all their worldly belongings and they put it in a bus which is how big the bus\nForty five foot and behind that you have your hot rod\nYeah well we have a twenty five foot trailer that we all her car and which is a um an eighty to ... an oath to core but\nOkay so you get when you say everybody has the picture and um I I thought you guys were coming back to Phoenix I heard\nYeah we are right after Thanksgiving we're heading that way we are in our last month and a half year\nAnd so what what has been like a really great thing that has happened the last year that you guys been arguing\nAll the great things I mean every day's and adventure and what we're doing um but I guess one of the highlights a has been for us this year when we got to Wisconsin this year as you know we have ... you don't know we have a full size a refrigerator\nAirbus and if you decided to die when we got to Wisconsin\nThat I have to understand we're up in northern Wisconsin and they are the places are few and far between up their\nOpening assistance can take care of this thing was a quite a challenge and of course we went online and um we got some help from our forum friends that are out there kind of doing the same thing we're doing\nUm the the question was going to be if we are going to replace this how do we get this thing out of the bus I mean this thing you feel like so uh the last we heard or was that we have to take out the side windows check on the door\nAnd pick up outside and basically toss it out the window I'm [laughter] short generally that didn't happen because some very smart person on the Internet said you should check your mother board in the refrigerator while\nIt's very possible that if you change the mother board you'd be back in business and sure enough that's what we did and that was that\nThat was it ... it was it was it was an ordeal et cetera and bought a an eight or eight inch pedestal and of course of the things quite heavy so getting it out and even during the repair it was a challenge but I'm rather interesting but I'm thankful that we've got the Internet in places where we can get some good information\nYou know if you just take your wife out to dinner where you wouldn't need such a big refrigerator [laughter]\nGosh we go out to dinner practically every week\nMy eyes All right so Andrew but basically I Want you to listen up because how has a technical question that I bet you're you will have input on so how does that question\nYeah basically what's happened is we had a bunch of super great movies from the old days watching the kids go up and some of my early days ranchers which I don't know if I Want everybody to see what we had those digital lives and we're now in possession of\nA a ... obviously that's got this information on it we're looking for an F. D.

by state law\nDiscoveries in hell on your host Chris McKay and I'm really glad you're with me today because they were going to be talking about an issue that affects each and every one of us and that stress and believe it or\nNot whether it's job stress financial stress family stress or even the little things that were told not to stress about\nAny form of stress takes a serious physical toll on your body\nBut don't worry because there is something you can do about your stress and joining me today on the phone is Dr Michael ... and Dr Pincus is going to talk about stress and give us some great information on things that we can do to reduce or even eliminate the negative effects of the daily stress has on our bodies\nFor those you that may not know Dr Parikh is he is a nationally recognized authority on natural an alternative health he's worked with top Hollywood celebrities professional in Olympic athletes and it continues to be involved in the latest research into today's top health concerns and Dr biggest thanks so much for being with us today\nThanks Chris great to be with you\nSo let's get right into this whole stress issue you know stress is such a normal part of our daily routine these days but why should we all be concerned about it and more specifically what's going on in our bodies and one of the warning signs that we should be looking for\nWell you know there's two ways to look at stress on is what we call mental stress on the other the other is how stress affects your body as a doctor I'm more interested in how it affects your body sure so the waste stress affects the body is this a what a person's under stress the body transpose is the stress into tension\nAnd your muscles end up contracting and everyone feels that and they're in the upper back in ... right and the doctor I'm more concerned about\nThe muscles that you don't feel such as the muscles in the arteries oh that guy up and the mothers the heart is a giant myself over and the muscles in and around your digestive\nTract mhm because these are the things that are resulting in in a heart disease digestive difficulties\nAnd I want to talk a little bit on your show today about nutrition because there are two nutrients that completely handle the body in terms of stress okay now according to the research that I've been involved with it it's as simple as calcium and magnesium\nCalcium and magnesium right okay\nWhen you're deficient and calcium and magnesium a lot of things can happen\nHealth and magnesium for example is needed in order to go to sleep at night and how many people you know they just don't sleep while you wake up tired\nYour body hurt more pretty soon it starts to wear you down and pretty soon he gets sick and you have a condition that people are suffering from pain and osteoporosis and fibromyalgia and cramped in their legs and we're illnesses so there's something wrong with this picture\nAnd it has to do it not how much calcium someone taking in their diet or how many calcium supplements or how many in Athens you chew it has to do with simple absorption is that calcium getting absorbed into your body\nWith calcium being something to do with stress isn't calcium for building bones well\nYes okay yeah and it does build your ... but he's the one percent of the calcium actually circulates in your blood\nSo in that one percent starts to drop it could affect your heart your brain your kidneys your organs and your body shutdown actually died\nWow one percent of the calcium always has to be in your system and there's two sources of calcium one isn't the diet you know and to is from the bones themself\n... absorb it back from the bones of ... that's right I see\nAnd what you just discussed right now leads to one of the major causes of a condition that's affecting twenty five million Americans right now which is called osteoporosis\nRight which is a weakening of adult now and that's due to the body deriving the calcium from the bones instead of frozen nitrogen\nYep okay and so we have to do is we have to find a way to put calcium back in the diet now you'd think that would be really easy\nSure just drink milk just drink milk or you know eat a lot of green leafy vegetables and that sort of thing but first of all people don't do that right and second of all the the quality of the calcium that comes from our diet\nHas been decreasing in the last fifty years really yeah because things like pastures Asian who they're irradiated hum the calcium as leach from the soil and\nPeople are taking medications that block it so\nThe actual calcium is that being absorbed in the body okay and then you see people taking toms and calcium supplements you know they buy at the health food store dry writer right but these things don't absorb\nAnd the body\nThat's out there for a couple of reasons\nOne uh when you take a let's say an antacid that has the calcium in it like a Tums first of all calcium does not absorb in the body unless it's an anesthetic environment but to see what happens when you take a Tom\nIs an antacid oh okay so even if you're getting calcium in the in the antacid itself is that being absorbed\nIcy because it has to be in a in an as an environment for it to be absorbed\nExactly okay now we have a product called the ... formula\nMy comics formula it's natural and the differences is that a powdered and what happens is you put it in hot water and you mix it up and you drink it don't do it in a liquid instead of a pill\nAnd it absorbs into your system\nWow so that solves the problem is well\nYeah because when Cal the magnesium earn a liquid state it absorbs ten times better than in any other state\nWow that's great matter of fact yes I'm I'm reading the can right now says a fast absorbing calcium and magnesium beverage powder\nIt comes down to ... one of the ways to tell if you're not observing calcium is take a look at what drugs they're taking are you on high blood pressure medication you need something for your kidneys or you want\nPain medications you need sleeping took the calcium and especially the magnesium being absorbed ... you're not going to suffer from all these things my comment formula does absorb incredibly in the body the thing is is that what do you take my comment formula but not like well well I feel better\nI have thousands of people are ready to the doctor pain 'cause I Can't believe it thirty minutes after I took the counter pain in my wrist went away or I was able to sleep for the first time in years I mean this is really
