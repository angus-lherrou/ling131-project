to shift her position\nAnd then tried to lie back down but the bed collapsed and she was thrown from it and did half of a back flip whoa and landed on her head to the way I buy spun around I put my hand down and I felt like I was catapulted off the back of the bed\nI felt inside and heard what felt like a spring in my body snap\nSo now her partner or the or than barter testified that he saw her

yeah okay stop there please I'm In my fifties do I know\nYou're up or I'm very lower but anyway how this new study says life gets easier at a certain point and that point is forty four years old\nThat is a crack right there so that is fake news [noise]\nIt does not get easier\nWhy do you think for me has it okay say before your heart attacks a few yeah yeah yeah okay say you're sitting there at fifty four would you said yeah like it's easier at forty four Mm yeah probably okay you know why they say that is\nBecause people in their twenties stressed out about finding a job saving money dating stuff like that when you're in your thirties you stress over like moving up in a career starting a family things like that\nThen in your early forties\nYou're trying to worry about work life balance your relatives getting older trying to plan for the future but at forty four things start to turn around you get all that other stuff squared away and you can start relaxing and enjoying your life\nI'm waiting [noise] haven't\nAchieved that yet and I got goals I suppose this also has to do with if you're going to have a family when did you start having the family and how old are your kids and how many kids do you have because this is all on average from the study\nUm they say people's favorite things about their forties going onto vacations earning a bit more money having a nicer car\nAnd then you know what's worth worrying about\nWhat would you say that is true here that you've approach you you've blown past that marker\nA I prefer forty for over thirty for just kind of a massive thirty four twenty four which bill my gosh pleased that there's any tapes I don't want 'em around you know I'm ...\nBut still I think my wife and I started having kids a little bit later at least from our peers yes so you're still sort of been the thick of it and you're running everywhere all the time there's that part of it and trying to achieve the work life balance but yeah it the one part where you get more comfortable in your own skin\nI think he's really true and they say from the study best thing about being in your fifties you'd do stop worrying so much about what people think oh look at the way I dress [noise]\nThey got care [laughter] I'm way past that sir\nI mean if you dress for the occasion but your every day where you're very comfortable in your own ... very much am I don't care anymore I think that's that's probably pretty good\nThat's one of the things I feel like I'm a little ahead of the curve on probably to a fault but I'm a little ahead of occurred on maybe

glad he was watching it and not me\n[laughter] yeah no she was really interesting and this conversation I one of the biggest takeaways I think we have the audio of is the way in which she found her fate\nAnd this is the question is something about you know as far as your dad how does he deal with maybe some of the things that either Trump says or does or\nThe CNN CNN person interviewing her obviously very not biased had a question about how Mike Pence and everyone else in her deeply religious family justifies the actions he takes but don't seem to coincide with people will say okay\nYou know my dad was always really telling me on how to kill 'em just treat people with grace and now I Try to get on my own life on something that can be difficult to do actually lives in ... and having a religious have when I talk about in the book that um I didn't always have\nSuch a strong religious faith and I did for a little while and then my um parents just don't even have our own opinions though when it came back that pay that's why I'm I'm kind of tried to run out\nAnd you find that very interesting idea I think I think when you hear Mike Pence's daughter to talk about considering being an atheist that that was headlined a big\nBut I my my takeaway here is I keep getting killed every day but uh my parents is a is a bit\nWell who are non Christian I mean so clearly I mean\nUnder that he should have like left her outside the city walls right\nI Do it or I or blindfolded and tied up and just let her go out into the desert\nLike a lot of times is a Christian person real read something you know as the way of like you just said David and I'm like I just I I Know there are some Christians maybe like that not the ones I Know most of the like\nAs far as their kids yes they want them to have the same faith that they have but they also know their kids have to own their own faith the parents can't do it for them they have to ask all those questions and you know seek truth on their own\n... you have to own your own I guess is it so yeah that totally makes sense to me but I don't think you're alone and saying wow I'm surprised that she was\nDabbling in atheism for a white considering that she may not be a person of faith at all and to come from the family she comes from just to me was sort of jarring answer\n... it's interesting to me um\nAnd there's a great book called the critical journey so many people of faith went through a crisis of faith at some point in time\nYou know what I mean like either felt all the way out or believe different things or whatever [noise]\nUm but that is interesting it doesn't get talked about that much and then and this is a a big question that\nGets asked a lot and who is this on new day David ah I think it's ... that's it there yes um and she just asked the question\nBut anyhow army was understand because they hear this a lot they are confused when deeply religious people support president for him because I mean every day we seem to have a different example I have I'm Out\nOf time out [laughter] totally not by us interviewing hiring I Know I think it to I\nI think it's an interesting question for miles and camera because you hear that a lot and it's good that at least she has an opportunity to respond to the vice president's daughter has an opportunity to respond to this\nYeah like how how do you square that sort of write\nBrought up and we certainly do with him is accused of having an extramarital affair and he went after her name and none of these things aren't aren't things that most people associate with someone on deep faith how do you square that\nShouldn't even say horse face no [laughter]\nNo [laughter] well I think I I I actually\nWish that this question would be brought up to more people are not not just conservatives but also Democrats as well because I think it's an interesting ah topic because we heard just a couple of weeks ago Chelsea Clinton saying that people who don't support I'm Sorry who who support a ban on abortion or actually not Christian and I\nBut I find that to be an interesting angle was well oh yeah people are never challenged on yeah I mean okay I I Want to hear how she answers this question\nYou know for me it's been a lot about and personal relationship with people and I know that there's a lot of fat in the ... a lot of the time ... and I write about
