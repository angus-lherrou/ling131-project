first of all in order to function at all your body needs magnesium it's probably of all the vitamins I could lift magnesium is probably the most important vitamin on the planet right now\nI've not

over Rick crabs security crazy story and I have to tell you about how voice fishing scams are getting more clever I mean we just heard about a fishing scam with a check well what about if somebody called you and this happened listen to this mass shooting\nBanks of the small Portland credit union last week he got a call itself from it from an eight hundred number\nThat matched the number that his credit union uses actually you get three calls from his credit union the same number in rapid succession he didn't answer the first to let them go to voicemail but then this time they called these like oh wow this must really be important I should answer [noise]\nSo he was greeted by a female voice to explain that his credit union had blocked too phony looking chargers in ... in Ohio\nMade to his dad did ATM card\nShe read him the last four digits up their credit card that was in his wallet\nAnd check out\nHe would tell the lady listen I any replacement current immediately about travel out of state ... foreign yeah\nWell the woman on the line said oh don't worry about you keep that card we're just going to simply block any future charges that weren't going to be made in Oregon or California\nOr those the only two states you're going to be and he said yeah I'm just going to California or an edge to oh not a problem any charge that you make in Oregon or California will be fine\nWe're going to freeze the cards everywhere else and he said well that's a little strange but he figured well you know what she's probably doing a favor she didn't said you know just to make sure that everything is on the up and I just want you to feel comfortable is this your home address because this is where we're going to say the new card when you're done with your trip\nHe says I guess that's my home address including my apartment number everything's perfect shit is this your mother's maiden name and he said uh yeah she said this is the correct spelling of your mother's made yeah yeah absolutely\nShe said can you please verify I Need to verify\nThe three digit code printed on the back of the card in your wallet\nIs this number these three numbers on the back of the credit card that's in your wallet and he said yeah uh yes so at this point everything seem crazy pretty legit right\nShe says so that I can apply the same ten number to your credit card but I'm mailing out to you or can you give me your PIN number so this way you don't have to go to the bank everything's all just going to work or and so that your PIN number will be the same PIN number that you have right now and\nHe said oh okay well you know here's my four digit pin the card\nHangs up then you look says account\nThere were two fraudulent charges on account from the day earlier totally three thousand four hundred dollars there was a twenty nine hundred dollar charge from a Kroger near Atlanta it was a five hundred dollar cash withdrawals from an ATM\nAfter everything was said and done he had just three hundred dollars in his account so what the scammer head was every single thing about him except for the PIN number [noise]\nAnd so by her going through all these gyrations with the card they were able to duplicate the card obviously they had and duplicate of the car she had been number she had everything in\nFront of her but she didn't have the PIN number so by going through every step she had the PIN number isn't that shady Andrew isn't that\nWhy would they get all the information that is our dog when it's on the dark Web crazy stuff don't do any banking on the phone [laughter] the bank calls
