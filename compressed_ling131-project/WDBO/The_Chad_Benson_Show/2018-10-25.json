abide by the U.S postal service because it doesn't look like if you're just you're wondering again there's all this information comes through where these somebody never hand delivered which would definitely make it easier to find out who did it\nWell you would have to have\nA lot of people in on that project out to be all the different places different times\nYeah you would think\nOK so thank you for joining us as we play sleuth\nLive on the air and try to figure it out and there are some conspiracy theories out there that I'm not all that comfortable running with right now what to do with it grow a pair of conspiracy theory and inside job I'm not saying that\nThere's no way too early to say one thing or the other okay and I don't think it's likely that this is a quote unquote inside job meaning that this was an orchestrated event I don't think it was but I don't think that's likely and it's way too early any way to do speculating about that\nWell okay\nOrchestrated in that one person we think was trying to inflict harm several places I don't think you just want to send a pipe bomb it is a died right that doesn't make any sense yeah so we're talking about an evil person that would coordinate this right yeah\nBut if they're it's stamped on the package what does that mean and\nSo it would be hand delivered it all these places like you know and if you want to just change the conversation to All right what are just regular old people saying right now and what are they wondering about you know at workplaces what's\nThat conversation some people are saying it's our job yeah\nThey're doing this on purpose for the midterms mhm [noise]\nOh you don't know that but yeah I mean\n... there's so much of this so far that doesn't make sense yeah so you're just trying to weed through and I suppose that we have a responsibility but we're not CNN but we're not Fox News you know what I mean they're\nDoing us during the day you come from a news background so I bet you have the weight of responsibility heavier on you the me coming from rock radio\nNo they just added fed is getting voted out there I'll say right now it I think that's unlikely\nUm but yeah we're just waiting to see exactly who did this and it seems like the person who whoever is responsible doesn't seem all that bright\nBased on several misspellings and all this and just the well anyway uh and the fact that the device that didn't work thank God\nThey didn't work the person is going to be caught whoever is what you have to go forward I Believe is going this isn't going to like be hurting right but I don't think there's gonna be like the anthrax scare from when was it was two thousand one right mhm were you\nKnow it's a big mystery I I don't I don't think that's going to happen\nThere are surveillance of ... where ... yes or at least could have images of this per se okay and the other part the return address the one was from\nIm quote Debbie Wasserman Schultz right but that was to Eric

and said like\nKorea or the mail to top Democrats and the New York offices of CNN Wednesday ABC News chief justice correspond appear Thomas they had\nBeen sent to the FBI's lab in Quantico, Virginia where a excessive testing will be done and they will look to see if there's anything in the system that is similar as they look for additional leads given the fact that you had so many devices set out already you have to look at the possibility that there could be more\nWell part of the town to say they handle such a high volumes and it's that it's difficult for them to to on\nYou know be able to detect you know suspicious packages at every step of the way but it does argue that it's better to think about how to try to have the technology capabilities as well as a trained troops now\nAt the distribution centers prosecuting centers um they may be looking not only for detecting no chemicals on my pattern it you know on particular types of packaging that also he's a novelist and how the packages being at his address\nTalking with Lewis Davis she's the senior policy researcher at the RAND Corporation you know to just make it like a very simplistic sort of question\nWas are you surprised that a package like what we've seen here that was delivered to CNN with this you know to be in like this this on below um made it all the way through to\nThe office there does that surprise you\nFun there it is definitely a\nThe survey and that that that's something like that whether detected earlier on and off\nOn processing stages but also it it doesn't surprise me since then I mean you know for example on such a high volume of being out with my period both private careers also sugars and get it raises the question about what kind of training the technology\nSon do they have to detect suspicious packages and I will say to what degree are they coordinating on their training in Syria\nOn so I think I'm In this\nCurrent environment and it's something that we need to take seriously and and and take a look at what is being done on in terms of the protection and safety handling cautious now\nYeah I think you know lowest it's something you'd buddies looked into say man people are doing their jobs it's just\nSurprising to the common person the oh my gosh how did this actually get through that that that is crazy\nRight right now that it's very unsettling and you know it's it's definitely on their scores on than that for a particular on [noise] it's not just on\nPolitical targeted but also we've had examples in the past of course but everyday citizen and becomes targets right on the on the middle is\nOn something that on the News Corps the need for the\nPostal service on track done a pretty good job in their detection and training in this area but also to on credit private carriers to look at their training and to see what kind of coordination needs to be done with the postal service says say now are part of the same delivery system\n... lowest thank you so much to do you're busy today taking the time to talk with this lowest David senior policy researcher at the RAND Corporation a hope you have a great day thanks Lewis thank you so much\nRight to care she's very nice yeah and she mentioned the technology aspect more than the mail carriers are more mail carriers I should I guess what I'm kinda getting out here what seems weird is I have to put my shoes through an x-ray machine at the airport yeah but there is no scanner\nKind of a living to either she ate that she's just she's being nice you know what I mean we're actually seeing how the heck does is this is either ... can't do their job or we got something totally jacked up you know what the security how does it not detect\nStuff them and so they're saying now yes they're suspicious package was not mailed it was dropped off by a courier\nUh and so then you also have to follow up questions why the postage stamps all of that stuff is just supposed to look like it was through the mail so that it wouldn't raise detection because if you get a package and you're just going through everything you don't necessarily think oh jeez this isn't this isn't stamping signed off on properly you're just thinking oh it's a package that I'm getting in the mail\nBut before he goes out but that also would mean that a lot more people are involved in this than just one not\nAbsolutely do more questions than answers as we get through all of this stuff today\n[noise] [noise]\nYeah ... this doesn't add up man I'll put it to you this way if it does add up oh yeah this could just happen you know\nIt's even more frightening oh we got a bigger problem and yes absolutely that's terrifying if it can just worked out this way if some dude wherever he is just put this in the mail and go or just randomly hire people on Craig's list to drop off packages like there's yeah there's a bigger problem\nAnd then you know the one thing that at least we haven't heard yet\nOr maybe you've seen is that I just have it is okay they're taking these devices somewhere they're examining them\nBecause the the first thing we\nHeard they were like active like ready to go yeah\nThank God none of them have so I mean\nWe'll know I guess in time what does this sophisticated is a very just simple things where they dodge where they supposed to go up at a certain time we don't know so that's all the stuff that we're trying to follow and keep you up to date on and do will continue\nTo do that then there's other things that we got to get to weld Scott Robbins will be in with Scott takes that'll be coming up
