USA Today story Brett Kavanaugh was quote belligerent and aggressive\nThat's where my yo classmate too weird the way the story is laid out um this Chad Flemington associate professor of history at North Carolina State University and released a statement said that Kevin has quote not told the truth when denying he never blacked out and downplaying his drinking\nHow would this guy you know if he blacked out or not 'cause it never says that again and the rest of the story and you just say no I saw him slurring a lot staggering around and when he got drunk he was often belligerent and aggressive\nAnd so you have all of that just adding up and that's the stuff that's really getting covered as far as media goes ... oh you see this he's a big boozer man\nIs it just me or is it still like the big big thing with Dr Ford and what she said was her good friend was there and she has no recollection\nMetal last I heard didn't know Brett Kavanaugh that for the and along with the rest of her story it's not that I don't have sympathy for her but there\nAre too many things that don't add up front and it's not like this guy's going to be boosted when he's on the Supreme Court bench right it's not like he's going to come into a steward setting a sit down and go\nHey Ruth that black robe looks fantastic I don't know I remember a couple of years ago were made her dance Byrd passed out during the state of the union because she had a couple of glasses of wine but you know on a true story and it took about blackout drunk oh yeah mhm so I don't know where all this goes and then you've got the Michael ...\nJulie sweating it gives the person that he's representing a P has other accusations about Brett Kavanaugh about gang rape and drugging limited parties those accusations are falling apart she was on MSNBC yesterday and she was so not credible the today show didn't even play their own exclusive\nNone of her because she can't even get the timeline of when she decided to come out with the allegations right those didn't make sense\nAnd so they're going around she's changed your story from a sworn statement that she put out last week it's changing a little bit ... they're not falling apart you know even though it's wet and that has gone back on saying that you saw Brett Kavanaugh andme are judged by the punch at parties that were this gang rape stuff was allegedly going on\nNow Michael ... he got defensive last night on CNN talking to Chris ...\nOne of her friends in foreign Kerr of what she just put in the declaration or what was attached to tune the declaration and last night at ten forty PM I had a telephone conversation with a woman who will go unnamed who lives in Florida who told me directly that mark judge\nAnd Brett Kavanaugh would spike the punch with a grain alcohol and quiet lives\n'cause she's seen it or she already knows it because she saw it and it's about the fifth conversation that I've had with her last fall as to what the FBI a hundred percent and this is what we associate nameless for us but she would give her name yes because she doesn't want to be out and publicly she is prepared to speak to the FBI and Chris\nThis is what I keep coming back to okay\nWe're not talking about a lot of resources to interview my client\nThe woman in Florida and other witnesses that I'm aware of we've got to make sure that we get this right as a nation\nMy my dad latitudes on that yeah what's this going to come down to if you've been injured at work I wondered in turn of the camera and say that [laughter]\nYou're entitled to his settlement [laughter] call this number [noise] playing out\nNow that he's not credible none of this is credible brand blood let's see him who are they stop what they say well I've got five people who will go nameless and we haven't seen yet who haven't offered up any testimony whatsoever but they're there and here's what they said\nMurkowski Collins flake\nYou see this going are they going to confirm\nOr not you know there was it was coming on the side of me today that thought for the first time that Trump would withdraw the nomination\nThat's not happening I don't think it will I really don't um however I think he would\nFrom a political standpoint he could say this guy's been through enough I'm not making them put his family through this any more withdraw the nomination before the vote if you knew to vote wasn't going to go your way and you go that way you ... you can make political hay whip it by saying I had to withdraw the nomination because of what these people did\nThat make you can't make political hay out of that at the votes got to fail and I think it's basically a coin while in many ways right I'll get burned so I think I'm definitely going to set a few days ago man or Democrats or whatever you hope a careful what they hope for ... because of this nomination at this nomination fails the confirmation of Brett Kavanaugh failed its nuclear war from conservatives\nMeeting I mean that that blue wave is gone\nBecause they're going to look at this and say oh did not that they aren't serious accusations but when you have even this lady's best friend Christie Ford yeah her best friend can't even put them on the same house together\nAnd these are weak at best allegations\nAre and yet everybody in the media all of these Democrats treated this as if this were one hundred percent true in everybody else's lying about it um what about the blue wave argument that is you don't care about women who don't care about sexual assault victims writer about any I also tend to agree that if he is confirmed that blue wave is all but locked in\nI Believe that the media will take the Democratic talking points and run with it and a lot of people in the middle will will believe it\nSo let me just get this straight if he is confirmed\nThat Republicans a loose yes if he is not confirming Republicans win yes okay interesting strategy here you would think it would just go the other way when you yeah you know\nAnd I don't write with David on this either by the way no ... no I don't and people ask me where's this isn't going to go I don't know I honestly don't know if you asked me a week ago and it was said he's gonna sail through compromise you\nKnow I'm not so sure give me two weeks ago or last week before the last week before the hearing yeah well nothing changed no I Know that but at the narrative like you just mentioned the narrative is one sign of sexual assault to he's a big ... not only that you had\nA Mitchell was her first name\nThe lady there on the ah the asking the questions you have public yes um that's what she does she's the sex crimes prosecutor ... and laid out all these inconsistencies with sports testimony\nRight mhm [noise] there's no one wanting to talk to that woman to met you know why is it is\nVery strong was not what they want to know that overall\nThat's my point but that's it is is that the ... all these details have been consistent feeding the stories and all this doesn't matter\nBecause what does it come down to every body is either against Trump or it's the abortion issue that you know it ...\nWhat it is that those are the two things right there okay won't keep an eye on I mean does the word is it useful pawn for these guys\nOh yeah but do they really care about or not they don't have ... or so of course it just helps them All right um\nWell there's another study confirming a link between violent video games and physical aggression\nAnd yes it's true limiting a kid screen time\nWill improve

David band camp only to spend a ton of time on this but as we know with Brett Kavanaugh there's all these accusations right oh\nAnd Julie sweat Nick she's the one talking about all of the gang rape yes and as I mentioned before I've from reading that the first time I'm like this doesn't seem very credible at all and that's been really exposed\nYeah well and then you started hearing about her history with past legal action\nIn Oregon where she was also accused of sexual harassment yup uh now the boyfriend of joy sweat neck was on Fox News last night essentially saying I'll boil it down your real quick for you as pages crazy [noise]\nThat's what this was more anger and show Richard been actually he was talking about how she threatened him and his family after they broke up\nRight after I broke up for her she basically called me many times and I wasn't points to basically say you will never ever seen your unborn ... child alive and uh I wanted you know I just want to go over there where they can you guys\nSaid that she was going to kill you\nYes and that that three this county a little bit [noise]\nInto Politico originally Richard that shaped threatens your family and your baby\nCaused by the ongoing they meant the unborn child is that right I met the unborn child that's correct I was not to marry at that time when this happens\nI think that qualifies as crazy as you\nSay I never heard of her talk about being sexually assaulted either\nAll this stuff is news to me all the time we dated\n... not that I Know of you know she was always wanted to be the center of attention on the show it was went through the ... the main socialist went to press the way everything she basically was telling you that that she was essentially everything if anybody knows Julie on the person I mean I Know because they didn't want her\nTo everything that came out of her mouth was just exaggerations and she never mentioned that to me at all and it's something that I was surprised to hear this is actually it was very surprised elections the are making these concessions because they have never ever mentioned that to me at all\nWhat I Wonder is after this whole thing now has been exposed ... does that do anything Dr Ford's credibility and some people that I\nI don't know I think it kind of has the two things are somewhat related 'cause they obviously had to do with Kavanaugh but I don't think you can judge one based off of the other personally speaking I Know there are a lot of inconsistencies in Dr Ford's but I don't know of her credibility goes down because of this person\nI think to me at least I'll just speak personally ... the two don't have anything to do with one another\nI don't know that it does with me either other than\nA lot of people you just can't help the way your brain works and it's sort of like you there's a few question marks with Dr Ford like this timeline doesn't add up there yeah I mean there's so many different things or not wanting to fly\nBut that was you know all of part of playing the time game for the Democrats yes um and someone exposed her\nYou know as far as her identity she wanted to remain anonymous that didn't make sense of your friend doesn't say she was there that doesn't make sense there's so many things that don't add up and it's like are they just using this person to go after Kavanaugh\nSo if anything the sweat and the story doesn't help that you know and if you go into your brain like well it might just buying into some sort of conspiracy here and you see a story like ... ... you're like okay what is going on here a lot of inconsistencies yeah that makes sense\nAnd I think it's really interesting because if you bring you confront Michael have an Audi her lawyer about this you know his responses how dare you question a sexual assault survivors story and you know well this guy is just her ex boyfriend wouldn't be the first exploit friend ally about somebody which I for one I'm tired of Michael ...

I. now Hoffman allegedly been told his ex girlfriend he should've brought his gun in front of the car so we could shoot both of them\nShe said she had difficulty breathing during this whole thing but the victim was saved by dominoes delivery guy who brought Pete to the house that often had ordered a so when he was saying when he was paying the un identify driver noticed a visibly injured woman mouth helped me and call the police\nDo dominoes driver says not today not on non dominoes watch\nCalled the cops saved her life holy smokes\nPolice say they could hear the victim shouting please come in and help me from inside the home and they got there so they bus down the door and they save a safer now opposite of course is facing multiple charges burglary of a building balls and bring them in belle any intimidation of a victim kidnapping and strangulation and suffocation\nBut her life was almost surely saved by a dominoes delivery guy going above and beyond\nAll right wow that's frightening man absolutely frightening and an unrelated story this is national pizza month yes\nSir producer Greg goings on this disease very opinionated when it comes to the New York style pizza like that he's the only sell us Nabil\nBut yeah but there's all sorts of pizza stats out there we may have to wait on this we may I mean there are a few things like uh let's see uh survey from California pizza kitchen was time to head of national pizza months which started off yesterday but I talked to those people\nSee why I just I'm not opinionated in Nabil I Know what ... it's not made anywhere other than in New York\nThe beads and what was the favorite food of Twenty one percent of the people surveyed steak came in second burgers third tacos por pasta theft and salad and sushi Mac and cheese\nOkay where there is a lot more self that we'd have to get to Craig trigger warnings seeds of talk in the next\nHour okay so Trump talking about a dangerous time for a young man in America straight ahead on the Mark Twain man game\nShow [noise]\nNinety six point five building a bailiff him Orlando by new sound winter for saying look how fleeting group station\nUsed savings I knew and previously furnishing market writes huge saving our financial grandparents used from a wide variety of new and previously means furniture and acorn for your home or not you don't mind cell phone from one Ninety nine Ninety nine ...\nEverything in our nine thousand square foot shell rent is going to buy guaranteed in fact many ... are you can't come to visit our handling quite furniture than center at one three nine point lead that kinda Morial highway or go on line ... dot com mentioned radio twenty ... twenty percent off\nDuty new only mine hair color kiss and make it even becoming your hair and home [noise]\nEverything in college for ... you know\nProfessionals hoping to everyone Sally beauty [noise]\nThis is news Ninety six point ... happy in the ... or\n... turns worse for breaking news\nFour hours a day\nFrom ABC News\nI'm Richard can chew\nDon't be surprised later today\nWhen your wireless device sounds an alarm lab and the two Eighteen pm eastern time less than twelve hours from now\nThis afternoon you'll get a message on your phone that reads presidential alert this is a test of the national wireless emergency alert system no action is needed it's part of FEMA's first nationwide testable wireless emergency alert system men to let people know about things like nuclear attacks or widespread terror attacks\nFEMA estimates it will reach about Seventy five percent of mobile devices ... ABC News\nWith the FBI investigating allegations of sexual improprieties against Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh President Trump declared young men should be concerned right now\nAnd then we get to a couple of things that Trump said today on his way to another rally in Mississippi talking to reporters so Lindsey Graham is thrown out this idea Lindsey Graham has become like Trump's favorite guy in the Senate what you would have never get to buy they told you that it three years ago\nAfter Donald Trump docks Lindsey Graham ... meaning he put out his private cell phone number [laughter] it was an all time or you would have never guessed that Lindsey Graham would become Trump's number one guy but the Lindsey has a way of\nOf ... favor with people as he does ah so when's he is asking the president to re nominate Brett Kavanaugh if he's not confirmed\nI guess the overall gamble as bad as I've talked about before I really think a lot of conservative voters will be beyond outraged if this thing gets sunk if it gets on ... and they're going to come out and vote in November\n... they're going to show up at the polls I Do believe that ah now Trump was asked about this idea so I guess Lindsey Graham is saying you know re nominated then after the midterms will go ahead well we'll have more Republican senators will have more support will be able to confirm him I'm so Trump was asked about there's any kind of took the scenic route to the answer\nWell I heard you say that it certainly is Israel as a as we both love him I was in Tennessee last night and I want to say that those people we add a sold out arena with thousands of people outside everywhere I go I'm going to Pennsylvania the same thing\nThey are so in favor of judge Kavanaugh you've never seen anything like it I actually think it's like a rallying cry for the Republicans they are so in favor of judge Kavanaugh I\nThink a lot of it too is the frustration of watching this very one sided presentation of how this story is going\nI think it is I you know\nIn terms of people love this guy I don't know if they do or they don't you know what I mean it seems to me though it's a situation where I don't know Brett Kavanaugh\nOnly knows what I've read over the last twenty five years incredible record right what he was like in high school or college I don't know\nIt seemed like he partied\nBut as far as sexual assault then you bring that down to what what is the evidence\nAnd so many people are ... they're not approaching it that way and everyone's saying well it depends on the lens you're looking through and if you really want him confirmed you're going to see at a certain way and if you really don't want him confirmed you're going to see a doctor Ford's way\nIt should be evidence shouldn't them and I've I've said it'll female are still frustrated by that\nYes and I've said it before and I'll say it again here listen you give me one other person who can say there was a party that those two people were attending at the same time\nThat's a game changer to me and if that comes out then I can reconsider my position on it right now but right now you don't have anybody who can even put 'em in the same place at the same time no and so we're supposed to do I saw one one way was characterized an opinion piece I read over the weekend\nThat was kind of a waste of ink but one of the phrases in there was a any sane person knows that this happened to Dr Ford and Brett Kavanaugh did it\nAnd I'm like we've lost their minds if that's really where\nWe are supposed to be right now that is that's frightening to me\nDo it like I said before\nYou don't know what happened there I don't only forward cabinet and God Knows what happened but we got to base it on the evidence\nAnd so there are so many people are like so you're just going to destroy this guy from me she said she said situation and there you know it's not that I don't have sympathy for I keep saying that but there are so many holes in the story that's a problem yeah well\nAnd a Trump touched on that today as well talking to reporters\nWhile I say that it's a very scary time for young men in America when you can be guilty of something that you may not be guilty of this is a very very very difficult time [noise]\nWhat's happening here has much more to do that even the appointments of the largest it really does you could be somebody that was perfect yours higher life as somebody said here's you up stuff that\nHas his early ... woman as everybody say somebody could accuse you of something\nYou're automatically guilty but it is well you are certainly guilty until proven innocent\nThey know how this has heard and how this was going to be repeated absolutely Trump says men matter more than women and that's not what he's saying oh of course not that's not what most people believe and it is sad that for a long time and even in our current culture\nYou know there are women who are victims who don't feel like they can come out with accusations 'cause they don't feel like they're going to be supportive and they don't feel like they're going to be heard and that's a shame and we have to do everything we can to rectify that sure\nBut at the same time part of solving that problem does not just means swing so far to the other way that we throw\nEvidence out the window because of an active because of an accurate that we that we just ignore holes in a story or that we just instantly believe everything it's the difference between hearing people who have actually accusations and just blanket believing people who have accusations\nYes I mean you do that's what it's built on\nInnocent until proven guilty we thought\nBut this is a completely different situation though right there are other things that we do have to get through [noise] I don't think we have to but man I Want to do we're talking about this endlessly for like a couple of weeks and I don't think we're anywhere close to being done yet but I Want to get to well\nHow many crimes are view committed in your life how many grams or by personally I'm going to name nine I bet you've committed eight of them not as far as you know\nAre we
