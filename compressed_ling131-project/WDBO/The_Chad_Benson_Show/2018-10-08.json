uh-huh using YouTube tutorials mhm\nBut here's how you do it\nAnd he sure enough did it is the house good\nAccording to the story it is does it have indoor plumbing\nThat appears to be so does it have working electricity\nI Do believe so what a show off that guy is\nNow there's any do it yourself projects around the house if word gets out about this this guy built a two story house well then why

know that last Star Wars movie where they basically kill the sole Skywalker\nI haven't even seen it I just read about it [noise]\nOkay [noise] a lot of\nDiehard fans\nHated it [noise] yeah\nI didn't love it I thought it was fine fine movie but a lot of people very disappointed [noise]\nNo doubt about it a lot of people out there saying that they ruined their childhood with that movie which I think you're [noise]\nWhat you really didn't have a nice childhood if that's the worst thing that can happen to\nAll the great memories and look it up to Luke Skywalker in what he stood for and in the end [noise]\nJust let everybody down apparently it's hard for me to speak I think it was any way more than half of the hostile responses to the last jet I ... were politically motivated trolling or the result of non human\nActivity according to an academic paper published\nBy a U.S digital media expert by the name of ... research fellow at USC\nAnalyzed Twitter activity about the film and concluded that more than fifty percent of the post are by ... ...\nOr political trolls\nResearch and to indicate that not only are negative comments on social media about the film in a minority but the anti jet I campaign has been designed to survey wider political perfect oh my gosh this study finds evidence of deliberate organized political influence measured this guys are measured rather disguised as fan arguments\nThe likely objective of these measures who's increasing media coverage of the fandom conflict there by adding to and further propagating a narrative of widespread discordant dysfunction in American society Bob Mueller where you add on this one man\nOh man well\nBe a little nerd alert at all it's all the Russians van that's all at all it is just it was it the Russians that made the solo movie sucked to yes\nBut you liked it too I actually I enjoyed watching solo more than I enjoyed watching their last year I okay I thought it was a fun movie yeah I listen

Orlando and central Ford offices\nBe forty if he wants to be forty show you probably written a bond more than drinking their beer well that's just my take I've been to a year before the show really yeah his way back in the day is they were the headline or were you there on a date or something nope what was it for\nI had a friend of mine who was in a band and I went to see his band open for over day right I'd I really I went yes okay and I left midway through red red wine I got to the red part and left\n[laughter] at that time it was it was more of a country club or his band there was talk scholars there was a yeah\nA guy she hated and they were all there began sending Iraq and yeah well yeah um yeah it's like us we were jealous of the ... of the world because they had the nice cars and they were the nights closed and they had everything going on on a future screw those guy I'm sure that you and I hated him that's been saying but I don't know yes so\nAt this bar fight apparently I Love how it's being described as big bar brawl ... what does he alleged to have done he was alleged to have thrown a cup of ice on somebody yes there was this man ended up getting in the fight to get in trouble call him to go to Patrick\nSwayze 'cause that's straight out I started out in roadhouse stuff right there [laughter]\nSo what is right now [noise] I don't get help you with the ice cubes their ears so to me\nSo that's the angle right that old man this guy has a huge history ... ... USA Today's story Brett Kavanaugh was quote belligerent and aggressive\nThat's from Rio classmate just weird the way the story is laid out of this Chad flooding so she's professor of history at North Carolina State University and released a statement said that Kevin has quote not told the truth when denying he never blacked out and downplaying his drinking\nHow this guy you know if he blacked out or not because it never says that again and the rest of the story and you just say no I saw him slurring allied staggering around and when he got drunk he was often belligerent and aggressive\nAnd so you have all of that just adding up and that's the stuff that's really getting covered as far as media goes oh you see this he's a big boozer\nMan is it just me or is it still like the big big thing with Dr Ford and what she said was her good friend was there and she has no recollection\nMet at last I heard didn't know Brett Kavanaugh that for the and along with the rest of her story it's not that I don't have sympathy for her but there are too many things that\nDon't add up right it's not like this guy's going to be boosted when he's on the Supreme Court bench right it's not like he's going to come into a steward setting and sit down and go\nHey Ruth that black robe looks fantastic I don't know I remember a couple of years ago the creator Ginsburg passed out during the state of the union because you had a couple of glasses of wine beer on a true story and it took about blackout drunk oh yeah mhm so I don't know where all this goes and then you've got the Michael ... at ya ...\nJulie sweat make is the person that he's representing she has other accusations about Brett Kavanaugh about gang rape and drugging women at parties those accusations are falling apart she was on MSNBC yesterday and she was so not credible the today show didn't even play their own exclusive\nNone of her because she can't even get the timeline of when she decided to come out with the allegations right those didn't make sense\nAnd so they are going around she's changed your story from a sworn statement that she put out last week it's changing a little bit ... they're not falling apart you know even though it's wet and it has gone back on saying that you saw Brett Kavanaugh andme are judged by the punch at parties that were this gang rape stuff was allegedly going on\nNow Michael ... he got defensive last night on CNN talking to Chris ...\nOne of her friends informed her of what she just put in a declaration or what was a test of two in the declaration and last night at ten forty PM I\nHad a telephone conversation with a woman who won't go unnamed who lives in Florida who told me directly that mark judge and Brett Kavanaugh would spike the punch with a grain alcohol and ... lives\n'cause she's seen it or she already knows it because she saw it and it's about the fifth\nConversation that I've had with her last fall as to where the FBI a hundred percent and this is what we associate nameless for us but she would give her name yes because she doesn't want to be out and publicly she is prepared to speak to the FBI and Chris this is what I keep coming back to okay\nWe're not talking about a lot of resources to interview my client\nThe woman in Florida and other witnesses that I'm aware of we've got to make sure that we get this right as a nation\nMy my God why attitudes on that and yeah\n\nWhat's this going to come down to if you've been injured at work I wondered in turn to the camera and say that [laughter]\nYou're entitled to hundreds settlement [laughter] call this number [noise] playing out\nThat he's got a credible none of this is credible brand blood let's see um who are they stop with this say well I've got five people who will go nameless I mean we haven't seen yet who haven't offered up any testimony whatsoever but there are there and here's what they said\n... where do you see this going are they going to confirm\nOr not you know there was it was coming I always this side of me today that thought for the first time that Trump would withdraw the\nNomination that's about a minute I don't think it will I really don't\nUm however I think he would from a political standpoint he could say this guy's been through enough I'm not making them put his family through this any more withdraw the nomination before the vote if you knew the boat wasn't going to go your way\nAnd you feel that way you want to call you could make political hay with it by saying I had to withdraw the nomination because of what these people did\nThat make you can't make political hay out of added the votes got to fail and I think it's basically a coin while and you may run for nothing I mean that they're going to set a few days ago man or Democrats or better be hope are careful what they hope for ... because of this nomination at this nomination fails the confirmation of Brett Kavanaugh failed its nuclear war from conservatives\nMeeting I mean that that blue wave is gone\nBecause they are going to look at this and say oh they're not that they are serious accusations but when you have even this lady's best friend Christie and Ford yeah her best friend can't even put them all and the same house together\nThese are weak at best allegations\nAre and yet everybody in the media all of these Democrats treated this as if this were one hundred percent true in everybody else's lying about it um what about the blue wave argument that is you don't care about women you don't care about sexual assault victims are but anyhow I also tend to agree that if he is confirmed that blue wave is all but\nLocked in\nI Believe that the media will take their democratic talking points and run with it and a lot of people in the middle ... will believe it\nSo let me just get this straight if he is confirmed\nThe Republicans a loose yes if he is not confirming Republicans win yes okay interesting strategy here you would think it would just go the other way when new\nYeah you know and I didn't write with David on this either by the way no he could ... I don't and people ask me where is this thing going to go I don't know I honestly don't know if you ask me a week ago and it was said he's gonna sail through confirmation\nNo I'm not so sure give me two weeks ago or last week before the week before the hearing yeah well nothing changed now I Know that but at the narrative like you just mentioned the narrative is when I signed on sexual assault to he's a big boozer\nNot only that you had a Mitchell was her first name\nThe lady there on the ah the asking the questions you can yes um that's what she does she's the sex crimes prosecutor ... and laid out all these inconsistencies with sports testimony\nRight mhm there's no one wanting to talk to that woman to met you know why\nIs it because I was drawing was not what they want you know but overall that's my point but that's is is that the ... all these details of inconsistencies in the stories and all this\nDoesn't matter because what does it come down to\nEvery body is either against Trump or it's the abortion issue mhm that yeah it really is\nWhat it is that those are the two things right there okay won't keep an eye on I mean does the word is it useful pawn for these guys\nOh yeah but all they really care about or not they don't have the days are liars right so of course it just helps\nThem All right um well there's another study confirming a link between violent video games and physical aggression\nAnd yes it's true limiting a kid screen time\nWill improve brain function\nDetails coming up on the marching band game show [noise]\nThree three Michael expected to turn into that category ... hurricane making landfall in the panhandle later this week\nAnd there is nothing in their state will not do to make sure that every family in visitor and soldiers prepared for any possible impacts from this storm\nGovernor Rick Scott has issued an eight of them are getting paid for those twenty six county\nBeing called the deadliest traffic accident in two thousand nine twenty people died when I when I was ... upstate New York ... baptized Corrine here in ... and crashed into a park the car\nCouncil will be in Orlando today speaking at a convention as police chief however the events of not openings in the public\n...

there's all these accusations right huh and Julie sweat Nick she's the one talking about all of the gang rape yes\nAnd as I mentioned before eyes from reading that the first time I'm like this doesn't seem very credible at all and that's been really exposed\nYeah well and then you start hearing about her history with past legal action in Florida yeah also in Oregon\nWhere she was also accused of sexual harassment yup uh now the boyfriend of Julie sweat and it was on Fox News last night essentially saying all boils down to your real quick for you as changes crazy [noise]\nThat's what this was more anger and show Richard been that she was talking about how she threatened him and his family after they broke up\nRight after I broke up for her she basically called me many times and ... points to basically say will never ever see your ... child alive and uh I wanted you know I just got to go over there where they can you guys [noise]\nShe said she was going to kill you\nYes on that that really scared me a little bit [noise]\nBut you told Politico originally Richard that shape threaten your family and your baby\nBy you know the more they meant the unborn child is that right I met the unborn child that's correct I was not to marry at that time when this happens\nI think that qualifies as crazy as you\nSay I never heard of her talk about being sexually assaulted either\nAll this stuff is news to me all the time we dated\n... not that it no you know she was always wanted to be the center of attention on the show it was with the ... the major show us went to Presley where everything she basically was telling me that she was such a way to get anything anybody knows Julie or the person I mean I Know because I knew were her\nOn to everything that came out of her mouth was just exaggerations and that she never mentioned that to me at all and it's something that I was surprised to hear this is actually it was very surprised Russians who are making these accusations because see I never ever mentioned that to me at all\nBut I Wonder is after this whole thing now has been exposed [noise] does that do anything Dr Ford's credibility as I'll be ...\nI don't know I think it kind of has the two things are somewhat related because they obviously don't have to do with Kavanaugh but I don't think you can judge one based off of the other personally speaking I Know there are a lot of inconsistencies and Dr forest but I don't know if her credibility goes down because of this person\nI think to me at least I'll just speak personally ... the two don't have anything to do with one another\nI don't know that it does with me either other than\nA lot of people you just can't help the way your brain works at a sort of like you there's a few question marks with Dr Ford like this timeline doesn't add up there yeah I mean there's so many different things or not wanting to fly\nThat was you know all of part of playing the game for the Democrats yeah um and so I Want to expose her\nYou know as far as her identity she wanted to remain anonymous\nThat didn't make sense to your friend doesn't say she was there that doesn't make sense there's so many things that don't add up and it's like are they just using this person to go after Kavanaugh\nSo if anything the sweat and the story doesn't help that know and if it was going through your brain like well it might just buying into some sort of conspiracy here and you see a story like ... ... you're like okay what is going on here a lot of inconsistencies yeah that makes sense\nAnd I think it's really interesting because if you bring you confront my daughter ... her lawyer about this you know his response was how dare you question a sexual assault survivors story\nAnd you know well this guy is just her ex boyfriend wouldn't be the first ex boyfriend ally about somebody which I for one I'm tired of Michael Evan ... saying that all immigrants are liars or playing the game now this is how it\nGoes

out you used to be a fan of Lewis' UK yeah I was where are you ready for me to come back no I'm not are you ever going to be ready I don't know I think it does help\nOverall but he owned up to it you know he was accused of something he didn't draw it out a he said yeah this happened and he was if you didn't remember he was the one who would\nTreat his body like an amusement park in front of women wondering them and different places and the phone yeah so yeah creepy and not acceptable and he owned up to it ah it does seem a little soon for him to be coming back though\nWell apparently did another gig in New York and got a mostly positive response and ... said they were very enthusiastic to people that believe in ... there were not ready yet um I mean we said\nBefore there are different levels yeah [noise] yeah is I I think the and it's an uncomfortable conversation to have but is what he did what he admitted to doing\nThe same type of thing that if you come out and you whatever have you tried to go to rehab or have you tried to go to therapy and tried to address these issues or whatever it may be is that the type of thing that would get you just killed from show business forever\nI don't even know if there are so many of these guys I Can't keep them all straight I don't even remember that this guy gets some sort of help professional help not that we know of ... so all of a sudden just convince yeah that was the right thing to do I'm done yeah okay [laughter]\nI don't know I mean I have no idea if he's actually going to be able to make a big comeback or not my guess is he's never going to be as big as he was no I'm getting make a living doing maybe it's possible I just don't know how you watch the act and not have it go through your\nMind well because if you've ever watched his act that is definitely not one for the kids and there is a lot of jokes about well doing what he was doing behind closed doors for example and so it's hard to watch some of those things knowing what he was doing two young women young female comedians who are sort of under his care under his wing\nIt's hard to watch those and not just think oh my gosh he was actually confessing the whole time right\nWell and it's one of those things where he certainly didn't mention anything about it during the act yeah does he ever white make jokes about that I thought his first performance back was he did mention it or did he I thought that was the that was the story at least I don't know man or a whatever\nI was never that big a fan so it doesn't really matter to me but I'm always curious to talk to people that really dug the act of it's like okay you're ready for this and a lot of people are like ... you know maybe maybe in time and I are\nNot ready to watch his you know come back Netflix special\nYeah at this point here is a nice story about a pizza delivery guy and all because of him may have saved this woman's life so dominoes employee dean hop and fifty five\nOf the story goes Mrs in Wisconsin troubling county guy goes to see his ex girlfriend right\nAnd uninvited she in order to pizza yeah correct that's right and so pizza delivery guy goes there and she ... the words\nYeah so dean Hoffman as the ex boyfriend and he broke into her home basically held her hostage eater and while in a home the cops had that happen shove the unnamed victim rip their clothing
