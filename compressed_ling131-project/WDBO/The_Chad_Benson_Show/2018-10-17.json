some are suspicious packages delivered to well I tend to have them delivered to President Trump and then also there was a suspicious package mailed to the Pentagon and other people in the government to the wake of the whole that Brett Kavanaugh stuff\nThat went down now you have Susan Collins who's been targeted by somebody\nRepublican senator out of Maine who of course we had our daughter was a great speech knocked it out of the park or reasons for voting for Brett Kavanaugh to be on the Supreme Court um and stories are now looking into a suspicious letter that was sent her way\nTo her home in Bangor Maine well she was labeled a rape apologist right how ridiculous man\nDo they have no information to suggest that the public is in danger that's according to police department the FBI has been notified are notified do about it\nUm\nThere was no information immediately available about the contents of the letter or the identity of the center but believes it was delivered to the house and the reason why there had been sent to the senator's residents was not immediately clear I'm into I mean we'll just have to keep an eye on this story but it's a scary time it's a scary time to be a lawmaker\nThe reason wasn't clear right [laughter]\nThat's what the ... just a coincidence that happened to show up at the Susan Collins house no idea why ... ...\nUh there was another story that made some national news a possibility of a nine year old groping a grown woman\nYeah so last week this ... this went viral and and and then there's an update to this story now a woman who was dubbed corner store Carolina called the cops on a nine year old kid who thought that uh she er she thought he grabbed her but she lost her mind to this is in a corner store in Brooklyn and the cops got called\nShe thought that this nine year old boy yeah touched her but as he walked by and they're just a snippet of the audio of her freaking out and called the cops\nYeah on the\nAnd she's I mean\nShe looks like something not right between her ears I mean it was a little crazy so surveillance video shows that the kids backpack brushed her behind yeah tight squeeze and so and she's kind of leaning over\nThe counter and so he hurt his backpack brushes past her backside she turns around and immediately says you grow up to me I'm calling the cops and one of the things that's fascinating to me about this is it is the collusion of two major\nSocial flat a flash points in our country right now one of them of course his race relations\nAnd the other being the me too movement\nHas both together and here you have now a woman who is claiming that a young a nine year old and I mean not that it really mattered ultimately by nine year old was a black kid\nAnd she says you touched me you grab me I'm calling the cops instead of handling this like a mature adult and if you think this happened you can turn around and you could maybe say something to cater to the mom or something or you don't have to call the\nCops no no I have no idea why I don't know this person I don't know if that happened because of the nine year old was black or it would have been the same if the kid was white Asian whatever you have no idea what I mean she immediately like freaked yes and this is one of the things that I Know this this\nGets a lot of flak whenever somebody brings this up the president has brought it up others have that you want to make sure that in the me too era you're not reaching hysterical levels meaning you're not it doesn't become literally a witch hunt\nYou know this is a danger of you know that women need to be believed heard yes automatically believed no because sometimes people do either misunderstand something or like\nIt does and and when the president and others say it it is turning into a scary time for young men this is exactly what they're talking about cars that nine year old must have been free Tibet hell out because he's got this adult claiming that he groped her\nHe didn't he has no idea what's going on saying the cops are going to get called right that is terrifying stereotypes about it and when you bring that up and does it mean oh we need to keep covering up sexual assault and rape no\nBut we also need need to make sure that we're not throwing people into a state of panic where they're going to scare the hell out of a nine year old over a misunderstanding well and another\nLearning was sort of this if you're ever in that situation most places such public has a security camera yeah because then she was shown the truth yes it's a backpack where do you get a ... now she is also getting\nThreats and all that and of course that's nonsense as well leave her alone she's an idiot leave her alone yeah now she's apologizing now to reach the climate client is her name this was with a inside edition ... what I thought was [noise]\nAcross both to know what is happening I regret that I thought I should simply have said sounds how shall I say\nOkay well blue she owned it you know I didn't need to know both cheeks I got the idea from the video I'm just saying\nYou know it was yeah they were open late and so they they attract a wider audience that they're going to go have some cocktails you know listen to some jazz look at the dangerous lagoon as it is knowing where you have a bunch of sharks and all that and of course someone in the crowd got video of this dude stripping down and wild doing back flips and stuff make it yeah\nI like the part of this story to where the authorities like hey you know over here yeah no it back flips back\nYeah he walks up to them and it looks like he's getting out now so he's swimming around with sharks just few inches away from the speed at one point you're right he started to get out been taunted the security did it backwards die back into the tank so we're wondering who is this guy\nBecause he got away security told them to stay and he just left before the cops got there so he's on the loose now there is an update to this could apparently he was really busy that night not only do to go swimming naked at the aquarium mhm but the cops also think he assaulted someone at a medieval times\nA couple of miles away from the aquarium\nJust someone that was there are one of the character's someone that was there do they they said he ... he beat up somebody I mean it was a it was a brutal beating they said wow and then just a couple of miles away and many you've decided I'm going to go to a glaring between naked with sharks [noise] it was busy [laughter]\n'cause said man if it was just someone that was like it all the garb [laughter] yeah I don't think you're all that so she didn't bring your stored medieval times you know but I had close friends and family that have gone I'm seeing the pictures that looks like it could be a lot of fun\nTo actually it was the weirdest thing I only went once I went it was like a band to high school band dream and for whatever reason in Dallas they decide well we're in Dallas they decided let's go to medieval times for dinner because that's something that normal people do [noise]\nUm and so we go to medieval times with that and if you've never been there this is where they have like ... you get you get this big mug of what it's like diet Pepsi but they say it's meat or whatever and and you have the big turkey leg and all that stuff and then they put on a show for you they have a jousting tournament\nTo win the part of the ... or whatever or some such nonsense\nAnd at the end it was so weird because there was all these ... these Texas dude you were trying to do ... just terrible English accent I think my English accent is terrible this was like English with a southern twang [laughter]\nAnd so [laughter] and so they do all this and at the very end the Victor the brave night who won the fake jousting tournament comes out any he just runs several laps on his horse waiting the biggest American flag I've ever seen\nAnd I was what message are we sending you or I don't understand what this is\nThat they could see in the future and they dreamed of a place like America Sunday America will overthrow this this

some babies another babies like how big is that the pound age difference there\nSerious question you know I don't have an answer for why abducted always part of the way it's always been done is there

born see this is normal\nDay average is about seven and a seven point seven pounds okay ah the range of what's considered normal is five and a half pounds to eleven pounds right what about it just because they always report that to average or this is what I average length of a baby\nBoy did HR is going to have some questions\nFor and also do you weigh a baby with one of those things you find at
