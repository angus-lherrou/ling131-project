means\nThat our guys find your guys doing doing your guy needs to stop\nBecause when you are reacting your guy if you're a guy stops are guy will stop to when you hear rhetoric what do you think is meant by most people in the media\nBy by ... by the word rhetoric oh you're Donald Trump's mean tweets right I hear them Kim sang mean things\nAnd calling out the media yes isn't that what they're really talking about\nToning down their rhetoric saying enemy of the people and\nWhen you got to talking about media the media is being attacked at a level by a president that they'd never been I mean he's going after them these called them out everybody else's sort of ... yeah well we're probably not getting treated fairly however I don't want to say anything bad\nResult turned on me yeah I think

thought so too they're gonna get it\nNot yet go around doing this they will eventually gang up on you and get you\nBut that's what they're talking about with the rhetoric yeah any right to tone it down but then again they included every body him\nAnd I I you know again you you mentioned you know enemy of the people that I've said it before and I'll say it again yeah knock that off but you know the press or you've got a bunch of people who yes are biased and yes are pushing an agenda enemy of the people know but whenever they do talk about the rhetoric they're only talking about the rhetoric from the right\nGloss over completely near riots that you've seen from the left in places like Portland up and down the west coast in Chicago remember there was a riot but shut down a Trump rally in Chicago\nAnd so I like you cannot ignore those things either and you have people who are supposed to be\nA high minded media luminaries like Mr Chris call him on CNN who says that groups like anti far just misunderstood there just patriots who won a better life for themselves and the people they care about excusing violent behavior no one today on the right at least that I've seen nobody credible\nIs sitting near excusing this nut job in Florida not arrested no he's just standing up for themselves\nSo why aren't those same rules being applied when it comes to leftist activist who do wreak havoc on communities\nAnd don't tell me I'm not seeing what I'm seeing don't tell me that it's not a mob I just I'm seeing it well it yeah it is what it is but don't tell me it's something it

he was a character that some several of the Trump rallies I saw a picture of him holding a sign with like a half shirt on the guy loved him some him\nSo we'll see exactly how this was all handled I think we can all predict how the media is going to react we've talked about that ah\nAnd then where do we go from here with this thing Trump tweeted out oh my gosh the Republicans had so much momentum and then there's what\nWas the allergy thing comes on things up and get in a way of our momentum I don't see I don't\nKnow and it it it it feels it feels terrible to to boil with a situation like this

not like the original is what you're saying as far as the air and that got it too I'm OK Greta Van fleeting fame yeah oh wow that are good ones okay\nSo we know this and we know that it's also already being portrayed in the media as well do Republicans got to tone down their rhetoric right do you not jobs and\nNot looking at their own past of bringing up plenty of jobs with themselves and I guess it's all very predictable um but the president spoke about it I think most reasonable people would say said the right things shift\nYeah ... yeah the initial statement there I Know he later went on to basically a laugh at a lock them up chant so that's probably not the best way to do that too good\nBut yeah I mean today I body and the opening remarks that we used to all the right notes\nThese terrorizing acts are despicable and have no place in our country [noise]\nMuch never allow political violence to take root in America\nAnd I'm committed to doing everything in my power as president to stop at\nThe bottom line is that Americans most unify and we're\nShow the world that we are United together in peace and love and harmony as fellow American citizens there is no country like our

[noise] are they actually going to cover the fact of who he was speaking to today\nOh you're speaking to a group of young conservative young black conservatives will know that doesn't matter because if you take has already been with bad or as they were preparing to was ever previewing the story they're already saying he was using young black conservatives of props\nOkay so I was talking about toning down the rhetoric everybody's got a lot of toning down to do if we are actually going to do that like maybe when Kanye West comes out and support the president you don't call them quote and illiterate negro maybe what they're all combat held bound for a minute\nSo any black Americans voted for the president\nThey're all well and I'm quoting\nCNN host\nToken right I mean\nAll these other
