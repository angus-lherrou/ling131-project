this moment depending on what he's going to talk about it was a great promo I'll say something else to just to hear Michael Jordan speak\nHis voice has a president I'm not even a Jordan fan but you've noticed what I'm saying when he's talking it there's a presence\nThere that's the best way I could describe it um I mean there's a couple of big Michael Jordan fans on the show one being Robin and I don't want to hear the story about how he showered with them that's for another time [laughter] but Craig ... of a present ahah yeah ... ... is also a huge\nMichael Jordan fan as we talked about

purged the heat\nMichael Jordan did that to a lot of kids I made it made them bowls fans no doubt about it\nSo as I see this argument come back up did you see what LeBron James reaction was to this because he tweeted after he saw it bring it\nSaid all caps I'm ready Jordan would beat him and he said oh my bad I thought maybe you were kind of I'm never mind back to my regular schedule\nProgram so

Pittsburgh today he'll tour of the site of Saturday synagogue massacre and visit hospitalized survivors synagogues rabbis said the president would be welcome to the progressive Jewish group in Pittsburgh says he is not\nI don't think he'll face any significant criticism although this city has been critical of his comments about arming every city got you know it's a matter of money and it's also a matter of principle of this is a city that has welcomed migraines and immigrants and its history\nI think that they're going to look harshly upon that particular message for every city wholesome at least as of welcoming a president has this community I bet well ABC's\nMatt Goodman federal magistrate in Miami ordered accused male bombers sees are say oc held without bail peddling a hearing on friday authorities warned there may be more apparent pipe bombs and it appears they fifteenth has been recovered\nIf people are tired of waiting as we've seen before what do they do\nTry to come into the country illegally when they get caught what happens to them I mean it's it's another\nMass waiting to happen and I don't think that I think the unfortunate thing with all of this\nIs that if you bring up that hey maybe it's a bad idea for hundreds or thousands of people to show up at once at ports of entry that's a bad idea that's called hateful Xena phobic racist all of that\nWhen it's not you're also trying to avoid another as we've seen before humanitarian crisis at the border and I'm not talking about even last year or two we've seen it time and time again over the past decade\nWell we also know that not everyone here is going to be a applying for asylum right or or even close to fitting what needs to happen to get asylum yeah\nThey don't fit the criteria you do have people who are using this caravan which is quite part protest\nIt's been part you know safety in numbers as they make this journey into difficult journey all of that is true part organized right like very much so and there are people who are using it as a shield do try to come in with a very sympathetic group of people\n[noise] oh yeah you have people who have been deported multiple times traveling with the with the caravan sort of being are being formed\nOh yeah I don't know if you saw parts of the story and judicial watch they went down there you know um because they know not many people are going to do the job but they do they want to get the word out there um they got information of photos from Guatemala and authorities um\nRevealing that were\nSmall several unaccompanied minors were there with human smugglers\nAnd so they got the kids into custody they're getting them food water everything else they need smugglers have been arrested and the border investigation into criminal activity\nIs ongoing with the whole caravan so you got all these bad actors in there too right right and then you have a different authorities and this is where you don't know exactly what to believe when you're talking about Guatemalan officials\nWhat's their play ... you know why are they saying what they're saying um\nYou know because they're talking about this whole thing was organized there's nothing spontaneous about this it's very complex it's not a simple march caravan is a movement of radicalized forces to destabilize Central American countries\nAnd\nYou know you're talking about a number of people that were interviewed by judicial watch\nYou know saying well no we're not scared and our country we are coming here for work\nThat when they go to do interviews there are you know sort of organizers shouting out instructions\nOr in Spanish and then having particular people do the interviews ... to use the same\nTalking points over and over it's hard to believe this amount of people just decided you know what I'm going to join that I'm going to go ahead and go\nWhen you saw that there was a showdown on friday or the AP reported on this there are there you know the Mexican government some Mexican officials were stepping in to try to help\nPeople who were traveling in this caravan ... is that hey we can help you establish a permanent refugee status here in Mexico if you were fleeing violence for being a plane crime all that fear of your life we can do that here and there was a big standoff between federal officials and the caravan and the people the representatives of people in the Caribbean says no we're going north\nThey were boisterous says the AP puts it friday evening in their refusal to accept anything less than safe passage the U. S. borders thank you day yelled then they added no we're heading north [noise]\nAnd so and I like how is it what what has morphed into the conversation about the caravan as well as of course the Pittsburgh shooting because there's not\nOne of the things that set him off was this because he thought that the Jews were funding this invasion\nThat was one of the many things that set this guy off and now this is being used as well you can't talk about the care of and you can't talked about how this might not be a great thing because what you're doing is you're in your inciting nut jobs to kill people that's done which is not at all\nWhat Ninety nine point nine nine percent of the people who have been talking about this caravan are calling for to absolute nonsense\nA totally switching gears earlier this show of course you mentioned World Series is over\nA Red Sox win against the fourth time in the last Fifteen Years wow\nI can remember the day after they want to know for yeah I was listening to a a show where people from Boston We're calling in the talked about how much this meant to them they're watching like grandparents suffer through all these years of losing it all I remember at the time not being a fan of Boston but finding that touching yeah now it's just kind of annoying because\nThen they got good and be a an excellent and that's that's kind of what happens\nBut it is the most bitter for people in New York and then we talked with\nOr producer Craig called earlier is a big Yankee fan grew up in Jersey\nDid you see what he handed me during last break is well the cover of the New York post\nI got to admit this is kind of funny they hate the red Sox so much on the sports page it's just a picture of Clinton gr show the Dodgers with his hand over his face and says Eli series\nDream over his ... hammer for three home runs and they're all big gaps Dodgers lose an ashtray\n[noise] and then it says just below it sucks when nights title only Eighteen behind yanks\n[laughter] that is better than actual reporting it is and here the Dodgers did lose yeah\nThe dream is over and they are only Eighteen behind the Yankees the those are all in fact\nThat's that's a hefty dose of bitterness right there that's what that is my\nBig takeaway last night the same as there's the Dodgers lost that's the big thing I learned\n[noise] I got dominated just like the Yankees data and just like my Houston Astros I have no problem admitting that sign or even when he was behind this low pay you back on their way I guess\nAnd then I bring up questions like these especially as an Astros fan yeah because they got farther than the Yankees okay [laughter] that's I don't even manage I don't mean to reporting [laughter] okay now including\nBoth you guys with the question is it more painful\nTo get to the playoffs and then lose to this thing\nOr to just sucking the regular season never gets the playoffs which brings more pain\nTo to me uh it's as after watching the Astros suffer for so many years in terrible for so many years it's way worse to watch them not even how to sniff at the playoffs I mean I think about just a few years ago\nIt was a big deal that the Astros didn't lose a hundred games right and so to get to the AOL see as his great and you can't win all the time in Boston was clearly the better team and for you Greg\nAnd the Yankee fan and as always World Series or bust so when a World Series is devastating\nWhich is worse I think just give up than if you're not going to win the world series guys don't even play so just you'd be hanging season it find your eighty one in eighty one that's that would be better than getting about how they're not real Yankees they should all be fired if they were on fire and boom all
