E. D. V. O. F. at one end of media group\nReason we invented things like the same day delivery in P. P. N.

now a tropical storm blowing it sixty miles an hour\nPanama City Appalachian coal at Tallahassee are now starting to the conditions gradually get better so that rain is ending the Windsor decreasing the storm surge is decreasing but places like Georgia they are just being the wind starting to pick up starting to get very strong tropical storm force winds are happening right now\nABC News meteorologist Melissa Griffin in Tallahassee mayor Andrew Gillum has been surveying damage\nA lot of people believe that we dodged the bullet today and uh it's hard to say if you've got a tree across your house and so I Want to keep that in perspective but as we think about the potential consequences of the storm in this area [noise] um I've seen it a much worse\nOf course it is is that there is this idea floated out there that Trump's daughter Yvonne get might wind up being the next ambassador to the United nations because Nikki Haley says that she's stepping down at the end of the year are now if I get has already come out and said no I'm not going to do that ... that is not going to happen but Trump was asked about it and I think this is one of those moments where\nHe's he's very good at this is is identifying\nMoments that will drive people crazy\nAnd just taking advantage of it for the hell of doing it [laughter]\nI've heard a lot of them I've already learnt my very good with him I'm going to be people that know nothing to do it ... them but I Want to tell you the people that know know that even if it would be done in my mind them you know and then you left but does it live you didn't believe that right\nOkay hold on a second 'cause you know again like Jim Acosta look up to them it would be nepotism Mr President\nWould be ... this is what I'm Talking about he find those openings and he's very good at it to say I think she'd be dynamite at it just like sport but some people would say\n[noise] I think it would be rented them they\nMay not use you know and I remember because it does it not for this [laughter] even though I'm not sure that everybody more confidence in the world but then the game but but we are looking at ... and it is it [laughter]\nYou gotta Anderson Cooper on that night keeping them honest so please it would be nepotism Mr President you should not do it okay he likes to throw the shiny objects out there and watch people just run after him\nYes and then for the rest of us it is sort of just a fun game to follow along with them you know are much outrage and you are getting better and better at predicting at all the time they have a story about a woman this is kind of said the lottery seems to be in the news a lot of different story this is the Philippines right\nYeah well she played and she thought she won she thought you\nHad won the equivalent of about sixteen point six million dollars whole night she had the right number she had the winning six numbers\nAnd she saw she saw the numbers come out from the Philippine charity sweepstakes office the ultra lotto six fifty eight\nShe matched all the numbers you thought you just won millions and millions of dollars you might have heard all the ... yeah you see it yeah and all of a sudden your heart start speeding through your chest and you\nGet like the tingling sensation your body like oh my gosh I Can't believe this has just happened\nYeah\nAnd you're thinking I never got to work again I'm going to be able to pay off all the debts that I might have all of that stuff my kids are are going to be able to go to good schools all of that one of the\nWell then it turns out you know cue up the all low prices right horn a band as well she plays they're bad on October fourth and the ultra lotto six fifty eight results came out on October fifth\nThe six winning numbers were for a different drawing not hers\nSo as Hong ... well\nYeah well as her niece says it's like that money became stone to call me she couldn't stop crying and then she sent us that\nPicture so they are a lot a lot of games they got the altar lotto six fifty eight grand lotto six fifty five super lotto six forty nine and among others and that's why she got confused but she I mean what are the odds of that even you hit the right numbers just for the wrong game\nAnd you don't get jak for that or no you don't well no wait hold on she match three numbers for the one uh and wound up getting like thirty seven cents [laughter]\nThanks [laughter] that makes it worse\nThey were nothing oh wait a second yeah she did and I'm like oh like like ten grand\nAnd thirty centered said oh no not quite enough to cover the cost of the ticket that she bought\nListen maybe if you're there it's easy to understand this there's the six fifty eight and there's the whatever it sounds very confusing yeah\nIt does sound like there are a lot of different games that are out there that it is a little confusing I had a situation like that when I was I don't know maybe twelve or Thirteen and it was the McDonald's Monopoly game yeah and so I pulled off one of the tabs and it said like prize and it was a car\nAnd it was one of those moments I'm thinking oh my gosh I just want a car and I'm a I really I got excited sure I showed it to my brother and my cat [laughter] and I started getting cocky right and goes through that says you're eligible to potentially when a car here where I was one of those things like your entered into the drawing ... type of deal\nAnd I didn't hear the end of that for the entire ride home it was bad I'd I I went from having like I'm getting a Ford Mustang or whatever car it was sure to just I have nothing I Would rather just not have even thought I had one\nSo I can remember being a kid like almost having the argument of getting like the one of the sweeps\nIn the mail and you read it you don't read that part of the ... where it's like you may have one right if you send a sin blah blah blah right you just see the big bold letters you know like no mom it's for real you know it's not easy whatever but but it says\nAnd then you go through the same thing again with your own kids and you know it really doesn't mean that I Know you think it does but it actually does it\nUm some other things you want to get to 'em and there was a chant last night of lock her up and it wasn't about Hillary Clinton\nThe Trump rally or no it was not me to get to that also big bang theory you watch this I've watched a few episodes yeah it's okay\nI mean she's one of the most popular actresses out there right [noise]\nYou see this headline she says it's fine of her and her husband split the leaves [noise]\nFine [noise] what the heck does that mean\nThe whole lot to get you coming out this is hardly a game show\n\nLike the rescue team that Arnie out looking for a virus

are Supreme Court demanding their way of getting traffic all of that stuff how dare you call them a mob\nCNN has officially taken aside Kay of anarchists\nThey're losing people just regular clear headed people you're losing them we'll get into it [noise] um no we all hate I think we're all together on this you get a call from an unknown number uh-huh do you ever pick it up\nI never do now if I don't recognize the number I won't I won't pick it up and I figure if it's something important they'll leave a message you're not going right back but I don't ever pick up the phone or a pick up a call from a number I don't know\nI'm with you there some people are like yeah but what if what if it's an emergency and then I Can't call back some people you know they still just want to know so the new Google phone apparently pixel three go to take care of that\nBecause well it's a feature they called the call screen so you get a call and then you have a robot that can answer for you\nAnd then it'll transcribe what the person is saying and then you pick a reply for the robot say to them huh so you can answer it without actually having to talk to anybody\nEspecially for millennials that is awesome\nWell it could be good if you don't know the number you know if it's and it might be an important call you can have the back and forth I don't I don't know what's wrong which is to have an answering machine now\nJust have to do too yeah well this way I it seems like okay you can pick the reply and then if you want to join the conversation you could set of having to call back so am I getting this right 'cause I haven't heard the story yet\nYou're basically it's like it's like you were involved in a text conversation but the person on the other end of that conversation is actually talking and you're just telling the robot what to respond with\nYes fascinating right\nSo they can say whatever ... that you want them to say I'm going to see actually how it works is supposed to be rolled out next month okay now I'm looking forward to using those the boss called [laughter]\nTalk to my mother and her name is Sheryl ... good luck with that see how that goes um man this is an ex dream case of but dialing that you have yeah well\nThis is from a Honolulu a lot of people got phone calls from a hospital that cares for Hawaiian monk seals\nWhat makes a ... a a vet clinic\nSpecializing yeah specializing in Hawaii and monk seals sure marine mammal veterinarian clearer simian was at lunch when she got a call from the big island hospital where she's the director and there was silent on the other end nine more\nCalls followed so she's getting incessant phone calls and she thought there was a seal emergency so she rushed back to the hospital\nShe wasn't the only one getting these calls 'cause people started asking why the hospital was trying to call them nonstop and they're wondering what's going on is the right on with the phones\nAs they say there were ... billion calls made from one line she called the phone company in a rap tried to talk or through finding a possible a glitch with the line she walked into every lab and wound up finding the culprit what it was was a gap a gecko [noise]\nBad perched itself on a phone making calls to every one of the recent call history with his tiny gecko feet [laughter]\nDo you just didn't free dial ... dial re dial\nKorea's this whole story is gone now has gone viral and after finding out who was responsible for this she got the gecko put it outside on a plant um so that's a it was it was just one of those a little geckos trying to remind you can say Fifteen Percent or more car insurance [laughter]\n[noise] you know I don't know if we have all the time to get into this story right now but I don't know if you have the same power over geckos\nThat you do over cats uh-huh no one of the show and I do a big cat whisper you know one of the most bizarre stories is you driving throughout the Pacific northwest staying in eastern Oregon at a place where you had cats sleep in your head hell room we let them\nLittle mom and pop place in the southeast Oregon uh I I was staying there and apparently the cats are very friendly they have like six cats they're at the hotel and uh yeah one of them was very insistent on checking out my a hotel room\nAnd so she came in and you know the owner of the motel just said oh they're used to it if you don't want them in the room you can get a government and tell them to get out do get out I mean I don't really care I like cats they're fine\nBut she came in she
