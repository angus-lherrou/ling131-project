'em [laughter] makes it really difficult for victims and survivors and these guys are tragic event to even come forward yeah we we don't seem to have come very far from the Anita Hill days\nBut as I said hello last he they're not to come out and and talked to a lot of talk to me about due process or all the women out there that I'm hearing about who never came for it is really important not only for the for the survivors to be hurt but\nIf there's someone that credible in fact the fourth story is I think can be believed\nDo you have any sons Mazie do you\nWith the same standard apply\nOh oh you at all no credible evidence but they should be believe yeah and this kind of goes back to the extreme swings would depend on both ways I mean it absolutely I I don't know if there are a whole lot of people out there who would disagree with the idea that a woman who has an allegation like this needs to be heard no\nAnd the claims should be not swept under the rug and not only that I think most people say I can't imagine how painful it would be but you cannot take\nExtreme examples from the past and then suddenly say well now the the way to rectify all of that is to swing to the other extreme which is if somebody is accused they're guilty\nBecause you're forgetting about all the false accusations we've seen in our lifetime does a lot\nOf those high profile one would probably be the Duke lacrosse right yeah ... certainly comes to mind a so dapper then brings up the fact that none of the four others that this pool party were a Dr Ford was allegedly sexually assaulted none of the four others who were allegedly at this party remember ever being in the same house together\nIncluding her good friend yes now Mazie Hirono says that doesn't matter Dr Ford is still credible because of abortion but it's\nKind of ... are any very questionable in my mind and that and the minds of a lot of uh like hell on Judiciary Committee members who they are Democrats\nTell sitcoms and when I say that he's very al ... and you have an ideological agenda\nAs very al ... and I can sit here and talk about some of the cases that and that exemplifies Harris and in my view inability to the hair and the cases that come before and this is a person that it's going to be sitting on our Supreme Court making decisions that will impact I mean when a saint productive twice a month or\nHave very much again for the deck of\nElections have consequences okay what does that have to do with due process and Dr forge credibility when her good friend says I wasn't there what does that have to do with anything it's crappy talking points senator Geraldo\nTo tap or ask though aren't you then using a policy disagreement to influence your thoughts about the allegations of sexual assault\nOh good job\nBut this is why it is so important that there'd be a nice and investigation so that there's some effort at collaboration and we think that there was a lot of thinking going on as far as the friend his fans want cash not even testify that is a founding to me\nHe was like there in that realm seeming to testify for he's a member of an incident that I mean a lot of changes going on\nFor the blackout drunk doesn't remember that's why he's not a credible witness okay [noise] um if you feel so strongly about it a once he's confirmed you can keep up with your fight for justice in truth and if you ever do happen to find it\nThen you can do with the Democrats are already threatening which is to impeach Kavanaugh yeah\nBut I think they all know there's never going to be enough to impeach and so this is the desperate plea right now that's what it looks like taught it seems like and honestly I I mean you look at it seriously and this isn't to demonize Dr Ford talking just about the case is flimsy at best\nThe second accuser is even more so\nAnd I mean and I know if you're reading anything on line there's going to be more rights yeah very curious that it's in this point in the proceedings isn't it and nothing before last week but then all of a sudden it's out of the woodwork yeah\nSo I guess the learning lesson is so little late you're gonna have to get your ducks in a row earlier in the process\nOr I mean and in fairness at least have something more than he said she said and then all these other people are going to happen you know I mean actually have some evidence to back it up\nAnd you know yes there is this alleged third accuser out there we'll see what that story is when it comes out but that's the ... right and then worry about it ... I think is a different yeah anyway any of these cases that come out you look at it and you weigh it independently based on the fact that are available and at this point I don't know if you've really reached\nA level that you can say yes absolutely judge Kavanaugh should\nPull out his nomination should step aside I mean what is the precedent that would set you know that any accusation can derail someone that's that's not the way it works unless you're\nMazie Hirono right now there are ever told you about this this was a early on when I was first going to college there was an orientation that went on\nWere part of the freshman orientation was about sexual assault and drinking mhm what about you know making sure that you're not drinking too much making sure you're not putting yourself in bad situations where something bad could happen to you and they did have a rape survivor come and talk and it was very moving all of that about how that just the rail their life\nUm is a terrible situation but also it was kind of controversial I remember at the time but they had a guy who was falsely accused of rape also come talk to the young men in the room\nTo also gave a very similar message but said dude don't put yourself in a situation\nWhere you're going to ever be even close to credibly accused cars and this guy's case and I don't remember all the particulars of it but in this case the sexual assault but he was accused of happened in a house party where he wasn't there and he wound up being one hundred percent cleared of it but at the same time if you put his name into\nGoogle what shows up first but he's been accused of rape\nWow and he and he said look and I had a reputation for being somebody who drank a lot got blackout drunk I was at parties you know did things I shouldn't have done but never rising to that level but that's also the other and that's a sad testament to how sometimes the tide seems to be turning here in that in Mazie Hirono as world just the accusation major guilty\nRight but I mean like you said you think of Duke lacrosse do you think of the Rolling Stone cover story yes [laughter] it's got a lot of those a trip advisor one out of three reviews is fake are you surprised I Know I'm not\nBut if you've ever looked at trip advisor when picking out a hotel I might happening else that's why you weigh things carefully when you're looking at reviews\nI Know but at the same time I mean how do you spot which ones are fake how do you know which ones are real\nIt's almost impossible to get a vibe well I think the number one rule that I use is that if it has perfect grammar don't believe it because nobody in the history of the Internet has there ever left approve red review on line\nBut if you get hotels and restaurants buying positive reviews not so much from a pro game you mascot to look like it's just you know regular regular old Joe you would hope so\nThat and and you know this and you know this even at Amazon some of those are fake reviews but at the same\nTime once you get a vibe you checked out the Riviera actually seems pretty good it's almost like if you want to stay there you're looking for the use to make you feel better and then you're like yeah good reviews even though I Can't trust well a third of them this is just the way it is um other stuff to get two\nPuppies are blamed for diarrhea outbreak is

he's going to be meeting with Trump on Thursday that tried to ignore the stories that nobody's really clear or nobody's really sure what the story is with this guy right because there was a report that came out on friday that he had apparently talked about trying to tape\nThe president's secretly during the twenty Fifth Amendment and trying to invoke the twenty Fifth Amendment which I anyway\nYou know where I Am on that one\nBut this is why it's it's so dangerous and crazy to go wall to wall with this story because we don't know what all the facts are and this is a moment from CNN it's probably the best protein seconds of the day where they're trying to break down what does this mean it was\nReally strange I\nGuess why they're so much\nI Wish I could help preserve confusion but

know\nYou come from that game the news game it's not that hard is it we have to have dazzling coverage on my gosh I understand why everyone's out they're confused because we've we spent the better part of two years confusing the hell out of everybody right\nWell and they're not even talking about the gamut on situation and I don't even know if that's as confusing that's kind of like what lens are you seeing this story through I probably what you believe right\nBecause you do I mean you're out at the so called second accuser who says that what they got drunk their point of drinking game at Yale he pulled down as bans he waved his privates in front of her and then in a room full of people by the way none of member of this happening\nWell and she didn't her\nMemory was very fuzzy yes but after six days of talking with their lawyer and assessing her memory that's the worst assessing the memory and then it was like yeah I think this happened and it was and I remember trying to push them away and that's where my hand came in contact with\nIt ... and that's what happened but no one else remembers that at All right\nIt was a room full of people but still this is enough to apparently have judge Kavanaugh withdraw his nomination to be the next Supreme Court justice right\nHey how's it Keith Ellison thing going yeah because we keep hearing the story boy\nIf someone is accusing you got to believe him right unless they're accusing Keith Ellison\nYes devotee chair of the Democratic National Committee currently running to Minnesota attorney general says the woman accusing him of domestic abuse of just making it up\nHe was at a televised debate and was asked about the allegation from Karen Monaghan we've talked about it today to them for a while she claims that he was a motion we use of one time Yankee violently off of a bad when she didn't do something for them right something like taking out the trash or something like that mhm he's saying you know get the bleep out of my house all that\nNow here's this and it's very uncomfortable for Keith Ellison the audio from the debate because I mean one of the reasons why you gotta love local media is they'll actually asking these questions on the agenda setters on the national stage so true\nWe were in a long term relationship and it two years ago two days before the primary she made these allegations they're not true\nI've said that they're not true I've answered questions and gone on as many Murphy and others to to make these points clear ah there is an ongoing investigation which we hope will likely will not be done before the election [noise] I don't know\n[laughter] no I don't know why are you asking all these questions on me and you hear me deny it and I gave the timing\nShe made these allegations\nThey're not true two days before the primary of course so what is he saying it's politically motivated\nRight which I thought that would spur on Wall to wall coverage again but it does it no it doesn't because his Democrat right Monaghan by the way has offered to meet with him and people doing the investigation he says it's an independent investigation it's not\nWe can see in your area\nBecause the answer\nSaid my family and my name\nDestroy didn't\n[noise] this is Ninety six point five ... [noise]\n\nThey can't show Jamie Barclay that's millennial David Mann game [noise]\nYou know what I think this is really admirable of millennials I really do\nA ... story I was handed to me was from CNBC and the title is why millennials are flocking to rust belt real estate [noise] this is pretty cool they want to revitalize areas plus it's cheap\nYeah I was going to say it probably has less west to do with altruism as opposed to do also with you know the fact that it is cheaper to live in a lot of these\nPlaces that is true I mean they're talking about like Detroit we know that but also a town like Mansfield, Ohio\nMhm\nWe're talking about how they got a three bedroom Victorian home for thirty nine thousand nine hundred dollars\nAnd they say in the piece that rather than just homeownership it's about having roots and contributing to the revival of a place that needs businesses three that to create jobs and create value and that's also part of it\n[noise] [noise] well if you want to if you're really you're bracing the entrepreneurial spirit there's really not another a better general region to go\nDo right now if you're on the coast I mean you're kinda stuck in wherever you know not that it's all bad on either coast or in larger cities in the United states but you know you can actually strike out on your own do something different in a smaller community in a place that not a lot of people live right now okay\nSo when I see a piece like this I'm like wow that's kinda cool it's also written on the coast right\nDo you have any friends millennials friends that are described in this story that that's what it's about you ever want to be a part a community and set routes and even though it's a place like Mansfield him a few hours from you know a bigger town where there's a lot of stuff happening yeah but I have well last time I got to drive to work every day\nSo it kind of makes up for it and then I'll drive the extra time on the weekends to get to the bigger city\nYeah no I mean I I I have been that millennial and it's not so much about it is chasing a job and then also realizing that you can get the opportunity you want maybe not in the location you want to get the opportunity you want and also all the other things that go along with that cheaper rent yeah cheaper cost of living\nYour commute to work is five minutes as opposed to half an hour forty five minutes\nTheir advantage is a lot of good things to say about that yeah I'm not that this story is totally related in my mind it's about you know okay you're going to settle down you want to set some roots yeah right\nYou're in the relationship it's a long term or and to me that's related to this little study about how people gain quote love weight in a relationship\nYeah\nGoing to go to a smaller town and buy a house where to get fat it's all good\nA lot of diners out there in America ... according\nTo this new survey approximately four out of five people gain quote love weight when they get a serious relationship\nWhy is that there are eight reasons what would you think I can speak to my personal experiences you're going out to eat more yes that's actually number one\nIt's almost weird though because when you were single you just stay home and eat the more than ... okay\nWhen I was when I was single it was all make a big pot of ... or something in Iraq for like four days straight\nAnd so it's not like the healthiest meal option but it's also what ... beans and rice and fish or sausage maybe right that makes sense um what else would you think um while you're probably not well I realistically you're not on the market anymore so you're not quite as worried about whether or not you fit in the genes quite as\nLess motivation to keep up your physique that's also one of the reasons that would be seventh I'm somewhat say well you're taking more taxis river so you're not really walking as much maybe\n... going on walks was part of it they whatever um\nThat somebody like starting a family well that's certainly true you don't have time to work out yeah you're just not as I especially when the kids are small and you know that's a little bit tougher trying new foods in restaurants as a couple yeah I\nI Would kind of put that around and going out to eat a lot more but I understand that you're trying new things together\nGay exercising less to spend more time together and it's kind of covered in yeah like staying home to eat and drink and adopting a less active lifestyle and\nNetflix and Jill's wouldn't it be nice to just sit on the couch and watch them TV [noise] ... yeah it is there is that part you're like I'm tired of the game this is nice and comfortable I\nMean you don't want to get too comfortable you don't want to stop pursuing a person but there is though I Will get the bridges in Madison County by going home I don't even bring that up he was a different points or during the show\nAgain might get brought up and there might be five bucks but on it here there and we may have just heard that in the last segment\nDid you hear about the dude that was trying to make four hundred and fifty dollars over the weekend because different lines like you have to bet if you're looking to make a hundred dollars yeah\nAnd you know if it's you know the plus or minus you want to make a hundred dollars you got about five hundred to make a hundred right but if you better hungry and you when you could win five hundred if you went with the other ... that makes sense\nWell this guy is looking at this weekend Vikings bills bills looked terrible\nAnd it will be retiring half side that was going to say that miserable\nAnd so the Vikings heavy favorites in Vegas minus two thousand on them on the line so you'd have to bet a hundred dollars just to win five and as they say well that seems pointless unless you're sure they're going to win which most people work yeah\nSo there was dude that put nine grand on the

with a list of witnesses to her alleged encounter with Kevin all the\nFBI like with any other kind of priority investigation will deemed is at the top priority investigation for this period of time and will allocate all resources that are necessary to support the investigation they knew that there's the potential that this background investigation could be reopened\nKind of going off of what you said uh just ban was I mean when there are inconsistencies inconsistencies it is harder to believe the story and also really though for the people who matter\nMeaning in this particular case members of the Senate Judiciary committee ... who disrespected her\nThey said from day one what's getting hearing you tell your story and we'll talk about it and then it changed from well now we can't have the hearing without further FBI investigations\nWell now we can't even do that and even suggest that you would show up at a hearing as disrespectful and Brett Kavanaugh has to defend himself before he even knows what he's defending himself against anything short of that would be disrespectful so there has been on there have been a lot of inconsistencies here\nOf course and then there's a bunch of inconsistencies with the second accuser\nAnd you put on top of it the timing of everything and you're just looking at regional ... reasonable people looking at this whole situation going fan this doesn't seem right\nThis isn't someone making an accusation\nWhere you have a couple of different people say I wasn't in that room but I saw every one there yet they were there and I did see them drinking we don't have that here you know\nThis is nonsense say you brought up Keith Ellison because there's something kind of related to this whole thing okay Keith Ellison is accused of abusing a girlfriend that he had gone over this before\nAnd he's allowed to say by the way that you only came out for political reasons he's allowed to say that a notch yes because he had benefit of the doubt when it comes to the media about do you remember\nA Democrat out of California\nIn the state legislature named Cristina Garcia\nOh yeah she was a rest and the do yes she was the one who was accused by multiple man mhm and also it was kind of well known that when she drank she got Hansi there are other people who weren't accusers backing up that statement at least ... or so there's an investigation going on and do her\nWhatever she may have been doing groping guys inviting them up to her room and all that and threatening their careers if they did\nAnd she was also by the way featured in time magazine's the silence breakers\nPercent of the year or two every last year remember I didn't want to people and it turns out that she also had her own me two problems in the past mhm now this is from Politico just days after taking a victory lap for successfully shepherding a landmark build a beef up sexual harassment investigations and the California legislature\nTo leading female democratic legislators and to me too movement wrote generous political checks to their colleague assembly woman Cristina Garcia [laughter]\nSubject of an ongoing sexual harassment investigation see this is it is just about politics they don't give a crap about women who make accusations this is about politics\nAbsolutely or you could say it's about women period because if women are the accusers there to be believed if women are actually the ones doing the harassing they're also to be believed ...\nOr at least we're going to support them with our money\nRight and you had a lot of witnesses coming forward and say yeah this happened when she was drunk yes she did this to me she would make these comments you you don't have any of those with you right now do you avoid man it was some wild ...\nThere was well there was yes they're one of the accusations was some sort of company outing like a baseball game yeah and she cornered somebody you know and the dog out and grabbed him\nAnd said I'm going to bleep you and yeah that yeah and also by the way she had a keg in her office\nRight her defense was well it's a drinking culture in the in the state legislature you see [noise] right right but let's continue to funnel money into her coffers into her bank account um because we always apparently believed the women whether they're being accused of making accusations\nHow about just go back to part of the statement we heard earlier everyone deserves to be hurt them and\nEveryone deserves to be respected and then you look at the evidence whether it's male female it doesn't matter\nAbsolutely a
