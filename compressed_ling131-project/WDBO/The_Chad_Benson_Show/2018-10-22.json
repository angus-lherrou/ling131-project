your story and we don't want to make that ride\nWho says that right you know just try to bury the saying somewhere there's no one's saying that you own it okay and when you get to the bottom of it and this is where I Would say I'm not buying that we've we've got to have this internal investigation it's three people\nI Can't imagine and see any more than that who ordered it who oversaw the last draft of this\n... yeah we need to talk who called these people and said yes this is a person there is sexual assault survivor who whose responsibility was that well that would have been gym and and that would have been probably Brian over there\nOkay get gym and Brian in here now given Brian these names that are not sexual assault survivors how did you come up with these\nRight and you had your bottom of this and then when you make the statement here's the deal yeah Okay Jim and Brian they made this up now and\nIt's my bad for hiring them to begin with yeah whatever whatever but at least you're owning a and then at the very end you say him fired a date Ryan White yeah\nWhatever it might be that's what makes sense to people yeah we want to get to the bottom of it it doesn't take that long shouldn't right All right\nSomething else and I want to bring in our bodies got Robbins for this what Brian ever do to you [laughter] I'm just making up again you can insert any man named one of my cats mhm what do you want to fire my cat and he had nothing to do with this maybe that's where they came you showed me a picture of brain tissue\nAfter a road trip was happy to see you yes maybe it

fake news [noise]\nIt does not get easier\nWhy do you think for me has it okay say before your heart attacks a few yeah yeah yeah okay say you're sitting there at fifty four would you said yeah like it's easier at forty four Mm yeah probably okay you know why they say that is\nBecause people in their twenties stressed out about finding a job saving money dating stuff like that when you're in your thirties you stress over like moving up in a career starting a family things like that\nThen in your early forties you're trying to worry about work life balance your relatives getting older trying to plan for the future\nBut at forty four things start to turn around you get all that other stuff squared away and you can start relaxing and enjoying your life\nI'm waiting [laughter] [noise] that I'm going to achieve that yet\nAnd I got goals I suppose this also has to do with if you're going to have a family when did you start having the family and how old are your kids and how many kids do you have because this is all on average from the study\nUm\nThey say people's favorite things about their forties going on vacations earning a bit more money having a nicer car\nAnd then you know watch

which bill my gosh pleased that there's any tapes I don't want 'em around\nYou know I'm ...\nBut still I think my wife and I started having kids a little bit later at least from our peers yes so you're still sort of in the thick of it and you're running everywhere all the time there's that part of it and trying to achieve the work life balance\nBut yeah it is the one part where you get more comfortable in your own skin I think is really true and they say from the study best thing about being in your fifties you'd do stop worrying so much about what\nPeople think oh look at the way I dress [laughter]\nDo you think I care [laughter] come way past that sir\nI mean if you dress for the occasion but your every day where you're very comfortable in your own ... very much am I don't care anymore I think that's that's probably pretty good\nThat's one of the things I feel like I'm a little ahead of the curve on probably to a fault but I'm a little ahead of the curve on maybe\nWhat you were not caring about what I wear mhm [noise]\nYeah I mean if I'm giving advice I'd probably wait Twenty years on that David but hey man James van yet that you don't want my advice I don't need the

speech knocked it out of the Parker reasons for voting for Brett Kavanaugh to be on the Supreme Court um and stories are now looking into a suspicious letter that was sent her way\nTo her home in Bangor Maine well she was labeled a rape apologist right\nHow ridiculous man so they have no information to suggest that the public is in danger that's according to police department the FBI has been notified the er notified do about it\nUm\nThere was no information immediately available about the contents of the letter or the identity of the sender by believes it was delivered to the house and the reason why there had been sent to the senator's residents was not immediately clear um and so I mean we'll just have to keep an eye on this story but it's a scary time it's a scary time to be a lawmaker\nThe reason wasn't clear right [laughter]\nThat's what the ... just a coincidence that happened to show up at the Susan Collins house [laughter] no idea why ...\nUh there was another story that made some national news a possibility of a nine year old groping a grown woman\nYeah so last week this ... this went viral and and and then there's an update to this story now a woman who was dubbed corner store Caroline\nCalled the cops on a nine year old kid who thought that ah she she thought he grabbed her but\nShe lost her mind to this is in a corner store in Brooklyn and the cops got called because she thought that this nine year old boy yeah touched her but as he walked by and they're just a snippet of the audio of her freaking out and called the cops\nYeah\nAnd she's I mean she looks like something's not right between her ears I mean it it was a little crazy so surveillance video shows that the kids backpack brushed her behind yeah tight squeezing so and she's kind of leaning over\nThe counter and so he hurt his backpack brushes past her backside she turns around and immediately says you grow up to me I'm calling the cops and one of the things that's fascinating to me about this is it as the collision of two major\nSocial flat a flash points in our country right now one of them of course his race relations\nAnd the other being the me too movement the ads both together\nAnd here you have now a woman who is claiming that a young a nine year old and I mean not that it really mattered ultimately by nine year old was a black kid\nOn a story that we talked about yesterday David this is out of Toronto Police looking for dude decided to go skinny dipping sharks at an aquarium British aquarium in Canada ah was open later was jazz night\nYa I was yeah they were up in white and so they they attract a wider audience that they're going to go have some cocktails you know listen to some jazz look at the dangerous lagoon as it is knowing where you have a bunch of sharks and all that and of course someone in the crowd got video this dude stripping down and well doing back flips and stuff make it yeah [noise]\nI like the part of the story to where the authorities like hey you know over here yeah no in fact\nYeah he walks up to him and it looks like he's getting out now so he's swimming around with sharks just few inches away from its feet at one point you're right he started to get out been taunted the security did it backwards die back in a tank so we're wondering who is this guy\nBecause he got away security told them to stay and he just left before the cops got there so he's on the loose now there is an update to this could apparently he was really busy that night not only did it go swimming naked at the aquarium mhm but the cops also think he assaulted someone at a medieval times\nA couple of miles away from the aquarium just someone that was there for one of the characters someone that was buried okay they said he beat he beat up somebody I mean it was a\nIt was a brutal beating they said wow and then just a couple of miles away and many use decided I'm going to go to the aquarium it's wouldn't make it with the ... it was busy [laughter]\nSay man if it was just someone that was like in all the garb [laughter] yeah I don't think you're all that can bring your sword medieval times no but I had close friends and family that have gone and seen the pictures it looks like it could be a lot of fun\nTo actually it was the weirdest thing I only went once I went it was like a band of high school band dream and for whatever reason in Dallas they decide well we're in Dallas they decided let's go to medieval times for dinner because that's something that normal people do [noise]\nUm and so we go to medieval times with that and you never been there this is where they have like ... you get you get this big mug of what it's like diet Pepsi but they say it's meat or whatever and and you have the big turkey leg and all that stuff and then they put on a show for you they have a ... tournament\nTo win the part of the ... or whatever or some such nonsense\nAnd at the end it was so weird because there was all these dudes who were able to these Texas dude you were trying to do ... just terrible English accent I think my English accent is terrible this was like English with a southern twang [laughter]\nAnd so and so they do all this and at the very end the Victor the brave night who won the fake jousting tournament comes out and he he just runs several labs on his horse waiting the biggest American flag I've ever seen\nAnd I was what message are we sending your I don't understand what this is\nThat they could see in the future and they dreamed of a place like America someday America will overthrow this
