a statement like that is a very dangerous state but you know they talk about us we are\nExactly opposite you know the rally is where they send people I I heard somebody yesterday on your show actually talking about my rallies\nThat might rallies or really calm and and ... and and packed with people we don't have problems that arise and I would say this that it wasn't so successful for those protesters but that to be careful with the rhetoric because it's very dangerous what older says\nThere's no question and it's not just Eric Holder it's it's all over the place\nUh and the word mob is being used a and as if it's being encouraged Maxine Waters used it before as I mentioned being on civil that's something that Hillary Clinton brings up what does it mean to be in the big picture Andrew McCarthy or a prosecutor here in New York turned Fox News contributor best selling author cut Fifteen\nI just worry that it's not a four week phenomenon you know we can't here and do anything more than than calculate how does this affect what's going to happen on Tuesday night for weeks from now\nThis is not a genie that could easily put back in the bottle and has the eerie feeling of Nineteen sixties Nineteen seventies radicalism and it's a face I think we're just getting into the beginning of rather than a you know something that's going to be able to be contained in four weeks and remembers\nThrough the sixties and seventies and eighties Reagan get shot John Lennon get shot you have a Bobby kennedy get shot JFK get shot or Martin Luther king of course get shot George Wallace get shot people across the spectrum getting shot because they don't agree remember Gerald Ford was nearly assassinated would that lunatic\nA gun didn't go off right thankfully he ends up a surviving member he replaced a Richard Nixon for a while that's what he's worried about who wouldn't be worried about that\nI mean there's more guns out now and it seems to be more crazy people out now and there seems to be more outlets for with social media for these crazy people to get to know other crazy people\nAnd suddenly make it seem like it's OK especially when the so called leaders say it's okay listen to some with Don Lemon Maxine Waters Brooke Baldwin Matt Lewis listen to some of the texture of this conversation on other channels you probably don't listen to cut seven\nCall people mobs because they are exercising their constitutional right it's just beyond the pale we\nCannot allow Donald Trump and anybody else to take protest away from us and to name it to be violent and to try and make us look like a mob\nWhen you see people like Ted Cruz getting chased out or restaurants by a mob oh you're not going to use the word totally a mob\nMob why wouldn't you use the mob these people a lot of times they are paid does is their job\nChristian you'll send against Stephen Miller against Sarah Huckabee Sanders against Ted Cruz\nThat's what these guys are doing and these women are doing they feel so instead of actually doing something productive you can protest that's fine but that's all you do use screaming people you don't agree with who writes ... by the way Ted Cruz now is an eight point lead in Texas so your idol Beto O'Rourke who's got a lot of talent\nBut he's he's wrong on a lot of issues especially with\nWell the taxes are beginning to sober up\nI find a crazy a next I Want to talk about what's going to be happening today I have great hopes\nThat the president could accept Jim Brown's plan for establishing some type of prison reform because he's worked over Twenty years in prison setting up curriculums for life skills a lot of these men and women who get imprinted in have absolutely no uh the the education doesn't suffice they don't\nKnow how to balance a checkbook they don't have any uh they don't have a a sense of self esteem he going in there with the American program and it's all part of criminal justice reform you use that along with was already been out there by banned Jones in others and the president has a template for criminal justice reform\nAnd I hope something like that comes through today when they meet at lunch I Hope it isn't just hey Jim Brown how much money would you make if you were still playing today\nA instead they hope to make some progress so Kanye West is out and said I support President Trump is not everything I Want but man I could really get along with a lot of the things he says\n... somebody you don't know and neither do I knew what am I looking to meet was on CNN so when this came out the economy was who's going to the White House everyone thought this is hysterical listen to how they describe what Kanye West is cut twenty two\nNow all of a sudden ... because he put out an ad hats and he's an attention more like the president he's all of a sudden now that that the model spokes person he is he's the token negro of that of the Trump Administration\nThis is ridiculous and no one should be taking Kanye West seriously he clearly has already been hospitalized you know not to trivialize mental health here but I mean obviously Kanye a has taken a turn in a very strange way\nOkay a couple of things number one yet he ah like other people some people are um have ADD some people have manic depression or other people or or a bipolar\nAnd they're great people great contribute to society some or all time greats and I think about Mike Wallace who came out and says this I have depression I couldn't even get out of bed from times in my in my career and it's kind of work seven days a week for about sixty years\nI think Mike Wallace was pretty productive I don't think people said he was crazy this other person is on the tip of my tongue Abraham Lincoln he also had depression low long bouts of depression\nAnd I don't think there was mood altering a medication there was no Prozac back then but he worked his way through it and I think it became a pretty extraordinary person\nSo of Kanye West to I don't listen to his music that they choose not to I just don't come across it\nBut most people think he's a genius he certainly thinks he's a genius he's been successful for a lotta years and now all of a sudden he's mentally ill because he has a point of view Kansas Owens who had a chance to meet him and talk to them and they sounded nondisclosure I Believe that he's not going to talk she's not going to talk about what they meet\nBut she's indicate to me that there's nothing wrong with him a cut twenty three\nWhat they said last night with Ali waste is it was absolutely despicable I cannot believe that would be allowed that work well at least about having a house that's laughable I think that's funny to kind of stand up and say that I support Donald Trump terrified that\nThey're going to say what ever they can before him to make sure that no other black of a wake up and understand and it has been a left\nAnd that harms our role has been Democrat policies that have the right under our communities and the air and family talked about Chicago in Philadelphia and all the ... they had run down black people are having a ... al ... is a big part of the reason why I I don't know if it's\nMass I think you could potentially could be there at the very least the African American community if they will unite and combine like unions do a certain way and they ... as one vote and demand attention\nOr they could do it much like the Hispanic community has done much like women have done a much like the Asian community has done African American she'd say earned my vote\nI asked the president or on this ... expects to come out of this meeting with Jim Brown and Kanye West cut twenty\nTwo whole comes out of this meeting the friendship is already there the mutual respect authority of parents but what substantive can come out of this meeting\nFor Brian it probably saying I have a lot of African American support and a lot has developed over the last little while with ... coming out and around has been there for a long time I mean I've known him respected and maybe still truly [noise]\nCan you imagine him playing in the NFL today what it'd be make it I guess you double double what anyone else has got to he was the greatest and\nHe came out a long time ago for me what it was much less fashionable frankly and now you see the results we have the lowest\nIf you look at the unemployment if you look at any statistical lowest unemployment rate for African Americans in history and history the highest median income right now I'm thinking of it highest in history for African Americans\n[noise] so uh I ... when it comes to the inner city and life skills and building up the family I think that could be done I don't I Know you came up for some families to stay together but you could make the environment a little bit more palatable for families to stay together and I'm not asking to go back to for the stats say\nA before welfare rolled in related\nBefore a lot of these social programs rolled in related uh the African American family was a lot more solid and when you did this stats don't lie either when you coming from a solid family more than likely your kids a doesn't matter what race or nationality you are\nMore likely to come out of a with a set of values and beliefs in education that makes them\nPrime for success in our society we are going to come back and take some calls\nOne eight six six for all eight seven six six not if you ever want to ...

hit\nGround at a point out of four and now it's still at a three hitting Georgia\nAnd a lot of people are saying well this is a natural disaster and people who are pro climate change and say that America excuse America the world is responsible human beings responsible for these hurricanes there get offended they say it's not natural to say natural a natural disaster because we're causing it\nGreg right stone does not feel that way he has written books on this it's called the inconvenient inconvenience facts basically with Al Gore is not telling you about the science that Al Gore doesn't want you to know a great joined just now Greg\nWelcome back Oh thanks so much Brian so does this go ahead\nYeah this hurricane is just a great example of outrageous latch onto a any natural calamity and it is natural and then try and try it back to to climate change in our what I call our sins of the mission are increasing CEO to content from burning carbon dioxide bailing these hurricanes tornadoes forest fires you name it\nUh because they want to strike fear in the heart of the population in order to get things like the Paris climate accord and acted thought\nIn the big picture you say hurricanes have always been there would they would argue is the worst and there are more now because of human activity\nTo get the science the facts and the day that don't support that in fact a\nReliably alarmist inter governmental panel on climate change I've PCC agrees with me they agree that hurricane numbers have not been increasing and even if you go to the NOAA website\nOr we could see that uh most of the numbers and particularly land falling hurricanes in the United states have been a ... definite decline for more than a century\nAll the while CEO to and temperatures been increasing a particular land falling a hurricanes are are are stark and they're easily accountable and we can take them back\nI'm really into the the end of the nineteenth century but he was just a satellite record when we can capture rely for records of ... of tropical storms and hurricanes ah we also see a decline\nA definite decline not significant put a decline nonetheless of both tropical storms and psych clouds which which are hurricanes by the way\nI'm Neil DeGrasse Tyson famed said this earthquake tsunami and tornados traditionally acts of God on insurance forms but climate change continues and coastal flooding from hurricane worsens or the forms might now include acts of humans from your own [noise]\nAgain they're they're linking what we have to do is is a gang go back to what is the science tell us what do we see in the long term data\nWe've had two years now which way and falling hurricanes in the United states so it seems like there are more but in the big picture or we'd gone back before last year we'd gone twelve years with no major hurricane\nMaking landfall in the United states and that's the longest period with no major hurricane striking landfall some snow or\nI'll begin capturing records back in Eighteen well because they go back to their records go back to Eighteen fifty twelve years with no major hurricanes making landfall where you have to go back to the Eighteen sixties to get the second longest period with no major hurricane striking the United states so so you look at things like that\nAnd what they do is take a short period of time and confused that\nUh what they need to do really as alarm the population um list what I\nH A man called imaginary hop goblins of alarm ... which they need to fight in the population to get otherwise onerous regulations like the Paris climate accord or not I mean who who in their right mind and why would the United states and act\nJust harmful and economically crippling legislation like a carbon taxes or the Paris climate accord unless there was not imminent catastrophe that we need to prevent a and that's why they're doing is they're painting\nEvery natural calamity like I mentioned before things like tornadoes which had been in the long term decline and believe it or not forest fires are also long term decline\nEven though the way it seems like all of California's burning all the time\nRight there are localized increases in in California we can that that's actually an interesting story Cal Fire here I'm getting off on a different subject but with Cal Fire ministers almost twenty five million acres\nOf the lower lying non mountainous training and their forest fires are actually declining over the last several decades in California the high mountainous areas controlled by the U.S Forest Service we have seen an increase there but it's probably due to different a forest management practices were um they have not\nPreviously they had control berms to clear it out a lot of the brush in fact the head of Cal Fire said there were four to five times as many trees in that area\nControlled by the U.S Forest Service than what a healthy forest ... wouldn't normally have just imagine you've got all these trees competing for the little bit of moisture there\nRecently invented things like the same day delivery and PBS Jay in the same jar we love convenience which is what

here protecting Saudi Arabia\nAnd I've told the king king Solomon ... you gotta pay it and it said that the loud and\nClear and they're going to kill the feeling of merit and you can be killing ... says everything is yet right now sir is that in jeopardy now I have\nTo find out what happened when I go out and we're probably getting closer than you might think but I have to find out\nWhat happened the Washington Post is reporting this morning that the crown prince Mohammed bin Salman boarded the operation tour and back to Saudi Arabia from Virginia and entertainment and according to us and tell intercepts of Saudi officials discussing the plant I've had that sounds like it goes right to the top as president well it\nWould be a very sad thing and we will probably know in the short future we have certainly incredible people and credible talent working on it we don't like it I don't like it no good [laughter]\n[noise] yeah I mean it's unbelievable that they think they can go just take out a journalist or because they don't like to read their critical in the Saudi Government and there's a lot to criticize\nI don't really know much about this guy I just know that uh they do report is\nThe latest report is intelligence has picked up intercept that says that they want it to get him and bring it back to Saudi Arabia they were trying to lure matter Virginia he goes over to turkey and they pick them up and then they do in somehow during the so called rendition two teams of Fifteen pick 'em up he ended up dead\nSo whether it was rendition gone wrong or you had a heart attack or in their midst in some something happened a they're in trouble and the one thing Saudi Arabia we were looking the other way because the Saudis were taken on Iran and counter balancing a lot of ... activity through the region\nThis puts it all in jeopardy all of it\nIn my mind and in the future our I'm not sure the order in which you're taking the show we're going to be treating the Bob Corker about that a bipartisan put a push to go after Saudi Arabia a and sanction them for what they may or may not have done to Jamal\n... he was a Senator Chris Murphy cut thirty six\nWe're also engaged in a very disastrous military partnership with them inside Yemen today but it's predicated on us believing this out and said that they are not intentionally trying to kill civilians inside Yemen where the United states is helping them bomb\nGiven the fact that they may be lying to our face about what happened inside this consulate in Turkey why on earth which we should we continue to believe them that they are targeting civilians with bombs inside Yemen when all of the evidence tells us that they are just as most of the evidence we've seen thus far tells us\nThat they did kill ... a a show you so I think it really calls into question whether we should continue in this partnership with them or inside the civil war and you have a\nCouple of things I Can't give you the latest on Yemen but I Will say this it doesn't even work to the Saudis advantage to kill civilians they're going after the who the rebels why because they're being propped up\nBy Iran who's around in the in the Arab world uh they uh they're mostly Shia uh the mostly they're a Shia and what is Saudi Arabia a Sunni and what are they trying to do take over Yemen why would they let their neighbors being takeover or by hostile power\nAnd just standby so we used to buy a lot of the military for Saudi Arabia you're the ... the United states has changed that they're actually paying for these days Rand Paul actually siding with Chris Murphy on this ... thirty eight\nI think you could say that there may not be proof that they killed a journalist or even that the journalists has been killed yet but what you do have evidence of is that the Saudis have been bombing civilians in Yemen for over a year now several million people live on the edge of starvation\nYeah we'll see what's going on but what role does Iran have in that have you spoken out against them and read polls case he just wants to pull out everywhere ...\nBuildings fall and they get toppled and Americans get beheaded when we pulled out of Iran\nWhen we Iraq when we when we left Afghanistan to its own devices are kind of came in you don't have the choice to be oversimplifying like that but I think there's going to be a major issue today Jason singing serious or a in St Louis say Jason\nListen to your show all the time I'm I'm not saying that the Democrats should be violent but I Do feel that the Democrats need to fight fire with fire\nAnd I think the problem is Republican but never adopted this play book and I think are upsides and I agree with the water that we can ... the constituents wherever they're at\nAnd that's exactly what I Would do because I'm a fighter myself and I agree with what commander Harris said we need to figure out why these other people were not interview by the FBI and also heard supposedly that Justice John Roberts is going to be hearing complaints filed\nClassically child but I'll ride during his confirmation hearing\nWe don't know I don't ... um before that you say that you I I'm I'm a little confused you don't support Maxine Waters is saying that you should wear by Trump officials and started protesting in front of them you do support\nEric Holder says kick them or you do I
