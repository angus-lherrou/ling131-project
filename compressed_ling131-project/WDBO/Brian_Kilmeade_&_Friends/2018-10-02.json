to Christine lousy\nForward it we're at a high school party where she says Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh sexually assaulted her that's according to lawyers ... and mark judge at the background investigation into the judge expanded income\nSays he wants the FBI to do a thorough job now that it has reopened background investigation into Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh\nI Want them to do a very comprehensive\nInvestigation whatever\nMeans according to\nThe senators and the Republicans and the Republican majority I Want them to do that\nI'm heading home friday afternoon eastern time and I see this so I'm watching without the sound\nJeff Flake get up tap Chris Coons on the shoulder and they walked out where it is just something going on we watched Jeff Flake and there's a story behind that somehow these two activists who are going to be sexually assaulted I have no idea starts screaming and Jeff Flake and what does he stuck in an elevator ... with the door open and alive CNN camera rolling\nI'm not said could be totally coincidence once he's supposed to do push right away and go in the elevator especially what she's screaming sexual assault and there's no threat he's traveling by himself and I put out a tweet\nOr a press release saying I Will vote for judge Kavanaugh this comes out and they target him by the time he gets downstairs he has a change of heart and he says I'm going to vote for capital out of committee but I Will not vote for him on the floor which could be critical in the end tank the entire ... nomination\nUntil I get I get a five day seven day FBI investigation they cut the deal Grassley pessimistic McConnell chemicals the White House the White House calls the FBI game on\nYou knew it as soon as this investigation with every Democrat was asking for was implemented they were going to raise the bar and complain that it wasn't brought enough why we have an artificial timeframe on this why can't we just let it go on and on and on\nAnd that was the story over the last few days and it was so so very predictable and you know what\nHe's already made progress they've already interviewed the Yale student Debbie Ramirez who is now in her fifties the your members thirty three years ago in freshman year she says they Brett Kavanaugh even though she was beyond drunk\nExposed himself and he couldn't remember going to the New Yorker story right away and then she thought about it and thought about it well now she sat down with the FBI evidently she's got some people to operate that story\nBut that is just stopped Democrats were saying this isn't a good enough investigation here at center a magical ruined no cut for\nEven seven days that's bad enough for them to limit the FBI as to the scope and there's no question that that really is a [laughter]\nI learned days away for that kind of the nation and all of us are expecting the FBI to conduct\nNo no it's the same type of Justice Thomas investigation with ADD hill they're going to take in the relevant people\nA route Brett Kavanaugh from thirty plus years ago and they're going to put together a thrill to just like Kavanaugh said just like the FBI always does just like Joe Biden was educating us in the Nineteen nineties why are you surprised and then Jeff Flake\nListen to Jeff Flake who I like I think he did some great work he basically saved the life of Steve's go at least on the on the field and he's a good\nPerson I don't understand why he just can't tolerate Trump but I couldn't understand how Mitt Romney at of everybody couldn't tolerate Trump that Tom Cotton good that when the Graham could that McCain I don't understand it but here is Jeff Flake has always been a conservative not a moderate\nGet tape Bush ... staffer\nWho the great ... go judicial record get them in front of them wants to vote for him but because of these other transgressions he pulls back now he's on the fence then he's going to set to vote so are you sorry his moral compass and his worry kind of just got the better of them and then he says this last night\nSenator Flake you've announced which are not running for reelection and I wonder could have done the [noise] if you were running or not attract and not a chance\nBecause politics has become too sharp to me that there is no value to reaching across the aisle there's no currency for that anymore there's no incentive\nTo do I have to outline to you [noise] how hypocritical and how\nHe marginalized his own move on friday\nPeople say well he rose above politics usually goes about politics because his ratings were so low he dropped out of politics and now we want me to ... I think that his moral compass\nLet them this way that he wanted to save American government what if he decided to stay in office or if this was your three of his six year term you wouldn't have dreamed of doing that why what Susan Collins\nMurkowski did Corker was considering it now you have mentioned and others thinking about doing it but Jeff Flake did this whole historic move and said if I wasn't retiree I wouldn't be able to do it I don't get it and then Chris Coons sits down on sixty minutes who I like\nBut I thought would be the one Democrat they would say you know I I think having a you know I'm a moderate to liberal Democrat but he's so he's really confident like his record I'm going to stand behind him his take Chris Coons is pulling for Jeff Flake too ... party\nWho is Chris Coons going to vote for judge Kavanaugh regardless of how the investigation came out now he says he was too angry when he came out\nTo angry why wouldn't you be angry you spend your whole life with a great reputation and then someone to reading your high school yearbook do you have to ruining you through the mud for ten days and maybe asking unfair questions for thirty\nTom Cotton cut nine\nFor three months the Democrats have turned the advice and consent process into a search and destroy your mission\nThese allegations are completely supported by any evidence what evidence there is thirty six year old ... all support judge Kavanaugh's denial but then the Democrats have disgrace this process and the United States Senate and the orchestrated smear campaign a character assassination they've run against judge Kavanaugh\nExactly listen to this Dianne Feinstein the FBI's hands must not be tightened the sophistication we need the facts and she goes on to say she wants to ...

Kan coon just did typically flake let say because I think Coons\nMay well be a decent man but he was clearly on the Democrats' side in this dirty job um I I think what flake did was real war does who who flung most mud and let's not forget Dianne Feinstein withholding that letter\nOr imagined that how what a storm this has hung unleash the doctor for its claims Feinstein had that letter and met with Kavanaugh privately and never mentioned it now suddenly it shakes the world I mean where is her judgment\nWhere ... people who said this old Brett Kavanaugh has got to be investigated okay fine but if you're going to go investigate cabinet and what he said and go back to see if he did drink and not not that I think it's relevant if you're dragging Seventeen sexual assault I think is a but if you didn't commit a crime but you had a few beers that you admit to I don't understand why they drove\nIn but if you had to go back and look at behavior then go back and investigate Dr Ford what would you do and in tenth grade how many parties you Chico as did you lie about other things along the way who else did she do who else did she tell that day\nUh before we do that I Want to back up on Jeff Flake as much as I I've met them talk to them and I thought to be able to overcome his distaste\nFor President Trump he never did and now he left politics\nHe lost all credibility to me I thought he acted out of more moral compass it made him stand up and thought he could heal everybody but listen to how what he said to Scott ... question\nSenator Flake you've announced which are not running for reelection and I wonder could you have done this\nIf you were running or not you're not a chance because politics has become too sharp ... there was no value to reaching across the aisle there's no

doesn't matter he's out there anyway so it means nothing\nWell not only that Brian I'm I think he's being dishonest they're he wants to run for president ... talked about that and and there is among many I think Republicans this idea that you can be a Republican and the anti Trump at the same time I mean the never Trump voters\nWill love Jeff Flake and I think that's so this is\nThis is a political move disguised as a moral move now politics can sometimes be moral but let's see I I think flake as being dishonest when he denies or any political that this is an anti political move this is not anti political for him it's very personal and very political\nThree county commissioners who were already make more than any one thousand dollars a year have voted to give themselves a

at something like this\nI was really stunned by how we acted at that hearing this as a basically a job interview for the highest court other land a her testimony was compelling credible or both

to get at that and\nThat's Amy ... from a a Minnesota and so that's one idea right that is one idea it's a job of well or as a job interview I never got a job interview where they looked at me go so here you're a rapist\nAnd these people over here who may hire you or may not higher figure right\nSo you're an alcoholic rapist things that you you you put people in positions to be raped as a child

couching it in the fact that\nI'd alcoholism and my own family my dad is Ninety now struggled with a throughout his life and finally got treatment and his sober I got help from a and so I was actually trying to get it the truth and that's why I was stunned by how he answered it but then of course he he later apologized\nYeah but you're trying to diagnose him as an alcoholic\nMinus\nMe I can name

you know people want it controlled managed immigration system\nAnd you are a again son of immigrants you are what we would call here and that's a politically correct ruled a person of color and joined

particular\nTalking around slum who is the executive director an editor of national views new book out called melting pot or civil war son of immigrants makes the case against open borders let's talk about some of the things the only things you talk about is is and something I've been screaming for a long time if I Want to get mad anybody for for immigrating to our country especially in particular to legally that's where we're really talking about\nIs at some point in time we have to start pointing the fingers at the uh fingers at ...\nAnd governments who have allowed there there are corrupt systems to fail their own people and they're looking for you know a place where they can go and make a living for themselves places like Mexico and Guatemala El Salvador and elsewhere and I don't think people understand that\nThis is a hugely\nImportant point what we're looking at is a comprehensive failure on the part of many different actors so the ... you know it's not just about attacking immigrants it's really about the fact that we allow this to happen and we've allowed our systems to break down\nIn service to certain interest groups including employers or unscrupulous and who'd taken advantage of this broken system\nYou know you talk about the simulation which to me is vitally important I I've always said this is you know I I've been fortunate to live around the world I played soccer do all kinds of stuff living in Europe for for almost a decade on and off and\nI've always said ... ... how somebody assimilate is really going to the American experience is going to be based on that and assimilation is key if you want to be part of the culture America's open armed for you if you just want to come here and be you here and not really enjoy all of this stuff America is ... ... it's not going to work\n[noise] you've really hit the nail on the head of this is the big issue people talk about a simulation as though it's all one single thing and the truth is that we're seeing two different kinds of assimilation in America right now you have some folks or assimilating into the mainstream oftentimes because\nThey have the language skills they're able to enter the middle class\nThey are prepared for it in a way and then you have other folks who are often times great decent hardworking people but they find that they're being incorporated into a marginalized

ridiculous line of questioning\nOn having a he is author of ship of fools out today and it's very much like your show how selfish ruling class at bringing America to the brink of revolution emulate talker and you're like your show and I know you do you're going to love this book took her this is your show right I mean this is really we get portions of this and your commentary everyday\nWell it's something I've been reading about since two thousand Fifteen when Trump cut in the race and I knew Trump like most people in the media you know Trump obviously and the idea that he was can be elected president\nSeemed ludicrous to me as it is because he wasn't from politics and then he starts to win and I started to think about like why is this happening why is the public supporting Donald Trump nothing against Trump it just seems unlikely\nAnd it made me think maybe there's something huge going on just beneath the surface and of course there was the middle class is dying\nAnd the numbers show that really clearly what was amazing to me and what I've never gotten over would have been mad about ever since the reason I wrote the book is that nobody cares and nobody in charge somebody who made the decisions that have destroyed the middle class has taken responsibility for those decisions or learn anything from them\nAnd so I wrote a book that's the kind of tribute to them kind of a howl of rage\nRight and I think it is so unique about your show and it it really the way Fox a line up to their prime time let them is that you and Sean are different\nI mean from day one children's like I Am here I'm a fan of the president I'm going to support the president but I think you are a you're a big picture guy what does this mean overall he'll support the president really has to but I also remember you taking on the president because you thought you'd be way too critical Jeff Sessions\nSo that doesn't bother you to be critical but you look at the big picture and say wait a second we're not even getting to the policies you just trying to stop a guy from being president\nWell yeah I mean I'm interested in the ideas and I I really I'm grateful that Trump has said a lot of truth things out loud when nobody had the votes to do that you know are we we have a right to secure our borders and every trade deal we sign is not\nFair just because it's a trade deal like the other side she live up to its obligations just obvious things that nobody was saying and I'm I'll never stopped being grateful that she said those rights\nBut to me I've never been you know what will trot politician I like some of them but but really it's about the idea of what's best for the country and my great frustration is that no one's even talking about it it's like to read kept trying to get drunk in college while we playing along with us so\nSo I wasn't really as into politics then as I Am now a as you were when when Bork was up for yeah for me I'll never forget but here's the thing\nBuilding like his ideas they act like they didn't like what it costs ... that's such a good point and it was all it was a fun debate so you're angry and people aren't and it's not fair and that's fine and I you know do I think it's fine in the big picture a guy who was nominated they went out their citizens how we feel they didn't like the ... and somehow they manage\nYou can get it now they're going after him and saying okay he's got twenty five years of a really good track record and we have free time he volunteers when he has additional free time he coaches\nAnd now they're saying wait a second in twelfth grade it was a party and in there there was a tenth grade ... and the tenth grade it might not even have been there but according to Kevin uh wasn't\nAnd then she don't she got there we don't know how she laugh we don't know who invited her she doesn't remember where the houses so let's destroy him\nTo coach the father of this so this to me this is an out of body experience for me personally and you you just told us on television guys you got to take a step republic should take a step back and say stop getting involved with the tenth grade party\nAnd understand what's happening and that's what Randy Barnett on a rival show of yours would the shedding brain who is hard to work with what's going on and she was on last night he's Georgetown University law school professor listen to what he said is at stake here and I think is very uh Tucker Carlson a cut twenty to\nThis is about stopping and there was this will conservative from making it onto the court\nThis would be to about stopping the next one that was nominated in his place should he be withdrawn and worst case scenario he makes it on the court this is about ... the Supreme Court five vote conservative Supreme Court\nThis is about ... our United States Supreme Court something that we were told in the past we should not be doing but this is what this was about so if they should if Kavanaugh should go on the court\nThey want him to be damaged goods because they want any rulings that come from the court to be damaged\nAnd piled onto he's our president he's not our president he's not with Jay he didn't get the majority of the vote the Russians stole the election this plays into ship a fool's so next thing you know what do we have we don't like our history we've taken a statue down we don't like the Supreme Court it's not real he drank in college or high school and\nSecurity the graphics that are still got\nThis kind of show an eye for west bound and Dirksen in ... county on the left lane is locked or delays extend all the way back to sanction for about thirty minutes they are starting to pick up the coast hopefully this is going to be cleared shortly but in the meantime you can take Seventeen Ninety two as are alternate Torrance there's Ninety six twenty five WD bill\nThis is six point five ...\nInsane so he won't come on my show which is I understand I wouldn't come on my show either if I were him but Lindsey Graham and Tom Cotton that's it I mean you've got the majority of senators are Republicans why are they not out there defending their own beliefs and their own voters I don't understand\nSo I I watch this thing so you know what happens on Fox and friends you use to Fox and friends weekend uh it's hard keeping everyone work it's such a hard job it's hard if he's going to be town but behind the scenes they worked nonstop so so Sean grown men who used to live on well when you were in your prime\nHe says he says let's go and and go out for a ... a few beers a few drinks whenever you drinking at noon\nOn friday so when I'm leaving walking over I think there's going to be a vote and I'm like okay I kind of want to watch his my office but I'm gonna walk over to the bar next door and hang out with my friends\nWhich were next thing you know we asked the bartender can you put the sound of what's going on and we're watching live\nTucker Tucker will watching live just like being ... by a woman who says I don't matter to you I've been sexually assaulting you tell me I don't matter new one is helping there is no security there Jeff Flake doesn't have the courage enough to say listen I'm Sorry what happened to you but we'll just have to do with Brett Kavanaugh and it doesn't\nReally believe what he sang and never has that's the difference when Democrats say we want power and we will crush anyone in our way to get up there not joking I mean it when Republicans say we believe in X Y and Z whatever voters say they believe they're lying they don't believe that what they really want is to be loved by people hate them they're weak and they're pathetic [noise]\nUm I thought it was interesting too is that the president sat there for an extra hour after major deal I think when you reach egg or NAFTA no I don't I don't write a lot of trade agreements I used to try and the weekends but then after our games but I'm listening to like some of the bullet points on this makes total sense and by the\nWay almost everyone says it he held out to the last minute with Justin Trudeau adjusting to do basically gave in on almost everything the same thing he's doing with\nA he did with the European Union has got a framework he might be due in Brazil next Japan came over the other day they say the framework for bilateral agreement he's rebalancing trade with America First in mind\nWhy can't people get behind that now you have Democrats who go yeah we've been wanting somebody to take on China for a long time\nSo the president's kind of winning the do they have in the morning sucked up to ... leadership meant by the way yeah and you you talked about that I mean ... wrote about it what is Mitch McConnell's investment in some different things in China and other politicians who are sold that unbelievable\nHere you have are actual main geo political rival China which seeks to displace the U.S military and economic exactly\nAnd culturally by the way which is exerting enormous cultural influence\nOver entertainment you can't you can't put the Dalai Lama Hollywood film a Chinese won't allow it really sort of Russians are tampering with our democracy in our culture please spare me I'm bored by your dumped talking this is my complaint again with the Republicans is they fall for this crap\nWhich is totally disingenuous it doesn't mean anything is dogs barking and they play along Russia I'm not even gonna you know what your boring may stop let's talk about the real threat China\nBut uh that's absolutely true and and here's the other thing about China they were actually repressing there are people more in the eighties we thought if you brought in uh the Internet and we brought in give these people give the Chinese government would lose control as they got more access to a different way of life is actually dead it's gone it's gotten worse\nBecause technology has a better their repression actually it's much more efficient to repress people digitally than it ever was with the conventional secret police\nWhich I couldn't have predicted a Tucker Carlson has his brand new book out Ghost Ship a fool's how selfish ruling class are bringing America to the brink of revolution if it were to many people who loved his finance and commentary especially on a show that's really the foundation of this book would come back and just a moment and if he's\nIf he's a nice guy as it used to be when he was doing Fox and friends weekend he might be able to give us some books to\nGive away to some of our lives right if you want the same guy but a lot of times people go prime time and he totally changed I completely I have we pick this up as you were talking to him before\nIs this the same Tucker do you know because before I got here you are talking today wasn't talking when she was talking to one of my assistance related seven I Can't remember her name of that is what you want to know her name tags Alison ... has he changed his nicer than ever now I get to sleep a little later oh that's so he's not as ...\nAnd his hair looks better look better I can afford
