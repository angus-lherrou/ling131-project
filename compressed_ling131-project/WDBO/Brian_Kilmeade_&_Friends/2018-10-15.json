purchase and then the the F yelled at such an engine optimization ethical would all all ...\nAll right well let's talk a little bit so so what's going on with your business on line\n[noise] well the problem now than what some of it\nIs obviously what most of us have as you know if you have as many good reviews that go on line to help you out of the bed ridden the balance it out\nBut obviously it doesn't work that way you know are the people have experience it's usually doesn't go online and put post there the positive experiences with you at your business\nSo when I'm Out here it's mostly the negative responses that are starting to add up more than than the positive responses to what I Need to do it by something or someone to neutralize the negative responses that's happened to my business a lot\nOkay All right so here's the deal before I Would contract with any reputation type management farm okay [noise]\nIs I Would encourage you to do this yourself because you are may be able to do it more effectively and do exactly what they do ... and then you will further understand how this all works okay\nBecause as a as a small business owner and I'm a small business owner too\nIs that you know you it's one thing tell somebody do a job it's another thing tell somebody do the job when you've already done the job right but and so what I Would do is it is are these on like Yelp or where where is it so I'm Glad for all the\nMedical while it's like ... grade that car okay all they use excel\nOkay so okay you a couple of things you can do number one to mitigate the negative you have to accelerate the positive okay\nDon't anybody who comes in they should be given a card from the gal the front desk that says we appreciate positive reviews so with their ... and on your receipt it says we appreciate positive reviews think of every touch point that you have with that client\nAnd tell them that you appreciate positive reviews okay but because I guarantee you that if you start telling them that this is what you need this is what you want to switch you appreciate this is what you're thankful for you know if they had a great time they're happy to do that and\nYou know if somebody says gosh you know gosh doctor you just saved my life I mean I never looked and felt so great ever before\nYou say you know can you help on line and just dropped some rep in there and I think over time say four to six weeks you'll find that those positive reviews are now out weighing the negative reviews okay okay so that's the ... the other thing you can get let me finish\nThe other thing you can do is with health grades is drop them a note and say I don't agree with this negative review I'd like to be able to respond to it\nAnd what I have heard is that when you do this is that health grades will remove it health grades also has a program called recognize Dr status\nAnd that'll put you at the top and then it will also you'll have because now you're having more positive reviewed as you'll be able to get that recognition there\nAre there are some sites and it's nothing other than an extortion scam\nI get I get it\nBut where if you pay them a certain fee\nThat they will spotlight your business\nYou'll have more tools available to you you'll have other ways to say I want this review to be front and center and I don't want to be I don't want this review to be on the top anymore\nSo so in answer to your question instead of signing up with a service to do this and I haven't heard a lot of good positive feedback from people who have signed up for the service and that's why I'm encouraging you refer you to do it yourself\nOkay is that to to accentuate that positive okay and to work with search engine optimization\nAnd to learn what it is before you hire affirmed because there are so many scammers out there who purport to know everything about as CEO and they say oh for five thousand dollars what would you at the top of the Google Search results\nThat will

people question his legitimacy and that's what the Mueller probe does\nBut who cares what I think when the guy like governor of New Hampshire's here Christian who knew and his dad who was also very successful in his own right Johnson it into a year and both are shy about giving their opinions unless you really changed or a governor have you changed\nI haven't yet I still have a lot of warmth and charm you do how do you get right to the boy was what was it like I mean growing up still waiting for the warmth and try to do it from where you like that as a dad\nI we used to read your commentators

used to living saint and um and she she really handle the the fact that I was in public life quite well um\nAnd of course she was in public life herself she was chairman of the school board and Salem um got elected to that she was chairman of the Republican Party of the state of New Hampshire before I got into politics\nWhile so I didn't know you guys going to be in Studio right away but I didn't do this and I am going to break format a little bit because you're from New and you're the governor ...\nI Am yes I I plan to be for a while yeah enough to uh\nBut there was a guy that he was a guest speaker keynote speaker New Hampshire but the Democratic party he's Alec Baldwin and he is an interesting choice to their little gym at least twenty five democratic candidates for president and they need New Hampshire they need Iowa than each South Carolina but Alec Baldwin hours you have to leaving the Senate to nail mocking Donald Trump\nBurst your thoughts about the Democratic party picking him\nA shameful frankly it really is I mean when you look at a an individual like that and his background you know I mean Democrats Maine's mainstream Democrats whether you're in New Hampshire or national really have to decide I you know are you going to stand up and want to work with folks and get things done we're going to be part of this you know extreme fringe Hollywood liberal\nLeaders and that that comes out of there it's not it's definitely not New Hampshire whether you talk about Republicans Democrats independents where very purple state right so the fact that he comes up given a lot of the things that he said in the past the fact that they have someone like him headlining the party I think it's it's disgraceful\n... governor you got a John I guess I don't feel comfortable and I'm just short of a show that he was out a little about boulders remarks\nSure just as ridiculous as you would imagine for a twist in\nThe way we implement change the way we implement change in America through elections we change governments here at home in an orderly and formal way it ... or early ephemeral way an awful way or you need to overthrow the government of the United states under Donald Trump [noise]\nYou know the Democrats love talking about dog whistles telling me that that overthrow is not a dog whistle to the mob\nOr that has been assembled which Soros money across the country from what you saw in Portland what you saw in Washington or during the Kavanaugh hearings all this insanity and and threats of violence than actual implementation of violence they've got to watch their language or something horrible it's going to happen the Democratic party has become the irresponsible party\nAnd and people are to understand that especially with only three weeks left in the election\nIn a Christian or a governor um there's a sense that this is Donald Trump started it I'm going to play their side Donald Trump started with Israel looking ways and since they got so beat and everybody was so surprised and they're watching his rallies\nThey're saying we have to do that too that's what the people one or the misreading him of course no of\nCourse look they're misleading America is what the people want it shouldn't be it it they have this mentality of us versus them us versus them whereas if you want to get something done you got to be able to work work with people and you got to be able to talk to a family or business or an individual and see what their struggles are find a way to implement a solution and simply get it done\nOr that that is what people want and so I find that the folks especially in New Hampshire really they they want to meet you write we talk about retail politics knocking on doors to talking one on one with folks they want to look in the I I'm I I tried to govern with retail management right we do the same thing what what is the need out there where did the system breakdown how do we make it better\nBut really focusing on that kind of stuff you get things done at the end of the day I always think that's what's gonna win out now in an election\nTwenty two days into the midterms which will be the Senate and house on the side there were twenty six governorships up Democrats seem to have the advantage here more Republicans are up a first off how do you approach that you don't really look for the national message right you look for that state miss most\nStates implement on their own and and when you look at the most popular governors in the country they're all Republican because they bring 'em a kind of those business ideals family ideals are conservative ideals in terms of governing in implementing new ideas for for the citizens and and and they get results so that the Republicans have a lot of seats to defend this time around to be sure but I have no doubt they're going to be successful because\nThe key is not letting the negativity the ugliness of Washington define your constituency to do to find the success that we're having a New Hampshire Charlie Baker savvy Massachusetts or feel Scott Vermont or or you could go down the entire list you can't let that Nick negativity defined ourselves and governors doing great job of separating ourselves and focusing on results\nSo uh I I agree with Leslie stall said\nThat this president's really understanding the job more who could it's tough to anybody would be the most you can be a President Bush forty three and still watch your dad in the job watch Reagan and the job and still have an adjustment period but it won't be a businessman where you call your own shots and your son does what you ask them to wear your daughter implements which which is supposed to do\nSo listen to even with Andrea Mitchell is saying about the president's performance they'll cut eleven\n[laughter] that's ... ... ... ... how much a lot of being out at the rally it had it with prime time\nThough everyone is covering on then carrying live as if they had in the past but ... doesn't seem to have any penetration and who is really enjoy the president and who can say it\nI I I think that's true Brian he is enjoying being president he has learned how to take a little bit of the rough edges off um he is I think his\nEven though I'm a his rhetoric cars still pointed and sharp I think it is it is less a it is more tolerable for some people than it used to be and I think he's made great headway and I think if the Republicans managed to hold the house it will because the because Donald Trump has been able to rally the vote and get it out\nGovernment when you talk to him or you can communicate with the president what do you tell them New Hampshire wants what I care about\nIt's it's real simple new ... New Hampshire needs results we do I mean look when you look at Washington DC I criticize Congress all the time or the Congress is down there to basically support a policy and find some funding but that's it senators and congressmen are out there trying to implement new ideas create new systems\nSo when we talk to the president we really talk about how we can implement a new system if you will to receive a certain amount of funding for X Y and Z whatever it is here's how it's going to change and not just change for the government for change for individuals and when you can talk on that grassroots level because it's a business you know I run a business and I wouldn't put myself in his level in terms of running business but\nA business leaders understand you have to get results at the end of the day and so to be able to talk that language I think as has been able to uh reverberate a bit with both him and his administration president\nLike NAFTA you guys up propose Matt NAFTA and Clinton and ... John Sununu and Clinton actually pushed it voted Democratic president and got it ratified do you like the new NAFTA and did you take it personal and the president said NAFTA wasn't good for us no I think the old NAFTA\nIf you will was appropriate at the time when it was put into place but over the over time uh our trading partners learned how to game was simply the game I think the new NAFTA deals with some of those tough issues brings jobs back and I think it's a really good thing that the president was able to get both Canada and Mexico to come on board with the change is great\nAnd it shows the president would walk away and say I don't even know when he captured in this thing you know I I don't even think we need to adapt to maybe I'm just due to bilateral but now we see that that's part of the game\nSo he is using us the media has a way to negotiate with they know their country and that's really what he was talking about yesterday with North Korea like what you're seeing all these nice things about a leader who killed his over ... because\nHe basically said it was so easy this is just the beginning does it I had a method to doing this aren't you getting it yet and my job do ... and Chris that I shouldn't be\nYou know you're you're spot on and again it it it was a bit nerve wracking and there were some as a border state to Canada where our biggest trading partner is just north of us uh there was some some some some tension is if you will there is this going to get done get done but he has this negotiating strategy the new deal is a good deal to be short and people have to remember this is just against face to face three\nOf a multi phased process where now puts pressure on Europe to get a better deal done in Europe which ultimately will lead to more pressure in Asia Stephen\nHarper is quoted as saying it's generally can a chili understood in Canada that we got much better deal than they did uh he used to be the prime minister there\nIt was a good deal for everybody and ah and ah the important thing for people to understand is that when Trump goes and makes the deal he's willing to give a little to get a little and and I think that's what happened does it not only they give a little to get a little on both sides they gave a lot to get a lot and\nWhat this is great for our dairy farmers for example this is great for other industries that had been shut out of Canada for a long time and the Canadians got something out of\nCongress got to fight it because Trump propose it or because they've been praising the this new deal\nI think it'll get through Congress I think that there's enough and therefore for constituencies across the board that that it's going to be tough for even the Democrats to try and screwed up although who knows nowadays are Schumer and Pelosi what screw up a one car funeral\nBy well uh when we come back and when asked as soon as is it possible to bridge the divide between the bushes and the trumps mate would go back in a moment\nIs news maybe six point happy you baby were turns first for breaking news weather\nIf you're feeling this weekend maybe around Saturday morning fall it was here\nAnd now it's gone nine thirty and he was Ninety six twenty five ... ...\nOther hot week we'll talk about your weather and a second or top story President Trump traveled to Florida and Georgia today to see for himself the damage from hurricane Michael first lady Melania Trump is coming into your spokeswoman Kellyanne Conway this morning\nOr they see the president has a whole of government approach to the parents have had a ... and wants to be there on the ground to witness firsthand shouldn't be touching down around noon today number at his\nCabinet members are there and have\nAwesome housing and other natural disasters and whether devastation [noise]\nThe president initiation can ready to\nCheck back in on our land those news at noon is we track the president after landing and there'd be listening to Orlando Z ... evening news at six with Tony marine on your ride home that's when you can hear the full story on the president's visits today All right and now they're new change on ice four to tell you about\nAnything point five ...\nOrlando turns burst for severe weather I cannot I wouldn't ...

[noise]\nThe Brian killing me to a new he's got to be six point but I Do believe Phoebe\nI mean we are at the beginning George I think there has been very difficult for the Republican spray paint but I think given the last ten days the presidents had now not impossible but you know with the news cycle here um you never know what's gonna happen to the next twenty four forty eight hours a day to what I you know a better because I think the president and the numbers reflect that\nAre absolutely and uh even with Nikki Haley despite the Nikki Haley situation which got a lot of publicity and a with a resignation\nAbout two months but it's official that took away a little of the president's role but the way he treated her and the kind words they had for each other next day type a sense that people were jumping ship before the midterms\nSo maybe crisis averted combat Evans here in Studio a real clear politics you know Tom we're also a way of telling me second a better real clear politics dot com who's ... and does a lot of the average is to talk about where these trends are heading Tom welcome back pretty be with you so you just heard some of the speculation from Chris Christie house not impossible is he right\nHe's definitely right I mean if you look at what's happened over the last ten days we've seen in our race rankings we've seen a number of tossup races pure tossup races go from a forty down about twenty nine and all of this move to a Republican direction we haven't now to a five to one\nI'm average net gain for Democrats in our model is twenty four point five so that the twenty three right they need twenty three so just over the button and that's down from about thirty one point five in the middle of September so I think we have seen a things improving for Republicans certainly in the Senate but also in the house\nAnd um [noise] we'll see whether the trends continue or not but if they do continue there's absolutely chance to Republicans could keep the house very interesting\nAnd I don't think anybody is saying that they're going to lose a Senate\nAh they were in around Labor Day might've been you Tom what you said you know there's this problem says problems in Texas He said there's problems in Tennessee obviously Rick Scott is going to have a handful of Bill Nelson pulling up the up to that when it's always going to happen now he's still going

the Republicans would again and those red states where the Democrats held serve but now things have changed in what way\n[noise] well I mean everything's moved and Republicans directions or in the Republican's direction\nOr anywhere from you know two to five points depending on the state we've seen Marsha Blackburn pull in Tennessee we've seen Heidi Heitkamp the bottom fell out for her in North Dakota\nWe're still waiting on polls in Indiana by the way and Montana I don't know why we haven't seen polls\nAre in those two states it's a little bit shocking to me but the polls we had on Ted Cruz's pulled away a little bit in Texas and most importantly I think that the poll for Republicans anyway is the polls in Arizona and Nevada have shifted\nFrom small them we'd now to tie raises basically Nevada is that is a tie I'm Sorry a Arizona's a flat out tying are real clear politics average\nTell us up by less than half a percent of Nevada right\nThat suggests lake seat and then send

done look at my congressional record\nAnd she's very effective on camera very comfortable in their own skin she is the candidate that does it just needs to tell her story why what's the struggle what's happening in Arizona there's still a struggle [noise]\nWell it's it's is it changing as Arizona changed or\nArizona has been changing a for for some time now and it's no longer a deep red state
