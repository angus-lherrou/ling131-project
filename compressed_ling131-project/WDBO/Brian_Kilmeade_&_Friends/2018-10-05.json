to put together a look to see this cooperation to the allegations thrown at a freshman at Yale Brett\nKavanaugh and somebody went to high schools thirty six years ago about the sexual assault and and the sexual exposure when in college and with Debbie Ramirez was the ... exposure sexual assault that was course doctor of a sport so with the idea to set up to find out the truth they're the best you can see if they can cooperate the story\nAnd they did a pretty good job amongst the people that get to be mark judge legal in Kaiser PJ Smith\nAnd Timothy ... debt Chris Garrett those are friends from

so\n... so you would think Democrats would feel as though even though they're not going to vote for him anyway and it's all a uh it's all and exercising utility in the big picture he's the hope was that people like Susan Collins\nCenter mccaskey Republicans do all all as well as the specially Jeff Flake would feel as though they didn't investigation and their nominated a guy that doesn't have an ugly history\nBack to high school not talking about an ugly twenty or thirty year old a bride Kevin uh we're talking about a teenager\n[noise] so with that comes in investigation and with them comes some outrage believe it or not Democrats should the surprise of few perhaps our outrage or about the investigation somebody even using expletives to describe it which I find unbelievable\nUh they do not like this investigation wasn't throwing up you've Chris Coons who I always thought it was a moderate and rational says it was not thorough enough they wish they had more time more time can you

fresh set of eyes in every situation\nA sober lead by looking at everybody's background it doesn't mean because you're a woman saying I was sexually assaulted that you're a hundred percent right we saw what happened with Virginia and the Rolling Stone story and the woman that claim that she was raped we know what happened the Duke lacrosse case he says yes high profile cases there were flat out

this are as evidence of that factor [noise] senators have requested background check out what their [noise]\nAnd listen if you want to read what how they feel he's with Susan Collins sent did yesterday she spent over an hour and a half looking at all this paperwork and she emerged undecided according to reports but does feel as though was Thoreau\nA Jeff Flake had positive thing says there's no corroborating evidence that's what he wanted\nTo make sure of keep in mind Jeff Flake profiles as a conservative he's a conservative like George Will who hates Donald Trump he's a conservative like Ben Sasse but it was like Donald Trump Donald Trump for the most part has kept a low profile because he's not the issue and Brett Kavanaugh is more of a traditional Republican\nBut then Donald Trump in fact there were many people if you remember who were upset that he got nominated because he got to traditional it's too easy or they just wanted to conservative on the court\nWithout without catching that wouldn't cause many waves that white George Bush to the person the United states former forty three was working the phones is white collar robot company that's why you see people that know what like Dana Perino constantly so rice go out and see I Know him quite guy you're not seen Donald Trump and um you know writes previous\nUh and people from the Trump era they associate down Trump pushing them because they just got to know him\nHe was on the federal a swift will screened multiple times\nHere's one Murkowski said it would be helpful for me in kind of there was a list of those interviewed we were not done we were not done in there so mccaskey wanted more time gets a hundred people got to go to one location and read that staffers reading to them but not many so mccaskey is going back this morning as as presumably is there or as just left to go back\nNow if you want to read the tea leaves Murkowski was meeting with women's groups all afternoon they got they should you know it's it's it's a split your representing your city excuse me representing your state\nBut the same time you representing your beliefs and if you're looking at the guy's judicial record I think he had fifty two votes maybe more but now with these allegations from high school and college it's making everyone reconsider I Do think the Democrats totally clear overplay their hand as a report this morning\nThat there's been pressure on Kaiser she is one of the uh people\nAre put forward and was interviewed her name is we wouldn't Kaiser old friend affords who was allegedly at the party she keeps saying I don't remember being at the party she never mentioned to me sexual assault\nThere's been pressure on Kaiser according to her amongst Democrats to change her story she says I'm not that would Grassley picked up reportedly when I talk to him today he was on we with me on Fox and friends about an hour ago\nSo Grassley said we've got some of that I Can't give out details in the report but I Want to see everything that you were going to give to the FBI because if I did not interviewed Dr ... I don't need to watch the hours of testimony it's under oath presumably you didn't why you're not going to change the story you're not gonna remember something magically in an hour but we would like to see\nYour um your therapist notes and they like to see some of the polygraph test it may be some receipts to find out who is paying for all this that will be nice\nBut along the way there's carnage people like Brett Kavanaugh up no longer can teach at Harvard because the students were protesting he'd be a distraction\nNow people like uh they used to room with him about twenty they used to be in a storm they have signed a petition that the Brett Kavanaugh they know drank a lot so in college so he should not be on the bench and former Supreme Court justice a liberal guy John Paul Stevens he has now changed his mind cutting done\nAt that time yeah I thought he had that lay their qualifications for them to sit on the Supreme Court and it'd be confirmed if it\nWas ever selected but I've changed my views for for reasons that have no really no relationship to his ah intellectual ability or is the record as a federal judge his of things\nThat are all good and they should have been in for when he was nominated so but I think that his performance during the hearings cause me to change my mind\nNo it didn't use thirty hours of course you should worry about the three hundred plus decisions which you should focus on an between someone's life has been bitterly destroyed he's been made to drunk\nOr somebody who a date rapes people a guy's group sex or spiked punch punch quaint losing to punch bowls or look at what has been done to him sexually assault drunken drunk in ... in college\nSo he has that and he defends himself he actually weren't editorial the wall Street Journal said I looked at my testimony maybe got too emotional but I was representing my daughter's my parents and my wife when I was out there\nSo it was called being a human being and if that liberal the Supreme Court justice Saudi was qualified he's still qualify now dance scene or weight and I just said hey guys\nJust get this in perspective Brett Kavanaugh made a statement this is a widespread conspiracy to take him down personally and professionally it's not the first time you've you think he's going to be biased on the court and you should worry about who's already on the court and already said in their statements that they are biased cut Seventeen\nAnd sixteen and you had Ruth ginsburg giving interviews in New York Times openly campaigning against Donald Trump and saying she was gonna move to New Zealand were elected I mean at times [noise]\nYou know Supreme Court justices or human and sometimes they say things that are inappropriate or political Aaron temperate I just think given all that was going on in this world footprint Brett Kavanaugh was not disqualify and that's why I think I'll get tougher\nAs much as dancing or thinks that it's really down to people he hasn't spoken to\nNor by Senator Murkowski senator Collins Jeff like\nThere's a report on hot air uh from somebody that said uh from one of the reporters who said they talked to a Jeff ... center
