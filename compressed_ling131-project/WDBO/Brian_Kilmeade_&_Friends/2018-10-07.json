my dad who were just it just died a few weeks ago and so I think you'd be happy me calling him getting onto your show so\nI appreciate it you know cross fire was a defining show in the history of political debate in the country and and Pat Buchanan and breathing and all those original guys there\nIt was an amazing show and it's funny\nYeah so I can empathize with I'm Brett Kavanaugh was one of those middle school nerds that you know it was probably watching those types of shows and uh doing those things that people want to block now but\nIn any event I think there's a silver lining potentially till the FBI investigation number one first of work conservatives we have a moral help us if we if we do detect that there's something wrong then he should be thrown overboard that's number one is it without being said but I don't that's not going to be found that being said\nIt's an opportunity for the Republicans to investigate further in turn the lands on the Democrat they're dirty tricks and use the power not that anybody should be abusing that power but the FBI should use the power\nTo investigate everything that's going on here and potentially witness was being coached ally people being put forward to sign false affidavits\nThere's obviously a lot of that funny business going on I don't think Democrats ever thought that the public and we're going to allow such an

I don't know yet but uh I think that's correct so here with the agreement with our colleagues and Chris Coons was never part of the agreement he's a Democrat from Delaware Chris but he was never part of the ... what compromise has been reached for Chris Coons he is voting no\nHe's asking for the investigation to continue around whether or not he's been honest about it as drinking habits to Chris Coons is a non factor here Lisa Murkowski Susan Collins and Jeff Flake expressed a desire for the FBI\nTo talk to the witnesses around the Ford allegation and ... and the fall and incredibly incredible lead within a week I think the FBI is about finished everybody can look at that report for themselves and safest changed anything I Hope we don't move the goalpost Geoff oh did you sing committee\nWith the understanding that he wanted to see what the FBI found about these accusations and hopefully get this done this week\nAll right let's talk about this agreement because it was supposed to be limited and the scope and now it is expanded out further we now see the ... ah your your colleague on the Senate Judiciary committee the great senator from the state of Hawaii who wants to mend by the way to sit down and shut up\nYeah which was pretty outrageous statement but anyway a senator Hirono now is saying she wants to nip FBI investigation into the quote I throwing report yeah\nYeah that's where we are so my dad owns a bar\nAnd so a throw in ice is like a good day in a bar so the bottom line is that's all a bunch of BS and she's not part of the agreement she voted and she's the one it said the goal was to take away\nA the hearing long enough to get into the mid term soon and I have a Democrat replace a Justice Kennedy and twenty twenty she said that not one media outlets fed ask her what did you mean but they're agreement I just outlined it was a three witnesses that Dr Ford named\nMess for ... that there are any a credible leads within that world of FBI will follow them and that's it and we're going to vote this week\nOkay let's talk a little bit about your on the program last night on on Hannity and I thought you dropped a huge bomb shell and I was asking you look I have no idea how Jeff Flake is going to end up voting in this I have no idea what Lisa Murkowski is going to do I have no idea what Susan Collins is going to do yeah\nThey are your colleagues maybe you up some more insight than I have but\nTo me they're the ones that met privately with Joe Manchin and they decided on this course now that it's an FBI investigation but we're going to be limited in scope is now expanded out into other allegations but it'd be a full one vote short you up with a pretty\nInteresting and thoughtful idea that I kind of like\n[noise] well I think we've got the votes and then some but here's the question does the Republican Party abandon Brett Kavanaugh do we legitimize\nThe way he was treated at the Senate is it forty nine what I Would like to see happen is to appeal the verdict of the Senate and the November election and take it to some of these states and see if the people in those states agree with senator about Brett Kavanaugh the swap\nWould abandon Kevin ... the traditional way of doing business is if they fail one vote short just pull the plug\nHe's never quit I don't want to quit on him so I think Trump might be different I think Trump would say listen this man it's been abused on not given up on hand less have an election to see if the vote in the Senate really represented the Trump states were Democrats a rain\nWell I mean this is the thing I mean we have people like Joe Donnelly ... he's a no he said already Claire McCaskill's know already as a matter of fact yeah most Democrats will know no matter\nWho Donald Trump ... they've already against score six\nYeah All right so now what is going to happen to Bill Nelson of Florida and Joe Manchin and Heidi Heitkamp and Joe Donnelly and well a smart question Martin makes Sally is a great candidate for the Republicans in Arizona most served their country with honor and distinction I Hope she wins\nUm we certainly could use a win out in Nevada or do you think this impacts the race and do you actually think you're going to get the votes and why do you think you get the votes\nWell number one I think we're going to get the votes because Jeff voted in committee yes I don't believe the FBI is going to find anything a relevant to this limited investigation that would show that\nDr ... force claims are more credible and that there's anything new about Brett Kavanaugh in terms of the investigation I Would hope they would stay consistent with this vote I think the other two Collins and Murkowski or friends they're warning death ... check the committee's homework I get that\nThat will be done here shortly but you're asking me a hypothetical\nI Can't imagine how we would explain to the Republican Party that we gave up on Brett Kavanaugh because for one vote short when a lot of the states that led to that vote being short Trump won I Do not believe North Dakota wants a Heidi Heitkamp to vote no\nI agree with you\nI Am so this is why you have an election appeal the verdict of the Senate if we have to to the people of of the country and November\n\nMe ask you if you've spoken to these red state Trump state Democrats that are up for reelection if you talk to any of\nThem doing it right now uh so you mean you're you're communicating Hannah I'm not sure if they're all Hannity listeners and viewers are beyond that I doubt if they're lifting\nI think we're fine but here's the dilemma that you that this process has put us in this is about the teacher the judiciary\nThe states couldn't be higher this about the reputation of one of the finest man I Know it's about who would come forward after this debacle is about setting the tone and the standard that will destroy the ...\nAnd eat the Senate alive\nSo I Know President Trump pretty well I think we've got the votes and then some but I think he's a different kind of politician that he wouldn't let the system get off the hook that if we had to as a last resort where one vote short let's say hypothetically we would take this issue to the ballot box in about thirty something days\nThirty five we can find yeah find that extra vote that way we would have a good nominee or have the lights salvaged have a process uh fate and the people finally get to speak up here I think we're fine but you asked me a question and I thought about this yesterday\nAnd said if Brett Kavanaugh is on the ballot in some of the states I think it changes the election you see in North Dakota there's a poll out today the number one issue in North Dakota is I'm Brett Kavanaugh's nomination is far ahead of anything else sixty to twenty eight people in North Dakota North Dakota support Brett Kavanaugh\nWell it's fascinating to me that the Democratic leadership is showing no support or comprehension or understanding of what their colleagues from states that are not New York and California have to go through in terms of reelection but the reality is\nThat I Would even argue that if they do vote for cabinet solely an election year conversion and they're only doing it because if they don't the people in their state will throw him out but they'll probably go right back to to being a party line vote would Schumer at the end of the\nDay [laughter] well you know I'm I'm not a psychologist or political scientist I don't care is like you know I'm a bad this I don't care how you find Jesus as long as you do you know if you can figure out that Brett Kavanaugh is highly qualified and these accusations have crumbled\nAre good for you and now here's the point this has become the most despicable thing I've seen in Washington and as saying a lot it changed the face of the judiciary forever if we condone it so it's not a complicated issue for me if\nWe follow vote short a less take this to the ballot box and see what happens\nLet me ask you about this whole process now we've gone through and and I do think the Republicans and you know I'm pretty honest broker I'm pretty critical of Republicans when they're wrong I Do think that they they have handled this with the seriousness the charge deserves\nI think ... [noise] yes no I think they handled it properly because these are serious allegations but she identified and and look I won't go through the ... the entire\nWe don't need to we don't need to re try this case I made a donor and you've made up your mind there five accusations that have are are are not verified or just made up not true outrageous so it's not about Cabot off\nFor them is that this is the environment we live in senator and I warn those arguments on radio and TV every two and four years\nIf you're a Republican or conservative when you're running for office you're going to be called a racist or sexist the point a massage it is the home of folk Xena fold Islamophobia you're going to be accused of wanting dirty air and water you're going to be accused of wanting to kill children\nAnd it's going to be all look alike of youth throwing a grandma over a cliff is as predictable as the day is long and now with Supreme Court nominees\nThis slander has been taken to a whole new level do you have a nice throwing incident when you were nine I mean it's ridiculous\n[laughter] yeah adding I stepped on granny over the cliff is the new standard so Scott ridiculous it started as a brush fire again back to the doctor for she's been betrayed by the other side as much as\nCancer at AOL less habits missile researchers needed to we need to find a cure for this devastating disease for more information on this bipartisan bill visit I save team dot org ... save team dot org [noise] hard\nReady and Brian kill me you know me from Fox and friends in the morning and the Fox news channel which you may not know is on the radio show right here I really respect your diversity is diversity and viewpoints your viewpoints and political position even when we disagree and sometimes we do so I Want to hear from you Orlando each and every day in the brain kill me Joe weekday nights 'til noon\nNews Ninety six point by WTO\nIs news maybe six point\nYour baby oh we'll turn first for breaking news\nFrom ... political victory\nIn the Senate confirmation of Brett Kavanaugh to the Supreme Court and his swearing in hours later to a crowd at a rally for Republican candidates in Topeka, Kansas\nAnd I want to thank our in front of a Republican senators for refusing\nTo back down in the face of the Democrats\nThe\nWhite House correspondent Jonathan Karl completing a polarizing chapter in American history and cementing a conservative shift for the nation's high court for a generation the vote fifty to forty eight is the narrowest margin for Supreme Court confirmation and more than one hundred and Thirty Years' eve Supreme Court has about forty\nIn cases currently one of the most watched will likely be gamble V.

I think it was a great Senate candidate for Arizona served her her country with incredible honor and distinction and\nAnd Dean Heller in Nevada and Rick Scott in Florida but\nNumbers today are interesting as President Trump's approval rating is now matched his all time high at fifty percent\nAnd more importantly we've got a raspy I suppose that says well the latest survey fifty six percent of likely voters agree with judge Kavanaugh's statement to the Senate Judiciary committee friday of last week that his confirmation hearings had become a quote national disgrace\nAll that it raises questions about what impact this might have on the midterm elections in thirty three days because mid term election polling is getting more definitive\nThe enthusiasm gap is as close to almost two dead even hold and you see Republicans and important Senate races now in a dead heat in all of the states that are red states where we're Democrats where Trump is won by fairly big margins\nI'm like I'm going to do stage further I think when we see that moment when judge Kavanaugh becomes justice Kevin off and we see that first time when he is sitting in the Supreme Court\nI think a large part of the left is just going to collapse and morale they have done everything they could they went all out they lied they meet your it everything you can imagine\nAnd they lost and I think that the morale effect on the left is going to be substantial a Chuck Schumer strategy failed and the fact is that he and the process he may well have crippled his party or a generation a good friend of mine called and said you know there's one team out there trying to build things\nThey're called Republicans and there's one team out there trying to destroy things they're called Democrats\nAnd he said to me I just don't think people are Americans are going to vote for the destroyers\nAnd I thought that was a pretty good way to capture what we've been living through\nI've often said and then we've been friends going back since Nineteen Ninety maybe even a little before that and I've often said you can predict this with certainty every two and four years that identity politics\nYou know as rich versus poor old versus young\nBlack versus white whatever ... nature of politics they could bring up comes up every election year but they have now son to a new low you know I knew this was not going to be a difficult job for the FBI and the case of professor Ford there was no place there was no time there was no location there's no place for the FBI to visit\nIt took to look for anything for ... that might exist\nAnd the only for people that they could really talked to the poor people professor Ford mentioned that she remembered being at this this so called party when the alleged event happened and she identified one person that was supposed to be a I Witness to the assault and the eye witness that that did not happen\nAnd the other people do not remember any such party is this and then the question is do we believe in the presumption of innocence or we just going to jump the gun and say guilt by association Cory Booker said something spectacular yesterday and he goes well there's an of allegations out there I mean you just you got to kind of believe it and they're not qualified based on allegations\nWell look I must be clear Cory Booker sadly somebody who I used to think that a real future as a reformer or it's just sort of decayed I mean I don't know whether it's because he wants to run for president\nOr what did he just kind of decayed into\nAlmost making a mockery of himself me he talks with any of Spartacus moment which is a sign of such stunning historical ignorance that has a history teacher I found it painful um he he makes comments like that I mean here people should know that if allegations destroy you a pin the whole process\nOf the rule of law collapses over totally and it's sad to watch something like that\nYou know I think could have been a positive constructive force and who's now frankly are becoming almost a caricature of himself\nCertainly a lot at stake and then the next\nThirty three days and you know there's other good economic those that have come out today I mean on top of record low unemployment of fourteen states African Americans Hispanic Americans Asian Americans women in the workforce\nA youth unemployment fifty some odd year low a we have consumer confidence all time high for a million new jobs created for a million fewer people on on food stamps or you see what the president's accomplish with NAFTA the new NAFTA the the new trade agreement with Mexico and and with Canada you see that he is\nEliminated burdensome regulation we can now drilling and war and the forty eight states\nUh he is literally singlehandedly save coal mining in America and of course natural gas production will now be at an all time high and we have a Wall Street journal piece today showing more Americans getting pay raises than ever before and that's the forgotten men and women\nMattered in twenty sixteen the question is will they all go out and vote to protect the progress that has been made in the last two years even maybe if they don't particularly like their individual Republican congressmen or maybe think they're weak or maybe don't even know their name is\nWhat he has put your finger on the key question of the selection I've as you know I've been involved in many many campaigns are actually going all the way back to Nineteen sixty and\nOne of the ... one of the lessons I learned was I don't care about the polls show me the precincts I Want to see the first real votes I Want to see who cares enough to show up and vote\nBecause that changes everything is you know we just won a\nA sixty three percent Hispanic district in a special election for the state Senate in Texas\nRight down along the border and this we had a candidate who got lost by twenty points four years ago came back to the special in one um and is the first Hispanic Republican state senator or in Texas and that's because people were energized enough to turn out so I Would say to everybody in our audience\nWho this is going to come down to isn't holding it isn't conversation at the coffee shop who cares enough to get an absentee ballot who cares enough to show up and vote and if our side does show up in both I think\nThis could be one of the most historic elections there you and I've ever covered living together for lots of elections I have a hunch this one could turn into something that we would rush to oil behind\nThe scenes I got to give you a lot of credit because I remember speaking with you you probably forget it the day before you became speaker the houses in Nineteen Ninety four and I remember talking to you that day and the day of the election and\nAnd you are surrounded by a group of people in Joe Gaylord and you actually shared with me the information you had and you said it was absolutely true that for the first time in forty years Republicans would take over the house\nI think you and I were two of the few people willing to go out on a limb and said yeah Donald Trump as a real shot of winning this election and\nAnd people laughed at us at the time and I I Believe that them and and we proved out to be right we also the ... both of us predicted Obama would be an abysmal failure as president based on a very rigid ideology that he seemed to be indoctrinated into\nAnd I I agree with you I think there is an opportunity here to shock the world again\nAnd it the for the people listening to this audience they're going to tune in thirty three nights from now watch election results come in and they're either going to seek kiddy happy liberal newscasters announcing Nancy Pelosi as speaker and\nChuck Schumer is the Senate majority leader and Maxine Waters will be the chairman of this committee or that committee and that the impeachment of Trump will go forward taxes go up open borders will remain\nAn Obamacare stays all this or they're going to shock the world and all these people are going to do what they did in twenty sixteen and be in the shock of their life\nWell that's right and I look I mean I think what what I Would say to everybody who's listening to us everybody cares what's country's future make sure you vote makes sure your friends vote make sure everybody you know who favors\nA solid productive work oriented results oriented system make sure they go out and vote if that happens my I'm not I'm not quite ready yet to predict what am I going to tell you that\nBecause of the intensity\nOf anger about the way the liberal smear Kavanaugh the characterization the dishonesty I Believe we have seen and I've and I've been looking at data for three days I Believe that we've seen a substantial shift\nTowards Republicans [noise] no I think that they were almost certainly now going to keep the Senate and probably going to increase our\nOr the total number

believe it's going to be able to legally go down that road but\nThis is what they do this is who they are in Sean I Want to see is the last couple of days you have done a fabulous job winning out the hypocrisy here\nUm I mean if if we're going to have a serious conversation about breaking in high school and drugs and high school and adult conduct of a domestic violence when you have incumbent\nMembers of the Senate with court records well out there well discuss ah and and and suddenly this is no longer part of the conversation or can't you discussed I mean this is crazy this is crazy I mean I think they've gone down the road here that they are going to regret long term because every\nDemocrat I I don't I don't think so because it's sort of like when Harry Reid lied about Mitt Romney out and pay taxes in ten years and then he was asked after the election if he cared about lying about Mitt Romney's way there is no we won the election\nWhat's the difference and the ... the means for the I think the left so believes conservatives are evil that they feel justified in whatever it is that they say that's right you know but the problem is here this is so serious an allegation\nAnd you know I'm not the biggest fan of the Republican Party I'm not a Republican I've been very critical when they're weak in timid and stupid and I would say they have handled this what the appropriate amount of serious this\nThey have balance what is a fair system they've given every possibility shadow of a doubt\nAnd now it's time to vote now the question is Kelly where Susan

not air link and I think that not because I had any faith and Democrat that'd\nBe ... they have political calculation didn't mind you had Joe Manchin looking at it gate or\nThirty percent margin that people are getting out why the un confirmed by thirty margin that people have North Dakota once the candidate all confirmed it would be political suicide\nOr high can't or mansion or not vote for the nominee don't get people to get their humor lack God that they might get out of their own political South Africa\nWho factory right\nWell I mean yeah I mean high camp and and Manchin but I think I don't think they go that way a less Collins and Murkowski or a combination of of ... and ... or Murkowski inflate once the Republicans have the vote then they'll have the freedom to go\nAnd I don't think the Democratic leadership because of of flying hoot about their\nConstituents in West Virginia Florida North Dakota Indiana\nMissouri because if they did they would say vote your conscience I mean\nJeff Flake the hero of the Democratic party why because he admits season on principle man that would never vote the way he really felt because he's only doing this because he's he's lifted up the burden of having to face the horrible voters they get\nI mean that was a horrible admission on sixty minutes yeah\nYeah and I I mean [laughter] don't\nCome in at real does wrong principle is man that stands on values\nAnd it is a man who wrote a book mimicking Barry Goldwater is a conscious of the conservative ... and ... you know if he is then now we have a moment to stand up\nHe thinks he's going to be president let me just always first to tell Jeff Flake Jeff delusion that\nYou are delusional you will never be the president of the United states not in my lifetime All right I think you both for being with us he couldn't get teen votes I mean he was like at\nNine percent of his own state race it off to the northeast New Hampshire's not interested in Jeff Flake and neither is Iowa\nI mean so out of touch and its own nobody's interested in the guy that says about I'm only voting this way 'cause I don't have to face the voters again oh so every other vote was because you wanted to

a political rally in Kansas Saturday Night President Trump and formed a crowd of the good news\nJust a few hours ago the U.S Senate getting from\nBrett Kavanaugh\nConfirmation as a huge political accomplishment for the president\nThe Senate voted fifty to forty eight to ... for making Kevin over a hundred and fourteen Supreme Court justice in American history will just before boarding air force one to head to the rally Mr Trump gave reporters his reasons for nominating Kavanaugh\nYou know if there are questions that can't be resolved at the event um the orange candy bar association has and ask a lawyer a has a lawyer referral service\nThe orange candy bars lawyer referral and information service is the only Florida bar approved referral service in central Florida um our lawyers that participate in this lawyer referrals service are all insured\nThey have um we have confirmed that they are in good standing with the Florida bar and we've certify that they have the experience in their respective areas of the law\nWe have to do those things in order to maintain our certification and we are the only Florida bar approved for for all service in central Florida so if someone goes to the event\nAnd they can't get their issue resolved at the event\nWe provide a lawyer referral line where they will call they will speak to a referral counselor\nAnd that referral counselor will help them determine which attorney may be able to help them with their issue now when people call the referral council counselor we have two programs we have our regular referrals service\nAnd we have a modest means program so if someone is a modest means and they may not be able to afford legal services but they are not poor enough to qualify for our legal aid\nPrograms that I can tell you about our orange candy bar legal aid society separately it's something that we're very proud of but if they're if they're at the point where they um would qualify for the modest means program we have lawyers who have volunteered\nTo accept cases at a reduced the and the and that's because of our bars commitment to access to justice for members of our community now if they don't qualify for a modest means we have the lawyer referral service\nWhich is a low fee based referral program and\nPeople think the lawyers are are ridiculously expensive [noise]\nThink about what you pay for a cup of coffee or a nice lunch what we charge at their lawyer referral program is a fee of between twenty five to fifty dollars based on the area of law and they and they are then referred to a lawyer who gives them a consultation that's included with the the\nTwenty five to fifty dollars and then there's some there's some areas where we don't even charge a referral fee at the lure for all services for personal injury Social Security workers comp and even criminal issues we just refer him to the lawyer\nAgain this is part of our bars commitment to access to justice and educating the public about the legal system and by the way I Want to ask\nYou since this is the Orange County by association certainly our listeners spanned the center flooded area they can still be part of this and get some guidance it doesn't matter what county somebody than\nIt does not know we can still we can still help them\nNow you mentioned the legal aid society said do you tell us about that [noise]\nSo the Orange County bar association a established its own establish a separate entity called the orange candy bar legal aid society all of our members every single one of our Orange County members\nMust participate in legal services for the poor either they take cases or they pay a fee it is a requirement to my knowledge this pro bono\nRequirement is not required by any other bar in the country are members either donate money to the legal services organization or they donate their time and it's something that we are very proud of\nAs an orange as a local bar association the legal aid society has its own contact information um\nPeople that call the legal aid society are screened based on their income usually the the people who called the legal aid society or a hundred and twenty five percent of the poverty line so these are the poorest of the poor and these are usually um I've done legal services cases um\nFor my entire career it's usually abused abandoned neglected children\nAbused

their best to help them or get them to a place where they can get some help I should also point out that um the arts candy bar staffs a program in a partnership with the clerk of court\nUm called a self help center so when people go to the clerk's office at the courthouse and they can't really figure out what to do on their own we have a self help center that staffed by Orange County mar members um who help people in the courthouse as well it's part of our a commitment to access to justice\nAnd what does that entail maybe not knowing my papers to file or something like that\nYeah what's what typically happens is people go the clerk they start asking the court questions and the clerk says I Can't give you a legal advice but we have and ask a lawyer service right around the corner and they go there and the other thing that are barred does is when there\nAre problems in the community and people can't resolve it the one example is you have neighbors who are fighting over a barking dog we

S.\nDot or what color office and will be happy to have that way as well\nAnd Marty last question for you whenever I have you on the line I always like to find out sort of the state of health care and what you're advocating on behalf of\nWell we're still advocating for Medicaid expansion here in the state of Florida we have the opportunity with the election coming forward for\nThe opportunity for the next administration that comes and thought that the legislature and the governor's mansion to consider this very important um issue to the to flood it continues to rank and the bottom part of the United states in terms of coverage for uninsured\nA Floridian we still have that drastic number that was quote quite frequently of about one in four earring central Florida ... ... ... hope that the out\nAlmost forty three percent of our papers case in population backs the U.S actively calling us also they're fully employed\nAnd that they don't have access or don't fall within the ... the choir and then to receive a subsidy to help offset premium costs through the healthcare dot Gov and certainly that ancient of Medicaid will help to improve that opportunity for more people and children pick up the coverage that they need so that their health is not something that they have to take for granted\nAnd worrying about how they're going to navigate with their fun that they have available in choosing between their health and their\nApartment rent or their cause human or child care for them especially for women in October that may be one of the things that she puts off because he doesn't have money I could get a screening mammogram that could eventually maybe get a diagnosis back I was talking to\nMoney thanks for letting us know about all that money Stallman with shepherds hope [noise]\n\nHave Hannity and you're listening to news Ninety six five WDC radio where Orlando terms for breaking news weather in traffic twenty four hours a day [noise] [noise]\nWhat do you know retiring early in the morning Seventy three degrees back in Ninety with the heat index of Ninety five on Sunday or is it true for some scattered passing showers but the ... century it's thirty percent\nSo no guarantees on the rain in the rain will be body will have a higher ... we go through the work week from journal minor windows news ...

she's chief curator for the Orange County regional history center and we're going to be talking to him about a wonderful news Smithsonian exhibit that you'll have there at the Orange County regional history center\nAnd people can enjoy it this coming Saturday October thirteenth for free [laughter] thank you for joining me in and tell us about this exhibit it's called genome unlocking life's code\nAbsolutely well thank you for having me and so this thing is it it is like you said it's a system and traveling institution exhibit\nWhich means they create this exhibition of using all of their science and their various artifacts and then we're able to travel here so it's like bringing this the Sony into central Florida for for people who might not make it to Washington DC very often and this particular exhibit it's called genome unlocking life's code\nAnd um that's exactly what it's about it's all about a genomes and what that means so a ... for those who don't know what that is a genome is the complete set of genetic or hereditary material other living organism so\nThey exhibit chronicles all the remarkable breakthroughs that have taken place\nIn regards to genomes so for the moments that visitors come to our exhibits a thirty two hundred square foot exhibit so it's pretty large uh they'll find themselves immersed in a cutting edge interactive futuristic environment that communicates that revolutionary nature of general mix the exhibit itself is broken up into for content areas so it talked about the genome within us\nIt talks about your genome in your health so how genomes relate to medicine and health connections natural world and genetics journey as how it can next to a human life on the planet\nAnd what I personally think is the best part any of these traveling types of exhibits that we get in we always augment them with our own local history section so we take the national perspective on a topic and then we localized that because our mission of course is to tell about central Florida history so do you want to know a little bit about what we'll be having in the local section\nYeah absolutely and I think just automatically answers the question I was going to ask which is why this history center but I think you're about to revenge so tell us about those parts\nYou know it's it's kind of fun because the reason I picked this exhibition is because of distance then exhibit it's very science is going to be very futuristic uh when you come in a lot of high tech and\nThat's really cool but the best part for us\nIs how we can relate that to history we're we're a history museum but we've we've we can find history in anything let's\nPut it that way and so for our central Florida section I Believe we're actually the first museum this has been traveling for about five or six years now were the first museum to take it or the ... at first need to take this exhibition and make it about history so in our local section or we're going to be featuring three different things\nThe first thing we're going all the way back in time we're going seven thousand years ago and looking at ancient\nDNA in central Florida so for people who have never heard of it or we're going to be featuring window over bog now window or Bob is right here in central Florida you're used to hearing about you know quote unquote Bob people and places like Ireland or where there's these really old ancient graves\nWell we had one dug up here seven uh it was dug up in the eighties or excavated in the eighties but\nThe individuals inside we're almost seven thousand years old and\nWe'll be showing for the first time some of the burial goods that we're with those grades uh they're very interesting because the the ball created such an anaerobic environment they were able to ... grade and some of them still had brain tissue inside\nAnd so to speak sequence the DNA between those in the bone it was so well preserved I mean we're talking this site is older than the pyramids and it's right here in central Florida nobody thinks central Florida has history a rape but this is a pretty fascinating stuff and so\nThey were able to figure out the hassle of group that these individuals came from and they know that they don't have any modern day to spend it so we'll be talking about some of the older the DNA science going on in central Florida um and have some like I said some of those artifacts on the very first time ever for some of these to be seen we're going to be looking at centrists\nSo people don't necessarily think about it probably but the family tree of citrus actually very much mirrors that uh we as people so we'll be talking about some of the the oldest citrus ah junior logical if you will or Gino a genomic ties here in central Florida and the last section a is really fascinating for some people\nMaybe they've seen those uh like a genealogy show like uh who you think you are are finding your roots uh we did our own local version\nSo we chose five a local people who are pretty well known a mayor dire a former senator Geraldine Thompson a and three others and we did a DNA test with them to see what their genome is all with the hopes of answering the question what is central Florida Jean what makes it central Florida in\nYou know we're a kind of a transient place and we come from all over at different times and for different reasons and so we want it to look into the gym no mix of central Florida or end its people\nSo we did a DNA test with each of those individuals and we've been doing genealogy research and we're going to do big reveals we've kept it a bit of surprise from them so we're going to do reveal just like I'm a genealogy shows and tell them all the really incredible stuff that we have found in their DNA lines\nOkay I Want to talk about each one of those three things and so we'll start in reverse give us on the reveal what's the one thing that you've discovered\nNew this hour three days after his

I Love this this is this is what happens to me are trying to put up the ceiling fan and rented some issues you know I'm trying to repair but it just wasn't quite what I thought you know plus you got going on Neal you're still with us\nI I can you hear me yes or thanks for sending him to appreciate Richard knew everything about\nCalled on time here but little quick and I've been stolen millions chili okay so you're not allowed us\n[noise] but a is a is a\nSense it's a you know had the box is way overloaded I mean I Know it I get it the house was built in Nineteen fifty I mean there's so much jammed in this box that I I also had no idea what I saw in Iran and do a thing I've never seen before was the comments were all run to grounds\nAnd unlike holy child I I was just you know perplexed and went to Google and all that stuff and\nIt was a common thing I guess at one time but\nAnyway but for all you know go to the ceiling fan of was the the I needed to add a tail a to get an a flame to connect the fan of talk to one of the to the league and um it just requires me to to dissect this box and I literally in this box I've got\nTo switches coming into about two hours going out of it I got to see on the life issue that was hanging in there you know and it was a small box but\nIn in dissecting it all and and been cleaning it out really I I I read why are all wires were air table with each other or that kind of angry about that but now I Can't you know than are on\nNo matter what you know I I thought man you're\nTaking a leader and I can I can see that the switches are running and there's there's ... should be exactly like it it should be taught and do these everywhere and everything but the uh the fan will not run is getting power to the fan because I can stick a task to Europe and the lights\nOn it and I can't get a lot I can get the meat or to go off telling me that I've got voltage in there but you school level then it and they won't why it's the craziest thing\nWhere am I doing really is when I call a company to come and look at it they look at it and freak out too and they tell me they have to rewire the whole house\nCool well let's see what richer says you know as you could tell a qualified person didn't do that work but Richard what you got for neo we've got a minute and a half\nBut the first ... first thing you've got you got to what we call a reverse which leg\nThat what you can do inside the box you have a hot when you find that hard you have a neutral that pairs up with it the to reset pulls coming out there just need a hot in the new ... the switch that go into that fan is what we call a reverse which like\nThat's that's where the power comes in on black guys back out on white\nHow 'bout that okay and that that I think now that you said that is one of my problems as I could find that hot wire coming into that what I cannot find this the corresponding neutral\nWell and that's my problem because I've always said there's a whole why is there no why\nWhy how do they just run one wire up here you know I originally wire that I Believe that's what that's what happened\nTo that was very common in the fifties it tries to check it out that reverse which leg if that doesn't work for you please give us a call now you got I got a God this very talented he's not probably a twenty minute drive from yeah\nAll right Richard

a second opinion on your investments really two different ways to do that give us a call the live on the radio aid for for two two zero zero Ninety six five or I can always contact John or myself again I'm Michael Clarke by going to our website website let's talk future dot com\n[noise] All right well let's dive into this email that we got from a listener or during the week uh they emailed us about their inheritance and the subject line says I'll check my assumptions about inheritance about seven hundred thousand ... so that was a listener says\nMy sister and I are inheriting about seven hundred K. total the account a containing the majority of the money was from my parents than it produces a taxable distribution over the course of a year about twelve to Fifteen thousand [noise] we're likely going to leave this place until the end of the year before we decide what we're going to do\nThe way I see it there are two reasonable options you keep the money together as a lump sum and grow it aggressively or split fifty fifty between my sister and I right now and go our separate ways\nAnd then they went into some detail about their personal financial situation they said I have about thirty thousand and student loan debt and a car loan Twenty one thousand total debt is fifty one thousand for me I make a salary of a hundred and twenty thousand per year I have about fifty thousand in my four one K. another Seventeen thousand and savings and four thousand in a brokerage account\nMy sister has a hundred and fifty thousand in student loan debt she has she has about a thousand degrees in print the cells in college degrees are in a car loan of ten thousand total debt as a hundred and sixty thousand for my sister she's currently unemployed but will likely get employment soon making about sixty thousand per year she has no savings\nNeither of us have children or a extended families to take care of we don't own homes and we're both in our mid thirties my argument is that we don't really need to touch the principal for any of our needs right now both of us are extremely employable and I'm not worried about either of our prospects in the near mid term at all\nUh I think we should just or should we should just aggressively invest in the market and lead let it be forgo any distributions and let this puppy compound for ten years and then dumped the money into a safe vehicle and collect our distribution down the road she'll goal would be to grow the principal the three point two million itch as fast as possible\nUh and I was at a weed obviously be joint account owners and would have to check each other on withdraws that would reduce the principal we're both reasonable people and very close and we implicitly trust each other does the plan makes sense\nOkay let's break that down a little bit into a first things first they're thinking of letting the money grow putting it just sort of joined account and leave it as as we've inherited seven hundred grand we're going to leave it as is and put it in a joint account between the two siblings ... what do you think\nMoore so again brother sister inheriting seven hundred thousand from their parents should they just put it in a joy\nAnd invest it that way and the answer is you know that that usually doesn't make a lot of sense\nFor a bunch of different reasons and when I Walk through the region and you'll be like well All right well that makes a lot of sense when when you\nHold things in joint name that means you have ownership in the other person has ownership maybe not just by the definition mhm so if something happens to want to view then that money can be at risk\nSo let's say your sister does get married and then gets divorced\nWell that money could be subject to a divorce\nIf something bad happens and want to get sued well that's an asset that is then at risk if one of you wants to go get a mortgage or a car that asset can then be used as collateral and us it could be at risk of potentially a creditor coming in to get it\nSo there's a whole slew of things that are ... I don't want the incorrect in that method but it it's not the best way\nI'm also if one of you were to pass away so looking way into the future hopefully on the obviously these are two thirty year old but you don't have the same what's called step up and call space as many you don't get the same tax treatment if one of your to pass away\nSo there's a whole bunch of different reasons why when you inherit money\nProbably a brother and sister should not hold it in joint name and this is our future show were written an email from a listener this week basically two brothers and a brother and sister inheriting seven hundred thousand of open phones eight for for two two zero\nZero Ninety six five also go to let's talk future dot com from there there's a whole bunch of resources and also our emails are on there again if you want to jump in like this person did on Michael ... let's talk future dot com and then John and John at let's talk future dot com but holding us enjoy name probably isn't going to be\nThe ... not probably deaf hanging out there right thing to do a you know there's just a whole host of issues that might share mentioned that can come up it's just a bad idea you don't you don't you only have joined account with your spouse there was not joined keep it in your own name there's gonna be no tax implications that money you're going to inherit the money tax free goes right up and costs basis\nUm split the money put it in separate accounts and and um you can of course use each other and lean on each other for advice and guidance I heard a great idea\nBut just not a good reason to have it and the second the second reason you wouldn't have it together is because you might have separate goals and separate ... and in this case\nUm you know getting into the what should we do with a portion or as you alluded to your your separate financial situations\nThere's um a lot of reasons or you know number one\nIs your sister has a lot more debt than you do share so she's going to need to pay down that debt aggressively or sixty thousand dollar a annual salary with a hundred and fifty thousand dollar in student loan debt is a lot of risk that's a lot of risk to carry that much debt\nI'm so there's ... there's many reasons but I Would I Would encourage her to pay the debt off and then take some cash and put that in an emergency fund so of the three hundred and fifty she's going to get she's going to end up with about um you know somewhere around a hundred and fifty thousand a hundred and Seventy five thousand dollars invest the money to show to pay the debt off\nAnd then she needs to put some money in an emergency fund\nThe risk of carrying you know a thousand two thousand dollars a month in a student loan payment on a hundred and fifty thousand is that okay I'm going to leave this money aggressively invested well if something happens like a two thousand eight well that investments the principal is going to be reduced because you ... your ... uh about a aggressively invest in\nYour your could lose your job for a short period of time right so now happens your income goes way down well now I have this monthly a student loan payments I have to make you can't go bankrupt on student loans right for you know you can you can do for it but that just compounds compounds\nUm I have this monthly amount of have to make in a payment well I'm going to have to withdraw from my investment at the worst possible time to meet my obligations every month\nSo her risk of carrying that debt is much much higher than yours you're you're you know a hundred and twenty thousand dollar income making thirty thousand or thirty thousand in student loan your risk is not as high as hers is so so your goals are very different\nNow we'll talk about if you should pay all the student loans or not when we get back from the break in here to any of the conversation about this a couple inheriting money\nYeah there is still a lot to talk about when it comes to your

he says you don't you don't want to have so much money going towards your mortgage every month that you can't enjoy life or take care of your other financial responsibility\nGreat quote from Dave Ramsey they're here on the let's talk future show a ... you know we we talk a lot about having a paid off mortgage in retirement I think that's very important in one of the main reasons is because it takes so much pressure off how much money you have to\nTo provide that monthly income when we go to retire we're living off of our own money right off Social Security and uh uh withdraw from our investments\nWell if we have a thousand dollar Fifteen hundred two thousand dollar mortgage every month that's even more money we needed our nest egg to provide that that's even more money coming out of our Social Security but doesn't go towards our lifestyle it goes towards our mortgage a and the same is true when you're working right before you're going to retire so I buy a\nYou know big house that's a big stretch in the mortgage is you know may be right on the edge of what I can afford that so much more money and so much more pressure coming in and that has to go out every single month to meet that obligation\nYeah and I know people from uh hear that all the time but one thing from John nice view when we designed income in retirement is that Social Security component and just say for ease you're going to get a thousand dollars from Social Security and your mortgage payment is a thousand dollars well that mortgage payment\nTo your point John is sucking up the entire Social Security amount right so that makes our job of planning income in retirement that much harder\nSo again if we can have that paid off home you add so much flexibility to their retirement income plan if\nThe mortgages paid off and you're not having to like you said your Social Security use the dividends use your grows right to pay off Andy lips so it it makes a big difference\nYeah exactly well let's go to the phones here ah this is let's talk to your show you can jump in at a for for two two zero zero nine six five let's go to Katie calling from Orlando a Katie you're on the livestock future show how can we help\nLearning learning I have I have a blend no on ... on and I I Am the knowledge that I like but I Know and they're not accountable eyes and and like you get in our\nLife and and that that money and then\nIt can be a great question so um you have a new grandson congratulations yeah very exciting or you know when a newborns it's a great time to start thinking about their future or because you have a good length of time for that money to grow so\nUh you're you're right on track right now is the time to start thinking about that for a newborn so five thousand dollars\nThat's a wonderful generous gift um\nUh you know so to so that's really going to help your grandson as a as they age now there's a couple of ways you can say for kids some of them are good and some of them I think are bad one of the ones that I think are bad or is a huge eater mayor UT them a uniform trust to minors account\nThat's an investment account you put money in\nThe uh they are the benefits to beneficiary essentially\nBut when they turn Eighteen or Twenty one depending on the state and the account the money's automatically there's there's nothing you can do about it they can catch that checking it becomes there's all Eighteen years from now five thousand dollars\nThat money could double it could double again that could be twenty thirty thousand depending on how it does yeah um I Would not handed Eighteen year old thirty thousand dollars with no restrictions on it right um I think that's a bad idea we see", "year": "2018", "show_name": "Brian Kilmeade & Friends", "city":
