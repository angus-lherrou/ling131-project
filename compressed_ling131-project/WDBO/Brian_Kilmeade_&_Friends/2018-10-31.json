we did on television Andrew Jackson\nHero under fire I got the idea almost at that moment when he was describing his interaction with Reagan and what he noticed as a historian then he's one of the best and most conversational\nDoug was talking about how Ronald Reagan was told it was so important of Jackson was very important to him even though he was a Republican and Jackson the first Democrat he wanted to take a picture with him for a major magazine standing in front of a statue or with ... horse in front of the White House and that gave me an idea I\nSaid what other presidents think of Andrew Jackson because Andrew Jackson now is under fire this group to New Orleans want to take him down there is a there is a former president they wanted to take them off to twenty you saw that his tomb was deep filed for the first time since his death part of the civil war\nJoining us now is Doug we New York times best selling author an advisor to American presidents Doug welcome back\n... thank you great to be with you Brian\nSo Doug I saw your idea when you started telling me about all these presidents what they thought of them I said what a great way to diffuse all the emphasis on how we like President Trump and talk about past great presidents on both sides of the aisle and one of which you know well Reagan Reagan seeing your accent totally different styles right\nTotally different style a different approach but uh he he liked\nTo Jack and a willingness to take on the tablets and if you'll remember the days of Ronald Reagan many of your listeners and viewers wall\nBut when Ronald Reagan would give a speech to the nation it was\nCreated by commentary both ... foreign after the news media would come on and they say now the president's gonna speak here's what he's going to\nWatch for this watch for that don't be misled by that and then after he was finished speaking they don't come on and rip apart what you said there was no Twitter there was no you're too there was no direct\nA line for the American people and Ronald Reagan had just hope and\nPray that they figure it out but he identified with Andrew Jackson\nWho would fly quite heavily credit\nBy by the media so much so as you know that his wife died ... right after the campaign that he just a lift her in the newspapers a day after day\nAnd said something about our first marriage and she ended up but basically it looks like a heart attack and she would never make it to the White House but he surround himself with his family like President Trump but didn't break and also look for a picture to be taken for a magazine in front of Jackson statue\nActually it was a cover of a book uh I was invited to Nineteen Seventy nine of the week that a Ronald Reagan announced for the presidency to his home in Pacific palisades and I met he advanced the and Michael Deaver was there and they wanted me to write a campaign book\nAnd so I did it was finished and time for the Republican National convention when it was finally published\nBut the cover of the book Reagan was a picture of himself in a lot of that Andrew Jackson statue in Lafayette Park in front of the White House so that was the picture that went on the cover of the book\nHere is Donald Trump comparing himself to Reagan and Jackson\nI remember primaries prior to the election they were saying well this is this is something much there's been nothing like this is Ronald Reagan\nAnd then after that they said we have to go\nBack further than Ronald Reagan\nSo they talked about Andrew Jackson\nLet's say the thirties that's a long time [noise] and then they said around election\nSupersede David Andrew Jackson\nA Doug with us now to comment on that and you know Steve Bannon tells him a lot of this stuff he also use a lot of people come in it's not unusual for a president to me with this story and tried to out their term and he gets on a he wants to put in perspective what he's going through\nYeah that's right and actually I was the first\nTo write about that comparison between Donald Trump and Andrew Jackson talk about the New York times picked it up after I did so and after that happened of course manner than many others talked about it but both men are were outsiders adult men were considered too politically experience to be effective president\nBoth men were populist standing up for the forgotten man both of them were wealthy while publicly taking on the establishment of money interest standard Jackson opposing the second national bank for example both men had short tempers some were\nUnpredictable Jackson carry bullets in his body from personal do both men ran against family dynasty Jackson took on the John Quincy Adams whose father than President Trump took on Hillary Clinton whose husband\nHas been president I could just go on and on it both mental ward against their own political parties are both men after winning the elections retaliated by appointing

off\n[noise] I think\nYou know the fact that at one of the things that have really launched his presidential run on is talking about Islamic rattle radicalization and this president has radicalized so many more people than I ever did several add up like ten hours I think the president has far more supporters too as an equal hateful ideology\nCan you believe that this is actually I hop she's at GQ correspondent and everyone knows they they have the best she says that the president has radicalized more people than ISIS\nRarely tens of thousands of those people that had people that's how they burst onto the scene where Brock Obama just pulled out of Iraq and left the terror group to take over almost the entire country outside Baghdad and then they radicalize the tens of thousands and we're still trying to finish them off\nAnd the president is radicalized more people than that I mean that's where the president is beside himself and he has to fight back because he can't believe that people are actually saying this stuff about him for me I Would shut it down with other people do you're fighting but she went out and apologize right after and said you know maybe I overstepped it I got a little emotional\nYou think so Bob Woodward trying to sell some more books although he's selling a ton cut twenty two\nWhen he blames the media when he goes up in in the Israelis I mean they are all designed to\nRaise the boiling point raised the temperature we have to look at what he does and what he's doing here\nOr if it's in plain sight and let's not kid ourselves and that he's stoking the fires and that serves his political purposes or in his view he wants to have a this volatility and politics and\nHe succeeded he wants to change things his way and when he can't get it through Congress he's put it out there making people debate it\nBy the way here's the apology from Julie I hopped for saying the president radicalized more people than ISIS I think this has been an emotional and personally painful time for me I think I exaggerate it and I apologize for that\nI clarified in apologized on the air she went on to say but I said here again this has been a very emotional and paypal time for me by I was absolutely should not have gone with such hyperbole on the air I Apologize\nFine apologize but that's the reaction is over the top on this president in example the president says I watch meet the press on Sunday I couldn't believe it here's an example of this the first one is going to be Chuck Todd [noise]\nThe one the other one is going to be a Matthew Dowd a former Republican under Bush and George Stephanopoulos cuts way\nHave a problem and we have a president who doesn't seem to believe he has a role to play and dealing with it\nI Would put specific responsibility on the president I think what he's done 'em over the course of the last few years has helped form at the\nCenter and unapologetically incendiary president on travelling by traditional norms of civility\nYeah uh that's why he sat down and did an interview on Fox yesterday and said I Can't believe these headlines I Can't believe I'm being covered that's why I came out and said what I was thinking that was the president's thinking is I actually blame the media for vilify me and getting some of my supporters exercised about it\nBut don't want anyone kid you this government at the synagogue hated Trump hated the fact that he's tight with Israel hated that he move the embassy hated the fact that he has a daughter that converted in his son in law playing a major role that they converted his daughter and they have three Jewish grandkids\nBut the people's view of the president it's always about the president now the president's been accused of making everything about him but you know what the media makes everything about him an example cut twenty six Chuck Todd we have a problem\nAnd we have a president who doesn't seem to believe he has a role to play and dealing with it and I think that is what is making this\nMore of a uncomfortable situation in our politics I don't think it gets better I think it gets worse uh guys at the end of the day the president said the town\nListen I hate to say it uh but you had the horrible shooting in Parkland does anyone in the prison for that but we talked about guns\nAnd the synagogue shooting is senseless eleven daddy was corn age people say that they wouldn't have said it was worse than they've ever seen\nCops come in they're heroes they're not really debating guns they're debating the competency the president cynically think there's a reason for that because the elections coming up and they know the gun issue is not going to be a great one for Democrats but the president's competence always is\n... you see I see problems on both sides cut twenty seven\nOne on Trump's failings isn't he thinks everything is about him\nAnd one of his critics failings is there are ... that they do too and this weekend's reaction to the hideous atrocities from last week\nA particularly the one in Pittsburgh illustrate that perfectly people were were finding a way to blame him\nAnd look I I look I think he could

[noise]\nNews maybe six point five ... family\nHis news Ninety six point your baby on land turns first for breaking news\nFrom ABC News\nI'm Gary all our investigators are trying to learn more about the man accused of murdering eleven people in the Pittsburgh\nNumber one you don't need that number two now can you imagine well you can definitely do it with an act of Congress but now they're saying I can do just with an executive order why\nIs that well it's about language remember we live in a world were words do matter and for all the craziness it gets thrown around the world of politics these kind of legal ease words now they're interpreted really really matter\nCan at a very small minority of others are reading into that language in the constitution where it talks\nAbout all persons born or naturalized in the United states and subject to the jurisdiction are there are a few folks not write anything that language subject to the jurisdiction there is a limitation that mean children are undocumented immigrants are not subject to the jurisdiction of the United states and therefore are not birthright citizen\nSo and the constitution has been this the fourteenth amendment is debated and they and and it's been rewarded uh because of the fact that at one time it you know if you didn't have a country but if you were country lives way back in the day I have no you know legions and then they wanted you to pledge allegiance to the United states\nAnd and then there is this the subject jurisdiction meaning\nLike a lot of other countries and there are a lot of other\nCountries Trump goes at her and says you know they were the only ones but there are other countries out there and that's subjective jurisdiction is the thing that is vitally important\nWhere the only country in the world now where a person comes in hasn't baby the baby is essentially a citizen of the United states for eighty five years with all of those benefits to kill us it's ridiculous and it has to end\nAll right well that's not true there are other nations like thirty three other nations that that allow this candidate being at Canada and the United states are the two biggies that allow this Germany doesn't allow this\nRight the u._k. doesn't allow this Australia doesn't allow this other large nations don't allow this to happen what they allow you to do is either a your mother and father have to be a citizen\nOf that nation or they have to be residents of that nation for a certain period of time before they will allow you if you're born there to become a citizen and it varies from from from country to country\nWe on the other hand are just like hey come on over and it's not just south of the board and that's the optics because you've got what's going on with as Trump calls it the invasion and and the invaders which is not true which is ridiculous but\nYou got this happening and then this comes out so the battle will begin and the fight is on over something like this and the truth is\nI look at this and say I see where he wants to go with this right I think if you come here illegally\nAnd you have a child I question very much a question\nFor people who are poor and coming from places like\n... or Salvador Honduras Mexico or any of these other countries fleeing and they're coming and they have a child there there there is an ulterior motive there\nThat is different than people who were were birth tourism for the Chinese the Russians are many other countries when a lot of money and they come over here and this happens a lot more than people think and they have their children here because the passport itself means a lot of things\nIt's a status symbol but it means a lot of other things\nIn other countries\nAnd that's where I I I drives me crazy on both sides of what I understand\nRight one I understand one I Do\nI get your desperate you're coming here you want your child to have a better life and opportunity and America is going to give you that\nBetter life better opportunity\nHow long can be solved by the fact that you know our immigration system is broken it's sometimes I think what Trump does and right or wrong is something where he's like you know what you guys aren't dealing with this kind of like what what you know ... with DACA\nAnd President Obama the frustration is you're not dealing with this so if you're not going to deal with this I'm going to do something about it which in theory may force your hand to do something about it which we all know won't happen because none of them will ever do anything because the reality is they just don't do anything\nWhole thing is let's let the court sorted out that way nobody can be mad at us and people can play in the constitution of the judges or whatever they can be mad at us it's a broken system\nI look at this I understand what they're gonna try to do\nOr at least he's trying to do and how they're looking at this subject of jurisdiction and what their argument is going to be as you've come here let's say you are right let's say you've come here from Argentina\nOr you've come here from New Zealand or Mexico you bought a house here you've started a business here you've been here for a year and you're a resident and you're paying taxes\nAnd you're you're here legally\nAnd you have a child that child should be us is if you come here because you're Chinese and\nYou have a bunch of money and you're able to obtain yourself a passport\nBirth passport because what that does is the ... the ... the thing about the anchor baby is what's the baby's here essentially that maybe that child to be able to sponsor a ton of people coming here and that's where this thing goes and that's part of the problem what do we have this problem if we said find the child is a U.S citizen\nWas one caviar can't sponsor anybody else to be here\nDoes that change things\nOh that that might change things so there's a lot of ways that you can look at doing this I look at it like if you've done it the right way I have no problem with it and I think most people don't have a problem with\nJust coming here for the sake of come here to have a child whether it's because you have a lot of money and the opportunity for you to potentially I think that if you're Chinese like part of this is the what ifs scenario\nWhat if China goes south again and we have a you know a ... square and a rise in all of the the crackdown and the fear factor and you've got the passport the opportunity to bring your family oh that's part of it\nIt's a status symbol also shows you the wealth that same thing with Russia and several other places in Eastern Europe or there's an opportunity for people to do these kinds of things and it's more is as much as status symbols anything else there's a lot of ways to go with this\nBut it's it's it's just another fight when it comes to immigration and as much as people get past that Trump the facts are he's taking on immigration nobody else has Obama had everything he wanted he pushed through Obamacare\nKind of half assed it with Dr could have done more didn't I've heard many people who were ... were mad why didn't you at the time\nSometimes I think you've got to force their hands to do anything and they love the fact that it's they know what's going to end up at the Supreme Court so they don't really have to do anything so we'll see how this goes three two

if you're here illegally you shouldn't be allowed you if you're here legally and you have a child after a specific amount of time let's say it's a year\nRight let's say it's a year and then you get
