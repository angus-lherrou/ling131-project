works with Amazon elect cynical assistant that also apples ... there's also the smart put gardens by many don't worry about writing this down we have some more information over a commander dot com but then you're going to need to think I'm all up and then you're going to need to add some spooky sounds and so that's where he labs\nIt has Halloween living scenes and chew Halloween which is an abba Hugh haunted house those are some uh lighting and music apps are there are ways that you can still step up to a game and get that house ready for Halloween with all those lights and sounds and back to the phones we go with Charlie and a great bend Kansas Charlie\nKill great to talk to you what's thanks so much for your call today so it's going on\nI mean we've got a um a small theater group so we put on three plays a year and a and an old movie theatre here in great and oh how cool is that it's what I'm told all it does have a good ... on the phone call\nUh we get our keys to the church to call the tractors to\nAll these people and we get a lot of people so we got the keys floating\nAll [laughter] that's going all over the county everybody's got to get out [laughter]\nEverybody's got a dead young key to this place when we were having a hard time control it so our idea is to one of the doors we would like to put like a digital type law\nSure that we can program with coats and you give them is the truth a lot to be able to set the stage automatically slower or twenty four dollars or wheat or six weeks where that would have this need for that and the second trip to this\nLong or my little due to a program like the on site but it was ... grand that\nAll such such nobody stopped at all the time\nRight [noise] well ... you know the good news is is that the technology exists\nThe even better news Charlie is that it's super simple to use okay and so when you buy the smart lock is that a couple of ways you can do it uh I actually have on a a v R B o house that I Am\nIs that I Am I have a ... legs smart block okay\n[noise] and so when somebody books through ... I can go and I can put their name in and I can say this law is going to work on this Saturday from eleven AM to next Wednesday at Fort Pierre\nOkay and you put the person's name and their and then what's also interesting is that you have a full log of when they when they come and go or eggs actually when they come into the building so you'll know exactly who's coming in at what time okay [noise] um and you can program this remotely program this right on the Internet\nOr you could do it within an app I have found that the easiest way is to use the leg lock if not the best of luck it's an inexpensive lock if you're looking for them all the best of luck with more bells and whistles there's something called the August pro Gen and the August ... is the best but\nWhen you start looking at locks that they have different systems so you ... you can't just buy the lock and it goes on the Internet\nIs that you buy the log and then it connects to a hub okay so you have like a smart things hub or you have what what I have is the next year up okay\nAnd then within the next the a hug with is where things have you'll find that there are other things that you can do so like if you wanted certain lights to come on in the middle you know say from eleven PM to six am when nobody's there so at least illuminates maybe it's less likely for somebody to break in\nIs that you can program the lights for that if you had certain cameras you could do that as well if you were worried about a water damage when nobody's actually there and it's snowing and the pipes are freezing you know what I'm saying\nIs that there are water detection sensors you could also put in there that you can get alerts so one sure once you get the hub Charlie's what I'm saying is that once you get the hobby started thinking about OK what more can I add to that right\nIt is so good ...\nYou know so if there are there any other things that we can for a couple of hundred bucks because that's all you're talking about\nRight that they are that's awesome audio\nThis is six point five maybe\n\nLive in if you're not getting all three hours the came commando show and joined Kim stuff that's right head over to get

walking exercising driving because after all knowledge is power\nA time in Scottsdale, Arizona a low there Tom\nBlow their Kemp what's going on well\nI have a question I I Am just give it a little set up here I'm a dentist\nAnd ah have ah a website that I have one son mind right now what I'm trying to put together but another part of my practice and I've been toying with the idea of putting a chat a function I'm not sure what you call it a in the website to where people could ask questions before they came in\nAnd the question I Would have for you is it is a beneficial or that you all you would do is it are easy to do and of course what kind of back up to I Need to have as far as the employment of people to support that are the questions or what have you\nAlways all yeah all really good questions by the way Tom I'm you know we read deployed shop dot commando dot com\nAnd uh you know we put a chat function in the shopping website oh my gosh it's amazing you know uh how how many people have basic question than him by you having a human being there it really will help with your return on your investment\nAre you thinking that you're going to get overwhelmed by these questions\nWell obviously I have to have someone to play so I just recently was approached by a company that said they would do is they would have a\nThey employ individuals to support the ah the ... function and how that would work because they would give me thirty quit or I Would give them thirty questions ... ... a prospective clients would ask them than those three questions so I Would give them the interest as well so\nAs I as a person would call him they would get a hold of this company and they would have if they asked a question though she they had the the canned answer that I've already given\nBut of course I'd almost June 'cause she goes for those dirty question yeah\nAnd I got here's the reason why I'm hesitating fact is that I think if you were dealing with a product okay and I'm not saying that you're dentistry is not a product\nBut you're also providing a very personalized service right and I don't know if that would work with a personalized service such as yours doctor I'm like we we looked into that for the shop to but part of us\nIn our businesses that I Want people to know that you know we're with them right we're not a bunch of robots that they can depend upon us they can trust us and to a large extent is that I have to trust you with my family members and friends and also with myself for my oral history and my real hygiene right\nSo so I Would be hesitant to doing that I Would put a check up on the west\nBut see what kind of volume that you get and you you are able to turn it off you can say that it's only available from eight to five so maybe there's a gallery guy in the office that you could say you know what you're going to get it a couple of hours a day you're going to get a couple of hours a day a couple of hours a day and you may find that you are truly in fact uh getting\nThe same question time and time again\nOf which then you know that you need to put maybe a different button on the website make something more prominent or maybe there could be part of those thirty questions later on\nBut I think you'll find that the volume isn't going to be that high and the people that will that you'll engage will be people that you can convert to a a paying client\nBecause they are going to feel that human touch now when you start looking at different chat depending upon where you get your website it may already be built in as a function may cost you a couple of hundred or maybe a couple of bucks a month for that\nIf you're building your side from scratch they have names like Ben desk chat is free uh there's also a live chat and there's also live agent um are you building the site or somebody building it for you\nAh yes although the we do have a website it's already been built and we have another company building or another website ... originally but but when we have a turkey tempting as calling me about that in this chat function\nAnd I don't I wouldn't I wouldn't add I wouldn't let the third party do it yet I Would if I Would I Would just I Would encourage you just to test the waters the kind of questions you get\nAnd then you can also listen to those questions under FA cues as part of the website but if you have a person behind this instead of an automated robot and I know that there's a lot of AI that's happening in chats and bought things like that\nOr is that you're able to say you know ... now that I've helped you can we make an appointment right now the doctors able to see you next Tuesday so then we can immediately convert that inquiry into a paying customer thank you so much for your call come back we're going to talk about browsing without all the bad stuff here on the came commando show [noise]\nNow I don't know about you but someone has been telling me how to brush my teeth all my life parents

me of the New York times on CNN sixteen days and counting to the most consequential in terms of our times why the GOP seemed to have secured the Senate while the president's approval rating hits it all time high but getting his numbers saved a house for his party or the or the Dems certainly being control plus civility\nWe're has it gone how do we get it back\nMichael Goodwin thanks for joining us much larger Brent premise the latest comments causing quite an uproar\nOf it gives you think you'll because it's going to run again I Want to get to that but I'm gonna ask you a bigger picture question because you are somebody who has to analyze not the knee jerk react to necessarily report\nHow do we bring stability back when I'm watching Mitch McConnell and you know in a ... in his genes in wearing a vast hanging out in a diner\nAnd they're getting his there's somebody slamming their fists in his counter and steel with his doggy bag and checking out the door and screaming at him this is about the fourth time they did this to the Republican Senate leader and it's not a unique circumstances is it possible to bring stability back\nI think it is Brian but it's going to take time but I think it's also going to take a a lot of people to stand up and say no and I think the most uncivil thing we've seen in our country was the treatment of Brett Kavanaugh during the confirmation hearings which is why I thought it was so important or none of that Mitch McConnell rallied Republican Lindsey Graham\nA Chuck Grassley ... and the president of course and Kevin himself just say no we're not giving in to this we're not going to\nWe're not going to behave the same way we're not going to stand up and scream and through and through and throw things that people but we're going to stand our ground and I think that's what they did and I think that's what a lot of people simply have to do is just say no we're not going to scream back at you weren't going to throw things were not\nAnd engage in violence but we're going to say no to you and we're going to do the right thing and be have the right way and that's going to prevail\nMaybe uh I I don't love the fact that she was she was screamed at either a I don't think that's right I mean bottom line is\nAh she's a Seventy seven year old woman who has accomplished a lot in her life I Would agree with the way she approaches things I also think she's being selfish in maintaining leadership and not turn it over to another generation but she deserves to be treated with respect I thought that I used to be a fear of treating someone disrespect sleep because of the backlash\nMy hope is that both sides stop with the name calling at the top as they run it very intense elections and start saying you know treat people the people who are we in a civil way at the top maybe it'll filter down to the grassroots well look\nThat's what we can hope I mean I I Am share your concern that we could reach a tipping point in this country where we do sort of get into more and more violence and then it becomes tit for tat escalates I've written that uh that's how World War one started nobody wanted World War one none of the great powers but they all thought the other guy would blink first\nUm and of course nobody blinked and I think that's what we have to worry about in this country that's why I think that you know people should understand there are now two opposing forces or the ... the the right can be as violent does have left it hasn't\nBeen in in the ... current atmosphere but it could become that and and so then we really would have more and more violence that's why I think the answer is for good people\nNot to give and not to be cowed by this but but does the same token not to engage in\nTears cut eight this is what I was talking about Mitch McConnell [noise]\n[noise] so what happened is the people in that diner stood up to the guy who was acting in a butcher in fashion image what kind of later stuck around later he thanked every one for standing up to him\nYou know and that's exactly what what has to happen I mean good people have to prevail but you don't sit there by me and just be quiet that doesn't work in this environment you have to stand for something you know an old friend of mine a set a wonderful line years ago which I used in the second century which is\nYou have to join the side you're on so if you feel Mitch McConnell in that instance is being treated badly you have to stand up and say so you can't just sit there and quietly root for the good guy you have to join I mean that's what that's what America is about we have politics there's no shame and engaging in politics there's no shame in standing up for what you believe in\nRight here is a Chris Christie after we saw this on Sundays this week with George Stephanopoulos got none\nI can certainly read any book\nOutside an act of violence and an acting without it so I don't care what side of the Florida from when you do that it's wrong to make public officials have become passages either oh you don't want to go out they're not going to see them you're not going to be able to get any feel fourth or like what the court t._v. commercials and\nI also think the Trump officials for the only place they really feel secure is at Trump Trump Hotel yeah and that's where they will be as a and that's almost like an enclave I respite a safe base yeah look at it that the capital of the country\n... well we don't want public service to become its own punishment\nI mean this is after all fundamentally American construct of citizens who come into the government and then go out it's it's not it's not a career as a ... we're not you know it's become that for too many people but fundamentally it is about public service for a brief time in your life\nAnd so I think we ought to him on some level treat these people with a certain level of respect we don't have to agree with him we don't have to approve of them but we cannot get into the gutter I think that way ... madness\nSo there's something playing at as usual there's three compelling storylines you got to Saudi Arabia controversy in the killing of American resident with three American Kid will touch on that\nBut we're watching this caravan come up again Steve from Guatemala excuse me from Honduras bust through the gates to Guatemala get to Mexico they said they stop and they had been unable to their walking up the street skating powered demanding entry to our country what\nIs happening demanding entry into another country is it to say how to air we allow a I have a system of immigration\nLook I I mean they're coming from countries that are broken I saw something recently in the wall Street Journal Ninety five percent of the murders go unsolved in those countries I mean that's police corruption as well as just violence\nA so look there's countries are broken people are running for their lives by the same token we have a right to protect our own borders to lead in those whom we deemed to be good for our country we are not we cannot be the last stop on every train for every person in the world who wants to come here uh if if if we cannot secure our borders\nThen I think we've really fall and then so far we have fall and we have we have dropped the ball on this issue this is a big test for President Trump is they\nGet to the border under laws passed in two thousand nine led by Senator Dianne Feinstein and they get to the border they say the right words we have to let him in and give them time in front of a judge\nBut we also have this flurries rule that says they cannot wait in detention more than twenty days okay so I guess what happens to get ankle bracelets did they do they cut them off get out what happens they stay forever Sean ... and now Mexicans evidently only two percent illegal immigrants or Mexicans\nThey are central South America because the laws they know better than we know when\nThey all we've been through taking advantage of it that to me is so easily corrected and should be able to bring both sides together why Democrats see the problem\nWell because as as someone called them these are undocumented Democrats are these are these are people in the Democratic party looks too for the next generation of voters so\nThey apparently are not concerned about the border I mean we we don't talk about it anymore but certainly terrorism is the biggest concern and then you have the drug flow you how do you have the gangs I mean there are all kinds of reasons why we don't want wards of the state or problems coming across that vetting is about\nMichael seven million unfilled jobs these ... these farmers absolutely need the guest worker program to be enacted full steam ahead if we could just get a system that allows people here who want to work on a better way of life to come in the people that I have come across in my life that I've worked in a landscaping trucks and have come from other countries\nThey worked a day or the or the energy of ten people they asked very little in demand they work extremely hard not saying that there are a bunch of terrorists coming across right but the system has to work and I think Newt Gingrich put it best last night on when I saw it last night but it was on Fox News Sunday cut for\nDon't think are human rights or she has won four or five thousand people decide to attack the United states\nAnd that's what they're doing but mom came down the street and occupy your home of the nicer home than they do you wouldn't say oh gosh I really feel sorry for you and me pretty angry that they were occupying at what point do we draw a number on when you draw the number I don't care how big it is I suppose you can say ... twelve million science that she's going to control the border\nNo she's not right that there there's no end to it I think that's the problem is is this is a failure that goes back decades and it's one of the reasons President Trump was elected\nFor stopping Michael can't stop that you just can't\nFor this is a big test I think this is a very big test of course part of the answer is is the Mexican government the Honduran government and the Guatemalan government most most of which are not function but the Mexican government is functioning and stuff like that they feel are coming through Mexico every one of them and that's how they get here\nSo if the Mexican government they have a new government in Mexico if it's going to uphold its relations with the United states this is a big test for that government as well\nA huge with the president just treated every time you see a caravan of people coming are attempting to come in into our country illegally think of and blame the Democrats for not giving us the votes to change your pathetic immigration laws\nI remember the midterms so unfair to those who came here legally when Michael ...
