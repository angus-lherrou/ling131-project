O. J. what's up Joe how are you glad you called sir\nJohn near the number one supporter of Donald Trump in the country I think he's the best president world history he needs to send troops down to stop this invasion and I think you would agree with that we just can't afford to take all these people and we we have a Twenty one trillion dollar debt and so I Hope that he will send troops down to stop this invasion of our country\nNice of Mexico did their job and Mexico would stop them in their country and you know now they're just trying to precipitate a crisis that could be a really disastrous for everybody involved in this\nAnd yet you keep breeding reports that you know people are being take well taken care of well bad food and water you know the goal is to get them up to a southern border but you know what's after the seven thousand is he going to be ten thousand more is going to be a hundred thousand more what do we know about anybody that is in this caravan\nYou know everybody come here because ... ...\nI think between and I've been saying this and I believe it I think between the horrible treatment of Kavanaugh the elimination of\nDue process and the presumption of innocence meanwhile they're silent on Keith Ellison and they're silent on Cory Booker and there's Tylenol Claire McCaskill's a husband between all of that hypocrisy and between the caravan and the mob is that we're out all all over the place this weekend\nAnd the success and failure Obama's failure Trump's success I think that there's a lot to get people to get out and vote\nWe'll see what happens in Fifteen days though Joe thank you eight hundred nine four one showing our number Brian is in Lexington, Kentucky Brian how are you and we're glad you called sir\nYes sir I was calling about the migration rush on our border and\nI Want to know your thoughts about who might be behind the scenes organizing there's basically committing trees and then it got down to the Trump could find out for the FBI and you know maybe you need to look into that and find out exactly who's you know has to have this big plan now that we know what's going on\nWhat what is it we know what's going on we know that you know at the end of the day we'll find out where the money comes from that supporting some of those uh I understand you know America can't continue to support and prop up as the president has been saying\nAll of these countries that were given a lot of aid to and they're going to let people leave their country and come racing towards our border I'm all for immigration but it's got to be done orderly it's got to be done legally\nAnd you can have what you know you can have seven thousand people just drop on our door and say take us into were horrible people uh especially one that the only place they can seek asylum is the first country they get to that would be Mexico in Mexico obviously didn't have the will or desire to do anything in this case\nAnyway appreciate the call eight

accused of shooting the debt and injuring six others at a synagogue in Pittsburgh this morning FBI's Bob Jones is they believe the alleged shooter acted alone\nThis is the most horrific crime scene I've seen in twenty two years the Federal Bureau of investigation members of the tree of life synagogue\nConducting a peaceful service\nAre brutally murdered by a gunman targeting them simply because of their ABCs Eric ...\nOnline this suspect Robert Bowers appears to have posted anti Semitic anti refugee and at times anti Trump screech one post said Jews are the children of Satan and a post written just before\nBut then they're talking about the guy smashed literally ripped\nHis leftovers I guess maybe it's taken a meal home to somebody else\nAnd throws it outside the restaurant door banging on the guy's table somebody's going to get killed here you watch somebody is or hurts severely it it's going to happen then nobody on the left at burger\nKing critique their own side for the rhetoric they're using Anthony Scaramucci is with us I just finished cover to cover his bat brand new book uh and it's a nominal and it's the Inside Story about Donald Trump it's called Trump the blue collar president\nAnd held billionaire living on Fifth Avenue identified the struggle of blue collar Americans had won the presidency and all those are the forgotten men and the forgotten women in this country and I don't think they're liking this mob mentality I don't think they like the way judge Kavanaugh was treated much\nAnd I don't think they like watching this caravan of thousands marching towards our border\nI mean they they literally are mishandling everything and so ... what's what's happening is uh the the president has almost like this light showing like you know you and I were out on Long Island in the summer or parents would hang up that infect light\nWell the president has that the Trump Twitter insect light and they're all going towards the late into vaporizing Senator Warren she's got to get\nThe DNA test she's less of a Native American and your mate into the vapors Asian big caravan issue the way they're handling the care of an issue it's a galvanizing his\nBase that Kavanaugh's thing was absolutely ridiculous they were making up one story after the next they figured okay me too movement seems to work there is no due process and the meat you meant\nLet's take this guy that's a very well credentialed judge or he's got an impeccable adult life let's try to destroy him\nGoing back to Nineteen eighty one in Nineteen eighty two and so again right into the Trump Twitter insect vaporize or so so for me I'm enjoying this the polls are tightening of the end of the president's base is actually going to turn out much higher percentages and people predicted and so\nOnce again he's going to defy logic here I think we are very good chance of possibly ah keep the house we're certainly going to gain seats in the Senate and it couldn't happen\nWithout the energy and the order tutors for a President Trump\nWell if they do it when I'll say this he's carrying a lot of these people on his back but you know what I feel like Nancy Pelosi the dangers are what we're gonna have endless investigation higher taxes keep Obamacare open borders\nAnd the president is is battling back on all these fronts in Guatemala Honduras El Salvador he says there or not we're not able to do the job of stopping people from leaving their country and coming illegally to the U.S now\nWe will begin cutting off substantially reducing the massive foreign aid we routinely give them an Trump tweeted out every time you see a caravan of people they legally coming are attempting to come into our country illegally\nThinking blame the Democrats are not giving us the votes to change our pathetic immigration laws\nRemember the midterms it's so unfair to those who come in legally and he's right um well and and we don't know anything about the people that are coming here we don't know when when one thing about them and I know the media can be sympathetic because they want but you know who might mix it with the people that maybe just want a job is a big problem for us but\nBut it's but you but here's the other thing okay the American people intuitively notion that it's a she says all it is is he or she is recognizing with the legendary built for even one set about any country\nIf you have a welfare state in the United states does have one you need to protect your order because free market forces dictate that people will cross over that quarter\nTo participate in your welfare state and so\nEvery country has a strong border and so should the United states so they don't get a you know ... on on promoting my my uh my book that today in the last couple of days mom a lot a left leaning shows where they go they go nuts so crazy on the president's response all\nYou want to illegal immigration you have democratic and Republican presidents and democratic elected officials that have voted in the last I don't understand why just enforcing those laws\nHave everybody saw ... ... ... well could there answered by so\nWhy don't they well it's a lot of things are we better off economically than we were two years ago by every single objective measure the answer is yes the growth of the economy consumer confidence jobs created\nThe number of people leaving food stamps or out of poverty eight million Americans so you know by every measure and more job\nOut of the bottom ... percent of the society shutting the wages of five and a half percent according to the wall Street Journal over the last Eighteen months but as a direct result of the president's policies but\nAlso the fact that he cut the slack at the border and so it made it tightened up the labor supply and it's giving a lower middle class families shot now have real living wages\nWell that's the story that you actually tell in the book by the way Anthony Scaramucci is with us all through the brand new book it's out today we put it up on Hannity dot com it's on Amazon dot com and bookstores everywhere it's called Trump the blue collar president I first heard that term from one of his sons of his either Erica Don I don't remember those Donnie\n... get on each call them the blue collar billionaire yeah and I said ... Don if you don't mind going to hijack the nickname and just switch out billionaire and put it in President he was gay he resonates with these people for a reason\nYeah look I I I think it is and you talk a lot about his background you you talk a little bit about your family background it's similar to my background and and it's amazing because the only thing that I really care about what motivates me it's not politics itself it's not a game to me\nBecause the policies that we have in a country as we do now greatly impact whether or not people are on food stamps or whether or not there are jobs we now in two years have a a a scenario that is not\nUnfolded in this country since Nineteen sixty nine and that is we have a million more jobs than we have people on unemployment you know that I identify with that that's what you identify with you you did not have any that are in your mouth\nAnd you know I saw it as a dishwasher at twelve and and look where you started died you know\nShowing showing list that I mean I think that's the message and I think that's the reason why you're so clearly popular at the end of the gay America is about aspiration in America is about passing the ... the the baton to a next generation of Americans that\nCan do better than ourselves and that's what our grandparents did for our parents that our parents did for you and I and and the cat that the right policy shift of white\nFree market based motivating market incentive policies\nOn because what we both know is that you cannot system ties for through a political system created equal outcomes never happens black markets crop up and then there's a thin layer at the tippy top that are living better than everybody else and everyone else has devastated whether it's Cuba or Venezuela place like that\nYou know the real danger so I don't know how this is all going to play out but we we see all weekend long these mobs you know really making ... an unsafe environment for anybody to even go get a bite to eat if you're a public figure which was really sad I mean when you're doing it in front of people's wives\nIt's not only sad it's pathetic when you're going after Pam Bondi Sarah Sanders and our kids and\nSecretary Nielsen and all she do all they're doing is trying to sit in a restaurant and have something to eat\nTelling you know one group of Americans they're not wanted here in any way what are you doing here get out of this you know they're going after in uh Ninety year old guy Henry Kissinger now who served his country with honor and distinction is that it seems like there's no limits here but there's no moderation left\nEither ... the Democratic party it used to I used to think Democrats at least they on paper they said they cared about the American working men and women but apparently they don't\nHave to losing the argument then you have to suppress the other side's argument in other words if you're wrong on the facts and your ideology is going to create\nUnequal outcome so you know bad society uh even though it sounds great on paper all of your ideas when they make contact with reality or disaster for a country a person a citizen then you've got to suppress the voices of the other people it's happened to me it's happened to me on a college campuses\nIt's happened to me I'm Around the country when I'm traveling I'm cool with it I'm up for the fight of it are both the you know when you know what's great about the people just want you to think of as Ninety five percent\nOf the professors Sean or liberal but about forty five to fifty percent of the kids are conservative so they're not buying into the ...\nYeah All right stay right there by the way the books phenomenal I read it cover to cover Anthony\nScaramucci is whether Trump the blue collar president\nUh you know it's interesting you look at the jobs created who's benefitting when we create manufacturing jobs in factory jobs\nAre and we bring an industry back to America and we incentivize businesses to invest here well that's the forgotten men and women the Thirteen million under Obama\nThe additional Thirteen million that were on food stamps and after eight years of his presidency and the eight million more Americans that were in poverty after eight years of his presidency well now we have for a million new jobs and eight million fewer people in poverty and on food stamps and so dramatic turn around\nAnd they're back happily working and some are getting career jobs and opportunities that we were told was never coming back\nQuick break right back well continue

literally taking the people of Arizona back I'm\nFirst instead of once calling Arizona the meth lab of democracy and the people of Arizona crazy a inviting Arizona State university the radical attorney for the blind shake\nYeah that blind shake involved in the what the bombings in America um she had no problem with Americans joining the Taliban\nMartha McSally confronted her in the recent debate and said well you apologize you would not apologize and accusing troops of torture and that's only part of it and then on top of that we have the latest development cinema once attacked BS stay

polls one I had you up by seven when I grew up by two ah but ah I frankly after these latest revelations in the last two weeks about Christmas\nSend them I Would imagine that your polls are going to go higher\nShon well it it's unbelievable every single day a new part of her radical passed in her mocking Arizona and their extremism on so many issues as being an earth\nBut the Arizona local media is protecting her a and making excuses for her and so the only way that filters down his shows like yours are us turning it into a TV ad\nUh the fact that she's still hanging in there is\nReally ridiculous so out of step with Arizona values and American values you rattled off a number of uh a number of things that would have a Senate candidate B. disqualifying in the past\nBut here we are way down to the wire over eighty percent or around eighty percent of people will vote early over half have already voted and so we need to make sure that the messages out about her radical out of step past\nThis qualifying statement you know compared to nice to have been twenty six years in the military and defending our freedoms that are way of life\nWhat did you do in the military I Know well you served abroad post nine eleven correct\nYes sir I was a a ten pilot I was just fortunate to be the first woman in us history to fly fighter jet in combat\nUh and then the first to command a fighter squadron in combat I've had six deployments to the middle east and Afghanistan a hundred and twenty five combat hours in a tan ward hog again saving American lives on the ground and defending our way of life it was an absolute honor of my life to be able to serve\nYou know when you hear ... cinemas ill it's OK at that point what I Believe it was two thousand and three that oh it's okay if Americans want to join our enemies the Taliban and nearly died\nA Sean when I when we heard this I I couldn't believe it I mean I was deployed on nine eleven uh the Taliban harbored al ... who can and killed three thousand Americans since then with them and their affiliates they've killed thousands of American troops\nTo include you know truth well I was deployed over there I've told this story before but we would at Bagram Air force base when I was a commander\nA we would you know we would get out there as soon as we heard a firefight was going on and we'd be overhead to protect them in our eight ten but often times uh you know the the the firefights happened before we could get there and Americans lost their lives\nAnd as we would we would line up on the taxi way as the cat the flag draped casket would come through and there is no this is silence there and everyone is saluting giving our final salute to these American heroes\nWho perished over there fighting the Taliban and their affiliates\nAnd for her to be able to say that she's OK with an American going to join the Taliban to fight against us I mean that in and of itself should have had her suspend her campaign and Arizona and should make a different choice to not vote for ... this is really personal\nFor those of us who served and was shot at by the Taliban and and so Americans parish over this\nUh you know I hear the

Robert Bowers\nWas charged with twenty nine counts in connection with the synagogue shooting believed to be the worst ever attack on American Jews the charges include obstruction of exercise of religious beliefs resulting in death rather antiseptic sounding term to describe what authorities called a horrific crime ABC's\nKaren ... says that given the studies in stature about the rise of anti Semitic acts in recent years President Trump sounded shocked\nTo the president said the synagogue in Pennsylvania it should've had armed security there he said you want protection they didn't have any protection and they had what he called\nWorkers\nFront\nRunner but she was\nGood for you\nDo you want to get elected when making really yes she's Germans\n\nI don't like this you turn them bomb a

[noise] [noise]\n\nAn endless Sylvia what's going on\nAnd they didn't want to be like you know the amazing\nThis is now number three British send the phony fake bony fraud wire hypocrite from Tennessee you got Claire McCaskill the pony lying hypocrite manipulate trying to manipulate the voters in Missouri and Heidi Heitkamp will be a super liberal but she's not going to tell you that until after the election\nAnyway project beret toss it CEO founder James O'Keefe strikes again how are\nYou a showing great to be with you and yeah this is number three it's it's more of the sameness Heidi Heitkamp director and her Washington DC campaign office\nOr speaking candidly about when she gets elected she's going to go really hard left she'll be quote super liberal unquote at that point so he's describing the bait and switch that once again the red state Democrats have to do in these battleground states the elected\nWhat's so amazing is the consistency here is that is that they are telling their staff\nOne thing they're saying things privately that they'll never said publicly\nIn the hopes that they can basically lie to bamboozled whatever term you want to use the voters in their state in the case of brothers and even calling the people at Tennessee ignorant in the hopes that they'll get that seat and then they'll they'll be a a basically a Chuck Schumer senator for that state\nYeah just so that your listeners if you haven't seen every video a there's a video in Missouri we did where were they were talking about Obama's using Claire McCaskill's views and the staffer says Obama and the cast school have the same views and everything but quote people just can't know that\nWell in this video this video released last night on your show Sean there's this another guy Gordon is his name he's the staffer\nIn and Heidi Heitkamp Fargo North Dakota campaign office\nAnd we and we see an Obama poster in the office there's a big one of those are the Obama looks like the messiah on the wall this big poster\nBut then they took it down right before the press came so we asked why did you take the Obama poster down and the staffer says well because the presses here and and we take it down when the press comes is what Heidi Heitkamp staff the same so it's more it's basically the same thing in each of these red states\nThey have to mislead they have to do the moderate voters in play to the progressive base well we just have them on tape saying it and we all know that Heidi is is liberal but\nShe's going to be so liberal once you get selected staffers are emphasizing it here and they also say that she's not going to run again so because this what Jesse Overton says in the studio quote she doesn't want to run again social just do good work while she can which means that she'll do the things that she can't talk about right now\nIt's just so revealing but I I think this is really this is not an accident that you're getting very similar responses and every place you have now gone\nI mean these are three big huge massive Senate races and you have caught three major Senate candidates all admitting that they ... they're lying to the people in their state to get elected\nBut I Would argue that it ... represents the entirety of the Democratic party we now know what goes Maxine Waters told us that are parties pulled or they don't want me to say it they want me to stop saying it but I'm not going to stop saying it impeach forty five ... well that's it yeah but\nIt's ... it's particularly true in these red states there's a there's a kind of a story here that we found that were confirming suspicions that well that's what we do it tossed we confirms suspicions\nAnd we've always known just to be true but my point is just have integrity does it it's not really a left or right thing I was at the first time in conference with all these big hon chosen media who were ... you know very cheering and and hearing it may I suggest have integrity\nThis is about just doing what you say you're going to I think it's more pronounced in the red states with these Democrats running because they have to lie to the moderates they have to woo the moderates and they and they could only make one choice one\nBut he did not have a choice it's lying is this a purposeful misinformation and propaganda campaign 'cause they have no intention of doing what they say they're going to do\nThey have a very different agenda the people working for them know that they have a very different agenda and so they're really just lying manipulating I mean it is the worst of the worst in terms of politics\nBecause there's an open contempt hatred and a feeling of superiority that Claire McCaskill has that bill Brett isn't hasn't Heidi Heitkamp as towards the people of their state Penn Web day so\nIt's so hateful showing that Claire McCaskill has asked for a special prosecutor to look into me he asked her opponent Josh Hawley who's the attorney general I'd never met Josh I yeah I don't I don't he doesn't work for me I never talked to anybody in his staff but McCaskill ask to be a special prosecutor to investigate project Vera tossed\nTo investigate hair on camera speaking her own words are there any restrictions in the state of Missouri about filming people\nNo no and it it it it comes to the attorney general asking for me to be investigated his like someone telling you not to go on the radio in talk it's it's it's it's it's perfectly legal for me to do what I Do in\nMissouri they're just Pennsylvania I Can't do it Illinois I Can't do it but thirty eight states I can record people as long as I'm In the room with them and I'm a port and it and let me say something I'm Sean if it's wrong for me\nTo go undercover and record these folks then how wrong is that for them to mislead the voters if it's ... it's not fraud for me to record people\nBut it's certainly approaches fraud for her to misrepresent in such a awful way\nAnd and thank you Claire McCaskill for doing that and asking for me to be prosecuted because now every TV station in Missouri every single one has covered these videos and I think the same things that happen in North Dakota this week\nKnow I think well that should've happened in North Dakota I mean if she's planning to be a super liberal I think the people in North Dakota and fairness to them they need to know\nUm why can't you do it in Pennsylvania and twelve other states\nThere's twelve states that prohibit what they call to party consent laws and I think that these laws basically it means that uh you know if you're if you're talking to someone you cannot record them without their permission whereas an ... like in New York and DC in North Dakota and\nABC's drivers reports on President Trump's reaction\nTo president said the synagogue in Pennsylvania it should've had our security there he said you want protection they didn't have any protection and they had what he called a maniac walk it he said that if there had been\nArmed security the results his word the results could have been much better remember that after the Parkland, Florida shooting the president's very emphatically was calling for armed guards in

check in with you as we get into the holidays and talk about what's going on at the salvation army\nOf course always kept a trap and making the point that people need your help all year long because you're getting help all year long\nBut I Would like to do two things to talk about the holidays but also\nTalk about you because you are new to the area are you not\nI I Am I ... I came in in ... I'm I'm a fourth generation salvation this was born and raised in the salvation army church\nAlways been directly involved with the social services and and the things that the army does for the community and about eleven years ago lord called me into full time officers ship and ministry and\nI won't I haven't looked back ships\nAnd how long have you been here now in Orlando\nI came to the end of June and I found the Orlando area to be an amazing community with amazing resources that are hard for others\nThank you and I did speak ones and the reason is as you got here suddenly it was hurricane season and of course the salvation army was helping out with that\nYes we have right now currently a hundred and six mobile feeding units in the panhandle and that we have over a thousand hands or are people who are helping out we've served over a three hundred thousand meals\nOr just in the panhandle we've done over half a million meals in the Carolinas after Hurricane Florence so we've been very busy with disaster relief\nYeah and I think it's important to point that out because certainly if you're on the receiving end of that help and one of those zones receding that meal you're aware at the salvation army involvement but as a whole I don't think people realize that you go on site and help out with these situations\nThat is correct and we have trained personnel and teams that we can deploy literally and fit within Fifteen minutes and it's a it's a major thing thing to be out there and see the devastation into here's the thing disaster has no respect or person so it doesn't matter what economic level\nThat you are at a ... there will be several days where you will need someone to feed you and hydrate you\nAnd what separates us as we give emotional spiritual cares well\nYeah you encounter a lot of people who are in that moment of trauma and being able to approach those people with a little bit of that support that type of support is so important\nIt is and it's very rewarding I at ... at the end of a fourteen day deployment you need to go through the briefing so you don't come back home with ... some of those things that are difficult but it's rewarding when you can stay in next to someone who say you're not alone ... somebody else cares and we're going to help you through this we're going to hold your hand and get you through it\nWhat did you hear from the volunteers who did go to South Carolina and up in the panhandle\nThey all to every one of them said basically the same thing that they were a just a founded by the level of the devastation and the Carolina if it was much more flooding damage than anything else but\nIn Mexico beach in in the panhandle around a pen Panama beach is editor editor devastation and people some they can't even rebuild it so bad\nAnd in addition to the immediate assistance from Florida and other states how will the salvation army and those locations responding to that need ongoing\nBut we're beginning now to transfer\nFrom the transition from the response stage to the recovery phase and so we will continue to send teams are feeding into hydration services will probably begin to fade out of power is restored we don't want to compete with a local\nRestaurant some businesses so we'll get into the long term recovery of both depending upon the resources that we received how can we help people get back on their feet to repay its way to to get back into a normal lifestyle\nWell let's go ahead and talk about the day to day here in our local area and orange in Osceola and the kinds of services that you are providing for people\nMade knows no fees and is what we say we're a lot more than just Christmas and the holiday time on any given day here in Orlando we have three hundred and Nineteen elderly and disabled who live in apartment for next to nothing\nThat we take care of we have we serve an average of over five hundred and fifty meals a day we have a three hundred bed upset that are filled to capacity every single night rehabilitation programs for people with addiction we have social services\nTo heck with rental assistance another human crisis that keep people from being homeless to keep them from being homeless and we serve about a hundred and fifty at risk children that we have character building a life skills part of this is going on\nConstantly three hundred and sixty five days a year right here in Orlando\nAnd you do need the communities helped throughout the year so we can talk about the various ways to do that than you did say you're not just all about Christmas but\nCertainly people kind of oriented Christmas and they seem more visible signs of you for example with the catalyst being out so it's certainly talk about that and the various ways people can help and we need to begin with helping some the heart that this is wonderful Thanksgiving meal\nThat is provided to the community so I Do want you to talk about that and certainly there are so many people who've already volunteered you may not need help with that but I think it's important to let people know that you're doing it\nI'm On Thanksgiving Day we literally send out of this uh\nAt the kitchen and Jim that we have over here on our campus\nTwenty thousand meals are on that day to feed the hungry and we're so grateful to golden corral and their homes who who makes that happen he and his wife Diane I make that happen\nAnd they're generous for a philanthropic people but we literally feet twenty thousand meals and give a emotional spiritual care during that time to let them know you know as these holidays approach you're not by yourself there are people that care and people in this community are willing to sacrifice some of their holiday for you\nThat idea that it isn't just food it's about that sense of community that there's someone else here with me and these folks eating together makes all the different stance on it\nIt makes a huge difference in someone's life you know we sometimes don't understand that the power that we have without words\nAnd the power that a hug or smile give for someone particularly someone who is down ... down in life mad at God mad at the circumstances of life one nice word or one hub can change their life and we see that on a daily basis you on that day we get lots of free hugs\nThank you so much for telling us about that but that isn't all that's going on and let's talk I guess we could start with the catalyst to ride capitals\nYes I'll read kettle campaign has a hundred\nAnd twenty eight years old it began in uh San Francisco on the on the fisherman's Wharf and that kind of thing that she had a cauldron out there for\nThe widows and the children of of a minute who lost been lost his seat and they had to sign it there that said keep the cauldron boiling and so for a hundred and twenty eight years we've been taken that in during the Christmas Time and are red cattle so we will have eighty locations of of between ... orange in Osceola county and if you were introducing\nA new technology so\nA lot of us don't carry cash no cash no problem this year we have what we call the tip jar you dip your credit card in pull it out and you automatically give us three dollar donations so if you don't have cast you don't have to avoid that bell ring or you can still give\nOkay so it's going to be like a little metal on the side or something\nIf fifty about eighty locations will have those are the new technology and we're excited about that and they give you a little jackpot sound when you when it's a successful donation and\nWe think we will say to our donors you know you just won the jackpot of life because she felt somebody with their life and and they're better people they're better people because of it\nThis is something that's so visible that people see those candles and it kind of reminds us of the salvation army and do you look at it this post awareness and a fundraiser\nRemember the reason we invented things like same day delivery and PBS Jay in the same jar we love convenience which is what makes highs are permanent tastes that special we offer health care in coverage together rather than having your doctor over here and your insurer there we provide quality health care in coverage under one roof and\nBring you up for other important tasks like making a sandwich Kaiser Permanente together we thrive Katie dot org slash integrated customers and hopefully the mainland and they think we're pretty when it when he's differences we brought them into the report to\nThe phones drives me crazy

though I like when this happens on the show what I like it when people call back an update us on the problems when we answer on and the other thing I like it when people call in and have solutions for

professional come out and empty it for you mentioned it will yellow did they say or elaborate on what they meant by slow does that mean drainage from the house you into the field or field itself\nI think we're looking at about a day and every oh I have found out about every two years or three years somewhere around there\nBut you you mentioned that they said it was slow did they did they say anything beyond what they meant by the word slow\nIt was it was right at the top ... it just was at a dream is is officially the shed with all the rain we had and stuff like that we've had water ... to it\nIt sounded like a fee to drain field slash yeah yeah ... yeah cause rejects treat what's in the tank most part you know the solid for the help solitary breakdown and things like that\nYou're probably the crowd was built into the the ... eighty three yeah yeah well I hate to break it to you but start putting your money aside for new drain field yes so\nYou know the last one I had it at

squirrel hill neighborhood individual to honor the eleven\nPeople killed in yesterday's mass shooting at the tree of life synagogue Pittsburgh Mayor Bill but\nDue to ah when something happens to one

shot by police see is facing twenty nine federal criminal courts including hate to climate charges President Trump at a rally in Murfreesboro Illinois last night saying America and the world cannot tolerate anti Semitism\n[noise] yeah I've been putting into it for about Thirty years I'm just not sure as far as the you know if I Need to go into a facility when I get older what that it looked like I don't have any kids just a wife and I'm not sure what that will shape a tree ...\nOh it's a little bit more in the long term care side of things you got it okay sounds good and how old are you [noise] fifty one the one that holds an awesome age to start thinking about a long\nTerm care which is which is fantastic and I think one of the big misconceptions which is a great conversation with with Greg is that Medicare covers yes long term care and it it really doesn't\nUm so ... it's great that you're you're thinking about this so there's a couple of different things out there to to different I Would say avenues to\nThink through one is traditional long term care insurance it's very similar to maybe disability or maybe life those type of policies that that you may have been used to where you pay a premium and then if you need the care the policy kicks in\nVery traditional it's called traditional long term care that's how it works\nSomething that's become a lot more I Would say popular as of late or basically products where you put aside a set set amount of money will just say for the sake of this conversation is it a little oversimplified\nBut you put away a hundred thousand dollars and then that money has been set aside for your hair and it has some sort of multiplication associated with it so it might be a two times multiple\nSo the hunter hundred thousand dollars\nTurns into two hundred thousand dollars so you have a bucket of money that's used can be used for care so that two hundred thousand dollars can be accessed for care now if you don't need the care than the kids or the wife get the original hundred grant\nSo when I explained it like that people say well why wouldn't everybody wants to do this well if you give one of the insurance companies a hundred grand now at age fifty one and then they give your wife or your kids a hundred grand in Thirty years well they've made a lot of profit off of a hundred grand\nThat's the kind of I Would say catch but that's also why a lot of people are gravitating towards these long term care products is that it's not a use it or lose that benefit like a lot of the other insurance products that are out there again life insurance disability\nThis is a little bit I Would say a less less scary in terms of you losing your money or at least you get back what you put in\nSo that's something I Would consider and are you thinking about this you know obviously for yourself it sounds like ... are you thinking about this because you went through it with your parents or what's a what's kind of sparking this conversation at that you want\nJust thinking you know and and I'm I'm I'm a planner so I'm just concerned about what'll happen says I don't have any kids is really what I've been thinking about\nSure um that ... that might be able to take care of me so that was that the fear that I've got and how long my wife will will either outlast me or or or free to see me as as just you know not so just wanting to have all the facts\nSure and you know one of the other\nThings as you can always pay for the care I mean I think that sometimes people don't want to do that but you know if you don't have any kids if you don't have any charitable a you're not terribly inclined\nI'm Ben paying for the care is not the end of the world but again with a little perhaps you can obviously find a better way of doing yet um but again I think a lot of times people say oh I don't want to have on the air but Carter the Klan as long as you think through what what that means\n[noise] gotcha well appreciate the time\nYeah and again I commend you for looking at it this early on that is fantastic\nYou bet well I hear all your Greg talking about all the Medicare stuff than if it ... me on to do what I Need to do so appreciate what you guys do\nArt well sounds very well thanks Parker and again Parker called in to eat for for two two zero zero in Ninety six five he joined the let's talk show live our producer Chris picked him up and he got into cue to talk with us again that's eight for for two two zero\nZero Ninety six five wants to go to the next caller Joyce from Orlando out of the question on Medicare Joyce you're alive and let's talk show how can we help\nGet morning unless you're the information that you get this time of year through the mail and I'm On Medicare I'm ah from Medicare Advantage plans what is and most of those are HMOs [noise] it seems like anyway I'm ... I'm On straight\nOr regular Medicare it's probably a little more expensive you seem to get a little more options with the advantage plans however doctors don't you know they say okay fine we accept Medicare as long as it's not an advantage plan\nHow how do you go about this how do you get around it I mean you can lose you don't necessarily get choice of doctor you have to go to okay and I I guess I pretty much need that only 'cause I have a couple of specialists but I'm not sure what to do or even out\nOkay you have to look into going to something different [noise]\nAbsolutely you certainly want to do your diligence and making that decision so currently on traditional Medicare so that means you have access to any Medicare provider in the country\nFor Medicare benefits what happens on advantage is you leave traditional Medicare as far as the administration goes you become a member of a private insurance company and in the HMO model you would need to use their doctors to receive your care\nSo you would absolutely want to verify that the doctors that you want our network [noise] [noise] and the other day that you want to be very very careful of is you mentioned some specialists [noise] even if you would see on the provider list in that HMO whether you're considering that your specialist or in network\nYou want to confirmed with your primary care doctor so your primary care refers to those specialists says they can choose whatever specialists they want to refer to it doesn't necessarily have to be the one that you're currently using or have a relationship with\nThen yes the advantage planes do offer some ancillary benefits\nSome a gym membership summit dental and vision\nSo those are the benefits above and beyond Medicare that can make Medicare Advantage look look enticing and there are millions that are on a very successful that you just want to be careful due diligence as you're doing\nThere are PPOs which give you the option of going out of network and paying more for your care so those are a little bit more flexible\nThe benefits typically you'll pay a little bit higher co pay on a PPO and you do an HMO but there's a lot more flexibility Sony referrals to get to your specialist seemed like I say goodbye to network and pay more [noise]\nUm is there like in a number or someplace you can call they have someone ex Ollie who some of these other you know I I don't want to be involved with an HMO and most people that I've spoken to just are not happy with the after the fact\nSure I represent a number of insurance companies that I can help you you know sort the options as far as what plans your current doctors take whether going out of network would become a necessity or we can find a plan that all of your doctors are in [noise] okay yeah feel free to give us a call during the week\nYeah Joyce our office numbers for oh seven six for eight Eighteen eighty one K. again for oh seven six for eight one eight eight one and then Greg handles all the Medicare in our office and he and my name's Michael Clarke\nHas an advance for probably going to my voice mail about ten people a day or being on the phone most of the time but I'll call you back as soon as I get a moment\nOkay and that was sick for seven one eight one oh six for a for a okay next for a one eight eight one okay All right ... thank you ...\n... pounds good well thanks a lot if you want to jump in like joy state for for two two zero zero Ninety six Fox or maybe you have questions throughout the week and you'd like to get in touch with Greg our office number four o seven six for eight Eighteen\nEighty one we are up on a break when we get back this will go up by two point eight percent next year [noise] so what will go up to ... percent next year will tell you this if the less talk future shop [noise]\n\nRolling breaking news this hour the FBI is giving a review this hour of the shooting in the synagogue in Pittsburgh it took eleven lives in the news at nine thirty I'll tell you the state but it's the government was making during the assault Leno searching for a car involved in what's described as a road rage shooting on ice for last night\nWere comfortably coolest our there is no rain news Ninety six point five WTO interacting with radar it's sunny fifty seven in Orlando\nWhen you get the as you get our Larry\nConnected to a breaking news with our ... and listen everywhere you go business news Ninety six Boyd five ... db were Orlando turns first for breaking news weather\nWith twenty five percent off on the NFL Seventy percent off previously refreshing you really need a better reason a party we don't think house how new correspondents are clear and interact with more than nine thousand square feet in New and previously in these furniture and acorn for your home enough so far from one Ninety nine Ninety nine some real Ninety nine Ninety nine\nDining room to Ninety nine Ninety nine animal I presented prizes and find all weekend long ...
