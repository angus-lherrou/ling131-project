I Do I feel like the president you know for a little while it's like this to presidents or even my friends they told me that they don't call me not only do they call me Mr President let's say we please loosen up\nI've learned on the job I have when you feel comfortable I feel very comfortable yeah\nI think he has grown into like a lot of people do it is a surreal thing when you wake up like

thing even though it's Donald had all of these trappings life ... ... people aspire to have\nThe reality is being president is different thing it's a whole another animal\nSo they can say he's not going to run I think he's liking it now or they get and I also think something else he lost a lot of money he's name for a lot of people is is no more the brand that he spent years crafting is done in

him they are\nYou could say what you want about you can say what you want to all of these things\nBut I Love how the left likes to sit here and say it's all his fault he's all of these horrible things yet thousands and thousands of people are showing up around the country to see him there people there to protest him absolutely he votes emotion it's one size\nAs one side of the other side but he gets his side to get out there they rabble rousing get excited he energized them like we haven't seen anything like this before\nThey is passing is cycle Donald Trump has gotten really good at being a really bad precedent you look at what happened with the Brett Kavanaugh hearings that was exactly what he wanted he settled down on both sides had both sides fighting each other and got exactly what he wanted which for someone who was unfair\nFor the highest court in a land elevated the highest court in the land\nYeah I and I'm going to call BS on that because if he didn't start the attacks on

don't believe what you're saying there's never any you know what both sides were horrible and this and if you look at what the polls say right what the polls say when they is that both sides behaved badly\n\nTrump didn't start but Trump finished does he like confrontation absolutely he does he ... he\nLoves confrontation he's one of those athletes I used to play against players like this where\n... they love to get physical they love the confrontation they love all of those things they like having a bit of a mean streak right Michael Jordan was the king of that he loved that he loved

things the economy is booming right we're nearing its full employment we've got six million job seekers and seven million jobs\n\nHe's taking on immigration you may not like the way he does it nobody else wants to do it nobody else does he went after ISIS and stomped on\nHe's done a lot of different things you may not like the way she does some of this stuff and you may not like it was a person I think a lot of that's what this is you don't like him as a person\nAnd I'm okay with that but if we're going to be honest let's be honest all the way around I Want\nPresidents that check in power but what you're going to get in the midterms is they're probably going to take back the house the Democrats not saying it's going to be for certain 'cause I think this caravan and I think cabinet has energized Republicans in a way\nThat for all intents and purposes that the the left in the coming and it's called them off guard and they're scrambling but ah what you may\nFind is a surprise and that's the prizes maybe they hold house maybe they hold the Senate maybe you look up\nIn a month from now Donald Trump has a smile on his face because uh if you're leaving the news that's coming out

there you're gonna find out and be disappointed that they didn't find any they're there\nAnd that to me is what do you say at that point in time but what happens is when they take back the house if

well he's a spokesperson to senior advisor for American first action as well as just being a America's toughest sheriff I think a lot of ways a share of David Clarke joined us and I read your tweet this morning about uh\nThe New York times what you said about the disingenuous reporting of why people are coming up here in this caravan\nYes a virtual ... uh no this was a political ambush just don't know about this this is a very organized do for me to think of the cost involved this is a two thousand miles trek from um doors\nThe United states border and this was covered in a couple of days but some of these people on foot I Know there's some other singer on buses and cars whatever other still pretty good track and you need to get to ask who's feeding these people were making sure they stay hydrated\nWhere are they sleeping and that costs money and and so somebody's behind this effort we could\nTalk all day about who might be but that's not the point the point that I was trying to make this is the political ambush\nI'm being directed at the price of the United states when we talked about the New York times article I read this morning there already setting it up they pointed out very early in the article that these were families and pregnant women and the article was full of color pictures of\nSmall children laying on the floor on cots and I'm mad so on and so forth\nTrying to a strike at a motion and I know there are ready um that that have just reached the board of they'll start with their separating families again which was a a a which is nothing more than propaganda the last time this happened so you can see what's going on but this is a test of US sovereignty it really is and the president so far President Trump\nOr showing great resolve he's not going to blink he's not going to political pressure and some of the propaganda that the um a leftist media is ready to Earl Adam you understand that his his duty\nTo protect the United states this is it a migration it's an invasion for heaven's sakes so he's holy from oh that's very important at a time like this politically and nationally\nYou know or a sheriff you know one of the things that that is is always frustrated me is uh and I spoke to a dream last week on my pod cast item on for about an hour it's really good guy was brought here when I was very young he's a lawyer\nAn immigration lawyer he thinks that Trump's actually can be the one that gets docket down his frustration is like a lot of people's frustrations on both sides which is both sides have had opportunities to fix something yet both sides don't seem to have really any stomach to do it because I think both sides like the fact that stuff does it get fixed because\nAs we always say there's more there's more money and the problem then then the cure\nThere's no doubt about it this is the fault in Congress failure to act\nOn fixing this broken illegal under spoken immigration system than I Am not securing the border both see or some political leverage it can be gained here they're dancing delicate lead to try not to\nTo upset the potential a Latino vote but that's not what their job is their job is to serve the American people and that's to do what's in the best interest of the American people you know they've been kicking the can down the road for the last Thirty years\nThere's political leverage in it but like I said the president's doing everything that he can within his power under the constitution but really this rests with the Congress by the constitution\nAnd you know specifically says that the Congress still formed rules on naturalization or immigration and so it has to start doing until Congress decides they're not going to use this as a political football and finally fix this thing and it is very broken\nUm this is what we're gonna continue to see the back and forth\nHow do we get them that my my thing is how do we get them to act because you know a lot of times and and I think you know this is the more that you get into the political world you know you're working with the American first action you're you're you're out there and and you're seeing things and you're talking to politicians I'm sure talking politicians on both sides despite what people like that the thing is\nThat neither side has you have to have the stomach to take something some of these these real issues on political you have to have the political fortitude to stomach to take these things on and a lot of them they're just they're afraid because they think their jobs are on the line which may be true but the whole point is you're supposed to be they're serving the people not just your job in the party\nYou know what I think needs to happen is an incentive to November because we have to win\nIn November the GOP has to maintain control both chambers of Congress\nAnd then we can um you know hold their feet to the fire after that because they've had two years the GOP Congress they squandered two years to finally fix this thing they had the numbers they didn't need democratic support although they probably did because you've got some weak need a GOP members on\nOn immigration but it's going to take leadership and I think the leadership\nOr catcher said we're we're in for a windy cooler and to the weekend and no rain now why do studies just went by W de Vito interacted with

I own universal roof and contracting love to help you with your roofing a roofing needs\nOr the number of our office is for seven three seven eight zero seven nine seven again universal roof and contracting or we are having a special for ah for this month which is thirty percent off labor\nI and uh so uh it is the only good for a few more days so if you want to take advantage of that you have to give us a call at the office for seven three seven eight zero seven nine seven again for seven three seven eight\nZero seven nine seven at let's go to another tax question here\nUh says I have a small beach cottage in Cape Canaveral it is about eleven hundred square feet or the roof is half shingles and half flat or the flat part needs replacement\nOkay so are many times you can uh just replace the flat section and are not replace the shingle portion it is common that a flat roof ... or do not last as long as slope troops\nOr when I'm when you have a flat roof or the water sits on it longer which means that usually going to deteriorate faster\nAnd flat roofing material typically is just designed to where it does not last as long as slopes material\nSo there are many times you have to replace the flat at a at a faster rate than what you have to replace the slipped through the material now if it's a completely different section then it's a you know then it's a no brainer in and you know it can be done pretty easily\nThe most the time what happens is is you have a flat section that connects to er transitions right into a slope section\nAnd there's a a rule that talks about how the flat roofing material\nHas to come on up underneath of the the slopes part the shingle part a minimum of Eighteen Inches so that can be a challenge if the roof is new era and flexible and pliable than many times you can you know just kind of chair into those shingles replaced the transition pieces and that's it\nBut if those transition pieces are brittle are in such a manner that they cannot be separated from one another than many times that would cause you to replace um that uh that slope to material\nNow many times what we'll do is we'll recommended material that can uh they can be replaced a without a installing that slope section um but uh we would just have to take a look at it and see whether or not you know in this area uh whether or not that would work\nBut if you call a my office universal roof and contracting a the numbers for seven three seven eight zero seven nine seven\nOh we do all types of roofing a universal roof and contracting\nA and uh so if you give us a call we'll send an estimator out or that estimated we'll give you a quote a and a our estimates are always free uh we did not charge or a to do the actual estimate we do charge to perform work but the estimate part we do not charge for\nA and I'm a if you give the office of call then they'll schedule a set time for one of our estimators to come out\nAnd throughout central Florida we've there's a number of areas of central Florida that has had some storm damage and so have you seen a bunch of neighbors and your house having the roost replaced or maybe there's been a a bunch of people knocking on the door and get some strange company that you've never heard of\nA don't go with them called the local company that's been here forever a universal roof and contracting we'd love to help you with your next project\nAgain for seven three seven eight zero seven nine seven or universal roof ... dot com and again for renewal by Anderson Chelsea thank you so much for for joining us or this or

thank you so much Lewis and God Bless [noise] [noise]\nAh in street name so you don't have to keep track of those and you get your statement every every month a course on line and so on about personal papers things that are really sentimental value to you and uh you you wouldn't want to lose them in a house fire or or staffed and uh\nYeah or get damaged so um you know it's also really good to put these things on a a scanned method put them on a a thumb drive and store that some drive in your safe deposit box\nOr keep that ... a copy of it in your home\nOr in the originals into safe deposit box or or you could store things on scan and stored among the cloud if you have a a\nLocker and on the cloud you wind up with things around and\nKeep it up there but make sure on some drives Joe you know the uh the worry of uh we we come up against with some drives you know ... somebody hands your thumb drive ... and you go oh good this is where it's laying around in your drawer and you wonder where that came from and you go I'll use this thumb drive\nWell you don't know what's on it and um there's been cases where they hand these out a and ... it's now a virus happens through you're if you're just because you used a thumb drive for a couple of moments so make sure it's a new one and uh\nRight out of the ... that's ... yeah [noise] so uh how about family photos to probably keep a family photos those who kind of go along with important papers\nAnd collectibles if you've got certain collectibles you want to make sure there are stored safely and you don't need to\nGet out and look at your Mickey Mantle baseball card every few days you might want to go ahead and especially if it's a human probably keep that in collectibles and you're a safe deposit box and again make sure those are insured because the bank is not cover the FBI seed isn't it\nA lot of banks today no longer have safety to pass by you know I used to be standard in many banks today today they're few and far between so you know there's a lot of banks that don't even have branches anymore that's for sure right there on line yes yes yes\nWell we'll get to more of that are more things to give it a safe deposit box coming up let's go back to the phone line she read for for two two zero zero nine six five is the number of you want to dial is up again he'd for for two two zero zero nine six five Harry and like a merry go ahead you're on a certified financial group the morning\nHere area like Mary morning we we couldn't help very sorry\nTo hear about um a couple of years ago I was diagnosed with some bladder cancer and um I've got a year and a half now they tell me that I found that answer and that's a great center of it but\nYeah thank you but I'm a while I was sick and I encourage them hospital bills and uh up until that point I was debt free and I chose to take my hospital bill money out of four one K.\nJust to pay it off as I said well you know ... different things come up if they pay for it it should pay for that but for some reason I I thought well this hospital bill is something that I I Can't pay all at once and I don't want to ah\nAh ah paying debt so I just check it out of my four one K. paid it off and was that a wise decision or should I just advertise that thing and uh make payments on it or\nOr whatever it is I Would have made it that there there are paid us but a lot of very how much are we talking about\nUh about ten thousand dollars of ...\n[noise] um do you can't take money out of what's called a hardship withdrawal\nOr that money will be taxable to you but if you have medical bills exceeds seven and a half percent of what's called your adjusted gross income and your adjusted gross income is the amount of income the shows up on the front page of your ten forty on the bottom line is before your personal exemptions itemized deductions\nIf your medical bills exceeds ... percent of your adjusted gross income which case it probably is not the case you will have to pay taxes and the tempers that penalty and huh yea so that's expensive money to do it that way we we very rarely I mean you don't you might have been better off to borrow from your four one K. and pay yourself back\nThis way you avoid the penalty you avoid the taxes and you're acting as your own bank how\nLong ago did you actually take the money out of the four oh one K. two years\nOld and waters waters under the bridge and there's a jar yeah yeah yeah So Harry I'm saying I'm Glad to hear you buy your kid by your health so that's the good news unfortunately Uncle Sam so you're gonna have to pay a price if you haven't already done so for that withdrawal\nBut uh but the key is just put that money back in the forum on gay as soon as you can and ... only ten thousand dollars really now you can't put it in a lump sum you know it has to come out of your pay but\nI uh I I've got a job with some great benefits and that's why the cost was well it certainly minimal as it is it it was a blessing that gives you a lot\nHarder when you're a cancer free us\nAs sorry Harry thank you so much for Dolly some if you want Harry's line and said for for two two zero zero nine six five paid for for two two zero zero nine six five good genes in Ormond Beach teams go ahead you're on the sort of financial broken morning hello Jay was on\nA great show guys thank you thank you for calling\nYeah I I have a CSP\nIt down to zero if you have it all you have a thrift savings plan yes okay yes All right\nAnd I was just wondering if it's wise to start taking the now instead of wait until I'm Seventy sixty five year old because if the Democrats and then\nAnother ... [laughter]\nWell we know which way you're voting so [laughter] so you're um are you retired now\nYes I Am ... who you have\nDo you ah do you need this money or you just uh thinking you know\nI'm just thinking twice they in fact well if they get in there probably are raised taxes that goes\nRight uh well you know it's also a function of how big it is in a ... if you want to put off and you know you can do Seventy and a half but if you feel like you want to take a little bit out and it's not going to bump you up into a higher tax bracket\nI'm about whether you're a tax preparer can help you determine what kind of bracket you're in if you took out five thousand if you took out ten thousand if you took out twenty thousand you know it may be a you can get a little bit out without virtually ah any tax if your income is low and so\nNow I have a pension and stuff like that so they\nBumped into a a a tax bracket I Know but I just thought since the taxes are lower now maybe it's better to\nWell let's let's let's back into this um James how big is your uh through savings paying money I mean they're\nIt's over four hundred gay or just a little bit you know going up and\nDown with a lot you catch All right so let's say it stays in the range of four hundred four hundred and five hundred thousand dollars\nBased on current law the amount that you'll have to take out of your T. S. P. N. eight Seventy happens about twenty grand Fifteen to twenty thousand dollars so we have to pay tax and that we remember at Seventy and a half you don't have to clean out the entire account and really what you want to do is deferred taxes as long as you can because the more that's in that account\nThe at the growth on it is ... ... it'll grow on everything is in there when you start withdrawing from it you have less for growth\nSo I don't necessarily run out in ah in cash in or ... or start taking your money out of your ts be now if you're in a ten percent or less tax bracket you may want to convert some of that to a Ross and take advantage of of the year low tax situation now\nHe says something to look at but you ought to get together with your tax preparer we'd be glad to do that calculation for you or we do that all the time for our clients we do a retirement financial planning determine the timing of when to take money out of your retirement accounts but I wouldn't necessarily rush out\nAnticipation of a higher tax intuition and start making money out of the SPN necessarily\nOkay great okay thank you very much thank you very ... oh I've got\nMe so much James
