and Israel at that time in Iran that part of the world about this particular topic and I would have people from the Obama State Department is basically threatened me and telling me look what you're doing it you know you're causing a lot of problems for us that would have an ... reach out to me from the Obama State Department and say the same thing\nSo I never really took it to serious until all of a sudden I came under scrutiny by the de OJ about Mike Tyson says where is this uh this would be a let's say twenty Thirteen up until\nThis year right so he's out of power in twenty sixteen so

by many different entities organizations and intelligence services and it would be unfathomable for me to just not have some sort of war that would allow these people to have me under surveillance\nStop your life at all besides being surveilled did it stop you getting credit or did it stop you getting a job well\nMean a ... at the time of my FBI interviewer was actively trying to get a job with the administration so I mean of course are you a bomb in his or not I'm not the Trump Administration and of course once FBI came to my house those dreams were completely shattered and what I think was for a completely unjustified reason because now that\nUh we have new evidence that surfaced about the tremendous government misconduct as a congressman himself reference yesterday [noise] um I think uh um my story really needs to be viewed in a different way so\nThe president United States ends up being the front runner in the Republican side and he as easy as an outsider so all the big names start with the Rubio's in the Bush is and they don't like the way Donald Trump for the most part conducting themselves they don't believe he can win\nSo we put together young young talented foreign policy group that you're part of that team famously there's a picture of you all sitting around a table ... what was your mission or so\nI Believe that a candidate Donald Trump was actually going to be elected president as soon as I saw him announced his candidacy I don't know there was just fate that you know I was supposed to get on this campaign\nBut in the summer of two thousand Fifteen I reached out to Corey Lewandowski when I think their entire campaign was three people and I said look I Want to join this campaign I Believe in\nA Donald Trump I think he's going to end up winning so I stayed in touch with these people I got on the campaign eventually after I joined the Ben Carson campaign\nAnd my mission of sounds ... essentially was to try and McDonald's from look as much of a statesmen is absolutely possible by leveraging contacts I had in the middle east not necessarily Russia because I had no contacts there and then I go on this expedition to introduce them to Vladimir Putin and in the middle of that of course it's now known that western intelligence\nUse that against me to ah basically sabotage me and then eventually to do with the Trump himself\nSo how did you end up with a mission to me it valid vitamin food\nYou know I just saw a Kennedy Trump talking about working with Russia I mean he was very vocal about it obviously obviously I mean this was in the secret and I said to myself okay you know I could introduce them to a leader in the middle east but does that really going to achieve\nWhat he's been talking about it he wants to meet Vladimir Putin or at least you know they can gauge the American public of why he wants to work with Russia so I thought\nWell let's introduce them to Vladimir Putin for a photo op a handshake just so you know he would like a great statesman and that was really essentially what I was trying to put together there was no collusion there was no attempt to ... this was all fantasy\nCalled back to section and say listen I'm getting some contacts with Russia who these contacts\nI'm so sorry I didn't talk a to Z to sessions of in particular but at that meeting if that's what you're referring to emerge thirty first meeting\nI basically told the group ... there's just one person who's a presenting himself as some sort of an intermediary with Russia and I could set up this meeting by using him or we all interested of course some people were not interested you know I don't think really Donald Trump was that interest that he just kind of nodded to think about it\nAnd then I just pursued it and then never went anywhere so\nThere's this misunderstanding that I'm this insider in Russia when in reality I was a complete want to be\nWhen it came to that part of the world's because they were telling you one thing and who was that person that was telling you they had rushing connection uh so yeah it's just a infamous professor Joseph ... this multi is professor that are just a couple of days ago or more\nTo just simply ... we're living in London and as a professor exactly\nAnd living in London tied to all these western intelligence groups\nBut then ah you know he starts to present himself as a Russia Insider and basically a couple of days ago his own lawyer went public in state of that he was working for the FBI not Russia\nSo it's very confusing I don't understand why his own lawyer would make such a statement if it is false I don't believe it's fall and he's also hiding in Italy is also is also hiding in Italy who's living openly I think he changed his identity so obviously is getting support I mean ... is a reputation obviously must be destroyed\nHe's not going to be attending conferences or\nAnything like that so how is he living who's supporting him and have them in a check stopped and is that why his lawyer when public knowledge\nPapadopoulos is here so this is your first contact with intelligence but do you think you're talking to faster but you're talking to chose submitted who's allied with British Intelligence officer is so did one of the things he tells you or what does he tell you about Hillary's emails\nSo I'm a ... by the time he tells me a in late April that the Russians quote have thousands of Hillary Clinton's emails\nThis is a person who couldn't even introduced me to anyone of substance in Russia or the Russian government or even in London which I was actively trying to to meet at the time just you know to understand what the U.S Russian relationship was all about but then we go from a ... a guy who tells me he knows the world in Russia\nTo not introducing me tiny one and then he has all of a sudden the keys to this kingdom\nRegarding Hillary's emails so it doesn't really make just one conversation was one conversation he dropped to somebody ... I never asked for it ... or he just basically sat down with him and he says I have information that the Russians have thousands of Hillary's emails I never asked for him to tell me those we're sitting down having lunch or breakfast out of nowhere\nHe drops his bomb on me it was like he was dangling something I'm going to see if I Would bite and that's how they look I didn't buy I ... I never knowingly told anyone on the Trump campaign those\nI gossip about it with another diplomat in Greece when I Am Alexander down or ... you know and see allegedly allegedly I told Alexander downright have no memory of ever telling this person that the only thing I Know about this meeting with ... or was\nThat it was a set up he was there recording my conversation I met him through various intermediaries of western intelligence\nAnd he just wanted to meet and he started talking about a lot of different things that had nothing to do with the U.S has to be in a bar\nRight was it a bar none of us so the meeting was was planned out yeah went down or through his uh interests throughout his associates we meet there and he begins to be incredibly belligerent he hates Trump\nHe's telling me to back off my comments about the u._k. prime minister of when he was a ... it's a disparaging Trump about his Muslim ban comments and then he became very hostile so I don't understand why I Would tell a hostile individual something like that that I had just heard so it doesn't make sense because I don't have any memory of ever\nTelling them now to George is saying is is that this ambassador from Australia Vassar and when he's got to be as ... as they come here to look out for Australian interest extensively and we know Australia the u._k. and us a tight we get that\nCitizen Basset or tape the conversations that because the transcripts or now a parent now the way the story was told to us George on the outside\nIs that George Papadopoulos gates word about these emails telling has a few drinks and tells US ambassador the story\nThat tells the story these guys emails is going to be huge news now in reality the emails were jumping desk is email was hacked\nAnd that's we came out past his name never came up never ever in the transcript so the passive are suppose says when I saw the emails get released I realize that conversation I had with George Papadopoulos I have to tell the FBI because I care about America\nIn reality he's working for the FBI and he's given millions of dollars to the Clinton Foundation\nAnd we didn't find that out to later that that's absolutely\nRight and there was other information that I just recently found out through a various reporters\nThat Peter structure boss at the time a travel to London either right before I met Alexander down or the day after I met him so that some new information I'm not sure the American public understands but why on earth would Peters trucks boss be in London at the time of mind meeting with Aleksandr down or makes no sense\nPeter Struck a disgrace FBI official in charge of counter terror that had the affair with Lisa pay less rent it foolishly leaves used government phones to text messages his hatred for Donald Trump and a plot and plan emergency plan to take him down should he when he won is this the plant it certainly\nLooks like it and you know what there was another really interesting piece of information that came out from these exact text messages that you just referenced\nThe day I may just have ... in Rome Peters truck has touched Lisa Page about their overseas contact now talking now unless it's just so crazy coincidence that on the same exact day that I made Joseph ...\nPeters truck is texting Lisa Page about an overseas contact of theirs was now talking I don't know what to think about this\nThey could be you more with George Papadopoulos or the day after his testimony behind closed doors this is the brand kill meet you [noise]\nGiving you everything you need to know is Brian Gilmore [noise]\n\nCape Wind Adam nitrogen bonded with one atom of oxygen boom you just created nitric oxide a miracle mile ... your own body makes the appeals your cardiovascular will help keeping you vibrant\nBut as we all age your body's need help generate more natural nitric oxide super beach by human has harness the power of nutrient rich beads and created a super food\nIs even if the devices and we're still trying to determine whether or not uh they were functional as they say they were doing all kinds of analysis on that to make a definitive determination but they do contain\nEnergetic material or which if subjected to the right combination of heat or shocker friction or could be dangerous to the public and the public should treat any device like that of course\nABC's mark ...

have it as crystal ball is now out I was struck by this headline today in the in the Washington Post\nThought in key house districts up by Democrats fear of defeat becomes fuel and it's a whole thing how many Democrats feel like they did with Hillary Clinton and twenty sixteen only to be crushed on election day or is that one of those things where you're trying to motivate voters as I read the article there's a fear that the Republicans have closed the gap\nSince Labor Day you'd have to say yes but how close that they've gotten to the closing the gap and houses key right ...\nYeah but I mean you have to I think it started with the Senate because that has always been the Republican stock goal that if they lost the house they had to keep the Senate\nAnd they have made progress there I think it's you know a long shot and now the Democrats would would win the Senate or the house um you know what you said is absolutely true although really you're taking it from somebody else you're just borrow that there was an original\nI'd I'd like but there is\nThere is is palpable fear out there on Democrats they keep having these flashbacks to election night twenty sixteen\nMaybe they should but I'm just saying I'm it's somewhat irrational every election is different or you're not going to have the same factors at work but they they were stunned really in shock for for weeks after the twenty sixteen election\nAnd they're worried that it's all going to happen again well maybe it will maybe it won't there's no sense worrying about it as one of those things in life you can't control\nSo the GDP when was it four point to last quarter and a half three point five to two very good numbers\nAnd now you have the tax cuts and the original premise was hey are Republicans running the tax cuts and new one is look at this caravan and the immigration and this is what we're talking about and it's not a ... it's not a what if it is it's happening\nOr the Republicans running on the right thing\n[noise] well look this election is all about Donald Trump just like a Michael Steele was suggesting\nMaybe not the way he was interpreting it but Trump is placed himself at the center of this election he was going to be the center anyway Democrats would have made in the center of it if he had made in the center of it\nNot you know ... out there on board this who thoroughly ...\nLook

apparently it was like a failed shipping Dale is kind of dancer he worked at a strip club he uh is Native American and he is at a couple of catering company's\nHe is a he he's just ... this guy has a some you know I mean he's got I think he's got some serious serious issues\nAnd the rhetoric is what we're going to be talking about because now that that everybody can calmed down now we can get back to doing what we like to do bass which is finding blame and attacking everybody as much as possible everybody's got a part to play in the rhetoric not just in a singular thing\nRight like take us out of that is a singular saying that this guy is done\nRemember what happened a Bernie supporters shut up a congressional baseball practice almost killing Steve's lease\nBecause\nWas passed at the Republicans because Bernie Sanders apparently told them that Republicans ready to kill a bunch of people\nTheir health care plan so\nDid I blamed burning that anybody has the bench ... nope nope nope them nobody blend burning no cars that guy's actions are on his own though that guy's actions are his but I Do think the rhetoric has gotten out of control and whether it's Bernie or Trump or any or Hillary any of these things no matter what you say you have\nTo take into account nowadays that there is point one percent one percent point one percent when you look how many people are out there though that can add up to a lot of people thousands of people who don't quite understand the craziness\nThat goes on in many ways is kind of like a joke they don't\nGet the the the the they're not in on the jokes that are quite get it and they take it to heart\nI think Trump\nBeing the president United States and John Kades ... he's got the he's got the biggest a bully pulpit of all I think he and the born I think he needs to tone it down this is what he said when asked about that but I think I could do that if\nReally do that because as you know the leaders of the really unfair to ... to the Republican Party\nNow has the media been unfair [noise]\nSomewhat I mean it was to be real for just for being honest and I and I like honesty here have they been has the coverage been fair no did he get six months or a year now in fairness to them as Trump gone after them giving as good as he gets absolutely\nBut yes there should be some toning down I I and I and I would like to see if I Would like to see the president of the United states who as my president he's your president whether you like it or not\nI didn't vote for me maybe you didn't vote for but I'll tell you what I Want him to be successful but I also want to delete and at some point in time you've got to be the one that says you know\nI'm gonna take step back and ... and I said\nSomebody look somebody Pocahontas well I think his asinine and stupid you know ... in the office is one thing for his opinion heads to joke around and stuff like that [laughter]\nOr comics to do stuff like that it's one thing it's another thing when you've got the the leader you know of the free world doing some of the things you know I find that to be ridiculous but when it comes to blaming somebody for their actions\nThat to me is where I just like I you know what that got this guy's actions or his own actions\nPlays [noise]\nHappened from the border of a different bar\nOr what happened over there was\nSo I'm just really proud of\nMud and like I said I\nWould like him to read the room better I Would like him to maybe tone it down a little bit here's what you're going to get the exact opposite from will be louder Trump will be more vocal trouble be in everybody's face because they'll look at it as a one off and I think for all intents and purposes it is a one off\nBut it still is frustrating\nIt really really is

I've been out of the ws being more than a few occasions a great guy works ah ah you know been very nice to me and he's never Trump or by the way he let me tell you how bad it was for him\nIn the world of Trump he was kind of never Trump or what it was first starting it's kind of the ... the coined the phrase and he wasn't a huge fan of Trump he had to have people watch over him and his family security and police for days after a contentious ah\nInterview that they had and it was not good so it's not like this is the guy was like hey by the way Trump's my best friend in the world\nBut the rhetoric that's out there everybody's got a part to play and what I see is the media wants to say they've got no part in this right at the media wants to say they've got no part in this they're they're on the moral mountain above everybody else on the mount Everest of moral mount\nThe Republicans are the only wants to blame the left side of the ones who say they too are on the moral dilemma Kilimanjaro the moral mountain next to him the case and they're right there looking over saying we've got no part to play it is only the Republicans I call fully\nProtesters chasing people at a restaurant so I think both sides need to calm down which is one reason I think it's it's not very helpful for those who started at both sides can say the other side did both sides need to stop turning the base over to the fringe and the angry mob and actually returned to the better angels of our cells that actually try to get things done\nI agree with I agree right I absolutely agree one hundred percent\nWith all due respect there and I think that everyone has to take responsibility for their own accent than they own their own way in which they respond to the president says that or\nI don't I don't condone anything that's happened to 'em and Collins or Ted Cruz or anyone getting yelled at a restaurant I think that's important but I Do think it's pretty clear when you're talking about the toxic political environment that it didn't start with [laughter] with ... with Donald Trump and twenty fifth penny [laughter]\nNo it didn't we like the people who are politicians somehow\nNever said a bad thing to one another somehow never argued one of them somehow never ginned up their base now Donald Trump doesn't in a way that nobody's ever done it before that I Will concede and the difference though is what has happened since that twenty\nFifteen ... even a little bit earlier than that what has started to happen\nIs the people\nHave access to information instantaneously can put things out there instantaneously can react instantaneously\nAnd they can allow their feelings to flow in their emotions to flow with very little repercussions whatsoever that's a huge thing I mean I don't I I agree\nWe need to definitely talk about the fact that social media plays a massive part in the inundated of information lies BS real stories\nFake stories have throughs uh you know stuff that that that may be true but it's definitely you know pushing the envelope of just trying to get you emotionally to react to something and both sides done it and so what's happened over the last four or five six eight years as\nWe've we've become so tribal as both sides have started to move away from each other the fringes as especially not that you saw that center of the exhaust image or the middle that we are but\nBoth sides have started to move further away from each other and is that it started to do that they've gotten louder and louder and louder and louder and louder\n\nAnd instead of us going I'm a Democrat and Republican let's argue but da da da da da na what it is is I'm a Democrat\nYou're an enemy I'm a Republican you're an enemy that's how things have really started changes we don't look at each other as as you know frenemies if you will we're strictly just enemies\nBright and not go by going ... dog and gone to a nice fight or none of is that it ever since you have to run around and I said was mighty route McVeigh\nIn Atlanta politician other than Donald Trump say I'm so proud or or or or or are given kudos to another politician who body slammed a reporter\nHave you ever heard that from anyone else other than Donald Trump\nListen how she's just breed breed breed what do I always say though don't let Donald Trump live rent free and it doesn't say that but this is what the left wants the left wants to\nBe able to say the things like that they want to be able to say that we're we we're we're above reproach know everybody's got a part to play I've said it over and over again I Want Trump to ... to do to tone it down it's not going to do it he'll probably get louder he's tone deaf in a situation like this he's playing to his audience he's playing to his base he he he's he's going to do\nThat over and over again okay I mean I I I'm an aspiring criticized because it drives me crazy but to act as if he's the only one that's completely disingenuous\nThrows a is a sim film of what's going on in this country of your your blood pressure went over and over right now is my\nOnly down protests have advocated violence or or semi Lauren Hill has not layer\nAnd where the mass shooting in against Republicans last year you have ... Democrats said that Republicans were killing people um both sides are to blame if you're going to say it's just so from what you're going to do is you're going to have fifty percent of the country saying you know what she's not really interested in a solution\nYeah you know I just I just I I Want us to be genuine and say there's plenty of blame to go around but for whatever reason we all want to be able to say\nIt's not my guy it's not my person I get a trophy because it's on you as if and and that is so sad that we live in a world we're celebrating it somebody else that's that's that's caused a problem and I said today you know because he gets I I've been inundated with\nConspiracy theories which by the way if you send them to me I just put them side I don't care they want to hear about it on mute you are on 'cause I I just don't care but somebody said well I just don't want to be blamed for all these kinds of things because I like Trump's policies and I said that's the issue right there is you feel\nThat you're getting blamed for some don't let it worry you just get on with your life who cares this guy's nuts\nThe guy that did this\nHe's got issues he's got real real issues absolutely one hundred percent issues he lives in a van they arrested him and his man and\nAlways wary of everybody with bumper stickers to that extent three two three five three twenty four

week and then a December well your savings last a lifetime so you know on our website we have a um a tab that it's called workshops and events\nGo to our website at financial group dot com click on

question again aid for for two two zero zero nine six pilots are good they started on the phone calls you talk to Eric in Orlando Eric you're on the certified financial group\nThey weren't you're are you doing ed call what's up [noise]\nA solar questionnaires I'm kind of in between the two are age of the traditional RA and you know the raw are a ... and I'm just trying to figure out why would one choose one over the other um so I just don't know which one or two but when I Want to\nSure well do you know anything about either one\n[noise] ah well I think from my understanding them to the wrong areas or after tax free tax that's correct um I just don't know why why would you choose one or the other what sort of choosing one or the other though I don't understand that\nSure well the idea behind the authors that you put the money and you don't get a tax deduction today but the idea is is that somewhere down the road when it comes time to take that money out that you will not be taxed on it will be tax free or continue to grow without being taxed you and you make the withdrawal it's taxed as opposed to\nThe traditional i._r._a. when you put the money and you get an immediate tax deduction when he grows without being taxes what we call tax deferred however when the money comes out somewhere down the road then you pay taxes\nSo you're trading off a tax deduction today for a promise of him in the future [noise] now that's the that's the very basic too I have my own philosophy and I think Denise was of the same mind is that depending on your particular tax bracket you don't necessarily want to give up that tax deduction today\nFor a promise that somewhere down the road that you're off the IRA will be totally tax free you know a ... the rules and our concern is is that somewhere down the\nRoad it is possible it is possible that the tax laws will change\nAnd that all that tax for income that you became related to some of it may be subject to taxes and so what you're doing is you're giving up a tax deduction today with a promise that nobody can guarantee in the future that the tax laws will not change so I'm of the belief the burden the hand tax deduction today is worth more than a promise\nSomewhere ten Fifteen twenty twenty five years down the road that the laws will not have changed so there is a an article that I wrote some time ago for ... you can go to ... dot com or better yet just Google you can Google Ross a wolf in sheep's clothing that's raw ... sheep's clothing\nIt'll talk about the pros and cons of an IRA versus the traditional i._r._a. what's your questions are good when in fact you have not only brought the Irish but you have Ross Perot in case\nYeah we do but there are certain income limits and and and depending on whether or not you participate in a company for all and K ... do you do that\nNow I'm In a actually a four fifty seven\nOkay well the same rules apply okay so um anyway um basically they're our income limits I Believe if you're single\nAnd if you make over Seventy three grand you can't deduct the contribution if you're married filing jointly if you make over a hundred and Twenty one grand you can't deduct the contribution and so forth and then Ross ah there is a certain phase out as well so you got to look at that numbers are for you make a decision also\nOkay so that's a big factor is a is there I Love all your and your tax bracket\nYes yes yes now you might not be able to do with the ... but you may be able to do a Roth IRA race if you can't do the duct will you do the raw simply because you're you can't you can't [laughter]\nGotcha All right well thanks for clearing that up or shut up\nYour lungs and everything I Do\nI like pre shaded uh the call if you want to ... for for two two zero\nZero nine six five eight four for two two zero\nZero nine six five and it could be a question that's simple we get that all the time the difference between Roth Iran traditional i._r._a. because you know when you get on the uh the phone and get on the Internet you get on the radio you get on the TV and near everybody talking about these products but nobody really it takes the time to explain which ones they really are trying to get a good fusing\nAnd the Internet the Internet's a great source of information but it's also a great source of confusion I had a client in the office yesterday um\nWho ah was very near retirement age and he confessed he says he gets on the Internet\nAnd um he here he reads one thing and then he flips a couple more pages and he read something totally contradictory\nAnd he says what do I believe where do I go and that's a challenge you know there's a lot of information out there unless you know how to read this stuff or couldn't read between the lines or understand what it is exactly that they're saying you walk away but they're totally false impression\nWhat are the other risks on the Internet today um are these do it yourself calculators and there's a myriad of them out there that will tell you to plug in this information that information will tell you whether or not you're on track for retirement\nAnd Mrs as good as a mile and these calculations I've seen them be way way way off\nSimply because the they're they're very poorly done or the amount of information that you're asking for\nIs incomplete or you don't understand exactly what it is they're asking for so it's almost like joy going up pulling up the calculator pulling up your computer and trying to get a a um an X ray gun or a CAT scan and I know it's it's impossible so it they're fun to play with but don't bet your financial future\nOn well you you and I disagree Joe I don't think the Internet is a great place to find\nA information I think it's a good place to start in good place to fight it's a great place to find misinformation well there's a lot of misinformation out there is no question about is how I say it's a good place to find information it's a great place to find misinformation and fortunately yes you know there's definitely a more misinformation and there is a information\nLike Abraham Lincoln said you can't believe everything you read on the Internet it's true\nIt's true absolutely he was a wise wise man said for for two two zero zero nine six five eight four for two two zero zero nine six five is the number to dial up today right now
