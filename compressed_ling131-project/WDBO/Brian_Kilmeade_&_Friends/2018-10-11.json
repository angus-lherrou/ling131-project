driverless car\nAnd how that's progressing and as I listen to you like to think outside the bar we think about other industries that are going to an impact\nAnd one of them I guess I'm Wondering how we are as sure it doesn't want to eat because I ... back once your car never made the mistake and never had that what the need for insurance\nWill even more keeping insurers up at night is the idea that cars in the future going to be something we only use per use and we will not owned them\nAnd there's a lot of belief by people who follow the automobile industry and the insurance industry that the insurance industry for autos is going to go into steady decline and that it's not going to happen all in the day\nBut that there will be a gradual reduction\nThe role of auto insurance in any of our lives\nSo you take a combination of cars is we hit a tipping point where the majority of cars will be self driving which is probably about eight to twelve years away based on vehicle replacement cycles\nIs the majority of cars are not going to get an accents anymore unless there's a computer malfunction\nThen their claims last from accidents is going to go way down and\nThe whole role in place of insurance in our lives will be reduced as well\nAnd this is not some kind of pipe dream this is gonna happen please don't tell me you sell auto insurance I have just ruins your day\nOh no not at all I like to consider myself a little bit of ... and I like to answer ... that will be impacted that we may not be anything you know\nAnd the idea of having a vehicle that yours sitting in your driveway or garage or whatever\nThat is so going to fade and the twenties you know not this decade but next decade because do you know how long the average car sits idol\nYeah to be twenty four hours\nOh I Can't imagine most of it I'm sure\nSo the numbers vary depending on whose stating it but generally it's somewhere between Ninety three Ninety seven percent of the time out of each twenty four hours a car is sitting unused on the left\nSo when vehicles become totally autonomous vehicle will come pick you up when you need a ride\nAnd just drop you off and when you need to go back to

John ... who got the story just ten minutes ahead of time\nSays some things have not been answered yet cut eight\nI'm Still trying to figure it out I yes I broke the story but I still don't feel like I Know what actually happened oh why oh I've been told\nNumerous accounts of what happened and why including it was all planned and everything's great and it's a beautiful way around it and maybe that's the case or haven't reporting things I just don't have a high degree of confidence to ... so I thought the actual crows\nYeah same here I don't think there's any big story but I don't think even when we have the small story\nYou know if she said listen I got a senior in high school and I want to spend some time at home she did say has been sixteen years in public service if you think about all my years uh and uh all my years in the state as well as as governor so that's fine that makes sense\nBut uh trying to resign October first nets to stay on I find that interesting bottom line is she's a favorite for twenty twenty four she says I Will campaign for Donald Trump not against Donald Trump Susan Page on special report twenty two\nI think it's it's a gift to Republicans are I mean they were probably Democrats are so energized and so many Democrats were so outraged by Kevin ... justice Kavanaugh's confirmation\nThat they there weren't any very vigorous protests which allows Republicans to describe them as a mob which is seen as a ... at the White House and on the hill [noise]\nUm and it's a I think it's a trap for primary Democrats\nAnd by the way and that leads me to my second\nA talking point and that is uh what will that will all the anger a voice against Brett Kavanaugh due for Republicans it has brought them together Senator Lindsey Graham says I've never seen the Republican Party so galvanize\nAnd it's because they thought were unfair hits and I do I do too and Brett Kavanaugh was talking about how many beers yet in high school and then we're talking about sexual salty doesn't remember that could be cooperated I don't want to go through that again but bottom line is the Republican or Democrat had high interest\nThe Republicans do I hope it benefits and a huge turnout\nAnd Susan Page says right now it's pretty clear that helped Republicans but remember the number one story short time ago was Michael Cohen we're talking about Paul Manafort you know we were talking about the president's approval rating dropping to one poll thirty six percent now it's up to forty one on the rise must be tracking poll it's up to fifty percent\nAnd now we see that he doesn't mind going out everywhere you'll be in Pennsylvania today I Will yesterday and campaigning here was Tucker Tucker said last night with brick cut twenty three\nThere should be a blue wave you know if history is a guide\nAnd if the president's numbers are the main factor but there may not be because when you scream at people in restaurants and block traffic about on the front door of the Supreme Court when you lose you scare normal people Democrats were losing this\nI hundred percent agree\nBut right down here the numbers prior to the cabinet on a verdict where he gets confirmed it goes on the bench\nThere were a total of sixty eight seats that were held by Republicans that are firmly in play rated as lean Republican or worse for the GOP presenting a stark contrast to the Democrats who only have about six that are leading Democrat that normally or a Democrat so if you look at the numbers right now the political was put together there's two hundred and nine seats there is the Democrats camp\nNine shy of what they need but as we saw so many states in twenty sixteen were too close to call and they ended up going Republican from Florida to Wisconsin to Michigan get it\nSo the same thing if they're within striking distance and this thing called momentum happens and there's a fear of voting for Donald Trump's forty so you don't really be honest to a pollster\nAnd that's interesting maybe there are if you're close it might be a lot closer so if you look at the issues that matter fifty percent of the country plus one health care and keep believing that the Democrats are beginning to run on Obamacare for them\nFirst time ever because it's better than what we have now which is we're in between plans nothing and everything and lastly Hillary Clinton listening to her cut thirty\nThere cannot be civil with a political party that wants to try what you stand for what you care about that's why I Believe if we are fortunate enough to win back\nThat Clinton that lady can start a gap\nYou crazy because you lose an election you don't have to be civil that's OK disagreement Ted Cruz cures Nielsen and demonstrate outside Steven Miller's office it's okay to shoot up a baseball practice and almost killed seeps elites and everybody else because you can't be civil because you'll lose elections\nReally I mean I can see a demonstration but they're paying people to stream it other people in elevators in around the buildings in at their house\nAnd Hillary Clinton Seventy plus washed up a loser of two presidential bid to rig the game to win the primaries has that to say oh yeah and that I mentioned she's got a few excuses cut thirty one\nRepublicans have systematically depressed voter probably as many Christie on as\nTwelve million voters were purged by Republicans governments and state between twenty twelve and twenty sixteen [noise] till we know that Democrats have to turn out an even bigger numbers and a lot of congressional district and they can be successful because they're\nBeing pushed back by a headwind that and trying to prevent them or discourage them from ...\nWell I have an idea of a Christina poor I Know she's a legend\nBut how about a follow up question of where the hell did you get that number what do you even talking about twelve million votes have been suppressed by Republicans and Hillary Clinton no wallflower has let that happen\nTo anybody else back that up could you please explain to me how twelve million votes go away the same way the Russians won the election now the Israeli from helped him win an election will Hillary Clinton say well the electoral college is out of date\nThat's how she wins elections making things up this is pathetic [noise] we had to come back and\nTake your calls on

worse for breaking news twenty four hours a day\nAnd you've got a lot of warning and this and ... when you over time you talk about every time that the biggest thing in the history of the world is coming to can't be stopped but it's never been to church get me to be massive\nAnd then when it isn't people get frustrated and that's why people like that that couple of right there rex clerk at his wife and Panama City said hey we're going to stick this thing out and let me tell you some ferocious than is what it's doing there and how it's destroying things is incredible it really\nReally is and I'm sitting here looking at some of these pictures and what's going on and it is it is it is it's got mad at Mother Nature say hey guess what I can do whatever I Want to do it\nSignificant because the debris and parts of building fell ripping off a building and flying through the air so we step inside so obvious reasons\nLiterally flies have a window [noise] you're the alarm going off in the background here\nYeah and and one of the other things though is much like in places like California where they've had to retrofit stuff for earthquake after Andrew rolled through there many of the the cities or you know in Florida itself and many of the cities and the surrounding areas of the pan handle it would not have\nHave bumped themselves up to new standards so you're not going to see the potential damage you could have potentially before but the thing that's interesting is this I've talked to a lot of people ... is is it\nHow much do people care not that anybody wants to see anything happen to anybody but the realities of this is\nWe had one last year and it was big and then all of a sudden you know after Houston and the flooding and then everybody poured out it was used in strong and all these kinds of things and in Florida had theirs and it was oh yeah we're here again in the dead and the by the time it gets the Murray or you know maybe Puerto Rico like\nAnd what\nKind of numb to the whole thing was just like I Will de sensitized to say I I don't have that much sympathy to give there's only so much we can do it it's not like you wait till the end of the year and go okay the storm season's over let's figure out who deserves what and that includes our sympathy and we're watching this and this is snuck\nUp but as I've talked to people across the country\nThey're watching it on TV catch a glimpse maybe read the headline but they're doing it the the you know they don't want anything to happen to people and what would get people's attention is massive tragedy thousands of people lose their lives that's going to get people to really pay attention\nOutside of that it for a lot of other people it's just about another day\nAnd it is crazy what's going on there and the the the massive size and what it's doing to to do some of these areas listen to this this is the wind and the sheer power of this whether they\nYeah they are there's gonna be a lot of damage and that's where the damage to become the houses are going to stay find is the debris that's going to smash into um [noise] that is going to be it just just watching this and how this goes about is going to be a\nCrazy it really really is add those palm trees that that is very interesting the palm trees\nThe strength of them they're they're meant they go all the way down and touch the ground are going to come right back up that the the the strength of the palm trees hence the reason why and places like California on the coast and and and the Florida and elsewhere yeah palm trees but it is massive is ferocious\nAnd rarely used at the wind is the flooding that people need to worry about and as I've talked to people today in Florida ah many listeners out there when I was talking to him and said you know what do you want to tell the rest of the country like something you know will\nBe fine this is this is this is part of being here\nAnd I think that's I think at this point in time for a lot of people that have kind of acceptable that this is what you do you live in California you may have an earthquake or two or three you living in northeast you're living in in you know the northwest you're going to get cold Front's and cold snaps a potential blizzards and you live through the center of the country you're going to get\nYeah tornadoes things of that nature this is just one of those things and I think the thing about America is is how strong are infrastructure is how good it is and how fast that it goes uh uh you know depends on a lot of things I think what we're going to\nFirst and foremost I think will people will rebound very fast here but as I talked about through this I eat one of the things that I think it's going to happen is because\nI think that even though it's going to be nasty and it's horrible for a lot of people and they're losing a lot of the things that rebound fast and the way that things will get up\nThings of that nature I just said Trump's going to be called a racist over and over again\nNot because of this they're just going to go back and go you didn't take care of of Puerto Rico and that's ...\nThat's what's going to come out of this global warming and you didn't take care of Puerto Rico\nBut it is a it is ugly and asked me if you're out there and get tax the program three two three five three twenty four twenty three let us know what's going on with you a again is not the people I think don't care I just think at this point in time where so desensitized were some numb and there was a first mover advantage and last year after not having a almost a decade of no storms\nHouston got the first mover advantage secondhand was ah was Florida and by the time it got to Puerto Rico ... be more like\nThat and this year

the refineries and the way that things are so there's lots of things that play into this it'll come down over the coming weeks and months but today was one of those days were were investors are saying you don't maybe I'm gonna get on the sidelines of the pull my money out there's a reason for that I Want to see what happens with the trade wars\nEspecially when it comes to China they're not really worried obviously with cyclists with Canada and Mexico is calm them a little bit but they're more worried about the foreign investment side of things and how that's going to affect it and then you've got potentially\nHigher oil prices higher gas prices heading into the fourth quarter people displaced maybe not spending the money the way they were there's a lot of things that are that are going to play into this as we were four three two three\nFive three eight twenty four twenty three ... and show is your Twitter push Trump come out today and hammered the fed for for for rights which normally don't do the residents come out but he he went out and and because he understands business\nHe he feels he can do something like this is something that doesn't happen normally but he did and so that's getting a little bit of play here because he's worried about the the cost of short term money so a lot plays into this I Know it's kind of boring at times but when we look towards the midterms the economy is one of the things we're not talking about in fact our our question of the day\nIs what is the big thing\nWhen it comes to the midterms what are you looking at like what's that thing that you're looking at is it health care thirty Sampras anything that's my worry thirty one is immigration twenty fours the blooming dead which we never talk about the debt and we need to talk more about the debt we need to talk about that\nSo there's a lot of things that were not touching on because we've been so you know inundated with Kavanaugh Kavanaugh cabin on the right to left to fight and all this craziness that there are other things out there that need to be discussed and that's going to play big into the midterms and were less than a month away three two three\nFive three eight twenty

I mean this ridiculous ridiculous and they clap and they cheer and he's happy this with Maxine Waters calling on if you see it official Trump official basically get in their face others you see the activists screaming at senators walking the halls all last week\nHillary Clinton remember what you said and I'll play it back\nYou're probably not be ... with a political party that wants to destroy what you stand for what you care about that is why I Believe if we are fortunate enough\nTo win back the house and or the Senate\nThat Clinton was ... he can start a gap [noise]\nDoes Hillary Clinton so if we win back the house and or the Senate then we can be civil but if we lose kicking scream and the attorney general doing the kicking she's doing the screaming or encouraging it so we played this for the press and we paid Eric Holder's remarks the president cut to\nBetter be careful what he's wishing for that I can tell you better be careful what he's we're discussing safe and found a Mac for him to make a statement like that is a very dangerous state but you know they talk about us we are exactly opposite you know the rally is where they send people I I heard somebody yesterday on your show actually talking\nOf my rallies that my rallies that really calm and and well run and and packed with people we don't have problems that arise and I would say this that it wasn't so successful for those protesters but they have to be careful with the rhetoric because it's very dangerous what holder says\nThere's no question and it's not just Eric Holder it's it's all over the place\nAnd the word mob is being used and as if it's being encouraged Maxine Waters used before as I mentioned being on civil that's something that Hillary Clinton brings up what does it mean to be in the big picture Andrew McCarthy or a prosecutor here in New York turned Fox contributor best selling author cut Fifteen\nI just worry that it's not a four week phenomenon you know we can't here and do anything more than than calculate how does this affect what is going to happen on Tuesday night for weeks now\nThis is not a Cheney that could easily put back in the bottle it has an eerie feeling of Nineteen sixties Nineteen seventies radicalism and it's a phase I think we're just getting into the beginning of rather than a you know something that's going to be able to be contained in four weeks and remembers\nThrough the sixties and seventies and eighties Reagan get shot a John Lennon get shot you have a Bobby kennedy got shot JFK get shot or Martin Luther king of course get shot\nGeorge Wallace get shot people across the spectrum getting shot because we don't agree remember Gerald Ford was the early assassinated would that lunatic a gun didn't go off right thankfully he ends up a surviving member he replace a Richard Nixon for a while that's what he's worried about who wouldn't be worried about that\nI mean there's more guns out now and it seems to be more crazy people out now and there seems to be more outlets for with social media for these crazy people to get to the other crazy people\nSuddenly make it seem like it's OK especially when the so called leaders say it's okay listen to just some with Don Lemon Maxine Waters Brooke Baldwin Matt Lewis listen to some of the texture of this conversation on other channels you probably don't listen to cut seven\nTo call people mobs because they are exercising their constitutional right is just beyond the pale we\nCannot allow Donald Trump in anybody else to take protest away from us and to damage to be violent and to try and make us look like him up\nWhen you see people like Ted Cruz getting chased out to restaurants by a mob oh you're not going to use the word totally a mob\nMob what would you use a mob these people a lot of times they're paid this is their job against Christian you'll send again Stephen Miller against Sarah Huckabee Sanders against Ted Cruz\nThat's what these guys are doing and these women are doing they feel it so instead of actually doing something productive you can protest that's fine but that's all you do your screaming people you don't agree with what rights office by the way Ted Cruz now is an eight point lead in Texas\nSo your idol Beto O'Rourke who's got a lot of talent but he's he's wrong on a lot of issues especially with the people at Texas a beginning to sober up\nI find a crazy a next I Want to talk about what's going to be happening today I have great hopes\nThat the president could accept Jim Brown's plan for establishing some type of prison reform because he's worked over Twenty years in prison setting up curriculums for life skills a lot of these men and women are getting printed in have absolutely no a dead the education doesn't suffice it don't\nKnow how to balance a checkbook they don't have any uh they don't have a a sense of self esteem he going in there with the American program\nAnd it's all part of the criminal justice reform you use that along with was already been out there by banned Jones in others and the president has a template for criminal justice reform and I hope something like that comes through today when they meet at lunch I Hope it isn't just hey Jim Brown how much money would you make if you were still playing today\nA instead of hope to make some progress so Kanye West is out and said I support President Trump is not everything I Want but man I could really get along with a lot of things he says\n... somebody you don't know and neither do I nor am I looking to meet was on CNN so when this came out the economy was was going to the White House everyone thought this is hysterical listen to how they describe would Kanye West is cut twenty two\nNow all of a sudden ... because he put out an ad hats\nAnd he's an attention more like the president he's all of a sudden now that the model spoke person he'd he'd the token negro of that of the Trump Administration\nIs ridiculous and no one should be taking Kanye West seriously he clearly has issued he'd already been hospitalized you know I got to trivialize mental health issues but I mean obviously ... has taken a turn in a very strange\nWay okay a couple of things number one yet he like other people some people are um have ADD some people have manic depression or other people are or a bipolar\nAnd they're great people great contributors to Saudi some or all time greats and I think about Mike Wallace who came out and suicide of depression that cater couldn't even get out of bed from times in my in my career and this guy work seven days a week for about sixty years\nI think Mike Wallace was pretty productive I don't think people said he was crazy this other person is on the tip of my tongue Abraham Lincoln he also had depression long bouts of depression\nAnd I don't think there was mood altering medication and there was no Prozac back then but he worked his way through it and I think it became a pretty extraordinary person to have Kanye West to I don't listen to his music that they choose not to I just don't come across it but most people think he's a genius he certainly thinks he's a genius he's been successful for a lotta years\nAnd now all of a sudden he's mentally ill because he has a point of view Kansas Owens who had the chance to meet him and talk to him and they sent a nondisclosure I Believe that he's not going to talk to your not going to talk about what they mean but she is at the gate to me that there's nothing wrong with him a cut twenty three\nWhat they had lost sight waste as it was absolutely despicable I cannot believe that it would be allowed anywhere at work like we've all had a house that's laughable I think it's funny to kind of wants to stand up and say I support Donald Trump terrified that\nThey're going to say what ever they can't afford to make sure that no other black people wake up and understand and it has been a left\nAnd it harms our ... have been Democrat policies have rendered our communities and there and stand we talk about Chicago in Philadelphia and all the major things that they have right now black about having a mass awake all tiny what sort of big part of the reason why I I don't know if it's\nMass I think it could potentially could be there at the very least he African American community if they will unite and combine like unions do a certain way and they become ... was one vote in demand attention or they could do it a much like the span of community has done much like women have done much like the Asian community has done African American should say or in my vote\nI asked the president or on this ... expects to come out of this meeting with Jim Brown and Kanye West cut twenty\nTwo whole comes out of this meeting the friendship is already there the mutual respect is already a parent but was substantive can come out of this meeting\nFor why they're probably saying I have a lot of African American support and a lot has developed over the last little while with county ain't coming out and around has been there for a long time I mean I've known him respected and maybe still truly [noise]\nCan you imagine him playing in the NFL today what it'd be make double double what anyone else has got to he was the greatest and\nHe came out a long time ago for me and it was much less fashionable frankly and now you see the results we have the lowest if you look at the unemployment if you look at any statistical lowest unemployment rate for African Americans in history and history\nI think people can be well thought out and don't
