you know it may be a ... year against racism you're against any of the things that they they I think all human beings should be against the ridiculous ... of bigotry and and stuff like that\nAnd yet at some point in time there had to be some moment where your thought yourself you know I I'm not a this this isn't really really what I jibe with over here on the left they somehow have lost the plot\nRight well they get out but I mean that ... and ... oh yeah that was a little circle of ... will quarter of all I can ... or it because I ... with all of\nFriends were liberals I Lived in New York City which is a very liberal city so it's easy I think for any of us would no matter if you're on the left or the writer or whatever to kind of start you know existing in your own little bubble and that bubble becomes your world and that and your world view as kind of shaped within that bubble so I didn't have a language to understand what was happening I now understand that what I was\nA reacting negatively to was identity politics\nA political correctness and you know the I think oppressive nature of those things you know how it\nForces censorship it forces division it it it it you know it keeps us divided and not United and but I didn't understand it I thought that this was something that was sweeping kind of humanity a large and when I started to hear\nThe the the language changing and I was talking about privilege and victimhood in a high ... patriarchy hierarchy and you know and it was male privilege and gay privilege and I was just like what the hell is happening like\nIt was bothering me so much for so many years that I Would push back against that even as a liberal I was pushing back against is when people would yeah\nI mean it's like zombies people started to just adopt these positions in this language and you know an everyday conversations would become about well you wouldn't understand as a straight white male but I\nJust you know black woman goes out so it's like how do you know how do you know but um it you know it kind of started there but I thought this was something that was happening to everyone it wasn't until later that I discovered this
