[laughter]\nThat's why we watch isn't it or they're really every night every game is something different so a ... weeks are different to go into limbo and have a great first half like they did is pretty impressive afford notice look like they're on top of things like\nThat CJ best there I mean nobody expects much of him he's come in and he's done a terrific job tonight actually played well a nine for twelve a hundred and eighty two yards grandson above Bobby Beth or the great general manager and hall of famer or to touchdown passes\nA he's supposed to be behind Jimmy ... season and Jimmy's out what the ... um\nWhat do you make of what you've seen so far from CJ better\nYeah he looks pretty good tonight he's hitting those hit it a bunch of big place looks really in control out there and it has really made some great throw so uh Aaron is playing spectacular is always on the other side of the ball so they got to put together sixty minutes to beat the Packers at all that's a tough place to play so uh it's going to be a great thing and a half\nAaron Rodgers eleven for twenty two hundred and twenty two yards one touched down or do you notice that him having a problem with his knee is a detectable to you [noise]\nWell I I think when he's in the pocket you don't notice anything I mean he is so spectacular as sitting in the pocket reading defenses and making throws you know his ability to escape make plays on the run you know he just not doing it as much as he's\nMaybe is used as a luxury in the past he can still get out there and do it it seems like when he needs to get out of pocket move but I\nYou know regardless he he's just he's so much fun to watch I mean is the way that he throws the football and the command that he has it often spreading the ball round

seems you know I haven't studied that as much but just\nYou know and seeing these games yeah there's a lot of the fence but always which which\nYou know for strives to go longer\nI mean that's just the way it goes the longer drives you know again it's more points so it's much more of an office of game and it's been um and I just could be this particular seat and who knows and you've got to measure these things over the course of time\nBut this group through six weeks of football it's it's certainly been a lot of points a lot of political off and it's a lot of passing yards you know that

right there at the end I mean it's it's crazy\nFor a hundred and twenty five you're Rogers to touchdowns a quarterback grading of one hundred are rushing numbers not impressive but the receding numbers are a divine the Adams catches one thirty two and two touchdowns\nFired for a hundred and four\nBelt is gambling caught three for a hundred and three that's a pretty good average for him [noise]\nAnd uh for San Francisco tonight that third was affected his quarterback reading was one Fifteen sixteen uh twenty three to forty five\nTwo touchdowns in a pick receiving Goodwin was on fire tonight Markey said for catches a hundred and twenty six yards and two touchdowns yard signs for for thirty seven [noise]\nThe running tonight was affected to most start a curative twelve times or eighty seven yards and breed a candidate for gene for sixty one\nIn Green Bay was down at one point in this game\nOr by by a a a [noise]\nThirty to twenty three and you just didn't know really where they're a compass was pointing and uh they had lost the ball and downs of the San Francisco for\nHim in a three consecutive or two consecutive months by the niners and an interception by king got Green Bay the ball back\nAnd they get to twenty seven yard field goal to beat San Francisco as the gun sounded here ...\nI I told you all night that in games like this against guys like number twelve if you're the quarter back on the other side you can't just play good you got to play great you got to make every throw and CJ battered made a lot of throws tonight and did more than I expected coming in here\nBut he didn't make a couple at the end there was the one that I was talking about the miscommunication where he didn't throw it in you know tried to run and got no yards and then the one there with the blitz zero good when it had his guy beat the under through it it turned out to be the interception that led to the long drive for the score but\nIt's just a different it's a difference between being good great it's the difference between being that next level quarterback is making those throws at critical times one of the guys did that tonight and they went over winter\nTwice Green Bay was signaling for a time out late in the game and\nYou said I mean when we sat there there were no time outs left so they kept looking for a time out but it didn't make any sense they tried one thrilled with about ... seconds remaining in the end zone it was out of the uh out of the reach of the receiver they bring in\nThe goat of last week and as they go to that kind of a derogatory way Mason Crosby who's had a decorated career is the all time factor leading scorer [noise]\nAnd uh as we know last week in Detroit in his four field goals with one of the game they're hitting his PHD is not only in last week that the game before last week so he had really been staggering\nMissing six cats but my goodness was the effect of the night the game with her from twenty seven and also nailed one from fifty one thirty nine and once you know time now select the drive of the game which I think we know\nWe we pretty much know that right it it's a template eighty one yard Dr ... one of those seven led to that game winning field goal and yeah I just want to think back there was some great throws a great place there but let's think back to that sac\nThat the forty niners had on third down and then there was the defense of a pass interference penalty on Richard Sherman that kept that Dr going\nChance right there for the forty niners the difference maker right there on that drive but you give Aaron Rodgers a second chance that's what he's going to do almost every single time\nWe always wore the guy go drive of the game and sometimes we have to search a little bit but tonight it was a

shall\nLive in a bizarre world at time things are becoming more technologically advanced in the schools becoming more expensive and uh we got to figure out what we're going to do joining us now is Danny any who was the uh\nThat was the c._e._o. is it is it mirror sees that what you're the CEO of ...\nIt is we're the I'm proud to be the other\nSyria yes and he's also an author leverage learning his new book how the disruption of education helps lifelong learners and experts was something to teach\nAnd a very interesting book I've been reading it off and on here for since Friday and ah I'm interested because I tell you what man education is vitally important education is ridiculously expensive and I think that's the next big bubble to break your let's talk about this first of all it says right there disruption of education what do you mean by that\nBut when you got something that is super enormous super institutional also super unsustainable\nIt and let's start carrying the scene so that's kind of break pop like a double what happens like a balloon like Paul Newman Polk on or you know a building with a little hole in it the deflate slowly over five ten Fifteen Years\nBut all that's going to happen and education formal education higher education college it serves such an important purpose in our modern society something's got to come in that play some types of disruption that we're talking about\nYeah well I mean I look I I don't know about you but I look at as you I think you can get education anywhere now I think we're in the world where you know we can get education anywhere uh because of the technology and all of that kind of stuff and I look at formal education as expensive\nAnd I don't think everybody needs it uh but I understand why people are doing it you know one of the things you talk a lot about is that you know a critical thinking and it is is a lot in this book and you talk about how critical thinking can meet with creativity\nYeah absolutely so it it comes down to the fact of the bar has risen in terms of what we need education to do for us for most of human history knowledge and information were scarce and so that's what we went to education for it right you go to school for someone could explain things to you didn't already know\nAnd then you know that they didn't explain those things you know how else are you going to get it\nBut today knowledge and information or under their you know Google Search or an Amazon purchase or a lecture series Cleary way\nIt's very easy to get information watch and we're pretty good about you know dig into them permission and just getting ourselves up to a very basic level of knowledge and so now the next step is what can you bring to the table but as you\nSure you can study and learn a little bit about whatever topic it is but what can you bring to the table that other people cats and that's where you don't play comes into the picture and in fact we're to talk to you have an interest section of critical thinking being able to look into what's going on see what's important to it's not important\nThe creativity which comes from this place of curiosity comes from this place of possibility and those are those things that formal education today are just horrible at cultivate and they they do frankly the opposite they teach you to\nDo it you're told to look to someone else who will tell you what is an important what is important and what isn't important and that's just not a recipe for success in the present and certainly in the future\nYou know I look at education or and I just uh it frustrates me because there's so much more we should be doing what we're teaching kids\nIn the old way and preparing them for a literally as far as I'm concerned in an old world when the new world out there we're not teaching for the future and in many ways I think we're teaching for the past and I don't think that sets it up for a massive success\nDozens and what's really interesting to me is that you're going to a lot of people who are saying yes we need to change things we can keep teaching for you know the jobs yesterday you know the the the tropes that's thrown out a lot of hype yeah they're going to the hottest jobs today and exist ten years ago\nAnd that's true but then they say so we really need to train people for the hardest jobs today that are kind of misses the point for two reasons first of all you know say everyone should be trained to be a data scientist yes there are a lot of data scientist that we need right now but you know the whole economy is not a scientist there's you know a lot more\nTo the world than that but also if things are changing as quickly as they are down saying look we're going to build an education of course building anything takes time we're going to build an education on the needs of today that still skating to where the puck is rather than where the puck is going\nAnd the only way we can skate to where the puck is going is recognized that we are not going to know so we can say All right this is a destination that we have to train people to be resourceful and creative adaptable on their own we can say\nThis is the job for the future we're going to teach kids how to do that job we have to say we don't know what job with the future is going to be we have to train them to be resourceful and adaptable and creative and insightful on their own so they can figure it out\nReady and Brian kill me you know me from Fox and friends in the morning and the Fox news channel which you may not know is on the radio

guns back is if you may be off or something\nKing is a revered figure but the MPs is pulling the believers there uh he's really a crackdown on dissidents in the country he says one thing he does another his the President Trump and myself in a bad spot\nHere as Michael Hayden former CIA director touch well\nI'll accept what king sol mindset at face value he didn't know and I frankly wouldn't expect him to know given the the dynamics of how the kingdom is governed right now but it is very hard for me to believe that the crown prince Mohammed bin Salman who is a very controlling personality\nOut would not have known this was going on or put another way I don't think anyone would have attempted this\nHas not had strong belief\nThat the crown prince had their back a couple\nOf days I mean you can people be that tone desk to understand America that little ... to really think the parents off\nWell so this guy is full of himself a you know he's getting all this praise including from me and I've been on the floor defending their actions in Yemen I've been on the floor saying demand good ally when it comes to the war on terror ah they've not been perfect by any means I've been trying to beat back this effort to\nTo to serve our relationship with Saudi Arabia so what does this mean for this NBS\nTo put us in this spot shows contempt for us in our relationship nobody has done more for Saudi Arabia than President Trump nobody has been there on their side more than I have in the Senate except maybe Senator McCain and this is the way you get repaid so\nYou were close so they are going to come back ... going over there right now he's going to come back and they say the Saudis are basically the myth that they did it it was interrogation gone wrong\nSo that is indeed the case and the president said listen I don't want to hurt Raytheon bowling in my other major companies who had these weapons sales last year I heard American industry because these guys kept behaved themselves what do you say\nWell sometimes you have to pay a price for your values\nI'm pretty defense a hawkish kind of guy on on services yeah absolutely I I won't Saudi Arabia to be on our side\nThere's Saudi Arabia then there's the crown prince they're two different things so how do you expect to stick to his children came to my office and Mr ... kits he has three American citizen children they came to my office\nThat said will help they got one one son in Saudi Arabia that I'm worried about how do I engage Saudi Arabia when NBS the de facto leader of the country is this brazen district disrespectful for the international norms that we fight for he is toxic there's no way we can move forward or I don't\nI Would suspend arms sales as long as he's in charge\nCenter let's back up a second you know the he created a lot of enemies when he made some of the changes he locked after roe family into the Ritz Carlton and interrogated and brutally in many respects and some are still in jail or under house arrest right so if you want to up into\nThe pull something off like this and say now you're tagged with this responsibility could this be diabolical plots that may be John Grisham would write\nA you mean the setting up NBS a no because everything about NBS seems to gravitate toward this this is not some guy is trying to change the country and hard liners under cutting\nHe's schizophrenia one minute he's talking about the twenty thirty plan for Saudi Arabia the next minute he's personally involved in stamping out the ... so I think he's on hinged\nHe's thirty three years old if this is the Next Fifty years God help us all it's an important relationship but the values that we possess as Americans are more important than any single relationship\nThis is a test of President Trump did the right thing to saint palm pale I just don't believe that we can ever do business with Saudi Arabia again a ... as long as he's in charge in the U.S while\nThat will be used to be you know whose high fiving Iran\nYeah well let me tell you don't get so excited Iran or we don't break your back\nThe people are going to take back to Iran after we crush the Iranian regime the sanctions so don't misunderstand I Want everybody know to be an ally the United states require certain things you don't murder people in consulates in foreign countries and expect us to clap for you\nAre on we've been tough on will continue to be tough on but this is a challenge the hardest thing to do with is abuse by your friends everybody expects ... act this way in North Korea but Saudi Arabia and we have an alliance is not perfect this is about us Brian is about who we are how we react\nThis is about Saudi Arabia I Hope they will take this moment\nTo deal with this problem in a fashion that will allow the world to engage Saudi Arabia more effectively because right now\nIn the U.S is too toxic in my view to take Saudi Arabia seriously All right and you speak to the president about this yeah absolutely we are taught to pump pay up Sunday\nThe relationship is important Saudi Arabia is not the ground perhaps is bigger than the crown prince but the crown prince

about getting American history and prospective Doris Kearns Goodwin is in Studio and uh she has a a great new book out called leadership into really turbulent times\nOr if there's a better story in the country I just don't know who it is um she draws upon\nA all for ... for instance a particular Abraham Lincoln theatre Roosevelt FDR and LBJ a president you knew about going in right Darcy\nI spent many years with them so many years that I felt like I was waking up with them in the morning and thinking about that when I went to bed at night\nThat's so interesting because uh the way I looked at this book I said did you go from what you know or did you have to go back and dig again\nI definitely have to take again I mean the reason I chose to these four instead of writing about a whole new president was it each time I would leave the guy behind when I went from FDR to Lincoln or Lincoln to teddy I'd feel like I was leaving an old boyfriend behind I felt guilty so I thought what if I keep my four guys but look at them to them\nTens of leadership and I had to learn a lot more where did they are in Beijing come from how did they run for office the first time how did they are and dish and change from South to something larger questions that weren't part of my sprawling biography so and I read a lot of literature from business actually 'cause there's so many leadership literature is because I ended up doing case study of all of them which sort of along the business lines\nSo you said you you read the business to find out about the leadership principles and see if applied to these guys in many\nWays I did I've been lecturing for the last couple of decades to leadership groups in business many times as well as universities\nAnd they write about leadership more than a lot of other people do so I think it's human nature if you're a leader of a huge company than the traits you need to have a a a team that works well too infused purpose in the team to be able to communicate to the team to reach out beyond that popped people on the ... these are all qualities that we need in politics as well\nSo are you going to bring Lincoln he was not born a great leader right\nAbraham Lincoln it's an extraordinary story I mean to think about this young man who only has twelve months of schooling he has to scour the countryside for books and read everything he can lay his hands on but he was born with empathy there was a sense in this little kid even when he saw his friends put hot coals on turtles to make them are eagle he told them that's wrong\nHe came by a drunk and man on a highway one time not highway road\nAnd all of his friends passed by he lifted him up and carry it into a fire and take taking care of him there was something inside that guy that I think was there from the beginning but boy you have to develop\nWho tell me with the with the story you know and can cause corroborate\nHe uh he didn't like his dad was really tough man and his dad used to always son was very wrestler and used to wrestle for money and one time he takes on a I don't know Armstrong's first name was jak yup jak I'm saying so they ended up wrestling and when his father when his father went to finish them off\nWell wanted him to finish it more if you let 'em up and then the mob would after Lincoln and Armstrong was the one who puts them back and said he ... he beat me fair and square that ended up being friends for that is\nThe story that I've heard too and I think the important part of that story too\nIs the father was always resentful of the fact that Abraham Lincoln wanted to read books he thought it was lazy in a physical culture that demand a constant effort to fail the trees and plant the crops he would take the books away from him at times so we had to fight for education against it very father and I think that's where the alienation took place 'cause he wanted to learn so badly\nSo you have somebody to and and knowing a you know you the civil war when people say Lincoln he takes office\nAs tough as as as much as he at empathy he also knew we had to win a war and it would mean tens or hundreds of tens of thousands being dead\nAnd he said he's pushing his generals to fight to the man who didn't want to put a cold in the back of the frog ... had to push generals to have one American shoot another American is that part of leadership doing making the tough decision that may rank who you're a regular your instincts", "year": "2018", "show_name": "Brian Kilmeade & Friends", "city": "Orlando", "day": "16"}
