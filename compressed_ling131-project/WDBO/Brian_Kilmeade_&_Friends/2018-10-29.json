about\nSunday Night Football on Westwood One from the progressive insurance studios I'm Scott Graf pick from a range of coverage options with the name your price tool to find a price that works for you big win for the New Orleans saints tonight in Minnesota they can look back at what happened earlier today and the national football league you know the Kansas City chiefs and dominated the Denver Broncos and vision\nAnd won six straight meetings including one earlier this year on Monday Night football is Denver came to arrowhead stadium today and the cheese just continue to dominate one of the reasons they do that is because they have down their quarterback and if you didn't believe that before now realize he's starting to take his place in history\nMuch as one of the box of the genes radio network that was one of four scores on the day thrown by Patrick more homes and it's for touchdowns in three straight games the only other guys who have done that\nDrew Brees Peyton Manning and Dan Marino one guys in the hall of fame the other two will be in the hall of fame that one for veteran homes that's certainly in this kind of company so early but you also joints Tom Brady another future hall of famer and Peyton Manning is the only players NFL history with\nTwenty five or more touchdown passes in the first eight games of the season the vice career so Kansas City winds today by thirty to twenty three score that now one Nineteen or their last twenty against the AFC West it can't get any better than this right Patrick\nLike we in school more points I thought you know when we get in a way by bigger margin but at the same time I mean this is the NFL I mean every ... every single week and we had a very tough scheduled coming up with a lot of really good teams is a first had the season it for us to\nBe sitting here seven to one and then I Would I Would love to be a no but at the same time I'm happy with where we are and where we're going\nI kid you believe whatever you want to believe the Kansas City and seven and one right now is the team to be at least for the time being in the AFC Denver Broncos won their first two games this year they're now three and five case can interpret two hundred sixty two yards at a couple of touch downs but something else he's done every game this year\nHe's throwing the interception he's the only quarterback in the lead to do that and the Broncos now lead Kansas City at three and five and a lot of trouble in the AFC West speaking of trouble there was plenty of it today for Tampa Bay in Cincinnati specifically for James Winston went in and through for interceptions\nFor interceptions in this ball game had his team in a whole thirty four to six team but there's somebody that can riding in these situations and try to get something done his name is fits magic it's actually fitzpatrick and that's exactly we're Tampa Bay went under cutter went to Brian Fitzpatrick winning eleven for Fifteen for a hundred Ninety four yard\nThrough to touchdown passes including one that got the new within two through the two point conversion attempt to get the game tonight at thirty four but\nAndy Dalton had some time in a couple of time out and he got his team close close enough for potential game winning field goal\nAll right so here's the deal is that if you are missing out on a commando pike has what are you doing I mean come on we have

at a strip club he uh is Native American and he is at a couple of like catering company's\nHe is a he he's just ... this guy has a some you know I mean he's got I think he's got some serious serious issues\nAnd the rhetoric is what we're going to be talking about because now that that everybody can come down now we can get back to doing what we like to do bad which is finding blame and attacking everybody as much as possible everybody\nGot a part to play in the rhetoric not just in the singular thing right like take us out of that is a singular saying that this guy is done remember what happened a Bernie supporters shot up a congressional baseball practice almost killing ...\nBecause\nHe was pissed at the Republicans because Bernie Sanders apparently told them that Republicans were to kill a bunch of people with their health care plan\nSo did I blamed burning that anybody has the bench ... nope nope nope them nobody but Bernie no cars that guy's actions are on his own though that guy's actions are hits but I Do think the rhetoric has gotten out of control and whether it's Bernie or Trump or any or Hillary any of these things no matter what you say you have\nTo take into account nowadays that there is point one percent one percent point one percent when you look how many people are out there though that can add up to a lot of people thousands of people who don't quite understand the craziness\nThat goes on in many ways is kind of like a joke\nThey don't get the the the the they're not in on the jokes that are quite get it and they take it to heart\nI think Trump being the president United States and John Kades ... he's got the he's got the biggest a bully pulpit of all I think he and the born I think he needs to tone it down this is what he said when asked about that but I think\nI don't really do that because you know is really a very big fan of the Republican Party\nNow has the media been unfair [noise]\nSomewhat I mean it was to be real for just for being honest and and I like honesty here have they been has the coverage\nBeen fair no did he get six months or a year now in fairness to them as Trump gone after them giving as good as he gets absolutely\nBut yes there should be some toning down I I and I and I would like to see if I Would like to see the president of the United states who as my president he's your president whether you like it or not\nI didn't vote for me maybe you didn't vote for but I tell you what I Want him to be successful but I also want to delete and at some point in time you've got to be the one that says you know\nI'm gonna take step back and ... and I said somebody look somebody Pocahontas well I think his asinine and stupid you know ... in the office is one thing for his opinion heads the joke around and stuff like that [laughter] or comics\nTo do stuff like that it's one thing it's another thing when you've got the the leader you know of the free world doing some of the things you know I find that to be ridiculous but when it comes to blaming somebody for their actions that\nTo me is where I just like I you know what that got this guy's actions or his own actions\nBlaze [noise]\nTo ask someone from the border of a different party\nOr what happened over the borders\n[noise] I'm just really proud of\nLaws and like I said I\nWould like him to read the room better I Would like him to maybe tone it down a little bit here's what you're going to get the exact opposite from will be louder Trump will be more vocal trouble be in everybody's face because they'll look at it as a one off and I think for all intents and purposes it is a one\nOff but it still is frustrating\nIt really really is frustrating and I think a lot of you out there get I 'cause I've got a lot of people who are sending me text messages and stuff and\nAnd here's the other thing and I'm going to say this to you right now I have no time or want to debate your hopes\nYour conspiracy theories your whacking is of the ... of the world to set this up and this guy's just a student I have no time for that\nThis guy's got problems\nRight if we're going to talk about that he's mentally I Believe he's got serious the van alone says mental problems but if you if you see some of the things is family said about the fact is law sold and roads have destroyed his brain and and that you know he said at one time his family fought the comedy I mean there's all kinds of stuff this guy's got some serious serious issues\nAnd that's that's the reality of this but I have no I have no watch to sit here and play it's all

got no time for it\nRight I don't want to sit here and debate because you want it this guy's like I Hope it's not true that he's a Trump supporter of the guy's a Trump supporter I said when you're looking at it like this is all I Know he's mentally disturbed the key word is mental\nRight disturbed those are the words that's\nWhat this is but somehow\nDemocrats didn't win anything today the

ah they voted early and that is a record eight days into the midterms for the Senate showing promise for the ... some say Trump and company had already given up on the house I totally disagree will look at the trends and final tactics of the president\nAnd the number one I'm not calling you a writer I bet they go their way to think you're right that is right there was a case where a lot of them I Believe that he is on their side and he had to push back hard enough if they so they are what\nThat is Jonathan Weissman can you follow that ridiculous reasoning terrorizing and the shooting first would be bomber's male would be bombs are male to Trump enemies and then at Trump hater kills innocent Jewish Americans as they worship ... since\nOne thing in common Trump is catching the blame\nAnd it's outrageous now I thought\nMaybe analysis would come down eventually where one pundit looking to make some headlines might bring up and say this reflects poorly on the president do you think for a second that Sandy Hook or the south Carolina church shooting shooting or a or Gabby Giffords' shooting reflects badly on President Obama\nThat his president that's his America he's the beacon of inspiration what was he saying that cause these people to shoot people I never thought it I never set it\nAnd I never hurting\nNew worlds new president and\nIt's so easy to just call off verbally and go after the president\nFirst off after the shooting on Saturday with eleven dead as it were shipped in a synagogue in Pittsburgh prison quicker react to cut one\nOf his way could act of mass murder is pure evil [noise] hard to believe\nAnd frankly something that is on imaginable the violent hate filled poison of anti Semitism\nMust be condemned and confront it everywhere and anywhere it appears they must be no tolerance for anti Semitism in America for for any form of religious or racial hatred for prejudice\nOkay so you know what the president's tone he goes right in your face especially if he's head he's critical of the media because Ninety two percent of the media reports on him negatively including a hundred percent of everybody on CNN\nAnd probably Ninety seven percent of everyone on\nMSNBC hits back you don't like that that has nothing to do with this in terms of a synagogue shooting and anti Semitism you know Jared Kushner his son in law who plays a key role in his administration is Jewish\nToo you know his daughter converted and his grandkids are Jewish do know that his best friend in the world is Benjamin Netanyahu and they've been friends for forty years and do you do know administrators to the detriment of\nUh the Palestinian Israeli Middle East cause has been tighter with the Israelis than this president you know that\nHow could you possibly look and say well the president's giving the go side to anti Semitism but that's exactly the conversation on CNN [noise] look at this and try not to grow up your steering wheel so hard if you're driving your fingers bleed cut eight\nCredit took incredible grace for standing where the people of Israel globally was condemned for standing with the people they thrill I'm Johnny Cash I got\nCut I Will try to head he took the arguments over whether the president there with a government in Jerusalem for that one of the Jewish people in the United states in ... so you say are you you're thinking is standing for the people of Israel by moving and no one pocket and then when I was\nLike okay this for a large matters I think it matters that he had grandchildren or Jewish\nOr that his cabinet is half Jewish or is it was at the point that after oak okay we have a new Kenya had Cohen they've got other folks there they haven't been in the White House the guy who you you could call a lot of things the anti Semite hasn't won over the government that is creating a crazy guy who did this\nWas a rally against Trump for being controlled by the British social media posts\nK now listen to John in Weissman respond cutting on\nNot over what President Trump line we're not calling him a rape is we're not calling on it and we don't know what I Am saying is the president has shown a reluctant time and time again to shuttle his supporters and\nFrom the security graphics better\nPolling divide westbound shut down and licked Mary boulevard\nAnd got heavy delays extend the all the way back to state road for

about this supporter was eight to tractor they hated the president and he found a social media website to vent but he had no criminal record prior\nSo that's why the president goes off and I give them credit for continue this rally he tone it down how does rally because you don't want anybody who was a shooting to go ahead and do rail your uh your life your plan I mean if it was some party at the White House and put it off\nBut if it's campaigning for your point of view for a candidate that as an election win why should you let a mass\nMurderer a win so I have no problem with that run germ\nHas you know who's next revolution on the media blaming and you know run German was former you are Israeli ambassador to the United states cut six\nHigh anti Semitism than up again in two thousand six pain has been going on for many centuries of\nAbout twenty five centuries a and President Trump is not responsible for the anti Semitism that has existed really in the United states and an increase fashion over the last couple of decades you know in two thousand fourteen and two thousand Fifteen and I say that only because that was before\nPresident Trump came into office over half of the hate crimes against religious groups or hate crimes against kids a lot of people don't know that and I think you have had an increase in hate in recent years I think that's a product mainly of the rise of social media\nWhere you have a lot of these purveyor of hey they can now go and reach out to other purveyor of hate and spread their poison\nThat tore the president says fake news which I hate that term and their enemy of the people I don't like that term but you know why he says it he says listen if you were supposed to be ... being the voice of the people you're saying things for your point of view not providing the voice of the people the information for the people to learn from\nThat's what he's saying I Wish you wouldn't say fake news I Wish you wouldn't say enemy the people but you know where he's coming from the president does what he wants to do but you understand that frustration legitimate\nSwitch to the midterms eight million people who voted early how impressive is that it's the highest total percentage of our population since Nineteen fourteen were on route to have a presidential if not above a presidential turnout that's great news for the country\nNobody is so frustrated they are not participating they are participating now I totally push\nBack on a guy I think he does a fantastic job John this one who says the president's schedule makes it seem as though that he's given up on the house because he's going to Fort Myers Florida for the Senate race in the governor's race to Columbus, Missouri for the Senate race for Huntington West Virginia for the Senate race kind of surprised me to\nA Bozeman, Montana because he hates Jon Tester and once the Democrat the Republican to win Macon Georgia he's worried about the governorships there in Fort Wayne Indiana\nBecause there's a chance for the Senate seat to flip and Cape Gerard or Missouri so he is actually doing that I Wish he put Michigan on because I think John James deserves some presidential support he's trailing by about seven\nBut I don't agree that he has given up on the house a lot of times presidents are going to these locations where it might be a detriment to show up because it's purple or it's blue got it Tom Bevan real clear politics cut thirty two\nDefinitely this is going to be a we're going to be up late on election I particularly in the house but uh it's going to be a battle and we'll see what happens but then both sides seem very very energized turnout ... you know off the charts because it's going to be exciting\nYeah because a lot of the house races that are going to be interesting even though you look at California go well that's a blue state where's the drama there's a lot of drama because they're on claims that are red and a lot of them
