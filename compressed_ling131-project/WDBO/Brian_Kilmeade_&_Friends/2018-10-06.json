show hollow Michelle [noise]\nHi there Clark thanks so much for taking my call I appreciate it\nAbsolutely Michelle you have a question for me that has come up twice in the last few months and it's obviously somebody it's being pitched right now fairly heavily tell me\nI was just wondering if you have an opinion about whole home search protection\nSo I had the funniest thing recently I asked last time with this question came up\nI later was talking to a guy who's an electrical engineer and I asked him about that and I said hey is this something you think people should do and he said no I haven't done in my own home and I don't recommend that people spend money on and I said but what about the issue if\nIf you know you have all these expensive electronics and homes now and he said well I just have\nThe electrical engineer telling me this he said I have the um surge protectors\nThe really robust ones for each important piece of electronics in my home so instead of doing a whole house he's done the individual ones and I wonder why truly engineer is not\nYou know and they'll be\nAll the only answer you should do but it's really interesting to his reaction was so strong against the idea of doing whole house I I have no specific reason I'd say absolutely do whole house and it's a lot cheaper for you\nTo think of it like zoning 'cause how many expensive electronics to you actually have in your house\nI'd say just about average I was mostly concerned about like the bigger appliances that's what I heard about you know your other than your washer and dryer that kind of thing\nI guess they could blow and a big surge in our house but that's not something that I've ever had somebody bring to the table\nOkay well that's helpful to know\nSo I Can't tell you 'cause you know this is we're stepping up a little bit out of my area will actually a lot out of my core area of expertise which is why when this came up before\nI went to consult someone about it and I are you being pitched by your power provider or by an electrical contractor\nNo no one's really pitching I've just read about it and so I thought I you know try to find out whether this is worth ... worth the investment or it's not something I should worry about that I hadn't heard on anyone's saying about kind of protecting things individually so that's a different approach\nAnd how much is it to have the whole house\nYou haven't gotten a call but my sense is when I looked at were between around maybe two hundred and fifty in four hundred and fifty dollars if you have an electrician do it\nYeah but then you've got the electricians labor to\nWell I think that would include I think that would be I think\nThat we hold the actual or worse than the last caller oh near me with the price so that may be\nWrong I may be wrong then they probably got a quote\nYeah so I that's why I Would check to see what it would cost\nTo just to be able to you so much cheaper to just to the surge protectors protecting your key electronics at least that's what I've done in my own house you're listening to the Clark Howard show [noise]\n[noise] maybe six point five day be with him or lead to buy new sound windows to loosen up 'cause we agreed station\nThis messages for all of you sitting in the passenger seat and apologies if it gets a little uncomfortable but how does it feel to be at the mercy of someone who thinks a random tax to more important than your life someone who takes their eyes off the road was speeding along in a three time hunk of steel\nFreaky right well why not just ask them to

Ninety nine\nWith that comes in investigation and with them comes some outrage believe it or not Democrats should the surprise of few perhaps our outrage or about the investigation some even using expletives to describe it which I find unbelievable\nUh they do not like this investigation wasn't thorough enough you've Chris Coons who I always thought it was a moderate and rational says it was a not thorough enough they wish they had more time more time can you believe that the one that's most interesting Senator Joe Manchin he says they have to go to a separate room to look at all the information\nSo he says he's got to go back today to finish it off\nHere's Joe Manchin being harassed cut forty\n\nSo look me in the rye I rehearse line he was well here in the number two why would she tell you how you got to vote and what makes you think that every woman that stands up and says I've been sexually assaulted deserves\nTo be looked at his innocence there is somebody other side who says they're innocent\nSo because he looked at this thing with a fresh set of eyes in every situation\nOr a sober lead by looking at everybody's background it doesn't mean because you're a woman say no sexually assaulted that you're a hundred percent right we saw what happened with Virginia and the Rolling Stone story and the woman that Clinton that she was raped we know what happened to the Duke lacrosse case these are just high profile cases there\nWere flat out fictitious in almost ruin lives for no reason for Senator Chuck Grassley he has had enough he is chair I think he's been phenomenal\nHe's chairman of the Judiciary Committee and he says it today is a date to vote and what is the schedule\nReal simple if they're going to convene in twenty minutes\nThey're going to get together that's when this whole thing is about to start\nThen at ten thirty they'll start to vote and then they'll they'll get the votes in theory according to Republicans deaf culture ... suit which would set up a vote tomorrow for passage of Brett Kavanaugh now if Susan Collins and Murkowski if ah if flake\nAnd mention all decided no it's done they can lose one\nThat's all they can lose is just one vote here was Lindsey Graham cut to\nTo those who says yes the problem like this as evidence of that factor [noise] senators and requests background check out what their [noise]\nAnd listen if you want to read what how they feel here's what Susan Collins sent did yesterday she spent over an hour and a half looking at all this paperwork and she emerged undecided according to reports but does feel as though was Thoreau a Jeff Flake had positive to things says there's no corroborating\nEvidence that's what he wanted to make sure of keep in mind Jeff Flake profiles as a conservative\nHe's a conservative like George Will who hates Donald Trump he's a conservative like Ben Sasse who doesn't like Donald Trump Donald Trump for the most part has kept a low profile because he's not the issue and Brett Kavanaugh is more of a traditional Republican but then Donald Trump in fact there were many people if you remember\nWho were upset that he got nominated 'cause they got to traditional it's too easy well did they just wanted\nOn the court without without catching that wouldn't cause many waves that white George Bush to the person the United states former forty three was working the phones that's why I call robot company that's why you see people that know what like Dana Perino with Congolese\nRice go out and see I Know him quake guy you're not seen Donald Trump and um you know ... ... ... and people from the Trump era they associate Donald Trump pushing them because they just got to know him\nHe was on the federalist will screened multiple times\nHere's one Murkowski said there would be helpful for me in kind if there was a list of those interviewed we were not done we were not done in there so mccaskey wanted more time gets a hundred people got to go to one location and read\nThey have staffers reading to them but not many so mccaskey is going back this morning is as presumably is there or as just left\nTo go back now if you want to read the tea leaves mccaskey was meeting with women's groups all afternoon [noise]\nThey've got they should you know it's it's it's a split your representing your city excuse me representing your state but at the same time you representing your beliefs and if you're looking at the guy's judicial record I think he had fifty two votes maybe more\nBut now with these allegations from high school and college it's making everyone reconsider I Do think the Democrats totally clear overplay their hand as a report this morning\nThat there's been pressure on Kaiser she is one of the uh people\nAre put forward and was interviewed her name is we're in Kaiser old friend affords who was allegedly at the party she keeps saying I don't remember being at the party she never mentioned to me sexual assault\nThere's been pressure on Kaiser according to her well amongst Democrats to change her story she says I'm not that we Grassley picked up reportedly when I talk to him today he was on we with me on Fox and friends about an hour ago\nSo Grassley said we got some of that I Can't give out details in the report\nBut I Want to see everything that you were going to give to the FBI because the FBI did not interviewed Dr Ford says they need to watch the hours of testimony it's under oath presumably you didn't why you're not going to change the story he I can remember something magically in an hour but we would like to see\nYour um your therapist notes and they like to see some of the polygraph test it may be some receipts to find out who is paying for all this that will be nice\nBut along the way there's carnage people like Brett Kavanaugh up no longer can teach at Harvard because the students were protesting he'd be a distraction\nNow people like are they used to room with them about twenty they used to be in his dorm they have signed a petition that Brett Kavanaugh they know drank a lot so in college so he should not be on the bench and former Supreme Court justice liberal guy John Paul Stevens he has now changed his mind cutting done\nAt that time [noise] yeah I thought he had to lay the qualifications for to sit on the Supreme Court and it'd be confirmed if it\nWas ever selected but I've I've changed my views for for reasons that have no really no relationship to his ah intellectual ability or is the record as a federal judge here's the thing that\nThe judge and they could have been for ... so ... but I think that his performance during the hearings cause me to change my mind\nNo it didn't use thirty hours because you should worry about the three hundred plus decisions which you should focus on an between someone's life has been bitterly destroyed he's been made to drunk or somebody who a date rapes people ah guys group sex or spikes punch puts quite losing to punch bowls\nA look at what has been done to him sexually assault drunken yo drunken mess in college so he has that need defends himself he actually wrote an editorial the wall Street Journal said I looked at my testimony maybe you got to emotional but I was representing my daughter's my parents and my wife when I was out there\nSo it was called being a human being and if that liberal the Supreme Court justice Saudi was qualified he still qualify now dance scene or weight and and just said hey guys\nJust get this in perspective Brett Kavanaugh made a statement this is a widespread conspiracy to take him down personally and professionally it's not the first time you've you think he's going to be biased on the court then you should worry about who's already on the court and already said in their statements that they're biased cut Seventeen\nAnd sixteen and you had ... theater Ginsburg interview with the New York times openly campaigning against Donald Trump and saying she was moved to New Zealand were elected I mean at times [noise]\nYou know you Supreme Court justices or human and sometimes they say things that are inappropriate or political Aaron temperate I just think given all that was going on in this world footprint Brett Kavanaugh was not as qualified and that's why I say go get them for\nThat and but as much as dance scene or thinks that it's really down to people he hasn't spoken to nor by Senator Murkowski senator Collins Senator Jeff flake\nThere's a report on hot air uh from somebody that said uh from one of the reporters who said they talked to a Jeff ... senator Coons and it looks like Jeff Flake yesterday afternoon said I Want to speak to you why would you have to speak to Coontz Coons has already said I'm not voting\nA Jeff Flake make up your own mind you just saw the investigation that you called for this is a conservative judge who actually apologize in is a well Street Journal editorial that he got to emotional but it will not factor in his decisions\nOr we're going to come back and take your calls I see out there and serious as the out there in in Orlando I see out there in Texas and I see coming through a in St Louis one eight six six four oh eight seven

to my my friend Bob which held down as both\nA and by the way Senator Graham it's just about had it and that was Bob Menendez who's you know all about a ... because his corruption investigation or you'll get a hung jury he was not exonerated\nAnd then he was reprimanded on the Senate poor how humiliating centered and by the way he is now in a tougher fight in thought in the very blue state of

that\nYou'll be resolved so the outcome that they wanted that they have pre determined they were going to say that it was a way that the investigation and you heard senator Menendez a terminology\nSo we had Senator Grassley on boxing print an hour ago the chairman of the Judiciary Committee who happened to be on the stand up or just going through Brett Kavanaugh's credentials he also said this

I talked to several people and I'm sure somebody you guys have out there too\nI'm all for protesting I got no problem with it but sometimes I think you get to the point where you go over a line of of\nHysteria ... you allow yourself to be pushed over where you start to lose a lot of people out there that were like you know I I'm fine with the protesting but I'm starting to feel like this is this this you've lost a plot here\nWhat last Twain groups and their democratic allies are down to judge Kavanaugh\nIs nothing short\nOf monstrous\nGrassley there and I and I think at times it has been ugly and it has been wrong and it was and I think what happened to\nBoise Ford has been ridiculous I think this entire situation and how it got out in the whole thing that's happened here it's it's ugly and this is not one of those things we look back and go there there was a proud moment for us it's not\nIt just makes the Clarence Thomas hearings looked like nothing\nAnd this is this is an ugly ugly ugly situation and ah I I look at this and think man [noise] we we we we have a lot of uh\nIf you own a gun you have a full time responsibility\nWhen you weren't using it sure can tune into the hands of curious children\nOr anyone else might misuse\nMore information on firearms storage safety presidency PC business in ... by the national crime prevention council bureau of justice system\nIs news Ninety six point by your baby turns first for breaking news\nWith senator from Alaska will not vote on Brett Kavanaugh's confirmation Saturday Lisa Murkowski told her colleagues that you would like the Senate ... president to record her as president so senators the Danes a fellow Republican will not have to fly back from Montana and leave his daughter's wedding it'd be a tie breaking vote\nIt will not change the outcome\nBut I Do hope that it reminds us\nThat we can take very small\nVery small that\nCan be ... with one another\nSenator Susan Collins not only dashed hopes of Democrats by voting to confirmed judge Kavanaugh to the Supreme Court she heap praise on Capitol for being a man to look up\nTo he has been an exemplary public surfing jazz teacher house has been and fat\nSo as it stands it looks like capital will be confirmed after the boats are tallied Saturday taught anti BC news\nSeventy percent off that right court furniture parents and our captain Seventy percent off new retail and she was from a wide variety of previously means furniture Andy calling for your home or on a cell phone from one Ninety nine Ninety nine bedrooms from three Ninety nine Ninety nine\nDining from two Ninety nine Ninety nine Anwar all items are hard to find guaranteed stock for delivery aren't you have to make the smart choice and then it went about five locations in the DMZ Oregon line at the heart clearance furniture dot com mentioned radio twenty twenty percent off\nSally did he knew all in one hair color kiss and make it easy killing your hair and home\nEverything in his column for the ... you know\nNone of my professional open to everyone Sally beauty [noise]\n[noise] I'm Clark Howard the guy helping you keep more of the money you make and this is where our land though turns first for breaking news weather and traffic news Ninety six five WTO\nWhat the white puffy tiring auto service\nOvernight there tomorrow morning weather looks quiet Seventy three degrees and after a ... start to your Saturday a slight chance for a passing sprinkle or shower midair afternoon at a high of Ninety\nFirst Sunday another day at Ninety Iran chant that thirty percent if he were scattered passing showers possible from channel anyway this news and meteorologists toward\nSecurity triple ... with no accidents to report we do have a surface wrote crashed colonial and ... it's a slow down in downtown in orange between Robin in church triple the traffic ...

time and punk rock in life\nAnd show\nIs happening out there in the world with cabin uh you still have to go to work on Monday regardless of what happens this weekend and the good news is\nYou're heading back to work on Monday and an economy that seems to be still somewhat white hot joining us now from ... dot com is more cameras into September numbers and you look at say the you know where it was just Nineteen sixty nine in the last time we were here market this kind of level this is insane right\nThe Beatles were together when we saw that left and so yeah it's quite remarkable the unemployment rate down to three point seven percent now some point people are pointing out which is not\nA a philosophical a plane but rather a factual one that they're that was the time of the Vietnam War and a lot of prime working age males were not in the workforce then so that\nProbably is a different picture but nevertheless so the stats are the stats and so yeah it's worth celebrating the job market remains this robust at this point\nWhich is which is crazy so let's talk about the jobs are now you know\nSo we're what three point seven percent and I always look at this like what's the ... what do you think the real job numbers are because you know when they say they're at five I usually say they're probably it's more like seven or eight percent because we have that wacky thing where if you're not looking for a job and you're no longer getting unemployment you don't count what do you think the real numbers are\nWell real is you know various\nFrom different people's point of view I mean they're all real and the sense that they have definitions on the definitions apply to\nYou know metrics or are there is another number or the or the Labor Department captures which basically takes him to affect some of that what you're referring to and and that number actually rose a bit here to seven and a half percent but\nWherever those numbers are and we know there are a lot of people who have given up looking for work and there are people who basically don't qualify for either because of their\nHealth situation or some of that is opioid addiction but also the fact that they've been out of the labor force for a long time and their skills aren't as relevant as they used to be\nWe still have to measure the other part too and and ah you know I'm the first one to say well you know there's probably other people raising their hands too but you know I grew up in the mid west [noise]\nAnd uh the town where I hail from in Kansas has the highest unemployment rate in the state and the highest rate of opioid mortality my mom and dad a war from West Virginia we know what the story is there and my wife is from upstate New York Niagara Falls New York which looks like\nYou know a bomb in it so there are plenty areas that country that are are not faring well\nBut still a there are there other areas like where I sit here in the middle of Washington DC and the other large cities across the country particularly those on either coast that are doing remarkably well so all these things fit together but they aren't elegantly fitting together that's for sure\nTalking to my camera ... dot com let's look at these numbers uh who did well and a ... and where do you see these job numbers heading as we head into the fourth quarter and spending and all of this stuff because\nThis is going to be vitally important as as we had there because a lot of people look at the fourth quarter as maybe the most important because we have Christmas shopping and spending\nWe think well in the year on a high note to the extent that are now it looks like growth for all twenty Eighteen will be three percent and that's breaking up above the long term trend which has been more along the lines at one point eight to two\nSo uh that's one thing though whether we can get past twenty twenty uh when the benefits of the tax cut\nBasically go away and still have a higher growth rate that is something will only know them but in terms of ending the year I think there's every reason to believe that we're gonna continue on this same fashion uh the job market continues to add about two hundred thousand jobs a month we only need to add one hundred thousand\nTo absorb the growth and the\nPopulation and so every time we get a centrally twice that we're continuing to winnow away at the remaining so called slack in the workforce so\nI think there's every reason to be optimistic about basically those short and intermediate terms\nSo I look at this and and I look at all of this across the board and I say to myself this looks this looks good this looks strong and then we get to the political side of things and I want you to listen to to what Don Lemon said the other night\nFrom to tread very carefully here because when it comes to the economy Trump got a lot of health inherited a growing economy a growing economy inherited it\nFrom his predecessor jobs are being created at roughly the same average rate as under President Obama wages are growing at about the same rate they did\nUnder President Obama\nThe left is never going to get Trump credit and when I was listening to this the first thing that came to my mind is Michael Jordan had other coaches before Phil Jackson as did Kobe and Shaq but they never want any championships till he showed up\nA Trump you know the left is never going to give them credit but the reality is is\nYou know when is it going to be is economy and and it has to help the economy because I think he absolutely has to help the economy not only from a point of how I think he's taken some of the shackles off and let it grow but I've also thing he's not the economy on the confidence level which rarely gets talked about\nAnd

A. L. A. R. D. mallard\nDuck here but it's mallard roofs systems there uh\nUse our name and ah they're the only company that we use when ... when we clean roofs and the same company that manufactures will call they use the same solutions that are approved\nBy uh the roof a manufacturer so they're going to protect your home do a good job they're a very fair on their price than a they do a good job mallard systems a\nIs are you planning to do it yourself or were you looking to hire someone Julia\n... I didn't know if it was something we could do ourselves it's kind of where the um groove comes together the water runs down it's a little the\nYeah it's not bad but it's just you know the holidays are so dire need in your area as I said and I only get\nBetter you know you would not use that no so the idea of using somebody that knows what to do\nAnd and roofs are dangerous you know uh so it it may cost you a few hundred dollars to have the entire roof to a cleaned\nBut well worth it and you're going to get a five year warranty from mallard or two at the same time so uh if she comes back in less time they're going to come on cleaning for free\nThey're not you know they're ... they're insured if they fall off your roofer they you know they're protected that's not going to happen that's what I Do enjoy\nYour show much\nBe up and I will do not use erotica\nThat do that [laughter] they were coming up on the end of the show and we really appreciate you tune into the in the house radio show

roofing contracting thanks for your business\nGlove you so much [noise] the uh God Bless [noise]\n\nThis is news Ninety six point by your baby turns first for breaking news twenty four hours a day\nDon o'clock news on one side of the be all want you to new tropical disturbance developed would've beans Ross I'll tell you coming up for so our top story the president about to celebrate a major success\nBut the point of his second Supreme Court justice after a difficult confirmation battle\nI'm Jamie do pre in Washington frustrated that the outcome of this confirmation fight\nWe had before as the nominee who's been deceptive and misleading Democrats\nThe proceeds are federalized it's really not going to be a staple investment type of thing because what are these people are dealing with the money that they're making from that said there's too many road blocks to you know long term success in this market right now but it is certainly an emerging market\nYeah it's one of those things that I I think is is the next people are always looking for the next big we're there to get rich quick kind of thing and it it almost reminds you of the dot com bubble from Ninety nine two thousand where anything with dot com and people were snapping up and and putting money into it and just hoping to try and make some my pets dot com or\nI I actually have it on my own personal stories so when I was in college\nIt during the dot com ... craze I purchased a stock it was called accelerated dot com and I got I think I'm trying to remember had vested six hundred dollars and I got ten shares it's sixty dollars a piece of six hundred dollar investment within six months it was worth Fifteen thousand dollars [noise] Fifteen thousand dollars so you can do the rate of\n... level as ... you know I still on it today in today's where nothing so I learned the hard way how about ... again this was before I knew any better than it is I learned the hard way about\nTrying to first of all getting greedy and jumping on to something that is some this is a craze because at that time anything with dot com and it was just going up astronomically and then everything if you're the last one holding the bag and and I was one of the ones that were the loser so\nThere seems a lot of people were investing money in companies that didn't exactly have a business model or a profit margin yeah he kept going up in up enough to melt\nAnd that's one and that's one of the things about about the ... craze right now is it they're really not making any money this one particular stock which I won't give the name though when it hit its high it was released this year it hit its high was bigger than a Clorox in General Mills market cap wise ...\nIt has no profits but its market cap was bigger than Clorox or General Mills which everyone does that mean they make consumer products that people use all the time huge profits and those companies jail this stock has no profits but its market cap was bigger than those companies and that's the kind of euphoria that we're seeing in this type of stuff\nIn it anytime there's that much speculation is probably better to just sit on the sidelines or or if you just have a few six hundred dollars to throw it\nSome yeah and again if you have to be prepared to lose whatever you might be wanting to put into that arena\nSuper high risk super high risk high reward but more risk than I'm limited\nThey especially his even though it's legalized ... going to be heavy regulate it you know and you know knows how one\nAgain you know they have to federal ... for that dollar\nSettlement and the funny thing is is they're all companies so just like any company it needs to be well run mhm it needs to it needs to make more than it than it's spending it's it's right now it's just euphoria and craze on on future prospects and it's just something I personally I Would stay away from [noise] no [noise]\nSo the question aid for for two two zero zero nine six five it's a for for two two zero zero nine six five for the calendars turned to October and his October sixth and uh [noise]\nI tell you what we moved into fourth quarter so uh you know one of the things I like to talk about with certified financial group and then this is just having a personal conversation on the air with them\nYou know one of those ... final year end checklists we should be thinking about she'll be looking at our four one K. and get ready if there's anything we can add to it if we're made it a little bit more money so far this year or or uh is is now the time to prepare for twenty Nineteen\nOr rebalancing right now is key mhm yeah we we've had um\nIt it's been an interesting year for the market's a lot of the equity markets are really had not turned into positive ground until a mid June of this year\nI'm at but there's been a lot of good economic news and it's important to remember what your risk tolerance is and not be afraid to take profits off the table and for example what you just said about that six hundred dollars you invest\nSelling gains and re allocating your portfolio around you mix is not a bad thing that's one way to to hang onto a the gains that have attained so it's important\nUh to rebalance and then re assess your risk and as you had mentioned if you have not maxed out your pre tax contributions see what you could do over the next couple of months to maybe increase what you're contributing and take advantage of that tax break\nYou know this is the time of the year that if you don't or don't have a retirement plan so if you're thinking about opening up an IRA you got to do that before the end of the er before you file your taxes also sick about setting up solar four one K. plans for yourself if you're self employed and you think you're going to have a lot of money coming in this year profit\nYou know where the soccer with some of that money and not have to pay taxes on it or to further taxes on it\nI'm set fire is again if you're self employed there's lots of different strategies right now think about ways to be putting away money 'cause a lot of those tax deductions that people used to get a going away because of the standard deduction going up\nYou're not going to be able to take those tax deductions that you used to be able to get know directly or taxes should be lower but if you were planning on taking a tax deduction for your mortgage interest or your charitable giving or any of those things are you're probably not going to do that anymore just because of how big the destruction is\nAnd along those lines planning is a huge part of what we do and I had a client's this week asked me to run the scenario of what if they converted therefore line case to Ross for our white case\nSo it was a matter of rerunning plans for them and with like a full conversion and paying taxes on everything that they would convert and it was interesting to look at what happened to the nest egg\nYou know in the current years and then as it as time went on because they would ... it has to pay taxes therefore the amount that they can for would be less\nAssuming that they're taking the taxes from the four oh one K. dollars it they're converting so the time value of money they had a smaller pot working for that length of period of time and it ended up making a two to three hundred thousand dollar difference in the long run year after year after year\nNow whether or not they want to bite the bullet and pay the taxes has not been determined yet but that's an interesting thing to look at at this time as you're getting prepared for what your potential tax pictures going to be next year under the new tax\nLaw you know this really interesting time would come tax time because a lot of Seattle's same rule more rules are completely different you can't copy and paste which did last no not at all not at all so I mean those those are the types of things come the end of the year you need to be looking at a trying to figure out ways the soccer away or save more money to for taxes like Nancy said reevaluating risk\nPossibly doing some rebalancing and again if you have a four one K. at work and you haven't been contributing and they match tried figuring out ways of sock money into that so that you can get that fool employer match where we did a four one K. enrollment this this week for a new employer just brought 'em on line and and everybody that was there was trying to figure out how to maximize\nTheir five percent contribution so that they could get their four percent match by the end of the year six payrolls\nThere trying to figure out how to suck that money I mean that's the kind of conversations\nOr thoughts that you need to be having um especially if you're not contributing your four one K. and the poor to do some sort of matching you know you're leaving free money what table for those people with an eighty percent return on their money just by putting them that five percent\nSay when a lot of people don't realize is you're either sending them money to the federal government or you send it gets your own retirement account you're not taking new dollars out of your pocket it's either going to taxes because you're not say man where it's going into your own right four one K. bucket for\n... for for two two zero zero nine six five that said for for two two zero zero nine six
