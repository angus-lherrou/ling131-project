on the Clark Howard show Hi how are you today that's how you doing a great thank you\nYou want to talk about how good or bad an idea is to pay all your bills by credit card is that right\nYeah ... to ... and I'm thinking maybe I could pay all my bills off and then every week you know pay a large amount of credit card when I get paid\nSo beer say if you pay credit card balances and fall is a great idea\nBecause with the fights going on among the banks for market share with credit cards there are so many reward cars out there every single bill that I can pay by credit card I pay by credit card and then get the rewards for having done so\nSo I think it's a great idea as long as you've never run a balance on the cards\nWhat do you mean I'm like hey it all before the end of the month\nWe'll just when the bell come so that you're never paying interest\n'cause you know credit cards all operate based on people who pay balances for called behind our backs by the banks deadbeats because we're getting free ride on the credit cards money\nAnd right now not only are they giving us the grace period where we can pay our bills\nIn full you know they give us the typically three weeks to pay our bills and fall but then they're rewarding us with cash back or free gasoline or free hotel stays or free travel or whatever it is\nAnd it's a deal for people who pay in full\nOkay I guess listening to

building was cleared out because one package was found was addressed to John Brennan who's even work there\nHe said this there was a total and complete lack of understanding of the White House about the seriousness of their continued attacks in the media the president especially the White House press secretary should understand their words matter does for the show no comprehension of that is that fair [noise]\nWell I think the general critique is fair I mean it he said something that's similar to what I said I don't think the United states should be even if he's joking which I think\nMany of his defenders would suggest yet I don't think the press the United states should be even joking about political violence or or supporting political violence but there is a leap year that that Jeff Zucker is making I think which is to tie the president's words to these specific\nEvents we just don't know enough about what's happened here how may be the case that will learn that that somebody was somebody who's you know crazy was\nCut the president literally and then decided to act on it but we don't know that yet and I think it's you're responsible speculate that way as well\n[noise] uh I Want you to hear what the president said last night a cut for\nAny acts joy threats of political violence aren't attack on our democracy is\n[noise] no nation can succeed that tolerates violence or the threat of violence as a method of political intimidation go words you're in Oregon from we all know that\nBut then he went on to blame the media cutting\nAs part of a larger national effort to bridge or divides and bring people together the media also has a responsibility to set\nA civil town to stop the endless hostility and constant negative and oftentimes false attacks and stores have to do\nSo um the that's the balance he struck last night and anyone to try to get Governor Walker another four years as ... as governor\n[noise] yet\nLook I think more of the former from the president it'd be it'd be\nGood for the president to continue to save the kinds of things that he said where he is a decried political violence and and warned against that I Will say as somebody who's been critical of them in the past so the kinds of things that he said it is ironic to have Donald Trump lecturing people about civility suddenly I mean this is somebody who\nI think rose to the Republican nomination in part because\nPeople were eager for the kinds of Republican primary voters park where eager for the kinds of confrontational sunny times uncivil politics that he brought out was\nPart of why he succeeded so it is ironic for him to be saying to everybody let's be civil but I'd much rather have and be saying that then saying the other or joking about beating up journalist\nIs I mean you don't think that he would ever said himself I Hope some of my supporters of go put package bombs to all my detractors I mean that just had to yeah\nSteve I got I got to do so in in the other thing is uh you have a Bernie Sanders supporter literally get a rifle and start trying to kill Republicans\nAnd he shoots in ... almost dies at second base there and very few people are saying well that Bernie Sanders hit the wrong tone\nRight hand and look I mean I don't think Sanders has has said\nThe kind of um inflammatory things that other politicians have said\nSuggesting that his followers are inside political violence but remember after that\nShooting the Washington Post read an article that suggests\nThat it was right wing talk radio that was responsible for the environment that was sad I mean is there is a certain sense in which the mainstream media goes to its old sort of script and an always wants to blame everything on conservatives in conservative talk radio and conservative\nMedia whether it's true or not it never the New York times just not long ago repeated the ... the false claims\nThat the shooting of Gabby Giffords was inspired by a by Sarah Palin and her uh her targeting um so yeah there's there's sort of major um tendency\nBy some in the mainstream media to to immediately blame right wing talk shows and and what have you and it's not healthy either I mean but part of the broader\nSaudi Arabia this was a top story a this show he killing a democracy so he gets killed inside an embassy we all have everything we understand that\nGina Haspel the CIA director heard the audio tape and it was really compelling and horrifying and it seems as though we have almost all the pieces to put together and finally the Saudis one from he died in a fist fight to it seemed to be a premeditated murder where are we going with this Steve\nIt's hugely problematic I mean obviously the the the Saudi story has evolved I mean initially they said no we don't even know where he is we don't know what happened to him he left you know their\nTheir story has changed in every particular that it could possibly have changed\nSo their courage story I think has virtually no credibility whatsoever and I mean the Turks are playing a a dangerous game here I think by\nSpring dribbling out these leaks into jazz thing that they have this information that um that makes clear exactly what happened but not actually allowing the public to see that information when air to one gave his speech the other day uh once again\nBlaming the Saudis or what happened I think there was an expectation that he was going to provide some some real supporting evidence\nAnd he failed to do so and it's unclear exactly at this point why he failed to do so but I think would be helpful if we had those original\nRecordings um that that apparently exist that Gina Haspel listen to [noise] so we have a better sense of exactly what happened but this is a huge problem for the United states is a huge problem for President Trump I'd a delicate dance to be done on the diplomatic\nFront here is Mohammed been so long the crown prince with all the power finally commenting yesterday cut forty nine\nThey a crime was really painful to all the Saudis ah and I believe it is a painful to have a human in the world is ... is a crime that cannot be justified\nSo I don't know where they're going from here but we do not want to break relations with them but there has to be some retribution people like Rand Paul want to use it as an opportunity to say we never should be in the middle east to begin with but with that but let's be practical Steve the was the option\nWell look I mean Rand Paul's very exercised about the Saudis but he's not nearly as exercised about flattery of who who does this thing's routinely he's a he's currently trying to get both ... push better relations with Vladimir Putin's Russia now in Congress so he's a bit of a hypocrite I'm that's\nWhat I think there has to be a tough response from the United states that we have to make very clear that this is unacceptable you can't have this way\nA as a as a an ally the United states particularly as it relates to somebody who was living in the United states with a columnist for the Washington Post had residents here\nUm it's totally unacceptable you need to make that clear the the the balance I think that the\nDifficult balance there is all of the attention on what's happened\nHere and on the Saudis ah gives sort of a reprieve to the Iranian regime which I think the Trump Administration has done a very effective job of pressuring of sanctioning new sanctions\nSet to kick in on November fourth I'm the administration is considering a some additional banking restrictions on the Iranians it's very important to keep up that pressure and the weaker that the Saudis are a as a result of\nThe punishment that I think we have to ah to meet out here\nThat the more that less Iran gives Iran a stronger\nHand in the region right and Leslie the midterms are but we talk a few months ago it looked kind of grim for Republicans\nI don't know anybody that things are going to lose a Senate and I don't think anyone can rule out them holding the house although I still don't I don't think it's likely to happen you cannot rule it out does that surprise you that house is still in play at this point\nYeah I mean I think that the historical midterm uh trends would certainly suggest that the incumbent party would not perform well and the fact that Republicans have ah any chance that a hole in the house I think is is a little bit of a surprise but\nIf you look at it particularly if you look at the at the way that the ... house seats are distributed you have twenty five house seats up in districts that Hillary Clinton won in two thousand sixteen so uh you know Democrats have to make some serious games if they want to take the house but I think you're right about the Senate and very few people think that\nThe Senate is is likely to go Democrat unless there's some kind of a you know this blue wave that people have talked about forever suddenly re appears [laughter] ah we we have a really terrific elections analyst at the Weekly Standard named David ... who's created this a Senate election model and he gives Republican now\nAn eighty percent chance of keeping the Senate and walks through that in great detail on on our website it we'd be standard dot com so he's he's done that the the hard work on this stuff and that is being looted that there's a pretty strong chance that Republicans keep the Senate\nA very interesting uh uh you know it's just amazing over oh Steve with all the bad books written on Trump and the chaos it was early he still about four between forty four I'm forty seven percent approval

she says there are a lot of clues here and right away John Miller who is Debbie ... he's a deputy commissioner of the NYPD former CBS\nA CBS anchor and reporter who was hosting twenty twenty for a while I Know it's bizarre also interviewed bin Laden on a side note but everybody knows he's with the package looks like because they all look strikingly similar Jason cheapest here Jason what do we do\nThe return address was Debbie Wasserman Schultz spelled on one of the packages to John Brennan at CNN wrong company spelled wrong we have six uh always as six Sam's exactly the same stamps or and we'd doesn't look as though this one to the postal system although\nIt says a poster more postage required only original package don't eat the sense we are going to get this person I really\nDo because the the postal service actually has a great way to track these things I Do think there's a suspicion that the didn't but they were hand delivered that they weren't necessarily through the postal service\nBut that was a second to another photo the we came out with their that was out there showed that the postage was short of what it needed to be\nBut think of all the elements that go into actual package you have an envelope you have the tape you have the ink you have the piece of paper\nYou have this damp itself you have there's so many ways that this person times nine of them now\nA could've flipped up and made a mistake I I really do think between the NYPD or the secret service the FBI a bureau of Alcohol Tobacco and firearms there's a lot of resources being thrown at this and I\nI got to believe that there's some trace some clue and they're probably honing in on that person right now\nI Want you to hear a little bit what's going on to another networks I Know there are a little freaked out the CNN was cleared out because of the one package that was brought there is it's interesting the policy uh Columbus Circle was get everybody out the policy at six in the morning when they found the package at Robert Deniro restaurant slash\nFilm studio was just gonna move the package and so I guess things have changed listen to this kind of live and\nI thought it was the absolute bare minimum that the American people could expect from the president is saying given the circumstances\n... leaves me wanting like Harry is you find yourself thing I just wish you could have said some other thing I think it would behoove tend to be a little bit more complex and they say about this\nWith the exception of the the violence part of it I don't know that it's just the far right I think it's just a lot of Republicans we have Republicans on Capitol Hill a congressman talking about Soros talking about John Brennan as he should be the focus it's not just the fringe anymore this is now mainstream Republicans thought\nWell look I\nI think Marco Rubio was probably the most articulate in the sea tweeted out a couple of things that I really did agree with where he basically said look we can have vibrant political debate but you don't step over the line and engage in violence\nYou avoid violence by having the political debate and so we shouldn't be afraid of that debate we disagree about things were in the middle of a of a mid term election but uh that doesn't when it says step over the line of violence and don't give me these\nFake phony you know I'm comments about well I Wish the president do this or that that wasn't going to appease any of them I think the president was it's been pitch perfect over last forty eight hours and just saying\nLet's come together let's be United this is not a time to be divisive let's tone down their rhetoric those are all things that the Democrats them encourage them to do he did it and then policy and and Schumer tried to swat a way of saying that I think it was wrong\nWell I think it would be wrong to if the president came out and rip Bernie Sanders ... shot and and that's why you think this can be an analogy there so Jeff Zucker ... hours later a couple of hours later was president CNN says there's a total complete lack of understanding of the White House about the seriousness of their continued attacks in the media the president especially the White House press secretary should understand words matter\nJust for the show no comprehension of that\nThey don't bring it to Marco Rubio's words yes words matter because freedom of speech will as Aaron settled or disagreements and grievances instead of violence\nThe first amendment protects press freedom but it doesn't allow immunity from criticism criticism calling people to violence or not the same he went on to say similar already giving it to the temptation to react to the terror attack by either assigning blame\nFor or rationalizing it no sane are well intentioned person no matter how poor person would do this it's either the work of a demented person or terror aimed at further dividing America you wrote the deep state he's trying to elevate the conversation\nYeah I think Marco Rubio is is so good at it or try to get that down into a tweet ... for about a I think he's saying it really well we have vigorous debate that's who we are in this country you can you can speak truth to power you can be critical of some of the media you can be critical of your president\n[laughter] well I I I think there's a big an important difference between the legal immigration and illegal immigration or the most welcoming country in the world when it comes to legal immigration\nBut we expect people to follow the rules and to get in line into a and to do it\nThe right way that's the way we've honored immigrants historically in this country by welcoming them\nTo legal immigration the United states but this idea of basically a mob\nInvading the United states and in violation of our rules jeopardizing public safety\nWe all know that this was the vulnerabilities of this uh this pipeline up from Central America this controlled and Mexico mainly by the cartels and they transmit not only are immigrants but also\nDrugs and other contraband to uh it's time for a wakeup\nCall and this may be just enough to try to wake up the American people\nTo exactly what's happening and who's controlling this so I'm the president's committed to stopping at a I was with him on Monday Night in Houston and he made that very clear and I applaud that and support it\nBut he might not have the tools to stop it I mean right now thanks to a a law maybe you can expand on it they Dianne Feinstein passed in two thousand eight it told mega into Mexico or you know you're not welcome here but central and south Americans well if it tip the scales to them can you tell us what took place under President Obama\nYeah what what what happened is this was a well intended\nA wall which basically has been exploited now by the cartels to uh uh that treats immigrants from non contiguous countries in other words places like Central America different way than it tricks Mexican\nUh enlist immigrants and it requires children to be a process by health and Human Services put\nWith a sponsor in the United states and then to litigate their claims of course Iowa a later on this is really created a not only a humanitarian disaster but I owe a huge backlog in our in our immigration or asylum of processing system\nAnd this is being exploited by the very people who make money off of off of this offer this flaw in our system that requires bipartisan\nSupport\nTo to solve it but as you saw when the president offered the solution for the DACA recipients\nDeferred action for childhood arrivals one point eight\nMillion young adults offered a path to citizenship in exchange for border security and ... laws it was turned down by the Democrats and this is the price we're all having to pay for that\nTime but the thing is they turned it down when you guys including chain migration as well as the lottery system but straight out it looked as though uh that wasn't enough for many on the right straight up twenty five billion for the wall and terms for DACA so would you take that deal today\n[noise] I think it's important we break this impasse when it comes to our immigration system because what we're seeing is as flaw look we've all recognizes now being exploited by these transnational criminal organizations sometimes called\nCartels who are using this to a to import a heroin and illegal immigrants said Traficant human beings that the United states we need to stop it so I Would I Would sit down at the table and roll up our sleeves and get this fixed\nHe usually ... drives me crazy if you live a policy difference alright fine which but within it lets debate it but if you have a policy difference and you know you don't even feel you convicted to what you but what you're saying I have a real problem with that because you just spinning your wheels trying to get political advantage and I put that label on Senator Schumer\nAnd embryonic Obama because he they could solve the immigration issue but listen to Brock Obama in two thousand five and Chuck Schumer in two thousand nine\nWe all agree on the need to better secure the border and punish employers to hire\nIllegal immigrants we simply cannot allow people to pour into the United states undetected undocumented unchecked circumventing the line of people who are waiting patiently diligently unlawfully does become immigrants in this country\nDaily go ahead that that ... that's exactly what Donald Trump is saying\nThat's right that's right and I guess the best thing you could say about that all the laws are would be that was then this is now but I Would call that plain and simple hypocrisy it's just a those to cause issues are inconsistent and what they just shut down is exactly what the president saying now what I'm saying now\nLet's fix our broken immigration system\nLet's have a sister in law legal immigration that can be ... that we can respect that honors and those who try to do it the right way and then to deter those who try to do it illegally\nHow hard was it for you to get used to the president's style and approach\n[laughter] what the president is a unique a political strict your trees that he was selected the optimist all the more conventional politicians and the Republican primary\nAnd I would say now two years in you can't you can't really argue with the results are the results have been tremendous forking with Republican majorities in the house the Senate and not only we confirmed eighty or federal judges including two members of the Supreme Court\nWe've lowered taxes reproduce regulations and the sleeping giant that is the American economy or was the American economy has now taken off and people are confident and optimistic again that's the results or\nCan't be denied and while president style as ... as unconventional took sure uh I'm all for the results\nBecause you are just the opposite view of the same beliefs but you have a totally different approach you're gotta legal background you were a judge your understated but you're strong and your beliefs and there's the president saying whatever's on his mind at all times so did you ever think you'd have this positive relationship or that you have now when you first met him\nWhile I think it was I've viewed it as my responsibility Brian\nI'm up in the leadership elicit it is the majority whip and working with Senator McConnell and the speaker Ryan I thought it was my responsibility relationship work or where we can find common ground and we have and I think the

I'm getting everywhere\nOh the negative ads drive me crazy ... not one person is sold me on why their ideas better all they're trying to do is say they just suck a little bit less than the person that you\nVote for us we're less corrupt [laughter] well how did we get to this point well\nYou know it's tricky during one of I I think right around Clinton's a mid term elections one of the things that we saw was there was a ton of money that started to get dumped into politics in a way that was unprecedented from donors\nAnd both parties have wound up kind of competing to that um and what's got left behind is what we used to have to do which of course\nUh you know court the voters who I've talked from the Democratic side\nWho we used to court and protect their interests white working class people African American community\nAnd and pretty much we all started tilting toward the bigger donors you know my estimation that there are differences among them playing both parties are are absolutely identical on this but I Do feel like there's a whole swath of working people who are massively overlooked and as as both parties have kind of role forward\nA new one who's taking care of them the way that they should the working class people of this country um you know hold his shoulder the weight of of basically enriching the rest of the world even through free trade\nAnd we we have not taken proper care or notice or seen and heard them and I think a lot of people did not see did not feel seen and heard in the law and or represented by the candidates in the last election\nWhen you say whole middle I think that's a that's a fantastic term because there's so many people who are much more reasonable but if they're looking older seeing or the amplified messages from either extreme\nBut they're not feeling like they're represented in either the level of civility or the kind of discourse it's happening or even the views or even frankly if somebody else has an opposing view then you you don't get to look into their hearts and make a moral judgment about the type of human they are you just you should just disagree\nOh absolutely and and and you know as we talked to a

packages even found right here in Florida we're hearing it was sent to New Jersey senator Cory Booker\nBecause they had an oil discovery that throws you do so uh I was working at the Hudson\nInstitute in Washington DC we're basically like you said Israel finally discovered energy for the first time in its history you know there was always a joke about Israel that Moses fled the juice or the one part of the\nThe middle East that had no energy but we later find out that there was a great navigator and there was actually oil and energy so what I was doing it the Hudson Institute was essentially trying to figure out how American companies could really answer that space\nOr help Israel a ... and its allies in that part of the world after the Arab Spring and you know basically help American companies monetize or Israeli energy in the reserves which was a win win but that caused\nA lot of problems for me and it put me under the microscope of the Obama administration\nThey were all over Israel I mean they they were almost enemies him in Benjamin Netanyahu and President Obama did not get along and they thought Israel is the big obstacle to Middle East peace\nYeah no absolutely I mean I remember I be talking a a very high level conferences in Israel at that time in Iran that part of the world about this particular topic and I would have people from the Obama State Department is basically threatened me and telling me look what you're doing it you know you're causing a lot of problems for us\nThat would have ambassador is reach out to me from the Obama State Department and say the same thing so I never really took it to serious and solve all of a sudden I came under scrutiny by the the OJ about Mike Tyson says where is this uh this would be a let's say twenty Thirteen up until\nThis year right so he's out of power in twenty sixty ... got to four years left and you believe would you believe that was a ... from your estimation was Pfizer weren't on you\nOr my estimation is a I was under a lot a lot of surveillance by many different entities organizations and intelligence services and it would be unfathomable for me to just uh\nNot have some sort of war and that would allow these people to have me under surveillance\nSap your life at all besides being surveilled did it stop you getting credit or did it stop you getting a job well\nI mean a ... at the time of my FBI interviewer was actively trying to get a job with the administration so I mean of course you know I'm not the Trump Administration and of course once FBI came to my house those dreams were completely shattered and what I think was for a completely unjustified reason because now that\nUh we have new evidence have surfaced about the tremendous government misconduct as a congressman himself reference yesterday [noise]\nUm I think uh um my story really needs to be viewed in a different set of\nFriends in the United states ends up being the front runner in the Republican side and he has easy an outsider so all the big names are with the Rubio's and the Bush's and they don't like the way Donald Trump for the most part conduct himself and they don't believe he can win\nSo we put together a young young talented foreign policy group are you part of that team famously there's a picture of you all sitting around a table ... what was your mission\nOr so I Believe that a candidate Donald Trump was actually going to be elected president as soon as I saw him announces Canada say I don't know that was just fate that you know I was supposed to get on this campaign\nBut in the summer of two thousand Fifteen I reached out to Corey Lewandowski when I think the entire campaign was three people and I said look I Want to join this campaign I Believe in\nA Donald Trump I think he's going to end up winning so I stayed in touch with these people I got on the campaign eventually after I joined the Ben Carson campaign and my mission of some ... essentially was to try and make Donald Trump look as much of a statesman is absolutely possible by leveraging contacts I had in the middle east not necessarily Russia because I had no contacts there\nAnd then I go on this expedition to introduce them to Vladimir Putin and in the middle of that of course it's now known that western intelligence\nUse that against me to ah basically sabotage me and then eventually but I like to do with the Trump himself\nSo how did you end up with a mission to me it valid vitamin\nFood you know I just saw a Kennedy from talking about working with Russia I mean he was very vocal about it obviously obviously I mean this was in the secret and I said to myself okay you know I could introduce some saw a leader in the middle east but does that really going to achieve what he's been talking about and he wants to meet Vladimir Putin or at least you know they can gauge the American public of why he wants to work with Russia so I thought\nWell let's introduce them to Vladimir Putin for a photo op handshake just so you know he would have like a great statesman and that was really essentially what I was trying to put together there was no collusion there was no attempt to ... this is all fantasy called\nBack to section and say listen I'm getting some contacts with Russia who are these contacts\nI'm so sorry I didn't talk to us to sessions in particular but at that meeting if that's what you're referring to emerge thirty first meeting\nI basically told a group I there's this one person who's a presenting himself as some sort of an intermediary with Russia and I could set up this meeting by using him or we'll interested of course some people were not interested you know I don't think really Donald Trump was that interest that he just kind of nodded to think about it and then I just pursuit of and then never went anywhere so\nThere's this misunderstanding that I'm this insider in Russia when in reality I was a complete want to be\nWhen it came to that part of the world because they were telling you one thing and who was that person that was telling you they had Russian connection uh so yeah it's just a infamous professor Joseph ... professor that are just a couple of days ago or more\nTo just simply ... we're living in London and as a professor exactly\nAnd living in London tied to all these western intelligence groups\nBut then uh you know he starts to present himself as a rush insider and basically a couple of days ago his own lawyer went public in state of that he was working for the FBI not Russia\nSo it's very confusing I don't understand why his own lawyer would make such a statement if it is false I don't believe it's fall and he's also hiding in Italy is also is also hiding in Italy who's living openly I think he changed his identity\nSo obviously is getting support I mean ... is a reputation obviously it must be destroyed he's not going to be attending conferences or\nAnything like that so how is he living who's supporting him and have them check stopped and is that why his lawyer went public knowledge\nPapadopoulos as he was so this is your first contact with intelligence but you think you're talking to professor but you're talking to Joseph ... who's allied with British Intelligence officer I did one of the things he tells you or what does he tell you about Hillary's emails yeah so\nI'm a ... by the time he tells me a in late April that the Russians quote have thousands of Hillary Clinton's emails\nThis is a person who couldn't even introduced me to anyone of substance in Russia or in the Russian government or even in London which I was actively trying to to me that the time just you know to understand what the U.S Russian relationship was all about but then we go from a ... a guy who tells me he knows the world in Russia\nTo not introducing me tiny one and then he has all of a sudden the keys to this kingdom\nRegarding Hillary's emails so it doesn't really make just one conversation was one conversation you dropped this on my lap right now he said you I never asked for it which he said he just basically sat down with me and he says I have information that the Russians have thousands of Hillary's emails I never asked for him to tell me those we're sitting down having lunch or breakfast out of nowhere\nHe drops his bomb I mean it was like he was dangling something I'm going to see if I Would bite and that's how they look I didn't buy I ... I never knowingly told anyone on the Trump campaign those I gossip about it with another diplomat in Greece\nWhen I Am Alexander Downer ...\nKnow and see a legit low allegedly I told Alexander downright have no memory of ever telling the person that the only thing I Know about this meeting with Aleksandr donor was that it was a set up he was there recording my conversation I met him through various intermediaries of western intelligence and he just wanted to meet and he started talking about a lot of different things that had nothing to do with the U.S\nI'm just happened to be in a bar right was it a bar\nNone of us so the meeting was was planned out yeah went down or through his uh interests throughout his associates we made there and he begins to be incredibly belligerent he hates Trump\nHe's telling me to back off my comments about the u._k. prime minister of when he was a ... it's a disparaging Trump about his Muslim ban comments and then he became very hostile so I don't understand why I Would tell a hostile individual something like that that I had just heard so it doesn't make sense because I don't have any memory of her telling them\nNow to George is saying is is in bad this ambassador Australia Vassar and when he's got to be as ... as they come here to look out for Australian interest extensively and we know Australia the u._k. and us a tight we get that\nCitizen Basset or tape the conversations that because the transcripts or now a parent now the way the story was told to us George on the outside\nThat George Papadopoulos gates word about these emails telling has a few drinks and tells US ambassador the story that tells the story these guys emails is going to be huge news now in reality the emails were jumping desk is email was hacked\nAnd that's we came out past his name never came up never ever in the transcript so the passive are suppose says when I saw the emails get released I realize that conversation I had with George Papadopoulos I have to tell the FBI because I care about America\nIn reality he's working for the FBI and he's given millions of dollars to the Clinton Foundation\nAnd we didn't find that out to later that that's absolutely\nRight and there was other information that I just recently found out through a various reporters\nThat Peter's trucks boss at the time travel to London either right before I met Alexander ... the day after I met him so that some new information I'm not sure the American public understands but why on earth would Peters trucks boss be in London at the time of mind meeting with Aleksandr down or makes no sense\nPeter Struck a disgrace FBI official in charge of counter terror that had the affair with Lisa Page let's rent it foolishly leaves used government phones to text messages his hatred for Donald Trump and a plot and plan emergency plan to take him down should he when he won is this the plant it certainly\nLooks like it and you know there was another really interesting piece of information that came out from these exact tax messages that you just referenced the day I mean Joseph ... in Rome Peters truck has touched Lisa Page about their overseas contact
