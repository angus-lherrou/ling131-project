Kelly from Orlando morning news we get to the news and information every\nMorning as your hobby into the car\nBut then at nine o'clock Brian kilometers actually talking to the newsmakers and that's what's so great Joe that's what I have a chance to not only do you what I think's going on but you could tell me what you think's going on from your perspective I feel like we have a dialogue to Bryan told me we do not until noon news maybe six point five WB Rio\nYou own a gun you have a full time responsibility\nWhen you weren't using as we should count due to the hands are furious to\nOr anyone else from my\nFor more information on firearms orange safety presidency piece you do business in bronze you by the national crime prevention council zero justices doesn't\nKnow that she had been showing new Ninety six point five do these devious [noise]\nIndependent\nAnd thought as punk rock in life the best in show\nLast week at this time of the world was exploding with craziness and that is just easy to be crazy at times in the debate is still\nRaging joining us now is a woman who wrote a piece in the uh and USA Today an opinion piece Kelly or a Kelsey couldn't I just joined us now and her piece is I'm a sexual assault survivor and I don't want you to just take my word for it which was crazy because when you look at all the polls Kelsey\nOver the last several weeks and we saw all these things to say just believe just believe just believe\nAnd the reality is just no we live in a world with the ... with due process and you're innocent until proven guilty but I think a lot of people especially on the left they didn't get that memo\nThat's right yeah I was I was just really tired\nOf that false narrative I kept seeing a social media you know the whole belief survivors early women nonsense that what they're really saying is the lead like you\nAnd I reject the idea that you don't have their right to an opinion on this matter unless you're a survivor yourself and I just kept seeing that come up on social media again and again if anyone challenge that\nWhile you're not as survivor or you don't have the right to speak about it and so that's why I decided to pick up as both a woman at a survivor and say no and you know I Am a survivor and I don't want you to take my word for it if I use them without any of that it\nWouldn't you think of her her testimony I mean I think some of it it it felt like you know they brought her in the glasses hair falling down it looked a little compared to the pictures and other things we see I felt kind of it was a bit stage not that I didn't believe in nothing happened to her and I did say that I Do believe that I just don't know if she got the right person but\nShe felt that some of that felt a little bit states like her her you know her attorneys and stuff are prepping for something that almost like they were window dressing or\nMhm yeah I notice that too it seems like she was kind of intentionally dish shuttled and I felt like the voice that she was using that talk a little bit\nUm manipulated like she was trying to make it sound like she had been crying or emotional I'm Sorry that testimony goes I felt\nI alluded to this a little bit of my article as well I felt like she identified a real the real aftermath of that a sexual assault survivor goes through and that was kind of pulling on my heartstrings a little bit but it's like now I don't need to take a step back and you know I Can't just believe her based on feelings I got to see them back then I just feel like after even after all the testimony in the\nHearing than every FBI investigation and everything else they're still just not a shred of evidence substantiate allegations and in fact I've even been refuted\nOh evidence is silly Kelsey talking again and I wrote a really interesting in a very I think he thought provoking an opinion piece in USA Today I'm a sexual assault survivor and I don't want you to just take my word for it because you you could identify with her what she was saying because you too had gone through something similar\nRight yeah and yeah and like like I said when she was detailing you know the aftermath of that whole experience\nAllegedly that she was saying you know I I should just move on and to pretend it didn't happen and I'm like well okay I you know that took me back I can remember feeling that way but I I you know you still need to look at the the testimonies and the facts objectively and they're just really wasn't anything that back at what she said at the end of the day\nYeah which is I Know it's crazy because we're watching when you watched that they're used to all the people out there and they're protesting do all of them and it was the just believe you must believe as if you weren't going to believe that somehow you were a bad person because you know you ...\nRuckel was something that though is it was very profound it was John Adams a he said he said it best once innocence is condemn virtue itself is no security you're looking out there and you're seeing all of these things and you're saying to yourself\nYou may identify with those people but the reality is is you have to have proof in this day and age and people don't care about facts anymore it's feelings that seemed to rule today\nThat's so true and some of the backlash I'd gotten which I've gotten quite a lot of backlash especially for women ironically enough\nI'm from writing this piece but I was told that it's even it's wrong to even ask a survivor for evidence because that would be a victim blaming since we live in a patriarchal society so I mean that's that's the kind of stuff that they believe that it's just it's just madness\nHow do you I mean that's the Institute the same thing as your woman you've gone through something\nSimilar to her being sexual assault you're underage drinking those kinds of things you were assaulted by a man you've gone through something like this and it's it they're the frustration I have is is you're not even allowed to ask\nYou so at that point in time what would we even have trials we should just send people straight to wherever that the judge decides that they should go if we're going to leave with feelings\nRight it's it's really scary I mean that's that's a scary precedent this whole ... and you know a lot of people responded to my article thing well well he didn't need it wasn't a trial it was just an interview well to me that's even scarier because he didn't have a trial or he didn't have a right he didn't have a defense and it's like all of our society is just already talking\nLike he's guilty I mean I've already heard meet people in the media saying you know he's the attacker they're describing in this way and it's just it's madness that we're we're we're just taking a woman's allegations that are completely unsubstantiated and treating them in fact it's terrifying\nWhat when other women or you know go\nAnd email you because I'm sure that the problem is there's a lot of women out there that feel like you do but we're in this world where\nPeople are afraid to say anything Kelsey because they know the backlash that's going to come is going to be tremendous especially people in power who were afraid of the of the social justice warriors and the mob comes after them if they say anything when women you know read your article I'm sure you've got several you know as much as you got complaints I'm sure there are women\nThis news Ninety six point by your baby oh we'll\nTurn first for breaking news\nI double
