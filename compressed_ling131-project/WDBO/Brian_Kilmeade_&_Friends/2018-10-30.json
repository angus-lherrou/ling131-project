rent a car and you talk about your credit card having insurance through it and my question was is there a difference between what is offered through our debit card from the bank versus like a traditional charge card\nYes so do you not have any credit cards you only have a debit card\nWe do not we neither of us have credit cards we got rid of all\nRight so if you are going to rent a car as a general rule you have to contact the car rental company in advance and they may have a special um former application you have to fill out in order to be able to rent a car with a debit card\nYeah when you get to any car rental counter they have what they call a debit card notice and ah they they are very nervous about renting cars to people with a debit card because there's been problems with auto theft rings\nThat will present false id and so my rent a car and that's the last us ever seen again\nSo you have to do paperwork before you even go usually to be able to use that debit card

your debit card so you'd have to have a very large balance in your checking account to avoid the taking out all the insurance\nOtherwise you'll have to buy coverage from them if you're going to rent

eventually where one pundit looking to make some headlines might bring up and say this reflects poorly on the president do you think for a second that Sandy Hook or the south Carolina church shooting shooting or ... or ... or Gabby Giffords' shooting reflects badly or President Obama\nThat his president that's his America he's the beacon of inspiration what was he saying that cause these people to shoot people I never thought\nI'd never set it and I never hurting\nNew world new president and\nIt's so easy to just haul off verbally and go after the president first off after the shooting on Saturday with eleven dead as it were shipped in a synagogue in Pittsburgh prison quickly reacting cut one\nFish we could act of mass murder is pure evil [noise] hard to believe\nAnd frankly something that is on imaginable the violent hate filled poison of anti Semitism\nMust be condemned and confronted everywhere and anywhere it appears that must be no tolerance for anti Semitism and America or for any form of religion\nFor racial hatred for prejudice\nOkay so you don't like the president's tone he goes right in your face especially if he's head he's critical of the media because Ninety two percent of the media reports on him negatively including a hundred percent of everybody on CNN\nAnd probably Ninety seven percent of everyone on\nMSNBC hits back you don't like that that has nothing to do with this in terms of a synagogue shooting and anti Semitism you know Jared Kushner his son in law who plays a key role in his administration is Jewish\nDo you know his daughter converted and his grandkids are Jewish do know that his best friend in the world is Benjamin Netanyahu and they'd been friends for forty years and do you do know administrators to the detriment\nOf uh the Palestinian Israeli Middle East cause has been tighter with the Israelis than this president you know that\nHow could you possibly look and say well the president's giving the go side to anti Semitism but that's exactly the conversation on CNN [noise] look at this and try not to group your steering wheel so hard if you're driving your fingers bleed cut eight\nThis president took incredible grace for standing where the people of Israel global he was condemned for standing with the people of Israel\nI'm Johnny Cash check it out I mean\nI Will say ... ad and took the arguments over whether the president there with a government in Jerusalem for them in the Jewish people in the United states in ... and you say are you thinking is standing for the people of Israel by moving and no one pocket and then when I when I was\nLike okay nice for a large you know it matters I don't think it matters that he had grandchildren or Jewish or that his cabinet is half Jewish or this or is at the point that after oak okay we have a new Kenya had Cohen they've got other folks there ... and the White House ...\nGuy who are you going to cost a lot of things the anti Semite doesn't want to call them and that that's crazy crazy guy\nWho did this was a rally\nAgainst Trump for being controlled by the just for her social media posts\nOkay now listening to John in Weissman respond cutting done\nBy not over what it ... and President Trump line we're not calling him a racist we're not calling Lynn ... we don't know what I Am thing in the president has shown a reluctant time and time again\nTo shovel his supporters and hit the order as Gillum that I'm not calling you a writer I'm going to say they are the rangers think you're right that's right they said we are in them I Believe that he and on their side and he got pushed back hard enough\nJoyce how stupid this is this guy hates Trump\nThe anti Semite think he's on his side do you you can't make up total facts for your argument that doesn't exist\nIt doesn't make sense out of everything the president\nFor instance says listen first thing you got to do in the meantime guns aren't the problem I Want to know I'm going to these places of worship and and it's not hard we discuss this already we discuss this when there was a shooting in Texas\nAnd with all these people volunteer in my in my town of particular two thirds of my town are are active or officers or retired\nAnd a lot of them are ushers and instead of maybe volunteering that way or helping out with the why do you say do me a favor was breaking up to three ships on Sunday\nAnd believe me these cower to show up they were up to their their their show up to slaughter they don't want to fight if they think first second they're going to get shot back at before they commit heinous crime I think in many cases they're not showing up\nBut you understand how outrageous it is ... hours after a eleven people were killed in cold blood including a Ninety seven year old\nTo go and say the president has been pushed back enough about his supporters who anti Semitic what are you talking about this supporter was eight the tractor they hated the president and he found a social media website to vent but he has no criminal record prior\nSo that's why the president goes off and I I give them credit for continuing this rally he tone it down had his rally because you don't want anybody who was a shooting to go ahead and do rail your uh your life your plan I mean if it was some party at the White House then put it off\nBut if it's campaigning for your point of view for a candidate that as an election to win why should you let a mass\nMurderer a win so I have no problem with that run germ\nAs you know who's on next revolution on the media blaming and you know run German was former you are Israeli ambassador to the United states cut six\nHigh anti Semitism than up again in two thousand six pain has been going on for many centuries of\nAbout twenty five centuries a and President Trump is not responsible for the anti Semitism that has existed really in the United states and an increase fashion over the last couple of decades you know in two thousand fourteen and two thousand Fifteen and I say that only that because that was before\nPresident Trump came into office over half the hate crimes against religious groups or hate crimes against kids a lot of people don't know that and I think you have had an increase in hate in recent years I think that's a product mainly\nOf the rise of social media\nWhere you have a lot of these purveyor of hey they can now go and reach out to other purveyor of hate and spread their poise [noise]\nThat's the way the president says fake news which I hate that term and their enemy of the people I don't like that\nTerm but you know why he says it he says listen if you're supposed to be you being the voice of the people you're saying things for your point of view not providing the voice of the people the information for the people to learn from that's\nWhat he's saying I Wish you wouldn't say fake news I Wish you wouldn't say enemy the people but you know where he's coming from the president does what he wants to do but you understand that frustration legitimate\nSwitch to the midterms eight million people who voted early how impressive is that it's the highest total percentage of our population since Nineteen fourteen were on route to have a presidential if not above a presidential turnout that's great news for the country\nNobody is so frustrated they are not participating they are participating now I totally push\nBack on a guy I think it does a fantastic job John this one who says the president's schedule makes it seem as though that he's given up on the house because he's going to Fort Myers Florida for the Senate race in the governor's race to Columbus, Missouri for the Senate race for Huntington West Virginia for the Senate race kind of surprised me to\nA Bozeman, Montana because he hates Jon Tester and once the Democrat the Republican to win Macon Georgia he's worried about the governorships there in Fort Wayne Indiana because there's a chance for the Senate seat to flip and Cape Gerard or Missouri so he is actually doing that I Wish she put Michigan on because I think John James\nDeserves some presidential support he's trailing by about seven\nBut I don't agree that he has given up on the house a lot of times presidents are going to these locations where it might be a detriment to show up because it's purple or it's blue got it Tom Bev and real clear politics cut thirty two\nDefinitely this is going to be a we're going to be up late on election that particularly in the house but uh it's going to be a battle and we'll see what happens but then both sides seem very very energized turnout ... you know off the charts because it's going to be exciting\nYeah because a lot of the house races that are going to be interesting even though you look at California go well that's a blue state where's the drama there's a lot of drama because they're on clubs that are red and a lot of them are retiring like Darrell ISIS district\nCBS does a new poll a and it shows Bill Nelson and Rick Scott any forty six forty six tie I'm shocked Scott's been more effective these more well known and bill Nelson's done nothing\nArizona Democrats and against

right I mean these people are all going to be said these lawmakers all pretty much said to elevate to cheer people if um if they get to the house\n[noise] Oh absolutely I obviously don't agree with the characterizations of of them but um yes we're looking at a first of all it's just an incredible time of turnover no matter what you know you have suddenly got upwards of can Republican chairman retired\nSo there's movement on both sides and of course if the Democrats take the majority are there's going to be\nUm a a big obviously Maxine Waters is going to head financial services\nUm and and that's gonna be a very controversial and then you have you know on judiciary and oversight I'm new chairs and they are you know I have I wrote in my last call them that they should not look to impeach the president but they should look to investigate him it's high time in the tax payers now\nOn what's going on Trump administrators and that the Republicans have refused to look into a and I think that if they do take the house one of their mandates will be from independent voters and college educated women and those type of people who in focus group and polls express concern about unchecked president um oversight will be one of the mandates\nOr any of the Democratic\nUsed all the investigations you went on a Jared Kushner and WhatsApp conversations I don't even know what that's about what's that about\n[noise] well Jared Kushner the reporting from the intelligence to me as we know a lot of people a lot of things have been leaked out um about the Trump Administration bite from within the administration out of concern and so you know we saw leaked out from the\nUm and I say his revealing of classified information to the Russians and the oval office there is concern that the purge that\nUm that uh the crown prince um\nAh ah how the purge that he conducted right after he met with Jared Kushner in Riyadh for um this big visit last year where they stayed up all night and they you know they they forged this close relationship\nThe concern in the intelligence community at the time was that\nI'm Jared was communicating with him not through the proper official channels but through um a cook conversations off line on one that um and that can be hidden obviously and that perhaps he might have shared intelligence from the presidential daily brief which motive helps\nThe crown prince know who had been disloyal to him because the purge took place within a few days\nAnd see he gets that offer that deal again from democratic leadership of hey I'll give you the wall or you give us a ten year a ten year a path on DACA\nMaybe takes it and he goes gosh this is what I got you know this is the best I got I don't have the house I'm going to do a deal here\nBecause I think you will give him credit if he does that right no I absolutely will do the people\nTo break down and and and solve some of our problems I Know and they're not going to do ... you know they're not going to tackle everything but I I Would I Would be so happy for even a half a loaf on immigration just something\nI didn't go to the ground I give him credit if he does that absolutely\nYeah I think Lindsey Graham really wants them to do it and right now he has a they say well when we was going to alienate the Freedom Caucus well what if he doesn't have the house\nSo maybe he says I Can't you know his instincts we saw his instincts when he brought the cameras into that room and we saw him trying to workout guns and we saw him trying to work at immigration but when the doors closed he didn't have\nThe the base behind him I get to go forward or you didn't think it was going to work for him to do that but I think his instinctual we saw their\n[noise] well I'm just saying that he started as twenty twenty campaign already and it's officially kicked off November seventh if it continues to only talk about MSN they're searching infection in your neighborhood and coming for you and your grandmother and and do this and play the fear card\nI'm ... I I mean ... that's what he's done to reduce turn out in this election I I I'd have to see it to believe that that he's not going to use it for the next two years to win again in twenty twenty\nBut as I told you I promise I Will give him credit I\nI gave him credit when he said he would take on and on the n._r._a.\nAnd then he flipped um I gave him credit I gave him the most part it I'd ever given him was when he invited the Parkland families the victim's family is into the White House and sat there with and they all could've screamed at him and he did the right thing he he let on that issue until they buckled\nAnd any buckled after people like soccer and everyone everyone around him for saying he was going to take on the n._r._a. and he was going to take the guns or wherever he went to our what every Saturday So um you know the bill of love I've heard a lot of promises and I'm going to give him credit if he comes in the middle\nI Know that I Am and this was my prediction ab if he does more town halls in purple areas than ah than rallies in red areas at least for the first six months of his thirty I think he he would do it I I think that'd be great advice it'd be used as make a go a mayor\nAbsolutely he has to come out\nAnd persuade people that don't support him he's got to get beyond between thirty and forty ...

always somebody else's fault never\nTheir fault never their fault\nAlways somebody else's fault and they think we as I've been watching the news over the weekend first of all everybody's looking for\nA place to place blame right it is it's from because of his rhetoric you heard a lot of that this weekend but it it in a different way they looked at the bomber guy they kinda they they really tried to tie everything together it's tough with this even though some have been trying to tie it together because ... son in law\nJewish his daughter for murder Judea his grandchildren Jewish his love of Israel\nThe Israeli ambassador to the United states came out and said look there's been nobody friendlier and better in a bigger supporter of Israel then Donald Trump's three even try to draw parallels\nThat somehow he takes some sort of blame for this and he's the cause of this but what you're not going to hear and what you should be hearing is he's a loser he's a man who's failed life\nWho's looking around at his failures and the only thing he can come up it's it's not my fault\nThat I didn't get a promotion it's not my fault that I couldn't get a good job it's not my fault that nobody likes me it's not my fault that women won't date me it's not my fault for these things\nIs a collective conspiracy theorists mind of him sitting around with other people in the same situation getting ready to figure out how we can blame this on somebody else and that's exactly what\nThey did his act was evil children's simple\nBut if you really look at it it's a simple thing to understand this guy is a giant\nLoser but he's got a three bedroom two bath house with a wife and kids or a business or a great job or even a decent job he's got any of these things put together guess what he's not it's not really a loser\nAnd when you're not really a loser you got nobody to blame because life seems to be okay so you're moving on with your life what are you seeing as people across the board\nGet ahead and he has\nSo there's got to be a reason for that and I got to be a reason I'm not playing field for the Yankees because a high school coach hated me and totally ruined my life 'cause I was the man\nLosers absolute losers but never let a situation like this\nGo without the opportunity to get a few jabs at at the president and in some way tired somebody semi back to them\nThere's have to understand that their words matter I don't think anybody should know Donald Trump personally responsible for what happened [laughter] Pittsburgh series you know you have those folks are Saudi or who are loose with guns [laughter]\nBut I Do thank you very special responsibility is first of all because I Won their first responsibility for the moral tone of the country that is what are we expect our president's partially in times of crisis to bring us together [laughter] and Trump has an effect on ... of the dogs were those countries [noise]\nYou know some I look look the reality is some people feel emboldened because of trumping the attitude yes that's true\nRight but the media plays a big part in it to write because hate is business and business is booming on both sides of the island there and and and and and and they like fighting and they like arguing and it's more entertaining than sitting around and being bland and so they'll focus on these kinds of things and it's great right like it's it's business\nBut for a guy like\nThis he he wasn't living in a world of of\nYou know he didn't care about Trump and what he had the same if you read some of the stuff that you wrote he couldn't stand Trump thought Trump was was being used essentially a puppet by the scientist you know Israel and Jews that were controlling him and\nHey I wouldn't be caught dead in America had I mean this guy is he was no fan of Trump this guy was singularly focused even the nurses just of the of of of of of a level that is is different\nThan the guy that thinks he's the bees knees in his life is great this guy's what was the was a nurse assist the loser kind\nOne guy thinks he's God's Gift to the world and he's got a lot going for that's what keeps him from being a guy like this this guy is a nurse assistant thinks the only reason he's not that is because older people have kept him down\nYou can't latest at the foot of Trump or there are people who feel emboldened because the Trump somewhat I Would assume yeah right absolutely there there there was some some people out there that feel emboldened but you can't hold somebody's ... him responsible for this guy's actions\nThis guy's actions are all on him and this guy's action started a long time ago with his belief that he was being held down by whatever reason the Jews the people bring coming from different countries all of these things\nAs if they were destroying his world to get ahead and because of that he couldn't have friends because of that he couldn't get a real job because of that he had no wife no girlfriend or boyfriend no no job no career no no prospects for anything he was a giant looser\nAnd when he's a loser of that size you look to find out\nWho can I blame the salt and after a while you Janet up so much inside of your head and you get in the echo chamber like he was with other people like him\nAnd they feed off each other and they poison each other and finally something snaps and he thinks he's got to go do something and this right here is going to give him credit to a certain extent and because of that he won't be a loser at least in a certain circle of people know you're a

establishment media and the shows from CNN to Fox and all of these things I Love it if they stop arguing amongst themselves all the time and and and and and she's going for the quick simple click bait kind of things that they do\nYeah it'd be great talk about real issues like health care actual immigration reform right\nHow we tackled the the the the deficit and debt those kinds of things I Would absolutely like that but they're going to go for the low hanging fruit\nTrump's not going to change their not going to change but it's not their fault it's not his fault it is this guy's fault in me and he's a loser\nAnd that is the most important thing for people to understand he is a loser and he lived in an echo chamber with other losers to the point where he decided he'd had enough and he'd rather be infamous\nThan do nothing SOB loser sitting in his apartment\nSeizing over the fact that everybody else has something and he doesn't edits everybody else's fault the person he hated more

WD veal our top story we're following breaking news this morning that the Trump says he's going to sign an executive order ending birthright citizenship for babies born in the U.S to moms who aren't citizens you made the comments during an interview last night with X. ios on HBO\nTo act of terror and the president's their Pittsburgh in the mail bomb from Florida with one common theme blame Trump with the president be better off looking past the critics or taking them off by the way you know what choice he already made the number one\nFor the only country in the world where a person comes in has a baby and the baby is essentially a citizen of the United states for eighty five years with all of those benefits which we did kill us and it has to end have you talked about that with ... where in the states in the process that will happen when an executive order that's what you're talking about\nYeah with an executive order and it goes down to the constitution is written we'll talk about that with attended colonel Allen West President Trump plans to sign an executive order to remove the rights of citizenship for babies born here from non citizen parents plus there is now with plans for the caravan\nWhat ten cities in hundreds of military signal to would be illegals hopefully to stay home and apply the right way\nSo that is pretty big news and the person the United states trying to get rid of birthright citizenship but it'll be a legal fight and I'm sure that people get really dug in and see that's the way the American use to be I Know how it's dated and I'm Talking about the constitution they drill down on the language first off\nJohn ... got this interview on ... on TV for an HBO show on Sunday got one\nImmigration some legal scholars believe he can get rid of a threat to the whole ship without tension because she didn't get the borders that quote right have you thought about this and we've all it was always told me that you needed a constitutional amendment gasoline in it\nThe number one number one you don't need that nobody can nothing to human emotions well you can definitely do it with an act of Congress but now they're saying I can do just with an executive order\nWill say oh it's going to come down to language when is with that so he he expanded on a little bit too now how ridiculous\nWe're the only country in the world where a person comes in and has a baby the baby is essentially a citizen of the United states for eighty five years with all of those benefits to Nicholas is ridiculous and it has to and\nHave you talked about that with counsel wearing the said it's in the process that will happen when an executive order that's what you're talking about something that I didn't think anybody but knew that but me I thought it was the only one China\nOr so there you go so he's been pursuing the story for awhile according to John this one he knew when to ask it and now that is going to be an issue in the midterms and will be discussing all of that now but it's all part of America First she is the part of the United states has made it clear he says it in his bumper stickers\nHe says in his stump speeches and I am not a constitutional attorney maybe you're not so I'll tell you where he's focused\nSays I'm under\nThe current policy anyone board of the u._s. regardless of where they are delivered by non citizen or an undocumented immigrant there and meet Lee\nConsidered a citizen the fourteenth amendment states this all persons born or naturalized in the United states is subject to the jurisdiction Arab or citizens of the United states and the state which they reside\nTrump would pursue the executive order and would face challenges on this Michael Anton former national security advisor said this to us in July he said quote\nThere's a clause in the middle of the amendment that people ignore or they misinterpret and here this is says subject to the jurisdiction there of\nWhat they're saying is if you were born on us soil subject to the jurisdiction of the United states meaning he was a child of citizens or the child of illegal immigrants and then you're entitled to citizenship if you are here illegally if you own legions to a foreign nation if you're a citizen of a foreign country\nThat caused does not apply to you that's what the president is going on [noise] what do you think about this\nGym band to high a who's a founding member on a he's also a founder of ... three\nIt's almost more confrontational you got on a language that he uses the word is he is wants confrontation he honestly believe I walked away from that interview he honestly believed that he has no responsibility to calm things down to cool the country and in fact he argues the opposite he argues that he has a responsibility to his people you know it's just the ... people\nTo turn things up because he feels like he's at war with the media it's like winning the presidency despite having the same favorable ratings have two years ago he feels that war\nWell actually his ratings were slightly up or they have a fifty percent a with\nA one in one poll forty seven on the wall Street Journal NBC poll forty four in the CNN poll but he's going to visit Pittsburgh today after the shooting at the synagogue he is going to go to I think the first responders in the hospital trying to recover and meet with the families\nAnd a lot of people thinking I'm One of them just focus on that don't even worry about what they're saying go out there and and show your conscious 'cause everybody who knows you know you are\nAnd you care about people and you're going to work to help them to show that side of you and I know no one's better than Bill Clinton is confirmed chief and George Bush was excellent at it and Brock Obama was great maybe not one on one but two a wide group Donald Trump is also great one on one so let's see him do that\nAnd he does not mind you know if you're going to go in head right bad headlines about him during this time he's not going to pull back and I wish he would\nBut he's not going to pull back and say I'm a little bit later on I'm going to go up to the Washington Post reporter and say how how can you of interpreted my actions in my statements to are ones which is a ghost sign for would be mailed bomber or would be\nAnti Semitic killer\nBut he does not hold back\nBoil I'm just going to pay my respects I'm also going into the hospital to see the officers and some of the people that were so badly hurt so that I really look forward to going I would've done it even sooner but I didn't want to disrupt any more than they already had disruption [laughter] but I look forward to going to Pittsburgh tomorrow\nWell he went on to say that he does not like being blamed for these headlines she says it totally inaccurate cut Seventeen\nThis horrible human being this terrible person that did the shooting was not a Donald Trump than because he said I was too close Israel so ah\nThat seemed to be his reasoning\nYeah uh and you can't get inside this uh this this guy's head but now they're talking about the president white supremacy reporters the president is a\nIs saying anti Semitic things I didn't know what you're talking about about the president using coded language anti Semitic when his daughters Jewish\nHis key aides Josh I'm a his ... his brother in law is Jewish orthodox Jewish on top of that\nThen you have this three grandchildren who have been raised Jewish his best friend in the world among world leaders and has been getting up Benjamin Netanyahu the how close we are there's real almost too close were compromised when it comes came to\nCompromise when it comes to bring in the middle east peace\nBut for the most part I just wish the president would not even addressed the Washington Post headlines on meet the press on Sunday\nI wouldn't even I won't even try and actually I wouldn't even want you to publish him I'd be so caught up\nIn what's going on with the policies I have to pursue and the elections I have to win but I Would not worry about any of these things because these people are never going to like come on never going to give them the benefit of the doubt both times as you saw it with Bill Clinton after he was impeached in the house and it didn't pass in the Senate\n[noise] the America's a lot of time rally around you\nWho the president took massive action it seems with birthright citizenship announced in an actual so making form on Sunday so you think he's doing is sending five thousand two hundred troops to the border five thousand troops to the border they got to have guns but they're not allowed to really stop anyone oh this caravan as it gets closer or the thousands who come to our border legally on a daily basis\nUs airport plans to airlift four hundred additional border patrol personnel so they'll help there are three staging areas one will be in South Texas want to be in Arizona will be in California\nThe name of the operation is operation faithful patriot and roughly two thousand National Guard already on the ground from earlier the hope is\nThat the confrontation will be avoid it because the word will get out that the president means business the troops are on the border and you can't get in\nWhen we come back I'll take your calls or also have a chance to talk to attend to colonel Allen West\nA we have a lot to discuss there I've got to get his take on what is the military able to do will they be very frustrated at the border alone with living conditions he also said listen I'm not building any structures and getting tense tense which will be temporary but then you run into the law that says\nThat you can't talk to people aren't given an ankle bracelet\nAnd left him to come back this is the brine kill me Joe\nBryan kill made one third of Fox and friends [noise]\nOne hundred percent of the Brian kill me [laughter] [noise]\nI think hearing
