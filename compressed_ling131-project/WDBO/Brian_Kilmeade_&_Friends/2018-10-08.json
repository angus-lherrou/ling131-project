launched a conversation about the history of cell phone my first cell phone was the big brick phone okay just to break away from Nineteen eighties\nMiami Vice yes okay oh and it was like so cool to have that phone and I remember like carrying around saying like oh by ten thousand you know [laughter] so that they were like\nOh gosh she must be like a trust fund our she must be a Wall Street

the game now what was your first phone uh my first\nPhone was a Motorola flip phone where the battery was the exact same size as the phone I remember that was it was huge because at the razor no it was the Motorola like cutie five seven for I think that was before it was actually there was before the race or yeah and I ordered it off of an infomercial\nYou head yeah on television and it was like at two o'clock in the morning impartial\nAnd they're like ... or you know the normal infomercial thing you ever been lost in the woods and now you can get a phone and it was like two hundred and sixty dollars getting St law\nWe don't I don't think this and people who have done infomercial [laughter]\nOkay [laughter] not a a business as much as they are very cheesy but very effective I was sixteen\nOh he was sixteen I better and that what if I get lost in the way it can be you know me I go camping all the time yeah I Know you're really into that\nDoesn't even work in the woods [laughter]\nAnd he was so heavy and it was like a hundred and eighty five dollars per month for the plan I Would not have written letters a month yeah so my dad called them and said you know you sold this to a minor\nYou cannot have a contract with a minor and so they said as long as we sent the phone back they would cancel the contract okay but only sixteen years old that's funny that was my first thought the actual first cell phones though\nWas available to passengers\nOn a German train\nOnly first class passengers\nAnd it was all the way back in Nineteen twenty six\nReally I Would have never guess that the first ever phone was all the way back in Nineteen twenty six forty years later okay this is like a fun fact that you need to know for like oh yeah we'll pursuit or some games are truly doesn't exist anymore because of cell phones\nBut ... ... or you can convince people to keep their phones in their pocket good when you could get a case of the first thing you could say when was what year was the first cell phone rang and it was available to first class passengers and German train route now Twenty years later Nineteen forty six in America\nWe had the first car phones that were available publicly oh I remember having a car phone so for cool that was like there was like the nineties yeah in the forties thinking pretty sick they were using radio waves but since the ban with were so limited\nThey had got their first couple of customers and everything was filled up there was no more room for anyone to make phone that many customers and they have the under a hundred I Know in Sweden at the same time their car foreign service was available and they have maxed out at a hundred and twenty five customers\nSee I yeah that that's crazy I didn't realize that it went that far back I had no idea I would've guessed the late seventies most yeah I would've said the seventies in the seventies Motorola they came out with their first ever put public cell phone that was available\nAnd they made their first ever public cell phone call on a device that weighed two and a half pounds\nThat's a big phone that's a heavy\nPhone imagine a cell phone technology did not advantage and we were still carrying around a lot I got to get my phone I could you live there for me my back is killing me just hold it for just a fact okay\nSo we we jump forward another decade okay

mean we just heard about a fishing scam with a check well what about if somebody called you and this happened listen to this\n... banks in a small Portland credit union last week he got a call themselves from it from an eight hundred number that matched the number that his credit union uses actually got three calls from his credit union the same number in rapid succession\nHe didn't answer the first two he's let him go to voicemail but then the third time they called these like oh well this was really be important I should answer\n[noise] so he was greeted by a female voice to explain that his credit union had blocked to phoning looking chargers in ... in Ohio made to his debit ATM card she then read him the last four digits of the credit card that was in his wallet\nIt checked out\nHe would tell the lady listen I had any replacement card immediately about travel out of state California\nWell the woman on the line said oh don't worry about you keep that card we're just going to simply block any future charges that weren't going to be made in Oregon or California or does the only two states you're going to be and he said yeah I'm just going to California ... not a problem any charges that you make an Oregon or California will be five\nOr to freeze the card everywhere else and he said well that's a little strange but he figured well you know what she's probably doing a favor she said you know it just to make sure that everything's on the up and up I just want you to feel comfortable is this your home address because this is where we're going to send the new card when you're done with your trip\nHe finished a yeah that's my home address including my apartment number everything's perfect ... is this your mother's maiden name and he said uh yeah she said this is the correct spelling of your mother's maiden yeah yeah absolutely\nShe said can you please verify I Need to verify\nThe three digit coat printed on the back of the card in your wallet\nIs this number these three numbers on the back of the credit card that's in your wallet and he said yeah uh yes so at this point everything seem ... pretty legit right\nThen she says so that I can apply\nThe same PIN number to your credit card that I'm mailing out to you I can you give me your PIN number so this way you don't have to go to the bank everything's all just going to work uh and so that your PIN number will be the same PIN number that you have right now\nAnd he said oh okay well you know here's my four digit pin the card that\nHe hangs up and then he looks at his account\nThere were two fraudulent charges on account from the date earlier totally three thousand four hundred dollars there was a twenty nine hundred dollar charge from a Kroger near Atlanta there was a five hundred dollar cash withdrawals from an ATM\nAfter everything was said and done yeah just three hundred dollars in his account so what this scammer head was every single thing about him except for the pin\nAnd so by her going through all these gyrations with the card they were able to duplicate the card obviously they had and duplicate of the card she had been number she had everything in\nFront of her but she didn't have the PIN number so by going through every step she had the PIN number isn't that shady Andrew isn't that\nWhy would they get all the information that is our dog when it's on the dark Web

about the more investigation being interfering with I think yes a constitutional right to women are those issues are going to be on the ballot and the term and judge Kavanaugh underscores those issues\nHe's going to be it's kind of interesting on the side no for them to be running the Democrats are always been captured a carton ah but it's not interesting for him to be talking about Obamacare and healthcare when they've been running from that but now they feel as though that might be their best chance uh but that is going to be the issue as well as a judge Kavanaugh because\nIt has really polarized the country like nothing I've ever seen outside the Donald Trump when Carrie Severino I joined us now chief counsel and policy director at the Judicial Crisis network and former law clerk\nTo Justice Clarence Thomas karaoke exhaled yet\n[laughter] just starting to hear it in a really long run but I Am so proud to see justice Kevin on the court and his is a officials kind of ceremonial swearing in is tonight so that'll be a great day tomorrow or state argument [noise]\nDo you think that he has exhaled yet or does it feel like uh uh when they just came up to two great of a cost [noise]\nWell I I think a clerk for Justice Thomas and I think of his emotions that he portrayed in his memoirs and my grandfather son afterwards it did feel to him like a lot with it's all worth it they\nCan get the kind of reflect that later he said you know at the time I thought this is um\nYou know it's just too much sacrifice when I think of our military and I think that people sacrifice for real and then you know even it's cool and it's horrible that that process was um it it's something that I can do for our for my service to their country and you know it just kept that probably hasn't had time to profit that because he has to be ready for cases\nTomorrow already so he's got to get its clerks that I I Know already been working on that you hire them professionally and\nUm but but it's it's a lot to kind of jump in part with richer and we've had several justices if you get into it before it Justice Thomas Justice Alito justice Gorsuch but I mean they did the first few months so I think it might be awhile before he gets to kind of sit back and really reflect on\nJust what a what a roller coaster it had been at but at the time of night I think it helps to keep that judges judge he's gotten that for so long as it is Thirteen the or the judge here so um he ... something he knows that well and he'll he'll be in a sweet spot\nLet me ask you how long until the Justice Thomas ... and I remember that this was the number one story for the longest time and then it kind of faded away but if I you said you need to help to anybody\nYou know exactly what they were talking about how long to Justice Thomas was able to to shed that\nHe knows he I\nI didn't I didn't cook for him in the in the nineties so I I Can't say but I can say certainly right now he is someone who on the white has really achieved rock star status I mean he I think is the the kind of person that that that people see as a real leader\nOf the entire a constitutional as wing of the court and um so I I feel like he's he's well past at this point that isn't the problem with with people on doing damage to someone's reputation they're still you know a sizable minority of people out there who\nAre always going to have that in the back of their mind despite the fact that at the time of the hearing it twice as many American believed him as believe tell but you get people who did a version of history et cetera so I think in some sense it's there's always some people will be the back of their mind that he's the kind of person that you can", "year": "2018", "show_name": "Brian
