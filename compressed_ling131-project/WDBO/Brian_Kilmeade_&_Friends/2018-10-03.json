Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh exposed himself to her and colors ABC News Cecilia Vega has more\nThe FBI also interviewing key witnesses including mark judge Kavanaugh's high school friend an an Christine Blasey Ford says when in the room during the alleged attack\nThat high school party thirty six years ago so far the only public details about that interview come from judges attorney who confirmed yesterday Mr judge has been interviewed by the FBI\nAnd it made me think maybe there's something huge going on just needs to surface and of course there was the middle class was dying and the numbers show that really clearly what was amazing to me and what I've never gotten over would've been mad about ever since and the reason I wrote the book is that nobody cares\nAnd nobody in charge nobody who made the decisions that have destroyed the middle class has taken responsibility for those decisions or learn anything from them and so I wrote a book\nThat's the kind of tribute to them kind of a hell of rage\nRight and what I think it is so unique about your show and it it really the way Fox a line up to their prime time auto is that a U.S showing are different\nI mean from day one shows like I Am here I'm a fan of the president is where the president would I think you are up your big picture guy what does this mean overall you support the prison already has too but I also remember you taking on the president because you thought you'd be way too critical Jeff Sessions\nSo that doesn't bother you to be critical but you look at the big picture and say wait a second we're not even getting to the policies you just trying to stop a guy from being president\nWell yeah I mean I'm interested in the ideas and I I really I'm grateful that Trump has said a lot of truth things out loud when nobody had the votes to do that you know are we we have a right to secure our borders and every trade deal we sign is not\nFair just because it's a trade deal like the other side she live up to its obligations just obvious things that nobody was saying and I'm I'll never stopped being grateful that she said those rise\nBut to me I've never been you know what we'll do a politician I like some of them but but really it's about the idea is what's best for the country and my great frustration is that no one's even talking about it it's like to read capital get drunk and college why we playing along with us so\nSo I wasn't really as into politics then as I Am now a as you were when when pork was up for yeah for me I'll never forget but here's a thing\nLike his ideas they act like they didn't like what kind of feels like Martha Stewart ... such a good point and it was all it was a fun debate so you're angry and people aren't and it's not fair and that's fine and you know do I think it's fine in the big picture a guy who was nominated they went out there is this is how I feel they didn't like the ... and somehow they manage to bore can't get it\nNow they're going after him and saying okay he's got twenty five years have been really good track record and we have free time he volunteers when he has additional free time he coaches\nAnd now they're saying wait a second in twelfth grade it was a party and and there there was a tenth grade ... and the tenth grade it might not even been there but the according to Kevin wasn't\nAnd then she don't ask you got there we don't know how she laugh we don't know who invited her she was room where the houses so let's destroy him to coach the father is so this to me was this an out of body experience for me personally and you you just told us on television guys you got to take a step republic should take a step back and say stop getting involved with the tenth grade party\nAnd understand what's happening and that is what Randy Barnett on a rival show of viewers with the shed and Bream who is hard to work with what's going on that side he's Georgetown University law school professor listen to what he said is at stake here and I think is very uh Tucker Carlson he cut twenty to\nThis is about stopping Miller's Fishell conservative for making it onto the court\nThis would be about stopping the next one that was nominated in his place should he be withdrawn and worst case scenario he makes it on the court says about ... the Supreme Court five vote conservative Supreme Court\nThis is about ... our United States Supreme Court something that we were told in the past we should not be doing but this is what this was about so if they should if Kevin I should go on the court they want him to be damaged goods because they want any rulings that come from the court to be damaged\nAnd piled onto he's got our president he's not our president he's not with Jay he didn't get the majority of the vote the Russians stole the election is pleasing to ship a fool's\nSo next thing you know what do we have we don't like our history we've taken a statue down we don't like the Supreme Court it's not real he drank in college or high school and now we don't like our president even when the popular vote and the Russians took out Facebook ads so what do we left with\nWe're left with one party that has a very clear picture of what it wants which has power is willing to do anything to get it and as openly among other things racist attacking an entire group of people based on their appearance the opposite of what moments are king spent his whole life fighting against and on the other side you have a party that is totally unwilling to ...\nDefend its own voters normal people of all colors\nWho are not succeeding in our new order in our new economy these are the people who look to Republican to defend them but Republicans are refusing to do that why is that Jeff Flake oh no I got yelled at in an elevator by someone I must\nYou know pretend as if the Democrats are negotiating in good faith or not this is a joke everyone watching it knows it's a joke except the people whose job it is just stand up for normal people they don't know they brought to look\nHow many times I mean you do many daily shows\nHow many Republican senators have said yeah I Will come on your show to defend Brett Kavanaugh I've had one\nIn twelve days are doing a story leading with it every single my Tom Cotton the only US Senator will come on and make the case for Beckham now why is that well I mean you have a nobody's fighting hard and Lindsey Graham I mean it was absolutely and I've criticized Graham extensively for his foreign policy ... insane\nSo like I'm On my show which is I understand I wouldn't come on my show either if I were him\nBut Lindsey Graham and Tom Cotton that I mean you've got the majority of senators are Republicans why are they not out there defending their own beliefs and their own voters I don't understand\nSo I I watch this thing so you know what happens on Fox and friends who used to talking to friends weekend uh it's hard keeping everyone work it's such a hard job taught it's easier to be it'll be channel but behind the scenes that worked nonstop so Sean grohman who used to live on well when you were in your prime\nHe says he says let's go and and go out for a few beers a few drinks whatever you drinking at noon on friday so when I'm\nLeaving walking over I think there's going to be a vote and I'm like okay I kinda wanna watches my office by little walk over to the bar next door and hang out with my friends\nWhich were next thing you know we asked the bartender can you put the sound on what's going on and we're watching live\nTucker Tucker we're watching live just like being ... by a woman who says I don't matter to you I've been sexually assaulting you tell me I don't matter new one is helping there's no security there Jeff Flake doesn't have the courage enough to say listen I'm Sorry what happened to you but we'll just have to do what price cabinet and it\nDoesn't really believe what he sang and never has that's the difference when Democrats say we want power and we will crush anyone in our way to get it they're not joking they mean at one Republican to say we believe in X Y and Z whatever voters say they believe they're lying they don't believe that what they really want is to be loved by people hate them they're weak and they're pathetic [noise]\nUm I thought it was interesting too is that the president sat there for an extra hour after a major deal I think when you reach a bigger NAFTA now I don't I don't write a lot of trade agreements I used to try and the weekends but then after our games but I'm listening to like some of the bullet points on this makes total sense\nAnd by the way almost everyone says it he held out to the last minute with Justin Trudeau and Justin Trudeau basically gave in on almost everything the same thing he's doing with\nA he did with the European Union got a framework he might be due in Brazil next Japan came over the other day they say the framework for bilateral agreement he's rebalancing trade with America First in mind\nWhy can't people get behind that now you're a Democrat to go yeah we've been wanting somebody to take on China for a long time so the president kind of winning that they had in the morning\nSucked up to the rash of leadership meant by the way yeah and you you talked about that I mean ... wrote about it what is Mitch McConnell's investment in two different things in China and other politicians who have sold out unbelievable\nHere you have are actual main geo political rival China which seeks to display sauce is generally in economic exactly and culturally by the way which is exerting enormous cultural influence\nOver entertainment you can't you can't put the Dalai Lama Hollywood film a Chinese won't allow it really should the Russians are tampering with our democracy in our culture please spare me I'm bored by your dumped talking but this is my complaint again with the Republicans is they fall for this crap\nWhich is totally disingenuous it doesn't mean anything is dogs barking and they play along to Russia I'm not even going to you know what your boring me stop let's talk about the real threat China\nRight uh that's absolutely true and and here's the other thing about China they were actually repressing their people more in the eighties we thought if you brought in uh the Internet and we brought in give these people give the Chinese government would lose control as they got more access to a different way of life is actually dead it's gone it's gotten worse because\nTechnology has a bad at their repression actually it's much more efficient to repress people digitally than it ever was with the conventional secret police\nWhich I couldn't have predicted by Tucker Carlson has this brand new book out called ship a fool's how selfish ruling class are bringing America to the brink of revolution if you're one of the many people who loved his opinions and commentary especially on a show that's really the foundation of this book we're going to come back and just a moment and if he's\nIf he's a nice guy as it used to be when he was doing Fox and friends weekend he might be able to give us some books to\nGive away to some of our listeners right if you want the same guy but a lot of times people go primetime totally change I completely I have we pick they said ... and you were talking to him before\nIs this the same Tucker do you know because before I got here you were talking to he wasn't talking she was talking to one of my assistance related to have and I can't remember her name of that is what you want them to ... but as soon as he changed his nicer than ever I can I get to sleep a little later oh that's true that is Audrey\nAnd his hair looks better look better I Can't afford a better way it's got to

prices have limited by state law\nThis is news maybe six point by heavy you baby oh we're on land turns burst for breaking news\nFour hours a day\n\nAnd then we get to our tongues you know our tongues which one person wrote to I mean it was even in the scripture that the tongue is more powerful than the rubber on the ship\nAnd we used this tongue is a weapon and we use social media now as a weapon almost a virtual tongue to say things that we ended up turning around and we apologize to our spouses we apologize to our friends we apologize for business partners and guess what sometimes we can heal\nYeah sometimes but the reality is people aren't we we've gotten so tribal that we live in these echo chambers and anybody who comes into her echo chamber we won't get outta here what are you if it's like it's like turf right this political turf\nIt's like that's my street corner you're in my area how dare you come over to the red side or the blue side how dare you if you get caught dead over here you know man it's you're done now we're going to get you\nIt's sad it's absolutely said one hundred and ten percent it's completely sad the way that this is playing itself out and when I look at something like well what's happening with capital\nRight and I don't think we're gonna find anything out other than you know she drank a little bit in college and apparently\nFor anybody else that's okay but for him that somehow he's he's he's damp\nBut the fact that\nWe're at the point now where we're not going to find anything out he's going to be ... you know he's he's a serial rapists these uh I mean he teaches puppy dogs in polar bears he singlehandedly destroying the earth's climate and all of these kinds of things and we're not gonna find anything else out and people have already made up their minds and if you support him somehow you hate women\nAnd that that's the that's the starting point for anything that's an ending point it at our tongues are in our mind tons it's are mine are mine controls our time sort of tone it's her mind and that's the point I was talking about being open minded don't tell me\nWhat color friends you have or what sexual identity they have what box you can check off for something I don't care about that\nWhat's in their mind what's in their hearts that matters far more than anything else\nAbsolutely\nBut in this world of red and blue\nWe can't do that anymore we can't and\nI feel sorry I look at this and I think to ourselves that we always been this kind of\nI don't know if we've always been this way obviously the civil war with them that this was quite huge and we can go back to that but as far as individuals\nRight the way that that that we now have that platform to say anything to anybody at any given time\nIt's it's it is kind of sad because we don't care we say things to people that we would never say to anybody else because we feel that we have the right to say something because you I don't agree with you so I can hate you and I have I have moral high ground to hate you\nAnd we got to all wake up that I don't have to win and you have to lose you know we could all have some victories how does that work in the confirmation process well five and I was going to be a win for some and Louis and we have to think about what we're learning from this that we had Gorsuch was confirmed that we have to learn why did that work why is this not working\n\nI Wonder how many times if I said this over and over again the sad thing about the politics that we have nowadays is we've stopped trying to say hey we've got a great idea we think it's a great idea it'll be great for the country it's now just easier to say hey\nThey suck a lot more than we suck lettuce tells you how they suck and boom\nAnd the and and when you hear people like Bill Maher\nWho what a month or two ago says you know we got to hope for a recession and the ... and that everything can collapse it's it's that's the mentality you hope America goes into recession and people lose their jobs and their livelihood and lose their homes so we can get back on the ground that you think we should be on in the past that you think we should be on because somehow people know better\nThat's not a when I've said it all along and\nPeople ask me every day would you supported Hillary I would've as far as I don't want my president to fail if she did something wrong I Would criticize or if she did something right I was raised in the same thing I Do with Trump when he does stuff wrong I criticize what he does not bright eyed praising\nThis want it because I'm a great patriot you're a patriot everybody's a patriot ... patriot where all the time you know how I hear is you have half the country\nRight\nYou have to have the country 'cause they don't agree with you that's ridiculous that isn't a patriot right you're not patriot you you you only fight for your side and that's the issue with politicians that's why I tell everybody over and over again become a free agent\nEvery time a year last vote\nCast for all of the people are going to cast a vote for come in November So every time you chick you check off that last box or do whatever it is you do and that's it\nYou turn around and he said I've got no allegiance to anybody they're gonna have to earn my vote its actions not words and become a free agent let them work for you\nI learned about pressure cookers when I was a kid I said to my mother you know when you make those potatoes wise that thing whistle\nShe said Johnny of a dozen whistle and blow off steam it all explode we're about to see the explosion and we are seeing in some sense explosion American politics I Hope people will listen to me and think about it doesn't have to be when and lost there are ways in which we can get these things fixed absolutely\nNot going to be perfect right we're still going to have some uh uh you know some awful people in positions of power but when you start holding them accountable\nYou start getting rid of them you start voting them out and stop being trapped by some sort of deal are by your name you know much better that's going to be for you and me and everybody else\nThey're still gonna be times when they fall short of expectations are she'll human beings they're still gonna be times with politics get away with the problem now is politics is all that matters the people don't matter it's it's it themselves it's the party and way down here it's the people outside of that they don't care\nThey don't and we need to start care we absolutely need to start carrying one hundred and ten percent\nIn a different way than we're doing it now\nWe do it now when we go we say something on Facebook we say something somewhere and we are I'm only this or I'm only that and and and away we go and defend my party and I don't care about no are you listening or you're talking or you conversing to other people are you having an open mind about something I don't have to agree with you you don't have to agree with me we don't need to hate each other\nFind some middle ground we can find some commonality we can sit there and talk and you know what's great\nIs when it comes to politics I'm okay if you have to give some stuff up\nBecause they're also Americans they are Americans just like me and sometimes you give and sometimes you get but we're in a position where we don't know if it's not all it'll be nothing and we're okay with that and that's not a win\nWas winning on this nobody we are not teaching our kids this we reach our kids\nYou win at all costs you know I the Ryder Cup was on over the weekend you know what everybody like each team given each other a hug right do you play as hard as you can and you show respect for somebody because when you back them into a corner whether it's a human being or whether it's an animal you learn you back somebody into a corner and they'll strike at you\nAbsolutely and I will tell you this right now like I said and I continue to say do look up the names of every tribe out there a majority of tribes have people in their name\nRiver people our people the people because they want to see themselves only as the people and everybody else is\nThe serpent the demon the evil they are less than us these people that doesn't get us anywhere diminish the red white and blue hey we're all Americans there regardless of color or sexual orientation who you're worship or don't worship any of the better it is for everybody\nThe better it is I'm not saying that you don't have your thoughts and and you should look at everything and you vote your conscience and the thing you want but if we don't stop for a second and start thinking hey we need to start moving things forward and we're not going to get everything we want\nAnd we can do this as as a group going forward and we could show the world what it is and who it is we are in a better way\nOur founding fathers were worried not about outside forces but by us

into a multibillion dollar empire\nI started off in Brooklyn my father gave me a small amount of a million dollars I came into Manhattan and I had to pay him back and I had to pay him back with interest\nIn New York Times reports much of his fortune is built on what the paper called dubious tax schemes and outright fraud the president's attorney called the story one hundred percent false and highly defamatory but state tax officials said they're reviewing the allegations which are too old to be prosecuted\nYeah too old to be prosecuted a and his brother is come out and said it's a bunch of crap they put the thing to rest a long time ago they're ... they're they're bad because look at all the money they had according\nTo the New York times and their obsession with his money I find that to be weird right like he's not a drug dealer this isn't Pablo Escobar right\nWho cares how he got his money well he should be paying more it's at least four hundred and Thirteen million dollars he got from his father and these are quarter the equivalent of that today's money and his parents dodged taxes\nHere's my question of the dodging taxes right cause the obsession that the left has with what other people have money wise is really weird to me\nIt is that's like a sign of that the thickness it's like I'm obsessed with what you have that I don't have I Want to take was talking to somebody today about this they're obsessed with hey you know trickle down economics doesn't work I'm like so it doesn't work when it comes to like private enterprise\nBut trickle down economics works when it comes to government because that's all it is just take bears and give it to you or you can open trickles down I mean how's that incredible it must have always said about the the greediest of all\n\nIs not private corporation it's government government wants wants wants what's yours and so this whole thing is apparently they had a lot of money and they paid about fifty two million in taxes on the money\nAlthough they're saying the dollar amount could have been about five hundred and fifty million in taxes quarter for the times analysis and the the times analysis what did they do well it was all wrapped up their ... their dad died in Nineteen Ninety nine that's Fred mom died in two thousand that's maryann\nAnd everything got sorted away and wrapped up\nThe way they think it should have been and that was twenty plus years ago the IRS and everybody else signed off of it\nWhat did they do they add sham corporation snow which is what they did that people don't like\nWrite you

right it'd be easier to figure out how to read sand script and figure this out but some people laugh\nSo what they do is they figure out how inside and it's not maybe Trump didn't maybe we'll find out later he didn't and his family didn't but a lot of times what they find out in this business people off\nIs they figure out how to maneuver inside of the thing that you give them so this is the game you create the game they figure out how to meet you and your game and that's still angers people especially people on the left because it's weird obsession with other people's\nMoney opium but don't you care what because it doesn't affect me I'm not getting the trophy I'm not getting some of it it doesn't affect me\nThis obsession with a somebody died they've already paid taxes on it so we need to take more money out of that before it goes to somebody else 'cause we don't like the\nChanging of well it's so stupid oh my goodness so we'll find out where they sham corporations were they laundering money\nYou can go to set up a trust put that money in a trust make it a family trust guess what happens when people die whoever has the trust and I pay taxes on that\nThat a shame if you set it up right it's not\nCorporations do with all the time and all these famous people come out hey you got to do this and you've got to do it let me tell you how the famous people the wealthy do it
