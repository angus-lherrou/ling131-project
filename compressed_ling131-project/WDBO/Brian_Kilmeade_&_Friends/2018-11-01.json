you know we are all kinds of different prices of buying a like a really good specials like that\nSo the the real test was something like that first role in the cruise terms and conditions before a final payment is do they may have a clause that protects them illegally but let's talk practically because now they're alienating a loyal longtime customer\nIf the price that they quoted you would be generally obvious to somebody who was not involved in the transaction that there was no way they could have been selling of the ... price\nIt would be considered to be reasonable in their part to tell

military presence along the southern border is needed as a migrant care then makes its way through Mexico that's what he told our Jonathan Karl in an exclusive interview with ABC News\nThey can't have a invade our country he looked at that are always looks like an invasion it really does look like an invasion ... Asian fall I think so I think when you look at some of them when you look at some of the people within the caravan yeah I think it could be considered an invasion of our country we can't have it\nMeanwhile the other big major issues that are taking place today are pretty obvious we have a midterm election is six days away in the press the United states who's going to go a run right through the tape so many times presidents are asked hey come to a couple of races if you can you really popular my state you could put me over the top\nThis president said nationalized didn't make it about me and I'll show up everywhere I can whether it's a or whether it's a race over in Missouri where he's tended to go he's going back to Florida Today are too hard tried to kill that race and the governor's race his hand pig grunt descent as he wanted to be the governor\nOr and of course when it comes to Governor Scott he wants to be the next center with us right now man he used to do politics for a living a Congressman Mike Pompeo now it's turned into a from CIA director Mike Pompeo to secretary of state Mike Pompeo Mr Secretary welcome to the brain kill me Joe\nCome on and Brian how are you today man your resume is getting better and better uh this is obviously the most challenging job today is an important day in us Iranian relations tell us why\nSo we are now just a handful of days from all of the sanctions that the previous administration had relieved against Iran\nA snapping back coming back into effect it's having a real impact on a rainy and leadership [noise] uh this is important that the ratings are just just yesterday the day before Denmark announced that Iran had plenty of assassination attacking their country\nFamous happened in France in Albania there the world's largest state sponsor of terror and they're squandering the people's money\nThe Iranian people's money silly malign activities in our effort to get them to change the behavior\nWell I mean let's talk about where you just click glazed over an assassination attempt inside Denmark and now the the Danes are asking for the European Union to take action could you tell us more about this\n[noise] so that's right so a an Iranian intelligence officer was in Denmark seeking to conduct an assassination attempt inside of Europe on the\nUse of soil ah this is the third effort of just recent times there's a long history of this uh you know we were talking about assassinations around there will be Arabians are the leading actor conducting we assessed these assassination attempts in Europe\nAnd that kind of behavior needs to stop and um we of offered our our support an effort to help the Europeans in preventing these kinds of assassination attempts from taking place\nSo back to what led to the Jaycee peel way which is an agreement the president promised to rip up that you didn't like when you were a congressman and now it's gone now there was no obvious breach of disagreement according to the United nations by the Iranians but this time it's it's harder for you because the deal was done\nThe Russians were on board with the sanctions as where the Chinese as was the European Union but once they signed onto this they're reluctant to sign off of this how hard it job has it been\nTo try to get number one our allies of the EU to step away with us\n[noise] so so far Brian they are\nThe Europeans have stayed in the deal they've they've taken a fundamental a different position that are but we talk to them nearly every day we're working with him to explain things like what just happened in Denmark yesterday and why\nAre we have to have a completely different policy with respect to Iran the the problems with the president has talked about this at great length of the challenge of the worst deal ever was didn't address Iranian missile programs that didn't address the rainy and tear\nIt did none of those things and you can see the fruits of that today were around is running\nRampant in Syria and in Iraq\nAnd in other places in the middle east that's the reason that the Jaycee peering made no sense and the reason President Trump made a bold decision to withdraw from it\nSo the Iranian foreign minister was on CBS Mohammed ... a reef and he's got a problem with with this with the Trump Administration and you cut one have you with the videos\nGetting back to those scientists have already\nThe whole thing that anyway you have no idea how much you're reading and they create that care the Americans really play hard ball and convince the Chinese and then and it's not the buyer oil\nProblem but I think the Americans but have a bigger problem is that if that is a type thing sly pickup because then we will take out of a response fly like flipping decide to take a job as President Trump says I Want to keep them guessing\nSo what do you think he's talking about\nA boy it's difficult to know what we know this this is not the first time that I'm misery and has made threats against the United states President Trump has been\nUnambiguous we will defend American interests all around the world ah and then what we're looking for Iran to become a normal nation we're not asking for much Ryan right we're asking the same thing over on the we asked for every nation don't don't cause trouble don't commit terror attacks around the world\nDon't engage in this kind of an activity we're hopeful that um [noise]\nThe ... the ayatollah the man who actually makes all the decisions it's not Mr Zarif it's the ayatollah the ayatollah will see\nThe era of his ways and will come to understand that it's in Iran's best interest to change the nature of the activities than Iran is conducting all around the world and become a normalization wanting to President Trump's made very clear we're happy to talk with uranium\nAnd bringing them back into the community of nations but they've got to do a about a dozen things simple things like stopped launching missiles into airports in the middle east before such things such a thing can take place\nAny decay jihad they reached out to you guys at all that they might be willing to talk at any level\n[noise] say no indications of any change in their behavior run none none none at all\nBut a lot of focus in Saudi Arabia their arch enemy in the region you're either in in the Iranian camp or the Saudi camp\nAnd that campus gotten really muddy and and murky\nA NBS says a crack calmly and the crown prince at thirty three year old you met with him you talk to the king about the murder of democracy okay now everyone ... where we are able to figure out almost immediately and Bob Corker said the day it happened that he was brutally murdered by a hit squad is there any doubt in your mind to print new\n[noise] look the death of democracy ... tragic [noise] um it's an awful thing that took place the killing the murder of democracy again the console in Turkey a violates the norms of international law that much is a very very clear what we've\nAsked uh the Saudis to do and the Turks to do the place which the murder to places to help us continue to develop the facts that there are still many unanswered questions about uh precisely how this came to me we're working diligently our our team to to get the facts the\nThe fact that the Americans can learn and we won't rely on others will take their information will make sure and develop our fact pattern\nBut run I I Want to remind your listeners um there are long since FDR long strategic relationships with the kingdom of Saudi Arabia military\nOr a commercial ties are important relationship for the states of America and it's very important for us to keep that in mind as we continue to ensure that accountability has had for all those who are involved in committing murder\nIf you are if you look at what he's done with the prime minister of Lebanon with if you look what he did it the Ritz Carlton jailing the family until they did exactly what he wanted it they said a haphazard way in which they're conducting the war in Yemen and the way they've isolated cut her a lot of people\nSay this is a this is this is a type of leadership under this\nUh thirty three year old friends that are responsible\nOr that we really can't get behind in fact General Michael Hayden says is\nThe only way to salvage the relationship between the United states in Saudi Arabia is to curtail the relationship\nWith Mohammed bin Salman America obviously does not get to pick their future Saturday kings but we do get to choose how we relate to one are you are you going to reevaluate if not you just told me you're not going to break but are you going to reevaluate that relationship because of his recent actions\nAnd brown we we've got to see where the facts ultimately lead us ah we we we truly have a responsibility to America to the American people to ensure that we have a good relationship with the kingdom of Saudi Arabia a\nTo general Hayden point to the people of Saudi Arabia um are an important partner for the United states\nAnd we're we're working to make sure we have the right the facts right I've spoken to the king a couple of times I spoke with MBBS I've spoken with their foreign minister my direct counterpart to bear on numerous occasions I think the Saudis share our view they understand that they've got to get these facts out in the time is not on their side and doing so\nI'm now let's switch we can I don't have a couple more minutes or the secretary of state Mike Pompeo with us\nIt's hard to imagine a lot more levels of America confronting China\nOr the backlash is building around the world in China because they come in with a lot of money and they basically a build up

one of their ships go within forty five yards of one of ours and China's a leader a prison she reportedly put his military advisors overseeing operations in the south China Sea on high alert last week
