have\nTo yeah if they are Jerry Lewis chairman of his committee he will do that as the Democrat from New York can can we keep politics out of the Supreme Court sadly chances of that looked bleak as Lucy\nOr and or many on Capitol side investigate and the president says accusations of a hoax both sides are making anything better from Iranian talk about accomplishments Mr President ...\n... talk about why you want to get in power but leave the Supreme Court out of politics possible [noise] number one I\nGreat event last night as the swearing in officially took place Brett Kavanaugh ... joined the group uh nine on the Supreme Court ah congratulations it's official and Brett Kavanaugh has already got his death\nAll female and they're ready for action environmental issues talk about executive power issues bottom line he's working what I Hope to do now\nIs the president should go out on the stump and he's still Republicans you should go out and say we have to ... to Supreme Court justices and Mitch McConnell should Trump but that but I Would leave a lot of the politics out of it not saying that it wouldn't benefit you Republicans but I think it would be better for the country more\nTo stop talking politics and the Supreme Court\nSo would you want to do is ... nice to be a team or let them know uh to vote together it'd be better devote honestly is is correct\nBut most importantly the president saying hoax and Democrats coming out and seeing and peach and then other saying investigate is a waste of time he's not going to be impeached you go to investigate and find nothing there is nothing\nDr Ford might be telling the truth I Would never know and you don't know but we know that there is nothing to cooperate Brett Kavanaugh was there\nSo stop investigating and raising money and the president don't even bring up pokes because they should not be ... should be not be compared to what the Russians did on our election or didn't do so easily look right cabinet you're not going to hear much from in the future but here's what he felt he here's how we felt\nA yesterday of course this is great for him to court Justice Kennedy he was a court for him Kennedy loves him he was able to swear him in for his spot never before been done it happened in the White House and ... what kind of walked in he got a standing ovation when Donald Trump made a speech he hit all the right notes with Brett Kavanaugh spoke here's what he said\nAlthough the ... Senate confirmation process tested me as it is tested others it did not change me my approach to judging remains the same [noise] a good judge must be an umpire a neutral impartial decider\nWho favors no lid again or policy a judge must be independent and must interpret the law not make the law\nAnd what he's trying to say is that you might think I was nominated by conservative president you might think is Republican solely back to me the only one Democrat got behind me and voted for me that he'd be going to owe the Republican something it's not the case it's not the way the Supreme Court works is that the way the justices were Britain you put it best cut ten\nThere's a deporting difference between being a political conservative and a judicial conservative [laughter] sometimes those things overlap but most of the time I basically do not a traditional conservative as a judge looks to the case compares to the law or the constitution and his reluctance\nTo find new rights and new concepts that are not\nClearly putting the statute or president of the constitution at the same time such judges tend to be reluctant to overturn existing president\n[noise] so that's why unless something is compelling about any decision\nAnd I'm not a legal expert but unless there's something compelling to overturn they won't and that's why Senator Susan Collins says I'm not worried about roe v Wade because I talk to him at great length and they believe there's nothing compelling enough to make you want to overturn we'll see how that goes\nNext in terms of the actual politics of it it's sickening and I think nobody's more embarrassing to the people of New York in my mind or to me personally\nThen ah Jerry ... congressman Gerry ... he said this a couple of days ago cut Nineteen\nThis has got to be thoroughly investigated I Hope the Senate will do so if he is on the Supreme Court ah and and the Senate haven't investigated than I than the house will have to\nReally so you're going to drag this out and bring the Supreme Court into it maybe you could even question him again remember as as divisive as as explosive as Justice Thomas in they need a hill\nWas once it was over it was over only brought up again recently can anyone put anything behind them ever that's the problem no one sees above the fray ever so they don't want to lose I get that\nBut Mitch McConnell did a great job powering through but I Believe and Mitch McConnell and didn't Donald Trump's final year Mitch McConnell should not put up a Supreme Court justice should Brier or a Ruth Bader Ginsburg retire say consistent with what you said before\nThat's what I think it will be one way to bring everyone together and said game on let's go have an election and I hate to tell you have you thought Trump but if you think Trump can't win re election you haven't been paying attention\nHis approval ratings you know at forty one percent low I get it but CNN always rates in low it was it thirty six\nWhen he just gets busy and gets to work at just a few questions in stays out of political unnecessary turmoil he is a machine he will be at sixty percent because oh he's doing his knocking off all those things to do list which a lot of time going against traditional Republican thought\nFor example he is not necessarily anti union for example ripping up these trade deals that's pretty much something that Democrats are always talked about\nWhere the most part the trade deals with something Republicans worked on even though NAFTA was passed by Bill Clinton it was proposed by George Bush forty one\nSo a lot of these things that are going to raise wages because of the new NAFTA is something that Democrats have talked about in the past taking on China something Democrats talk about it's hard to hate someone who's doing a lot of what really helps you unless you're a political walk or put politician and only see\nVictory or defeat Jonathan Turley says this about the process he'd more concerned than I Am and I'm concerned cut twenty three\nThere seems to be a new development where we have given a license for people to be an arranged to feel that they no longer have to be fair and empathetic\nAnd people have to wonder you know it's a lot like the old saying about Saturn that revolutions like Saturn devouring very young the Democrats have to be very careful than leash this they may find that it comes back to haunt them in years\nStill got this question or do you spell that Fairbanks with two right lane block your delays all the way back to Michigan street that's going to take a thirty eight

conservatives get fired up they said we're turning out there's too much on the line you can have a very different election as so far it's all been in the Democrats' favor last for weeks it may shaft\nIt is and it's got to go down to the wire I think the Senate might be said also if you factor in Florida\nYou know the ... the president's party may lose Nevada but may and I think they're gonna they're up in Florida with Governor Rick Scott he now has a hurricane sadly slamming into a state but the one thing about Rick Scott is a CEO he knows how to handle these hurricanes in particular he thrives on adrenaline and he's about three hours sleep\nSo he has also an opportunity to help around the centers who need some help to take his job as governor so to say at this as a congressman from Florida is by his side and kill 'em it's got to stay home and be a mayor of Tallahassee where it's been anything but crime free and a home free\nThat might work to his advantage to an
