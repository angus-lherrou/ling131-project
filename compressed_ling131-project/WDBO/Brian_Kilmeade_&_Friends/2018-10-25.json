the Fox news radio mapping patch of New York hey rich\nHey Brian thanks for taking the call real quick if the Republicans are serious about maintaining control of Congress they need to immediately reconvene submitted a bill to the floor for one hundred percent funding of the wall and then get it over to the set it that way every congressman\nEverybody's going to be on the record where they stand this is an issue that's in everybody's eyes right now it's like a scab but it's been picked raw and the people in the middle of the country the independence they want to know that we're going to

now's the time to do it\nBetter than any campaign them out there on the trail they do this and the whole country of sit and the Republicans will maintain control of Congress\nI oh here's the thing we know that we just had a guest on Kevin McCarthy I burn up on TV I didn't bring it up on radio and what he did is he is as a fund the wall or he's got a twenty five billion dollar will funding bill out there and secure the border\nSo he I Believe it's pretty much symbolism though you get the house but they're already gone to vote on it and it's going to die in the Senate I I'm done with those symbolic votes I just have no patience for them and bottom line is Republicans have stopped the president from doing that\nAnd that's the you know with Mitch McConnell hasn't put a stiff arm hasn't used the Heisman but for the most part he's indifferent about it there is some taxes congressman like will hurt who don't want it\nSo the president's right on this he doesn't need and he's come off the fact that he says I Want this huge wall or cross the border he understands is that's not practical he gets it now\nSo he wants to finish off he's got about six to twelve billion to do this and continue the wall he needs the rest of it and he does he and he says he's been convinced by border patrol that some of it's gotta be see through to see what is going on and the other side of the

because\nThis doesn't fit an animal that's been going on this animal could have been going on if it was supposed to a lot longer ago then right before the election I think at the sympathy ploy [noise]\nWell what you're talking about is this is ... she's package showed up the Clintons yesterday showed up with a Soros has has\nAh for the most part you don't really have a ... a lot of that you know conservatives is definitely don't see them aggressive in these diners are outside a malls or outside the Senate I don't know the answer to that but I don't blame you for being suspicious Mike\n[laughter] yeah I just hope that they do a thorough investigation I Would love for that stuff to come back to a like a private investigator or something a working or their side\nI don't believe suspicious packages are going to decide this but we do have Thirteen Days is probably going to be another major story that pops up Jerry Lewis and W. okay V. in Jacksonville, Florida hey Jerry\nBrian I Am a Democrat I Love your show I Love Trump but\nThis year has been really hard for me I had to swallow a lot you know it started with Maria throw up your child's life people um and then you know like you know just after saying you know don't monkey that's out now yesterday which President Trump has said he's a nationalist as if\nSpewing out a lake Okeechobee I think that's\nExacerbated the red tide that obviously we've had a long term need to restore the Everglades and reporters Florida Bay a so I've actually have the only guy that has a really solid plan to do that um and I have a pathway to get that done and that will be very very important\nNot only for our environment for really for Florida's economy because the water in Florida\nReally affects everything terms of local economies with like our fisherman and and then the tourism but that also written barred Florida being a good place to be that allows us to have a low tech environment because we get a lot of tourists to pay some of the taxes for us so that's important and then we also need to protect\nA Florida communities guy obviously I'm running against an anti law enforcement failed mayor\nI'm a former prosecutor I've worked arm in arm with law enforcement we've had a historic drop in crime outside of Tallahassee were killed mayor\nThat doesn't happen by accident do Brian it requires a lot of hard worker ... men and women go out in uniform and and risk themselves for our community requires elected officials to support their mission um and so I'm going to continue to do that because I think when you start\nSkipping on public safety and you could have a good economy you could have a good environment but if people are safe and their community that doesn't amount to as much\nWhat did you learn about Andrew Gillum debating Andrew Gillum Sunday [noise] well\nLook this guy he is somebody that uh is is more glib than I think focused on the back uh for example he was running commercials two months ago\nTalking about single payer health care and I was asked Campbell how could you take a ... you know this Medicare for all is basically single payer it takes away Medicare Medicaid put seniors on it takes away private insurance dumped so everyone there on a single payer plan and Floridians do not want that and you know and I asked\nHim I was like well why should someone lose their plan of all there and she acted like he had never heard of single payer before he endorsed it sitting us along\nBy Bernie Sanders he wouldn't say whether he would sign a bill in Florida even though he's previously said he wanted the single payer confederacy with a New York and California so I think he was somebody that was\nReally running from his record a and was in Boston and being honest with the voters\nBut that is now you know coming out and get respect\nParticularly with the FBI investigation and the fact that that he was whining his pockets with gifts from this undercover agent and with lobbyists who had business before him as mayor and he was just caught and a lot I mean the document they came out refuted what he said and I think he's going to have a ... explaining that away the night when we have our next debate\nSimply going all the FBI and him whether it was a trip that he used it was financed by a donor is fighting it and\nThen something pops up today in the news about Alexander Hamilton tickets now should you as a politician be able to accept tickets in the answer is no you shouldn't you can't do it even though it's tempting and they don't give you a lot of money so we said well my brother gave me the tickets and it turns out to be a totally different story it ended up being an FBI agent it was a set up\nTo the FBI agent was Andrew thought that the FBI agent was a contractor who was trying to get business with the city at Tallahassee so you know when when that agent\nIs giving Andrew the ticket you know which would lead hundreds of dollars maybe even a thousand dollars depending on you know when you when and how they got 'em um he's doing that with business pending before Andrew\nSo in Florida you know you're not allowed to accept gifts or if somebody is trying to influence of policy of yours and so that obviously would violate Florida law\nUm and it doesn't matter if that was given through Gillum his brother as a proxy Gillum knew that it was from the FBI agent based on the text messages we saw though so that's a distinction\nWithout a different um but then also the Costa Rica trip where there was he went on the luxury get away to Costa\nRica or with the lobbyists who are trying to get money from the city of Tallahassee um he claimed he paid four hundred dollars cash for four nights and the glove dream villa nobody\nNobody ever one says like hey I never gave me an e cache but it but it is the trip was much more expensive than that though he basically got free accommodations from lobbyists and then lo and behold short time after that um\nHe's he authorized two million dollars to this lobbyists\nProject to build a restaurant in the city of happy so Andrews getting things he shouldn't have gotten and then he's given the lobbyists exactly what the lobbyists was looking\nFor and it does not look like his explanation is accurate and I'm Wondering why people don't seem as curious about that as they normally would especially over something that matters so much to the election cycle and that's the governorship of Florida now one thing and\nPeople are they may be right now I mean I think that this is something you know bright and most of this stuff was not being vetted at all by the press um they they were not following up\nOn a lot of this you know the the grand jury seated people were not investigating yet and so this was really triggered by a he's also under ethics investigation with the Florida ethics commission and so this is these documents were subpoenaed produced until they were released in conjunction with that\nSubpoena but I didn't know how people this may be the first\nTime they're really starting to get the sense of what this guy was doing you know in the city of Tallahassee and I think from what we know a lot there's a there's a definitely a live possibility that were he to be elected he could find themselves getting indicted or either before he gets an officer while at all\nOkay there's a robocall out there are once again in ... joining racist robocalls attacking a attacking Andrew Gillum and it's I don't want to go to the verbatim of it but you have nothing to do with this right\nOf course by the total garbage Brian the reason that was put out is to try to distract from the FBI bombshell better they're they're trying to change the narrative\nTrying to make it about re I Want a full investigation of who they said\nI Want them exposed I've called for Andrew to help us identify the culprits here but I think this is all part of a of a disinformation I think they're trying to distract from the core issues um and so we should give it no credence at all and we should absolutely suppose whoever it is\nA few now are trailing in the latest Quinnipiac poll by six points how do you close that gap if it's if that is accurate in Thirteen Days\n[noise] well I I mean the Quinnipiac has had both Governor Scott and me way out of every other poll so I mean I just that's not the numbers were saying I mean we are seeing a very competitive race\nUm you know I'm the guy had the edge at this point I'm you know we need to do a good debate we need to work like attack and we need to just keep turning out voters I mean\nAt the end of the day the polls are great um but you know in my Republican primary\nOr the real clear politics average had me winning by five I think\nAnd I won by twenty or the real clear politics average didn't even go I didn't even register on that for the Democratic primary and he won right I think a lot of it is who you're turning out are you getting your plan and so far Republicans are doing that in Florida right and if we do that then I think well one\nLast question have you done a good job getting adding and Adam Pertman and other Republicans after you won a difficult primary was that easy [laughter] have you done a good enough job getting them to unite behind you along with the president\nI think so for sure I mean we've done events where you know people like Pam Bondi governor Jeb Bush I mean really the whole spectrum of the Republican Party in Florida and so I I think everyone's on board I don't think there's much

ridiculous on the other side\nI look at them and say well you play into the game you enjoyed as much as anybody else\nYou bring people on who are as divisive as you possibly can have you don't want people that want to have a conversation you bring people on who as divisive as possible and the biggest thing of all is you don't let the audience know that there's a game going on\nYou don't let them in to take a peek behind the curtain instead what you do you play it up as if this is just normal\nSomeone who send bombs in the mail or in any way delivered twice to hurt people isn't a sane or good person so I don't want our scribes many kind of higher political strategy of affecting midterms but you know irrespective of what this person's political leanings for motivation\nAre we are living in an atmosphere where hate and violence has been incited condoned by Donald Trump\nStop blaming just Donald Trump right stop you know what he has been a part of this problem with the way that he actually gets in front of a crowd he says things that are ridiculous the other side of things is the news media also plays into the part they again fight people on our show\nLet me tell you how this works I'm gonna I'm gonna let you guys if\nThey only want you if you're going to say things that are inflammatory or and see if I go on one of these shows I Would probably look at both people are we doing this because this is you you don't want to have a conversation on screen\nIt it's a show which theatrics it's it Shakespearean it's crazy 'cause off camera Ninety nine times out of the hundred\nRight there's a few out there that really they believe it and they drink juice all day long and ugly but most of the times what are you guys doing as we can hey did you guys see that new

people at home don't understand that\nThey don't want you to come and go you know what Trump can be an idiot at times and things he says can be divisive absolutely but also other presidents have been divisive\nThey don't want that they want you to come out and say stuff that orange and in and it gets people riled up because there was a segment of society that doesn't understand that this is part Barnum and Bailey right ... it's\nPart that it it's part like like going to say on that having you know all the the ... and the digits and stuff that make it look like we were being contacted by the it's it's show it's theatrics\nAnd some people can't re pass\nTo some people can't they they they they can't get past this\nNo I don't like what Trump says I it drives me crazy at times it does and and and\nAre there when he goes after some Oregon is like the ... of the world's ... you're you're passing yourself off to be I'm a I'm an upstanding you know a completely ... straight down the middle I'm just going to be facts you here's the story you decide for yourself there are organizations out there that have zero zero\nIntent on doing other activists and they they pass himself off as a journalist I understand the frustration does he need to be the way that he is ... no but I get it to a certain extent right\nBut\nThey love the fact that like CNN love the fact that they did they were just as much the news today is anything else that I think anything was going to happen no would if I worked there would be terrified to go in there no\nI wouldn't I wouldn't\nKnow more than anywhere else right the chance of you being attacked and killed by somebody who was who was part of a terrorist organization or you're just as good a chance on those last night of winning the lottery\n\nBut it's all about the blame game and that's what both sides do everybody jumps and and they take out their their their blame swords\nRight and they're playing shield the flickers and they go blaming each other it's a false flag narrative it's this is that if it's a false flag narrative ... false flag settle down I like I'm just saying jet we all understand what it is by my bed is\nUh even if it's that the fact that somebody would do something like that also shows the insanity of world politics is as to give their team some sort of sympathetic look so you can blame something on Trump that in itself is insane\nWe're in an era now where violence seems to have licensed by the president of United States and it's not just saying that neo Nazis you know are good people there are good people on both sides of the more including neo Nazis remember that the president either stays in the campaign offered to pay the legal bills\nOf his supporters are if they attacked his opponents\n[noise]\nWhat you

majority of people who win the lottery I'm going to say this probably aren't good at keeping secrets [laughter]\nWhat are you trying to say just throwing it out there\nThe other thing is and I think

financial world that I trust\nThat I could go immediately to four or five them because I Would never give all of them like one of them all of the money so you would want to spread it out you don't want to like a you know you hand somebody five hundred and fifty million dollars I think after taxes be between five fifty six hundred million after taxes you want to give somebody all of that right\nSo you know I Would have enough people to go to but most people don't have that\nRight you just you know you're a small business owner your students your ah you know you're just you you know

L. be a A R T Z\nA button Neal as someone pointed out earlier with all these discoveries of bombs going on that it kind of moved the caravan off the front page of sorts but you posted something yesterday about the caravan and I I Want to do their share some of those thoughts with our listeners\nWell was it was a part or I should have a lot of it is or go on\nA first of all these people need to be stopped no doubt about it if somebody is breaking into your house you're allowed to stop them usually whatever force you need to use well these people are breaking into our house but\nLet me make this quick they are fleeing government's just simply that are unstable where they don't feel secure\nOr services are available jobs are available why are those countries unstable in many cases it's because of drug cartels\nThat control the politicians and control the government why did the drug cartels exist they exist because in this country we continue\nTo follow this wave of glee or inefficient and unworkable war on drugs there have been so many studies that say the way to handle drugs in this country efficiently is to treat\nPeople who have drug problems not true for the allies their use of drugs if you treat them they'll be off the drugs they will get on the drugs that drug sales among the drug pushers won't have customers they won't be buying from their suppliers\nTheir suppliers won't be barred from the cartels the cartels we'll lose our said she could return to government Central America and we won't have these people that are\nClamoring to leave and come to the United states but I also pointed out that it's really kind of weird what you're marching to ask for asylum but you're carrying the flag\nOf the country you want to escape while you're burning the flag\nOf the country you want to embrace you so the thing looks somewhat like a fraud but one of the key to stopping this is true in this asinine war on drugs\nAnd you'll have that same with the with the flags Neal is something that I really hadn't considered until you sure that picture\nThat they are marching under the flags of the country from which they come\nAnd and burning the flags in front of the country that they are marching too and that does seem that they counter intuitive to two people who are truly coming here to seek asylum\nAnd it irresponsible either they or Democrats to be blaming President Trump would suggest that he's possible for this particular series of\nAttempted attacks or attempts at at at threats um what I also think it's fair to say that the president should speak at war strongly against political violence he did the other night at his rally in Wisconsin but he also shouldn't advocate political bounds but she sometimes has in the past\nWhen you know where there was some uh unrest with some hecklers they say we should you know he said I you know there was a day when we used to be able to you know ... you know punch that like a punch that guy that type stuff\nReally during the election I was surprised by this\nJeff Zucker a couple of hours after his building was cleared out because one package was found it was addressed to John Brennan who's even work there he said this there's a total and complete lack of understanding of the White House about the seriousness of their continued attacks in the media the president especially the White House press secretary should understand their words matter does for the show no comprehension of that\nIs that fair [noise]\nWell I think the general critique is fair I mean he said something that's similar to what I said I don't think the United states should be even if he's joking which I think many of his defenders would suggest yeah I don't think the parts of the United states should be even joking about political violence or or supporting political violence\nBut there is a leap pier that that Jeff Zucker is making I think which is to tie the president's\nTo these specific events we just don't know enough about what's happened here may be the case that will learn that that somebody was somebody who's you know crazy was cut the president literally and then just\nAnd it to act on it but we don't know that yet and I think if you're responsible to speculate that way as well\nUh I Want you to hear what the president said last night a cut for\nAny acts or threats of political violence heart attack on our democracy itself [noise] no nation can succeed that tolerates violence or the threat of violence as a method of political intimidation conversion or control we all know that\nThat anyone on to blame the media cutting\nAs part of a larger national effort to bridge or divides and bring people together the media also has a responsibility to set a civil town just stop the endless hostility and constant negative and oftentimes false attacks and stores have to do\nSo um the that's the balance he struck last night and then he went to try to get Governor Walker another four years as ... as governor\n[noise] get look\nI think more of the former from the president didn't it'd be\nGood for the president the continued to say the kinds of things that he said where he is a decried political violence and and warned against that I Will say as somebody who's been critical of them in the past for the kinds of things that he said it is ironic to have Donald Trump lecturing people about civility suddenly I mean this is somebody who\nI think rose to the Republican nomination in part because\nPeople were eager for the kinds of Republican primary voters part we're eager for the kinds of confrontational the Sunday Times uncivil politics that he brought was\nPart of why he succeeded so it is ironic for him to to be saying to everybody wants to be civil but I'd much rather have him be saying that then saying the other or joking about beating up tournaments\nI mean you don't think that he would ever said himself I Hope some of my supporters go put package bombs to all my detractors I mean that just had to you Steve I got I got so and and the other thing is\nUh you have a Bernie Sanders supporter literally get a rifle and started trying to kill Republicans and he shoots ... almost dies at second base there and very few people are saying well that Bernie Sanders since the wrong tone\nRight and and look I mean I don't think Sanders has has said the kind of um inflammatory things that other politicians have said it's suggesting that his followers are inside political violence but remember after that the shooting the Washington Post read an article that suggest\nThat it was right wing talk radio that was responsible for the environment that was sad I mean if there is a certain sense in which the mainstream media goes to its old sort of script and an always wants to blame everything on conservatives in conservative talk radio and conservative\nMedia whether it's true or not it never to New York times just not long ago repeated the ... the false claims that the shooting of Gabby Giffords was inspired by a by Sarah Palin and her um you know we're targeting um so yeah there's there's sort of major um tendency\nBy some of the mainstream media to to immediately blame right wing talk shows and and what have you and it's not healthy either\nI mean I think that's part of the\nSaudi Arabia this was a top story this cause Yogi killing a democracy so he gets killed inside the embassy we all have every day we understand that Gina Haspel the CIA director heard the audio tape and\nIt was really compelling and horrifying and it seems as though we have almost all the pieces to put together and finally the Saudis went from he died in a fist fight too it seems to be a premeditated murder where are we going with this Steve\nIt's hugely problematic I mean obviously the the the Saudi story has evolved I mean initially they said that we don't even know where he is we don't know what happened to him he left\nYou know that their story has changed in every particular that it could possibly have changed so their current story I think has virtually no\nCredibility whatsoever and I mean the Turks are playing a dangerous game here I think by some dribbling out these leaks have suggested that they have this information that um that makes clear exactly what happened but not actually allowing the public to see that information when aired one gave his speech the other day uh once again\nBlaming the Saudis or what happened I think there was an expectation that he was going to provide some some real supporting evidence and he failed to do so and it's unclear exactly at this point why he failed to do so but I Would be helpful if we had those original recordings um that that apparently exist that Gina Haspel listen to [noise] so we have a better sense of exactly what happened but\nThis is a huge problem for the United states is a huge problem for President Trump a delicate dance to be done on the diplomatic\nFront he was Mohammed been so long the crown prince with all the power finally commenting yesterday cut forty nine\nThey a crime was really painful to all the Saudis ah and I believe it is a painful to every human in the world that is a is a crime that cannot be justified\nSo I don't know where they go from here but we do not want to break relations with them but there has to be some retribution people like Rand Paul want to use it as an opportunity to say we never should be in the middle east to begin with but with that but let's be practical Steve the it was the option\nWell look I mean Rand Paul's very exercised about\nThe Saudis but he's not nearly as exercise about ... who does this thing's routinely he's he's currently trying to get both ... push better relations with Vladimir Putin's Russia now in Congress so he's a bit of a hypocrite on that's what I think there has to be a tough response from the United states we have to make very clear that this is unacceptable you can't\nHave this way a as a as a an ally the United states\nParticularly as it relates to somebody who was living in the United states with a columnist for the Washington Post at residency here\nUm it's totally unacceptable you need to make that clear the the the balance I think the the difficult balance\nThere is all of the attention on what's happening here and on the Saudis ah gives sort of a reprieve to the Iranian regime which I think the Trump Administration has done a very effective job\nOf pressuring of sanctioning new sanctions set to kick in on November fourth I'm the administration is considering a some additional banking ah restrictions on the Iranians it's very important to keep up that pressure and the weaker the Saudis are a as a result of\nThe punishment that I think we have to ah to meet out here that the more that less Iran gives Iran a stronger\nHand in the region right and Leslie the midterms are we talk a few months ago it looked kind of grim for Republicans I don't know anybody that things are going to lose a Senate and I don't think anyone can rule out them holding the house although I still don't I don't think it's likely to happen\nYou cannot rule it out does that surprise you the house is still in play at this point\nYeah I mean I think the the historical midterm uh trends would certainly suggest that the incumbent party would not perform well and the fact that Republicans have ah any chance that hole in the house I think is\nIs a little bit of a surprise but if you look at it particularly if you look at the at the way that the the house seats are distributed you have twenty five house seats up\nIn districts that Hillary Clinton won in two thousand six teams so uh you know Democrats have to make some serious games if they want to take the house but I think you're right about the Senate and very few people think that the Senate\nIs is likely to go Democrat unless there's some kind of a you know if this blue wave that people have talked about forever suddenly re appears ah we we have a really terrific elections analyst at the Weekly Standard named David ... who's created this a Senate election model and he gives Republican now\nAn eighty percent chance of keeping the Senate and walks through that in great detail on on our website that we'd be standard dot com so he's he's done that the the hard work on this stuff has been looted that there is a pretty strong chance that Republicans keep the Senate\nA very interesting uh I you know which is amazing over oh Steve with all the bad books written on Trump and the chaos it was early he still about Ford between forty four I'm forty seven percent approval that's right where a bronco Obama Bill Clinton were in their first their first two years\nTo mainstream media polls this past weekend Trump with basically is highest of approval rating yet now the country's in incredibly divided on people who\nLike the guy tend to love the guy and the people who don't like the guy and the eight the guy um but the fact that he got approval ratings that or you know five six points higher than they were just a couple of months ago I think is one of the reasons that Republicans are looking a little bit\nNew
