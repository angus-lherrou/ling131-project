stop with the investigating and raising money and the president don't even bring up pokes because it should not be ... should be not be compared to what the Russians did on our election or didn't do so easily look right cabinet you're not going to hear much from in the future but here's what he felt he here's how he felt\nA yesterday of course this is great for him to court Justice Kennedy he was a court for him Kennedy loves him he was able to swear him in for his spot never before been done it happened in the White House and we'll make kind of walked in he got a standing ovation when Donald Trump made a speech he hit all the right notes with Brett Kavanaugh spoke here's what he said\nAlthough the ... Senate confirmation process tested me as it is tested others it did not change me my approach to judging remains the same [noise] a good judge must be an umpire\nA neutral impartial decider who favors no lid again or policy a judge must be independent and must interpret the law not make the law\nAnd what he's trying to say is that you might think I was nominated by a conservative president you might think Republicans solely back to me and only one Democrat got behind me and voted for me that he'd be going to owe the Republican something it's not the case it's not the way the Supreme Court works is that the way the justices were Britain you put it best cut ten\nThere's deporting difference between being a political conservative in a traditional conservative [laughter] sometimes the those things overlap but most of the time like basically do not a traditional conservative it was a judge looks at the case compares it to the law or the constitution and Israel looked and\nTo find new rights and new concepts that are not\nClearly put it in the statute or president of the constitution [noise] at the same time such charges tend to be reluctant to overturn existing president\n[noise] so that's why unless something is compelling about any decision\nAnd I'm not a legal expert but unless there's something compelling to overturn they won't and that's why Senator Susan Collins says I'm not worried about roe v Wade because I talked to him at great length and they believe there's nothing compelling enough to make him want to overturn we'll see how that goes\nNext in terms of the actual politics of it it's sickening and I think nobody's more embarrassing to the people of New York in my mind or to me personally\nThen ah Jerry ... Adler congressmen Jerry ... he said this a couple of days ago cut Nineteen\nThis has got to be thoroughly investigated I Hope the Senate will do so if he is on the Supreme Court ah and and the Senate has investigated than I than the house will have to\nReally so you're going to drag this out and bring the Supreme Court into it maybe you could even question him again remember as as divisive as as explosive as Justice Thomas in they need a hill was\nOnce you was over it was over only brought up again recently can anyone put anything behind them ever that's the problem no one sees above the fray ever so they don't want to lose I get that\nBut Mitch McConnell did a great job powering through but I Believe and Mitch McConnell in Donald Trump's final year Mitch McConnell should not put up a Supreme Court justice should Brier or a Ruth Bader Ginsburg retire say consistent with what you said before\nThat's what I think it will be one way to bring everyone together and said game on let's go have an election and I hate to tell you if you thought Trump or if you think Trump can't win reelection you haven't been paying attention\nHis approval ratings you know at forty one percent low I get it but CNN always reaching low it was thirty six when he just gets busy and gets to work at just a few questions in stays out of political unnecessary\nWell he is a machine he will be at sixty percent because oh he's doing his knocking off all of his things to do list which a lot of time going against traditional Republican thought\nFor example he is not necessarily anti union for example ripping up these trade deals that's pretty much something that Democrats are always talked about\nWere the most part the trade deals with something Republicans work done even though NAFTA was passed by Bill Clinton it was proposed by George Bush forty one\nSo a lot of these things that are going to raise wages because of the new NAFTA it's something that Democrats have talked about in the past taking on China something Democrats talk about it's hard to hate someone who's doing a lot of what really helps you unless you're a political walk or a poet politician and only\nSee victory or defeat Jonathan Turley said this about the process he's more concerned than I Am and I'm concerned cut twenty three there seems to be\nA new development where we've given license for people to be an arranged to feel that they no longer have to be fair and empathetic and a people have to wonder you know it's a lot like the old saying about Saturn that revolutions like Saturn devouring very young\nThe Democrats have to be very careful than leash this they may find that it comes back to haunt them in years to come\nAnd we're talking about pounding on the Supreme Court door we're talking about interrupting every vote was screens and as for the Supreme Court judge associate justice\nKavanaugh takes to the takes to goes beyond the bench today you just know they're going to break precedent and start screaming again you're talking about storm in the halls of the Senate interrupting dinners around the city of Washington and around the country\nThat's what we're seeing on a regular basis Mike Pence seen the big demonstrations his credit he won through it the president with a forty one percent approval rating or so that is something that he feels good about because they are going up\nNot going down in terms of the generic poll with the Gallup people it's just a seven point difference the Democrats are favored to take the house but it's anything but locked up the battle for the Senate Republicans are doing much better\nTake a look at this I mean you have Kramer in front of Heidi Heitkamp be for the last vote us now Marsha Blackburn making it clear she supports Kevin\nAnd now British didn't say any wouldn't support Kavanaugh so it looks like an eight point lead but Marsha Blackburn in Tennessee she was trailing almost the entire time and then when you talk about other areas like Joe Manchin Joe Manchin might be locked in wherever there's a big reprisal and blowback among Democrats\nIn West Virginia because I Believe he did the right thing he studied he evaluated and said well maybe it's too conservative for me but he certainly qualified and he voted them through so these are some of the things that have taken place\nSince the mid term then we'll take some calls on that are from here on in Ari Fleischer obviously a Republican but understands communications like few people that I Know thinks the message is going to resonate from Kavanaugh with the Republicans who finally have a reason to rally cut twenty six\nIf conservatives sit at home so that the election the way the two thousand sex Republicans are dead in the water as a result of the capital Harris conservatives get fired up they said we're turning out there's too much on the line you can have a very different election as so far it's all been in the Democrats' favor last for weeks it may shaft\nIt is and it's going to go down to the wire I think the Senate might be said also if you factor in Florida\nYou know the ... the president's party may lose Nevada\nBut may and I think they're gonna they're up in Florida with Governor Rick Scott he is now has a hurricane sadly slamming into a state but the one thing about Rick Scott is a CEO he knows how to handle these hurricanes in particular he thrives on adrenaline and he's about three hours sleep so he has also an opportunity to help run the centers who needs some help\nTo take his job as governor so to say at this as a congressman from Florida is by his side and kill 'em it's got to stay home and be a mayor of Tallahassee where it's been anything but crime free and a home free\nThat might work to his advantage so

Travis and the Alamo and that's where it's a reference to but it's just tearing\nYeah I think we are seeing a a big problem here in Texas I mean I live in a congressional district is represented by a

if you actually look at the issues he's been working to run out of state tax is Gillum going to run on I'm going to be actually he's running on I Will give Florida a state tax and full Medicare for

way\nBecause if you feel a certain way that is more important and you can show everybody all the facts or you can show no none of the facts 'cause there was no facts to show\n\nAnd people are going to

old the sky is falling and we're all gonna die scenario now people say oh you're just one of those ... and that's all your client cars easy to say that and I always laugh right and I look at this and I say look I don't deny the climate change and I don't deny that we have\nAn effect on it because there's seven billion of us of course we have some sort of effect how much of an effect we have that can be debated and that's where the debate should start but the problem is is it's become\nAn us versus them say remember 'cause you're evil if you don't buy into this and what I Try to explain to people out there who are all about climate change is what you want to do and the way that you want to do it\nDo you understand the ramifications for countries for business for economies at for even yourself\nAnd it's no it's what's with the client I get to know one of those few but still I feel I feel that we're just hit the polar bears which say this and say that and I've always said you know it's about the Intergovernmental Panel on climate change the I. P. C. C. so vitally important\nWhen you work for a government agency\nAnd the climate changes in there what do you need to have happened to make sure that you continue to move forward climate change I always ask people on the left why are you so excited to get more power\nTo restrict more of everybody else to any kind of government entity to any ...\nAnd the less loves to do that they want to make government the central part of everything in your life that's what they want they want bigger government they want government to be so much so and when I was your people in let's say well the reason I don't know how anybody\nWhat reason can you give me for anybody who's poor and votes for Republican and I said but you you're missing the point\nA lot of what you're looking at is is is you think because they're poor or because you're not looking at the fact that they believe in liberty they believe in the second of all they believe in our constitution they believe in the person's right to fail or succeed they don't believe in government is the end all to bill you know classic\nLiberal is not a bad thing somebody who believes in liberty the individual and when it comes to something like climate change they don't understand why anybody would go against that and I'm trying to explain to him it's because how they were approaching\nThat drives people crazy if we start coming together and started talking about this in a real way\nRight we're ... we we discuss how we can make things better and we change it from climate change any any political\nCraziness to how do we better serve the environment because it serves us\nYou're going to find out you're going to go along a lot further\nA lot further but you can't\nBecause it is politics and there's a group of people a large group of people who screaming shout who name call their whole goal is to get you to do whatever they can get you to do to hand over power not to themselves but to somebody else\n\nAnd that's that's where I draw the line we need to take better care of this country we need to take better care of this world we need to take better care of our home our environment like clean water clean air all of us do but the way that you approach\nThings goes\nA long way to how you\nActually can find solutions to problems\nAnd turning over stuff to countries and two two governments and to the un is not a way that I think many people out there on the right want to deal with things\n'cause I've yet to meet somebody who wants dirty air dirty water who's on the right they just want to be able to do things in a way that is going to be both economically feasible and less restriction three two three five three twenty four twenty three at\nYou had mentioned shows your Twitter you can tweet at us take our poll are

you just never know you don't\nBut the reality is is that that she is done and uh she stepped out and I I think she's done a very good job I think she went into a position\nWhere\nThere was some some you know we had kind of decided to throw ourselves\nAt the mercy of the world we're sorry for the exceptionalism we're sorry for all the stuff that we are we started reading it you know for all of these things and and and and and and\nWe'll give in to a lot of stuff and you know what we went back out there and and she set the path that Trump wanted or is that and and she did it and a lot of

some stuff there and on top of that you got ... now and you've got Fulton and both of them are kind of running the show so she's kind of the the her her need if you will has has really kind of shrunk

Democrats are so energized in so many Democrats were so outraged by Kevin ... justice Kavanaugh's confirmation\nThat they there weren't any very vigorous protests which allows Republicans to describe them as a mob which is seen as the war and you have seen going is at the White House and on the hill I'm an ... I think it's a trap for Democrats\nAnd by the way and that leads me to my second\nA talking point and that is uh what will that will all the anger a voice against Brett Kavanaugh due for Republicans it has brought them together Senator Lindsey Graham says I've never seen the Republican Party so galvanize and it's because they thought were unfair hits and I do I do too and Brett Kavanaugh\nWe're talking about how many beers yet in high school and then we're talking about sexual assaults he doesn't remember that could be cooperated I don't want to go through that again but bottom line is the Republican or Democrat had high interest\nNow the Republicans do I hope it benefits in a huge turnout\nAnd Susan Page says right now it's pretty clear that helped Republicans but remember the number one story short time ago was Michael Cohen we're talking about Paul Manafort you know we were talking about the president's approval rating dropping to one poll thirty six percent now it's up to forty one on the rise must be tracking poll it's up to fifty percent\nAnd now we see that he doesn't mind going out everywhere you'll be in Pennsylvania today I Will yesterday and campaigning here was Tucker Tucker said last night with Brett cut twenty three\nThere shouldn't be a blue wave of history as a guide\nAnd if the president's numbers are the main factor but there may not be because when you ...\nBut people in restaurants and block traffic impact on the front door of the Supreme Court when you lose you scare normal people Democrats were losing their\nEye hundred percent agree but right out here the numbers prior to the cabin on a verdict where he gets confirmed it goes on the bench\nThere were a total of sixty eight seats that were held by Republicans that are firmly in play rated as lean Republican or worse for the GOP presenting a stark contrast to the Democrats who only have about six that are leading Democrat that normally or a Democrat so if you look at the numbers right now the political was put together this two hundred and nine seats there and the Democrats camp\nNine shy of what they need but as we saw\nSo many states and twenty sixteen with too close to call and they ended up going Republican from Florida to Wisconsin to Michigan get it\nSo the same thing if they're within striking distance and this thing called momentum happens and there's a fear of voting for Donald Trump's forty so you don't really be honest to a poster\nMatch interesting maybe there are if you're close it might be a lot closer so if you look at the issues that matter fifty percent of the country plus one healthcare\nAnd keep believing that the Democrats are beginning to run on Obamacare for the first time ever because it's better than what we have now which is we're in between plans nothing and everything and Leslie Hillary Clinton listen to her cut thirty\nThere cannot be civil with a political party that wants to destroy what you found for what you care about that's why I Believe if we are fortunate enough to win back\nThe house and or the Senate that Clinton ... can start again\nYou crazy because you lose an election you don't have to be civil that's OK to scream at Ted Cruz cures to Nielsen and demonstrate outside Steven Miller's office it's okay to shoot up a baseball practice it almost killed Steve squeezed and everybody else because you can't be civil because you'll lose elections\nReally I mean I can see a demonstration but they are paying people to stream it other people in elevators in around the buildings in at their house\nAnd Hillary Clinton Seventy plus washed up a loser of two presidential bid to rig the game to win the primaries has that they say oh yeah and then I mentioned she's got a few excuses cut thirty one\nRepublicans have systematically suppress voter probably as many Christie on as twelve million voters were purged by Republicans governments and state between twenty twelve and twenty sixteen\nSo we know that Democrats have to turn out an even bigger numbers and a lot of congressional district and they can be successful because they're\nBeing you know pushback by a headwind that is trying to prevent them or discourage them from voting\n... idea of a Christian poor I Know she's a legend\nBut how about a follow up question of where the hell did you get that number what are you even talking about twelve million votes have been suppressed by Republicans and Hillary Clinton no wallflower has let that happen\nTo anybody else back that up could you please explain to me how twelve million votes go away
