insurance just for the big things and we've tried to ensure everything top down and that's led to the last you know really a good ten years of\nInsurance premiums that have doubled or tripled we need to do is insured less which is how every other insurance products works they keep it that is means doctors have to make more of the services they provide affordable\nAnd they can if they cut out the middleman and streamline than a simple\nAnd how big is your practice how many patients do you have in your facility the atlas MD in Wichita\nIn Wichita we have five doctors in over thirty two hundred patients\nUnbelievable and your age and you give concierge care at all I could pick up a phone and I'm getting a doctor at three in the morning that it's going to answer my call\nYou do you have and I could go down and see somebody at three AM in the morning\nIf you need stitches or is it true emergency you know a lot of history and phone calls or chest pain which we might send the ER but a lot of times the kid who's sick and a mom who's worried and um you of if you can avoid the ER you can avoid a thousand or two thousand dollar bill\nThat's how you get health care health insurance is a card in your wallet healthcare is access to your doctor yeah\nAll right and it happened and how many other practices around the country have you been able to to provide your model that they have duplicated how you you've been out and about and a champion of this for a long time\nYet we've helped over five hundred and fifty doctors convert to this model in the last few years but there's about a thousand total there forty eight states every state except north and South Dakota right now but we have one about to launch North Dakota [noise]\nUm and then it's even gotten a little bit international so um this is a a sound tried and true model\nNow and what do you do Dr gross in terms of your president of duck a doctor patient care foundation\nYou know now that we have alternatives that are working real life experiences seems to me that we ought to be able to duplicate it a lot more than we are\nAbsolutely a so doctor patient care foundation was a physician on health policy because doctors never seem to be at the table whenever we're having a conversation about health care\nSo we put traditions about getting back to the table to help these conversations personally I I also have a primary care practice much like that lets them either at southwest Florida a practice Kissimmee health are pissed me was you know why are we using insurance to pay for health are for basic primary care services\nSolid does is create ...\n... ... ... ... points with Dr Josh and we're seeing patients come to us\nFrom all over the state of Florida and even from outside of the country\nWhere ... medical tourism are and what we're finding is that you know not not the same thing got about health insurance we're just using it and you know when somebody is you know pay twice the amount of money for a service because they just are how some shots one ensuring is using insurance drives up the cost of the product\nSo a number I cashed parts for us is two hundred and twenty dollars while using your your commercial insurance you know we go through all the the hoops ticket it authorized\nYour co pays five hundred dollars or so we we see this time and again the more people are coming out of pocket to pay for health health or\nI'll let you signed up to ... more insurance seems to be becoming an optical I'm an ... solution so but I'm pleased to see what the worst shifting the conversational from a coverage for everyone I'm Talking about reducing the cost of health care\nThat they're real close enough I was about to testify on us some help committee on the ... topic\nIt be a better idea that me and I'm watching for example they have this race out in California everybody's shock the gab anew\nBring free health care for everybody whether your pay our taxpayer whether you're in the ... the state legally or illegally everybody's got to get free health care well I basically put a sign that says come to California but you get sick\nUm but there's people are going to go there now what's interesting to me is that a Republican is within striking distance in\nThat gubernatorial race out in California because instinctively people no we can't afford to pay for every illegal immigrant in the country are but the reality is is that if I Lived in Wichita, Kansas I Would be a part of atlas empty and I would be your patient\nDr ... because I I think it's the best deal I liked the idea of being able to call my\nDoctor whenever I'm sick or if I have a kid that sick every parent wants the ability to do that and your preserved for service provides it for fifty bucks a month now how much is the average in Wichita, Kansas catastrophic plan of it but the big things heart attack a accident or cancer how much we're one of those plans cost\nAbout five hundred dollars to family five hundred dollars per year or a month a month\nOr so and the current rates closer to you know a thousand twelve hundred a across the nation people are paying more for health insurance each month and they're paying for their mortgage if\nThe Trump tax cuts only put a hundred dollars per household per month in and they're being credited with the economic boom of your four point two percent GDP\nIf we fix health insurance we could put five hundred dollars back in the pocket of every household a the the real ... and the the politician there has in California is to send them on a ridge analogy destroying\nMore money at the problem has never fixed it what we're doing is Dr Lee and ourselves and and a thousand other physicians is is innovating and saying how do we get much cheaper how do we make it so patients don't have co pays how do we provide stitches for no cost because they're so affordable\nI'm actually looking at ways it's fundamentally fixing the system that's what we need not just promises of more spending\nWay and if I could add up to that just a a you know as far as the cost of care you know people ask us as well how can I just get major medical you know we\nWe can afford what what services the ... primary care practice is providing but we just need something catastrophic well I'm a care made that illegal\nAh so little stretching just offshore won't get access to these later medical plans called ... short term medical plans and you know some would argue that these are actually true insurance they don't cover anything except the major medical expenses for Seventy five dollars a month or\nTwo but what it is this going to be implemented easily city by city town by town we can duplicate the model\nIt already does take care of individuals with preexisting conditions if somebody wants to sign up for outlets them day and they have a preexisting condition a doctor or do you deny them service\nEverybody's welcome and everybody's price the same just based on age um we know we're going to work harder for some patients ... will not have to work as hard for other patients and we don't want to be judged by their illness\nHow did you get to who directly negotiate these prices with these pharmaceutical companies\n[noise] boy I I Wish I could say was because we're so darn good at it um the truth is it's so much more simple than that I\nHave a doctor's in forty four states are allowed to work directly with pharmaceutical wholesalers so just like you can go to Costco and get something for much cheaper because you pay a membership we do the same thing and we're able to\nGet the you know the actual cost of medicine might be at ten dollars for a thousand pills and because we don't have a staff of seven people per physician fighting insurance\nWe can lower the cost and in past the savings on directly to the patient ... this is a win for everybody we we don't take care of of Republicans or Democrats we take care of people\nSo how does somebody had a group of doctors in New York say implement those because they're going to look at this and say fifty bucks a month I Can't make ten cents off of that\nWhere they have to move to New York because they don't make it easy but they could work with a pharmacist in New York state's one of the few states that make it a very difficult but then a pharmacist could say um if you do a five dollar a month membership with them then you get the medicine that cost that would be an amazing model it it would cut down there\nRight let's take her to York out of the equation for California out of the ... let's say any other state Louisiana Florida um I don't know Missouri yeah how do they do it\nIt's as simple as signing up effect shopping on Amazon there's there's almost nothing to it um\nYou know we have one supplier that makes it very easy overnight shipping and that's just it if I Want to buy a bottle of a hundred pills a blood pressure medicine I can if I Want to buy a thousand pills I Can't and it's about the same price um but it's fundamentally cheaper than\nWhat about Lindsey Graham is saying that what only block grant the money that we're already providing to individual states and let them come up with these innovative you know like centers of innovation all around the country and I think naturally people would move toward your system\nI I I Would agree with the logic or the federal government's basically saying we've given your money with strings attached before and we haven't received full value for that because we've wage you down with regulatory burden so we're going to cut those strings and just give you the money and say go forth and do the best job that you can write a\nQuick break we'll come back more with Dr Josh amber outlets MD and Dr Lee as grows president

are show rabbit that they don't care about fairness they just care about their own political agenda however misplaced in wrong it may be\nAnd show you're never going to change their minds there is no reasoning with on reasonable people so we'll just have to wait and see it's up to the Republican Party I think and and the candidates and indeed President Trump to maintain the momentum going forward over the next twenty seven days\nLook the hell out of great article today about what their agenda is and they the Democrats have big plans none of which will help the country\nOr they want to shore up Obamacare which has been nothing short of a disaster for the American people\nThey want more Dodd Frank financial rules to protect quote dreamers and the integrity of elections in other words they want massive amnesty they want to aggressively probe any single thing they can they want this country locked down into endless investigation and likely the impeachment of Donald Trump\nThey you know Republicans celebrate the passage of the biggest tax cutting history they refer to as crumbs\nAnd they're saying it's time to take the crumbs back I guess the crumbs or the most delicious part of the meal um so all of this is in jeopardy dam bond you know I don't see a waning in people's enthusiasm now I think they have they went so far in the cabin or case I'm frankly in the last two years what we have witnessed with the\nAnd you chronicled lives in your new book\nYou know the the attempt to sabotage of the president I think they see the fundamental unfairness and nothing they stand for is going to help the average American I have a better life\nRight and showing the media and Greg just nailed it by the very you know the media and the Democrats ... ... it's it's it's symbiotic guy I mean it it's a host\nAt a at a parasite at this point they're the same thing they have gender up this rage not all of them but many of them against Donald Trump to such an intense point me think about the things showing that have come out I mean new lows in politics\nDonald Trump's Supreme Court nominee hold the rapist Donald Trump called the treat treat guilty of treason ... a crime literally punishable by death that's not hyperbolic\nHe thinks he's been called trees is they ginned up the base so much on that here's the problem the Democrats have created for themselves and the election that in order to\nSeem like the more anti Trump candidate to get that money in those volunteers for your twenty twenty presidential campaign or to get that money in the midterms what do you have to do you have to oppose the trader you have to oppose the train rapist or whatever it's sick name they call the capital\nSo that that's what's leading to this a psycho pathology on the left\nAnd I agree I I don't see this waning and I do see Republican voters saying listen\nWhen is enough enough you attack this that this American patriot and cabinet or you try to take down the Trump Administration weaponize and the government when is enough enough and I think they're going to show up I Hope I pray they do\nWell what do you think about Hillary's endorsement of ah the incitement of getting in people's space and you can't be civil suit basically calling for instability you you can't really civil with the political party\nThat wants to destroy what you stand for what you care about and then the other comments made by people like Maxine Waters and others getting their base follow him into a grocery store is following the gas stations confront them chase them out of restaurants which we have seen going on and on a on a regular basis\nFor Republicans it is absolutely wonderful you know they ought to send an early Christmas gift to Hillary Clinton Michael ... Maxine Waters Jerry Adler Nancy Pelosi many of those individuals are calling for\nA V. investigation and teach men to Brett Kavanaugh which Americans realize is wrong and preposterous I could certainly explain how in a legal basis\nImpeachment is not possible for Brett Kavanaugh but the more that these toxic individuals' and all of the ones I mentioned\nEspecially Hillary Clinton are toxic uh the more that only drives Republican voters to the polls to make sure that these people are not ah in positions of power and will not be able to ruin the accomplishments\nOf Donald Trump which have been incredible you know in the course of two years he's accomplished more than Brock Obama did in eight years the greatest level of American economic growth and prosperity in modern American history and that is not\nJust made up there I mean the statistics demonstrate that and so if Americans want to maintain that prosperity 'em and add you know money to their wallets into private\nAh from government officials who loved just squander hard earned money from American taxpayers are their choices easy\nAll I did like Kevin McCarthy introduced which was a bill to fully fund the Trump border wall\nOr the president has already spent about what three three and a half billion dollars you needs about twenty three billion dollars more to get the job done and I think that is certainly one of the big issues that Americans would be motivated to go out and vote for and the other I think\nYou know the president rightly said he could make as many as four more Supreme Court appointments that is a massive issue at this point at it it's a tipping point for the courts you know if you think of the age and the health of some of the justices that there is no doubt that will be vacancies in the in years to come in the near future\nYeah and don't forget showing that the circuits in the district court the Supreme Court gets all of the attention you know it's the sexy story the highest court in the land quite obviously\nBut his Greg can tell you most of these cases that are ... reports to American businesses American individuals moms and dads out there are settled that the circuit court level they don't even make it to the Supreme Court and Trump already has was uh twenty six appoint east of the circuit courts\nThere's a couple of more are getting ready to have to be confirmed as well\nSo this is a really big deal now um we have of course the Ginsburg seat a you know they could come open if Trump wins reelection bid may come up and\nI ... and I say that Sean I'm worried I mean I mean it I'm actually worried what will happen to the country if that seat that it gives birth decides to step down I mean look what we just witnessed would cabinet can you imagine what's gonna happen if that seat comes open as a potential six three conservative majority and the courts\nI mean it is genuinely frightens me at a at a again that's not melodramatic I worry for my kids what will happen\nQuick break we'll have more with Dan bungee no and great Jared on the other side listen I found the best coffee you've ever had in your life if you're tired of going to those big liberal

David the Pfizer warrant signed by a career law enforcement person\nSwearing that what you are presenting to the court is true and that you know it to be true and affirmed it to be true well\nThat didn't work out what the third renewal by the application in the case of Carter Page a which is the fourth buys a warrant issued but the fourth one that was signed was signed by Rod Rosenstein\nAnd we all know that the bulk of information that was put in the ... well that was based on the pony Clinton bought and paid for dot CA that not even Christopher Steele stands by to this day\nAnd that was never verified never corroborated and has turned out to be mostly debunked which is among the many other conflicts that Rod Rosenstein has of course\nHe's the one that recommended firing Jim Comey he's the one that signed the visor warrants he's the one that appointed Mueller\nAnd are now he was scheduled to appear tomorrow under oath and a two sources now telling Fox News at this hour that Rod Rosenstein scheduled appearance before the house Judiciary Committee is at an impasse\nOver the terms of the testimony\nAnd he doesn't want to have a transcribed interview under oath which is the standard for congressional taskforce interviews\nAnd those close to Rosenstein say well he prefers a meeting or a briefing with the house Judiciary Committee chairman and other lawmakers where there's no paper trail where there's no under oath part well the question is why we be afraid to go under oath\nWell here to weigh in on this and much more\nUh as as in past continues Mark Meadows is the Freedom Caucus chairman and congressman Jim Jordan of Ohio also Freedom Caucus member a end by the way would be in the house Judiciary Committee\nAll the interview of Rod Rosenstein um we also have learned in the last three days Mark Meadows I'll start with you that we now know that Lisa Page\nAndrew McCabe the deputy FBI Director who is under criminal investigation Lisa Page who is out at the FBI James Baker the top attorney at the FBI they all are telling the same story that Rod Rosenstein said that he wanted to surreptitiously record the president of the United states\nIn the hopes of being able to get him to say something that would allow them to invoke the twenty Fifth Amendment so we there's a lot of questions for Rod Rosenstein at this moment\nWell there are a lot of questions I think probably the bigger question is why would Rod Rosenstein\nOr not be prepared to come to Congress tomorrow to clear his name\nAnd I think the reason for that is there there are credible witness is you know your lead in had Rod Rosenstein voice saying well you know the needs to be facts and we have the rule of law well we're willing to to consider him innocent until proven guilty\nHim not coming tomorrow indicates a that there is real credibility with these witnesses that suggested that he not only wanted to take the president but he wanted to use those tapes a to effectively have a de OJ who on the president of United States\nWell he met with the president apparently earlier this week and blue on air force one does anyone know what the result of that meeting was\nWell I think the biggest thing is uh Shaun is is a let's don't read too much into a flight on air force one I think it's the president trying to be reasonable and hear rod side of the story I think the president has been extremely measure\nI tell you who's not measured at this particular point\nUh you've you've got Rod Rosenstein believing that he can hide behind the fact that he's the number two at the oj I

invoking the twenty Fifth Amendment what else do we need to get a subpoena for somebody\nWell uh hopefully I I Would I Would not encourage giving out anybody's phone number in your ... holding people accountable but here's what I Would say is the fact that you're covering it your listeners and the people that are truly tune in on a regular basis to listen to you\nThey need to make sure their member of Congress feels the heat and understands how important this is but the other part of that is is Gemini or or tried to work today\nOr to to stress the importance of why transparency and and the fact that the deputy attorney general much caught me at\nA bus raises right in and say this is what I did and this is what I didn't do anything shy of that\nUh really uh would would be an indictment on his credibility\nYeah what about the president now talked about the classifying and releasing the un redacted by the applications especially pages ten through twelve Seventeen through thirty for the final buys a warrant the one that Rod Rosenstein side have either have you seen that particular Pfizer application\nI had not shown we need to see that we need to see it and don't take an after every time roots or goes in and talks with yeah yeah I remember Mr or told us\nThat after each conversation he had with Glenn Simpson and Chris steel he would then contact person at the FBI and he would sit down with them and they would take notes we want to see all those notes of all those conversations we know there are at least twelve adult\nSo the so called trio too as we need to see those and remember when the president first talked about e classifying what we all asking to do this three weeks ago he talked about any communications from Andy McCabe page all those documents as well that would include ... numbers so we we need all that information\nAnd again it's it's a real good sign that read it and you're dead talks about how our great system of justice works\nKey to that is transparency give us the information that we need to see it more important the American people need to say\nWell do you want to call chairman Gowdy it's too old to two to five six zero three zero

camera says and again in this three dimensional sculpture so the tail spelled T and the other shapes of the sculpture spell it the rest of the letters\nIn this artist's name\nPoint now where people will be able to meet him as he actually on site he's\nNot here for our own Czechoslovakia independence day I Wish she was we um as a small nonprofit were able to work with the Czech government and our an embassy in Washington DC for the Czech Republic\nWith grant funding we will ever be able to bring young to the ...\nTwice once in August so he could come and installed the works and again\nFor our kind of close the reception day I'm a meet and greet with the artists on December second but he is Prague base so again we're extremely excited to have this rising star from the Czech Republic exhibiting this art and you can see it all on checklist stocking independence day\nAnd the messages that would come out in his graffiti I take it their political in nature\nChick you early um he's a very sophisticated artists again it's all contemporary modern art so I don't really want to speak for young um but his artwork as our real\nBright palate very vibrant but also restrained and sophisticated so he's come a long way as a graffiti artists from the guy who is tagging cars at New York um to what we see now which is extremely refined and an gallery ready um so I guess it's more of a celebration of\nThe check people's evolution and their cultural I'm evolution over a hundred years and we're allowing yawn to evolve as an artist as well so you're going to see something a little bit more refined\nYeah I think people listening because I I had this reaction myself when you hear the word graffiti you automatically in your mind get an idea of what it looks like is that sort of a stereotype what we're going to see and young yeah\nYeah I'm we're calling it the soul of graffiti 'em as much to where he's coming from and again in a ... to the Democratic nature of the art form a spray paint and the insulation in Korea and site was done indeed with spray paint\nSo he is remaining true to those roots but I think you're going to see something very refreshing and very cool not necessarily what you expected\nAnd if you would speak more to the checklist locking in connection album logic and you know how he came to the U.S and how he made his way down here in retirement\nYeah it's a fascinating story and again on the open house day You're welcome to tour his historic home and learn the story first hand with our do since\nYou can watch the video if you like [noise] um and and to her or his his studio where he lived and worked in creative many other works on the site but essentially Mr ... was born in Eighteen Seventy nine and what was at that time\nPart of the Austria Hungarian empire so he didn't know democracy and the way we know it until he immigrated to the United states in Nineteen oh one\nHe worked as a figure Carver for a lot of the cathedral throughout the Midwest in its early use\nHe put himself through school learn English save money you know the whole American Dream and eventually went on to become the chair of the sculpture department at the art Institute of Chicago and that was a position he held I'm from er about Thirty years from about Nineteen sixteen to bought Nineteen forty nine\nAnd in Nineteen forty nine he came to Winter Park Florida\nFor his retirement home and he designed the studio at that you'll see in your old says it on your tour in Nineteen forty nine and lived here throughout the rest of his life so much of the schools pure heat did\nCreated right here inspired by our views um some of them are still in their original locations where very true to the original studio experience that you can see the tools he worked with 'em and learned his remarkable immigrant success story\nWhat do you think and I'm I'm sure you've given this some thought what do you think he would think about this event you're putting together for the twenty eight\nI think he'd be really pleasantly surprised and delighted that we're still I'm continuing this legacy and especially honoring his check with the Viking heritage he was such a proud check American um you can see this\nThis pride in his art work I'm In the political themes that you'll see on display um his most famous for doing the Woodrow Wilson monuments which is in the capital city of the Czech Republic Prague um so ... you can see some of these great political works um and I think\nHis check heritage really comes through in ... the artist\nBedroom which you can to her\nAnd you'll see a lot of wonderful Czechoslovakia and heritage objects um folk art and kind of simplistic designs a bright color and the studio exterior itself is all Czechoslovakia and patterns and colors that again he designed himself [noise]\nUm so you can't really escape his ethnicity you when you come here and we really embrace that and try and educate people on\nYou know catching up on more what history which week let's face it we all need a reminder of every now and then\nUm again it's been a hundred years\nSo it's worth celebrating it and talking about and learning about it\nAnd to that effect we will be having um a lecture in our Cape and health facility on site at two PM so those of you who might want to learn a little bit more about the political time period and specifically Woodrow Wilson who's our twentieth president\nAnd he helped get us through World War one uh we have a new and professor ya Nick Missouri Kowalski\nAnd he is um specialize in is in us

point five [noise]\nBest heroin speaking to Susan Mitchell\nAlso welcome back thank you always glad to be on with you we have fun that way every single time\nAnd for everybody we talk about is nutrition ... and Michel in nutrition experts and we're going to be talking today about some questions that I through your way and of course anything that comes up but I did want to ask you first 'cause I always try to throw out a stump or question for you\nWhy do my grapes say includes so fights because these are grapes on the stem and I was washing them and then suddenly I notice why does it bring out so fights on the labels\nAnd I'm really glad you asked that question because others have probably notice it and are saying hey I've seen that on my grades as well but you will also see this on some wine bottles the reason why is because some people are allergic to solve flights it is one of those items that people can react to and so\nBecause there have been enough people who have an allergic and the past it's one of the things that you see lifted if it's used to give people a warning because if you know you are and you see it you're going to say okay\nI'm not going to pick up that item or whatever but it's often used a self fighting a giant\nUsually as some type of either in a washer preservative or to like keep the grapes fresh as they're traveling and many times they'll just say wash them before you eat them is that what it said\nThat is what it said and I started wearing then because I always wash the grapes but did I wash them enough on it\nAnd I and hopefully so most things that are on the outside well wash right off easily and typically there is people say okay Dan does that go into the great [noise]\nUsually not very much and tests that they've done they wouldn't allow that if it was a high percentage because again it would cause a problem that people who are allergic so usually it's it's not and that's why they want to let you know\nI just rent vegetables and fruit with water is that enough because I remember back in the day I see ads for that special vegetable wash\nLike vegetable washes used to be very popular but as a research has found a good brisk wash with water is fine for your fruits and vegetables and it is actually the same thing that I Do but I Will tell you one little tip did you ever wash your chickens\nBefore you or your turkey before you cook that many people do you don't do that anymore so no need to wash them when you're cooking your meat if\nThere's any bacteria on it it will be killed during that point but what we found is that when you were watching it the bacteria was just going onto your hands and I think and so unless you sanitized with a good you know ... bleach wash that\nBacteria just went there but it really wasn't a reason to try to get a clean bird with a shower you know it was taken care of with it when\nYou know that's good to know a cause Thanksgivings coming up I was still doing that in the cavity watered\nDown here to do that anymore so I'm just save yourself one step and preparing what you're doing\nLike anybody wants me to do [laughter]\nAll right back to the nutrition news and and what's going on right now I told you that I'd like to hear about eggs number one it wasn't too long ago that there was the big scare when the eggs and number two we hear that eggs are good for this condition and bad for that condition\nAfraid what do I do it's okay first of all no need to be fearful let's start with bacteria first because that brings on a lot of fear because every now and then salmonella raises its ugly head right and you hear about salmonella not just in eggs but\nAnd a berries and spinach I mean that's been a number of items over time\nAnd this happens for various reasons but yes recently there was a recall on eggs because they were found to have salmonella salmonella is one of the bacteria that causes food poisoning and it can make you very very sick including hospitalization and such so\nYou want to of course not have that happen to you what do you do that well if you're in the recall you donate that product store to return them to the store but and they only let me\nJust a bump in there are a little bit because I think for some of us we assume well if you cook it it kills off whatever the salmonella is\nIt should but but it should in theory but what you don't know is\nWhere is the salmonella on the outside of the egg on the inside of the day you touch it and it's on the outside have you done just cross contaminated it to something else it is not worth the risk because a lot of times they're not quite sure they just know\nThat when they figure it out there's bacteria and it's making people sick so I Would tell you any time there's a recall and you have one of the numbers\nThat says oh that's my product\nGet rid of it or take it back to the store and get a refund because it happens we're getting we're becoming a country that's much stronger on where things are produced and how and monitoring it's getting better and better just like Europe is and we need that so that\nBy the time we figure it out people have not consume these items and they're sick were that we get ahead of the game and that we're able to monitor and we are seeing that improving the U.S which is a good\nThing let me let me also toss out this is a little sidebar whether you're talking about meet her eggs or whatever I realized not long ago when I tend to do is I take the eggs out of the car and I have my little special container\nWith me we would take it out and freeze some of it and I don't have those original barcode Sheikh cetera when I Do that so if there was a recall I wouldn't know\nThat is correct you might be better to just leave your ...\nAnd the original carton until you cook than let's say you hard boil them then that's a good time to put them in some little carrier that you have or whatever you're using and by the way let's say you go home tonight and hard boiled eggs are a great thing to take for lunch or to have her breakfast\nHow long should they sit in the refrigerator ask the hard ball there because I Will tell you I've been guilty and I have to remind myself of um two weeks go by and I've still got hard boiled eggs what do you think is a good rule of thumb\nYou know they never last that long that's a good thing but but there is a point at which and maybe it's after just a few days in fact when I feel like if I leave the shell on appeal it they taste more rubbery and you know there's not any flavor\nOK and exactly and I usually tell people a week is a good amount of time so if you're going to hard boil them for whatever breakfast salads however you use them\nUse them up within a week that lessens your chance for any type of food poisoning down the road that is one thing now what about if you bring them home how what what is the best way to keep from risk because believe it or not\nBacteria can be in the egg containers south it can be on the shelves and that you can even go through the shale to the egg so if I Am just crack you want to dispose of it because if there is a bacteria it'll make a you know be line through that crack into the eggs so anytime there's a crack get rid of that\nAnd what I tell people remember that until you cook the eggs it's considered wrong even though it's and the show so it needs to be kept separate like you're on me like you were talking about a minute ago\nAnd when you cook those that when you take ... out and you put them into however you're going to cook them scramble them into a pot too hard boil them once you've done that wash your hands before you do anything else in the food safety world we call that cross contamination you can't see that\nYeah you really can't smell and so if there's bacteria and the carton or on eggshells you put them in the pan wash your hands before you them start turning on the water and going to do another task otherwise you could cross contaminate the bacteria onto your hands on whatever you touch the dish towel the\nThe handle on the sink whatever it is okay now what about your health [noise] gosh I can remember\nMy dad yet we're thinking I I I'm thinking that you're not supposed to have eggs because of your heart but then you should have eggs because they're good ... well I Will tell you you'll love this answer old school I can remember\nMy dad saying than a dietitian years ago told him no more eggs you have a heart disease high cholesterol and you can't eat ... eggs that was what I was taught early on in school now we know from much better quality science that actually\nIt isn't eggs eggs are not a problem day that cholesterol found in eggs do not raise the cholesterol in your body really so it's saturated fat\nThat raises blood cholesterol saturated fat ... and and eggs are not high I'm saturated fat okay so think fatty meat\nFatty sausages and bacon and fatty anything like that it's that fat that saturated\nThat's what raises blood cholesterol so actually eggs are what we as dieticians call the reference protein they are such quality protein\nThat they are wonderful for the body good quality approaching they um zero carbs that people go on I loaded with cars zero carbs no sugar they contain codeine which is an essential um\nFor infant memory so when you have a little child that's

I wouldn't want to do a neighbor has an air horn and kind of like yeah that's what I when I'm here alone which anyway ... ... ... and this time when there was no one says and they were good neighbor reels years but but he just doesn't appreciate the British the grandkids do\nYeah that's a good idea and they also like car lights and cars coming up on them they'll they will move away for that type of generally they just want to eat ... and eat some grass and stuff\nAnd this and this was surprised when you open the door and let's see those beautiful ... oh yeah oh yeah and I can't believe this in the middle of the city because you do not find a way they live in the country but not anymore yeah it's actually doing a lot in in the mood of the country to do okay just like to see these beautiful I mean once in their right into me there have been here for\nThe hanging out and hang out all around the who is not just in my yard but they spent two or three days after this one tree to defer bears like OK guilty and I went on to Polaroid is going to be here a couple of very [laughter] hey on our Facebook page I've posted a picture of the bears that protest Facebook page and also\nA a rap rap music or a ... story\nThat they want to hurt us it's the funniest thing we have a ... a gentleman who started working as a few months back and he's trying to call on customers commercial customers and he's trying to come up with a method to do it it's it's entertaining it's entertaining\n... and they liked it and did you like if you just say like\nDifferent before on a time of the Hector I forgot to mention train is having a rebate right now up to a thousand dollars like on the effort to be twenty system which is a system I always recommend\nIt's a top of the line system most people won't want to sell you the next twenty uh because they they think price means everything well when you're talking air conditioning it's what you get for your money that means something uh most of our customers and put an ex we twenties say fifty percent of their electric bill\nI I tell people you'll save thirty percent to some a little more conservative than that and they'll call me back say Tom you actually forty two percent or forty seven percent uh but I've got a couple of family members I put in the X twenties for and they they're straight off fifty percent on their electric at the\nCalm for some ... to follow orders humid their money I don't have a problem but but the comfort level with the humidity controlled the the way the unit is designed to be ... and ... and I keep you run the whole day to run the water out of the house all day long\nFor it so we don't raise the price to do or rebate that's not how our company works uh we have a regular price that we charge and you know people think it's like a car sometimes oh I Want five thousand dollars off or no\nGo ahead by a car [laughter] we'll we'll play that we don't mark them up we just pretty straight up\nGuys and so I recommend the ex FBI twenty or the actually Eighteen is is next level down it's bearable speed just like the ... but it's not quite as energy efficient but in modern times that the modern technology regular standard single speed or conditioning was around from the sixties\nAnd I've I've looked at these things and why is it so energy efficient\nBecause it doesn't get hot and cold turn off and on I looked at some algorithms this week from my regular standard air conditioner in basically to three degrees spread or so on that\nA ... on and off the ex V. products ever verbal speed compressor outside that's the key to success they also verbal speed motor inside and digital electronic expansion Val and that combination\nThe temperature stays at that temperature humidity stays the humidity so you're not paying for those extra three or four degree bounce up and down it saves a lot of money plus it's super energy efficient by its nature\nSo we have been ... by train we sell them here's the phone number\nFour o seven to nine one one six four four four o seven to nine one one six four four we do service we fill air conditioners we will take good care of you that's what ... ... ...\n... ... ... ...\n... ... ... one nice feeling sick oh we let you know exactly how old you need to lose some maintenance was sunk in as the demos that gives you a buddy get up to do something about these ... because\nIt does is going All right for that reason so big Egypt prevention prevention is ...\nThat's right okay well thanks for listening hey don't forget George elite doctor it for oh seven four to six nine nine nine five it's hard to stop a train pro tech air conditioned plenty of four o seven to nine one one six four four we back next week as always part\nFifty fifty between sister and brother snake and have the brother own in his fifty percent and then half of moms half which is twenty five percent so that gives the brother total Seventy five percent and the sister would have twenty five percent which has a Seventy five\nYeah okay I was with you that that's the supposed to be Seventy five twenty five\nSo you know that that may not be with my wanted 'em but we don't know ... the other answer than is if I'm if if the deed does say with writers survivorship than the home entirely goes to a brother and sister doesn't get any of that regardless of what the will says\nYou know a will only has any say or any control over probate assets so if a as a transfer is outside of probate you know we see this um with some regularity of for example\nThere was that in California there's a guy who had a will to set everything went to his kid he got remarried but he had a life insurance policy that named his spouse is the beneficiary of that ... we're talking so I think like seven hundred and fifty thousand dollars\nAnd ultimately that passed to the than this kind of young trophy wife per se and other kids didn't get any of it and they all say well the will says it doesn't matter the will only controls what's going through probate it doesn't control these these athletes that transfer outside of that process\nSo you know sometimes you know with some really unintended consequences sure you'll without added a child named at a bank account to help you oh so they can help me ... and then all of a sudden when they pass away that bank account is that child yes the presumption\nWell over a dozen control yeah why and probate like you said in that in that fifty fifty on the house case she owns half the houses son in that case on says so there is no you know the the the already owns half the house or do anything in the ... the other half right so the thing you mentioned there is\nA joint penance and then the other one is Joyce terms with rights of survivorship in either case and it's a common or tennis or comedy out there so I have shut down in either case on that property around the house it's probably not how the parent intended\nRight it it it's just to make things easier I didn't mean to give you know Seventy five percent of my house to my\nSon and a quarter yeah you know most of the time somebody passes and you go wait a minute this is how everything's own this is not what mom intended we got to unwind this we've got to figure this out and if the kids are not willing to work together it's probably not how the ... or the parent in this case wanted it\nYet very likely the case I mean it it is not uncommon to have people kind of messy things up I mean there's a whole nother even tax implication reason to not do that with real properties and child name to it right um that's that's kind of a debate you can get in the weeds a little bit there but ultimately you know from capital gains taxes\nUm you know if it's a highly appreciated asset for when you bought it ... is oftentimes will have people who bought a home to live there for forty years and now they're at and their child named it the deed so that oh they don't have to go through probate well they may have just by adding that ended the deed they save him a few thousand bucks on probate but they may be looking at tens of thousands of dollars and capital right I Want to\nGo sell the house yes I saw one of our creditors you know you got it\nYou got mom in the house and and now the the child is fifty percent or something happens to them and you know they get a tax lean or something like that you open your property up to that risk\nThat's right because that child interest is not homestead right living there so it doesn't have any the homestead protection the mom would have in our own home but he has or he or she has on it on his own on the child so you know those are assets on their subject to yeah possibly creditor liens and being forced to foreclosure yeah so what's\nThe solution then so I Want my kids to be able to help me on the house I Want them to be able to make decisions I Want things to pass easily so that case somebody that made their kid joined order what should they have done\nSo there's a couple of answers there I mean as far as helping mom along well she's getting the power of attorney right that was easy people feel like that's\nYou know a difficult thing to do when they ask people joined on the bank account or do other things when really all you needed that that power\nTour yet I I think that's one of the terms that people are they don't they they feel like they should know what that means right right right now where they're almost embarrassed you know I'm fifty five I don't actually know what that term means you know but however attorney yeah they're embarrassed to ask that sure I mean I\nPresented love workshops around town and I'm at the most recent one the gentleman ... yoked spoke up in the in the works out these that hey you know I don't I don't like this idea of name of the power of attorney because what if they want to accept my bank account or something and you know can they can do it right away and I said well I mean is that what you're concerned about you probably shouldn't already one\nL O G right right or or\nOr you know if you're concerned about that but you definitely shouldn't put them on the bank account or you have the ability to get it for ... right\nYeah because when you add them to the bank account that their money right has a right to just clean it out if they want to know records for at least with the power of attorney David duty to act in your best interests and if they don't then you can sue them you can you press charges you know I write criminally and that sort of stuff not that\nWants to do that but it is an option\nYou have more protection as her however attorney and everything to that's coming up like at a Raymond James are from ... you can trust the contract now yeah so a lot of brokerage accounts that's a new a new regulation that's come out of a sudden\nYou know you need to be able to out of trust in contact with somebody that can\nCall and get information hey what's the balance of moms are couches in the hospital how much you know and and now if you name the person ahead of time\nThat just on the new account application you're able to tell you know give that person information on the account that's pretty so it's almost like the power of attorney light yeah you can't make a decision but your husband and wife all the time call hey ah\nYou know my husband's Iran how much is it not want to get I'm thinking of you know taking some might well I Can't tell you can put 'em on the phone and bright and let's get information will now you have the ability to add to trust the contact that can get information on your behalf\nWhich is something that that's new and I and I think people might want to look about to go back to your brokerage accounts and you don't have my wife or husband or my wife makes all the decisions financially they should be able to get information about my IRA or\nYou know my mom doesn't know how to make decisions I Want to make sure she's okay okay what is ... what is you know what's in the account what's the risk were taken in ... you can find out that information\nThat's really neat idea you know the cat similar for that for medical that we called HIPAA release okay yeah and um and I always kind of felt like in the back of my head like it'd be nice to have something like this for financial stuff\nRight he's really cool to write that you know I guess on you guys are than that they've come up with something yeah because there's there's nothing from a legal perspective on my side that I can do to be able to give someone access to your information right\nWell I think it's a it's a response to an or need right it's been a problem it's tough to get information you know area would make joined decisions but you know you're telling me you can't give me the full balance of our portfolio right there you know Joe Joe's watching the football game on I'll go bug um and get them on the phone or ... you know\nUh get information so it's it is kind of nice to have that yeah\nAbsolutely well we are up on a bright we'd have open phones for for two two zero zero Ninety six Hi ya author

said you'd never lose a dream it just incubate\nAs a hobby is of course is the lead to talk to your show all about retirement planning finances and your future and Michael I talk a lot about hobbies yeah here on the livestock future shall we talk about a bucket list right we talk about one of the things that you're going to be doing\nIn retirement I think that's one of the exciting things you know when you finally get to that work optional lifestyle is you do get to to really follow your dreams and as Larry Page says a lot of times it in ... as a hobby so it's important to think about those things what do you want to be doing during retirement\nYou know or do you want to travel do you want to pick up a new hobby maybe it would work and maybe it's golf maybe it's you know X Y Z fill in the blank but what are those things I think that's super important to think about especially if you're close to retirement\nFor two reasons number one is because it helps you cross the finish line I think right with energy I I've I've I have this goal for my retirement and I need to continue to save XYZ I got to work two more years then I wanted to I Need to do this or that and if I can attach it to\nA dream or a hobby or something tangible it makes it all that much more powerful and an easier I think they get their usher visualizing that that goal\nUh and then the second thing is it keeps you busy in retirement right I I think that the mind you constantly have to keep your mind are going to dive into a hobby I think is very fulfilling and I've seen it be successful for so many retirees and that's why my when I talk about\nThat I'm so much well this is talk future show\nBefore the break we been talking with Donna who had a question of annuities versus the stock market and what are our thoughts were a Donny still with us yeah\nAll right well so before the break I went over some of the cons to annuities and I and I I think people see them kind of trash talk in the media out a lot advisors are either super against annuities or you know they're super forum depending on what they like to sell the ... right\nAh but you know annuities are a lot of times confusing the contracts can be very long it can lock you in a to a certain to you know to certain parameters that you have to follow and if you don't follow them\nIt can cost you a lot of money there surrender penalties there's a cost of taking the money out you can lose benefits on your annuity so you have to make sure\nThat you know you understand the annuity mhm spend you know what you're getting into and I think that a good rule of thumb is to make sure if you are going to buy an annuity that um it's a small percentage of your overall network so if I have say\nHalf a million dollars in retirement and I'm looking at an annuity maybe because I Want to secure a death benefit or I Want to secure some sort of\nA income benefit your monthly checks just make sure it's a small percentage maybe twenty five hundred thousand dollars maybe I'm not going to put more of a hundred thousand at an annuity or just because it's it's very narrow on what your options are once you're inside that program\nIs actually about
