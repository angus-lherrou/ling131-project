because Donald Trump is atypical controversial uh unorthodox you think that he's vulnerable but the more you look at the machine that he has and the ways consolidate the Republican Party which the month think Abul even a year ago\nYou have to wonder if some Democrats are going to think twice I remember how thin the\nUh the the uh the race was and it can candidates were to get the Republican nomination when Bill Clinton was running for re election I mean it is a poll numbers from the high fifties\nAnd it was coming off the ... the Republicans took their best shot and lost so Bob Dole was the one who got the nomination with very little competition a Jack Kemp was running against him but he never had a shot\nAnd then when you saw the race wide open you saw double figures for the Republicans not as many for Democrats because the incumbent was almost Hillary Clinton\nNow you see double figures for Democrats because they think this presidents vulnerable\nThey just don't see it that way I think it's going to be a lot harder than they understand but when it comes to the midterms first things first the part of the United states was asked a question and he was asked basically in the past past presidents have gone out and they've campaigned at the midterms and it hasn't worked out well Bill Clinton pulled off the road\nThere were seven apple is when they said you're actually hurting these candidates first midterm you know ah George Bush never really went out heavily in the mid term elections Brock Obama got ... first made terms those were his words in particular when he lost the house and almost lost the Senate he would eventually lose both\nSo Donald Trump's out he came out and say you know what I don't really think I'm hurting I think I'm helping them with the headlines were Donald Trump says we lose it's not my responsibility how is that right by the way that was with the headlines on drugs as well which is shocking to me [noise]\nBut just let's look at the mid term elections and see we're at right now the blue wave is not going to happen a blue taking of the house could happen however\nThe Senate seems secure where we are we talking on Labor

justice Kevin or the way he was treated [noise]\nIsn't a standing human being an outstanding man of great accomplishment and the way those Democratic senators treated him was horrible it was a

lines uh he had the majority white women fifty three percent but didn't have the majority of women against Hillary Clinton kind of logical first major party major nominee who heads the ticket\nHowever now if they say the president's abrupt style and direct attacks they say it's a turn off to women I'm not going to speak for women are but I'm just telling you what the posters are telling me

Saudi Saudi\n[noise] I don't I don't I don't believe so you have to ask your question what do we do in this area because it is important this may be the biggest issue that Trump will have to deal with\nHis entire presidency and considering the long term global side of things\nThat you know the ... the thought of of Kim Jong il and a lot of these other things while it's going to be important to
