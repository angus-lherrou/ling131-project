{"month": "10", "state": "FL", "station": "WDBO", "content": "Well actually I Believe and there's something some people disagree with me strongly about I Believe the reason the University of just gotten so expensive is because of how easy it is for people to borrow money\nThat we are very high cost simply by creating what appears to be an unlimited supply of funds\nSo there hasn't been market discipline for the colleges and universities and so now the cost of educating someone has way outstrip the increase and family income over the years and over the last couple of decades\nSo it's my belief that if we heavily rained in the ability to borrow for school big colleges would become much more efficient and\nYou give the example of community colleges\nThere are a number of community colleges around the country now that offer full four year degrees that offer bachelor's degrees at all really hairy low cost yes Florida has been a trailblazer in that Texas has a program I guess you'd call it modified community college\nWhere the cost of a four year degree is designed to be ten thousand dollars total wow\nAnd so it it's not something they couldn't be done it certainly could be done and\nAt the graduate level Georgia Tech\nOne of the premier engineering schools in the country has the extremely affordable degree that's available online and other schools wonder how could they do it but Georgia Tech standing in a way\nThat they can do it without losing money so I Believe it's all about creating\nThat discipline in the marketplace\nI think we'd benefit mightily\nIf we

promising more jobs and tougher borders if Texas reelect stood crews and the field of ABC News\nAnd throw things that people but we're going to stand our ground and I think that's what they did and I think that's what a lot of people simply have to do is just say no we're not going to scream back at you weren't going to throw things we're not going to engage in violence but we're going to say no to you and we're going to do the right thing and be have the right way and that's going to prevail\nMaybe uh I I don't love the fact that she was she was screamed at either a I don't think that's right right I mean bottom line is\nA she's a Seventy seven year old woman who is accomplished a lot in her life I agree with the way she approaches things I also think she's being selfish in maintaining leadership and not turning it over to another generation but she deserves to be treated with respect\nI thought that they used to be a fear of treating someone disrespect flu because of the backlash\nMy hope is that both sides stop with the name calling at the top as they run it very intense elections and start saying you know treating people the people who are we in a civil way at the top maybe it'll filter down to the grassroots well\nLook that's what we can hope I mean I I Am share your concern that we could reach a tipping point in this country uh where we do sort of get into more and more violence and then it becomes tit for tat escalates I've written that uh\nThat's how World War one started nobody wanted World War one none of the great powers but they all thought the other guy would blink first\nUm and of course nobody blinked and I think that's what we have to worry about in this country that's why I think that that you know people should understand there are now to oppose it\nThe forces or the ... the the right can be as violent as or the left it hasn't been in in the ... current atmosphere but it could become that and and so then we really would have more and more violence I Try I think the answer is for good people not to get it and not to be cowed by this but by the same token not to engage in\nIt tears cut a this is what I was talking about Mitch McConnell [noise]\n[noise] so what happened is that people in that diner stood up to the guy who was acting in a blue during fashion image but kind of later stuck around later he thank everyone for standing up to him\nYeah no and that's exactly what ... what has to happen I mean good people have to prevail but you don't sit there by me and just be quiet that doesn't work in this environment you have\nTo stand for something you know an old friend of mine a set a wonderful line years ago which I used in a lot of these circumstantial which is\nYou have to join the side you're on so if you feel Mitch McConnell in that instance as being treated badly you have to stand up and say so you can't just sit there and quietly root for the good guy you have to join I mean that's what\nThat's what America is about we have politics is no shame and engaging in politics is no shame in standing up for what you believe in\nRight here is a Chris Christie after we saw this on Sundays this week with George Stephanopoulos cut nine\nOut concerts with any votes for outside\nAn act of violence and and acting without any type of civility and I don't care what side of the book who are from when you do that it's wrong to mix public officials have become hostage just decide or oh you don't want to go out they're not going to see them you're not going to be able to get any feel fourth or like other than what the court t._v. commercials and\nI also think the Trump officials that the only place they really feel secure is at Trump Trump Hotel yeah and that's where they have a happy as a and that's almost like an enclave\nArrest but a safe space yeah look better that the capital of the country\nI'm ... well we don't want public service to become its own punishment I mean this is after all fundamentally American construct of citizens who come into the government and then go out it's it's not it's not a career as a ... we're not you know it's become that for too many people\nBut it's fundamentally it is about public service for a brief time in your life\nAnd so I think we ought to end on some level treat these people with a certain level of respect we don't have to agree with him we don't have to approve of them but we cannot get into the gutter I think that way ... madness\nSo there's something playing at as usual there's three compelling storylines you've got to Saudi Arabia controversy in the killing of anti American resident with three American Kid will touch on that\nBut we're watching this caravan come up again Steve from Guatemala excuse me from Honduras bust through the gate to Guatemala get to Mexico they said they stop and they had been unable to their walking up the street skating powered demanding entry to our country\nThat is happening demanding entry into another country is it to say how do we allow a had a system of immigration\nYeah look I I mean they're coming from countries that are broken or I saw something recently in the wall Street Journal\nNinety five percent of the murders go unsolved in those countries I mean that's police corruption as well as just violence\nA so look there's countries are broken people are running for their lives by the same token we have a right to protect our own borders to lead in those whom we deemed to be good for our country we are not we cannot be uh the last stop on every train for every person in the world who wants to come here\nUh if if if we cannot secure our borders\nThen I think we've really fall and then so far we have fall and we have we have dropped the ball on this issue this is a big test for President Trump but they\nGet to the border under laws passed in two thousand nine led by Senator Dianne Feinstein and they get to the border they say the right words we have to let him in and give them time in front of a judge\nBut we also have this flurries rule that says they cannot wait in detention more than twenty days okay so I guess what happens they get ankle bracelets that they do they cut them off to get out what happens they stay forever sure now Mexicans evidently only two percent illegal immigrants are Mexicans\nThey are central and South America because the laws they know better than we know them they all we've been through taking advantage of it that to me is just so easily corrected and should be able to bring both sides together while Democrats see the problem\nWell because as as someone called them these are undocumented Democrats are these are these are people that Democratic Party looks too for the next generation of voters\nThey apparently are not concerned about the border I mean we we don't talk about it anymore but certainly terrorism is the biggest concern then you have the drug flow you have you have the gangs I mean there are all kinds of reasons why we don't want wards of the state or problems coming across that vetting is about\nMichael seven million unfilled jobs these ... these farmers absolutely need the guest worker program to be enacted full steam ahead if we could just get a system that allows people here who want to work and want a better way of life to come in the people that I have come across in my life that have worked on landscaping trucks and have come from other countries\nThey worked a day or the or the energy of ten people they ask very little in demand they work extremely hard not saying that there are a bunch of terrorists coming across right but the system has to work and I think Newt Gingrich put it best last night on when I saw it last night but it was on Fox News Sunday cut for\nDon't think there are human rights issues one four or five thousand people decide to attack the United states\nThat's out there now and my mom came down the street to occupy your home can you hear the nicer home than they do you wouldn't say oh gosh I really feel sorry for you and me pretty angry that they were occupying at what point do we draw a number on when you draw the number I don't care how big it is I suppose you can say I'll take twelve million science is she going to control the border\nNo she's not ... ... there's no end to it I think that's the problem this is this is a failure that goes back decades and it's one of the reasons President Trump was elected\nFor stopping Michael he can't stop it stop it but he can\nWell this is a big test I think this is a very big test of course part of the answer is is the Mexican government the Honduran government and the Guatemalan government most most of which are not function but the Mexican government is functioning and don't forget they feel are coming through Mexico every one of them and that's how they get here\nSo if the Mexican government they have a new government in Mexico if it's going to uphold its relations with the United states this is a big test for that government as well a huge\nWith the president just to eat it every time you see a caravan of people coming are attempting to come in into our country

whoever you're supporting back over there this in many ways the shore lottery\nI point the finger all the time at the Republicans and the Democrats for not getting something done when it comes to comprehensive immigration reform a lot of that has to do with what's happening now but as far as the outside\nThe fact is is these people are coming here because these countries have failed their people these countries suck\nThey do I said it boom bang deal with it it is the truth\nCorruption jak crime check poverty\nJak cartels check\nAnd more corruption they have failed their people and their people have no choice but to try to figure something out Mm actually goes looking around going All right for your something out here\nAnd I don't even know what the hell they're doing I don't think anybody knows what the hell they're doing\nBut perhaps most funny about it is shown these people have all been offered\nSolemn satisfy the Mexican government they are rejecting it convinced the

people\nThat are in this caravan this was always the destination this is where they want to be this is it in Mexico needs to figure something out because\nThe last time actually go kind of just let everybody on through right like like the bulls coming through right the matador only\nNow Mexico's trying to figure something out but what are they going to do\nMexican authorities have shown they're reluctant to physically confront these migrants in a head they face this building humanitarian crisis there are no facilities there no showers here a little food and water for the rest of the day they face the prospect of a clash with Mexican authorities so so what do we do\nI think at some point in time Trump in sooner rather than later a member of the\nMidterms are coming up so this'll energized both basis\nBecause the laughter say Trump's off all these horrible we should let these people in and and Trump's going to say you know we've got enough is enough and I'm the only and willing to take the stuff on and it goes on you for that because nobody else wants to their all playing grab ass with each other and using ... you know this to to raise money and to energize the base but\nUh it's something needs to be done and is it going to be the military\nI don't know if it will or what but what I Do\nKnow is that we need to start looking at Mexico and say look here's the deal Mexico you can either start gobbling these people up and sending them back\nOr we're going to look it may be looking at Western Union and a few of the other ways that you guys are getting funds back here and we're going to start packing on massive fees because Mexico Honduras El Salvador Guatemala their biggest export for all intents and purposes\nIn many ways is their people to come here they work they

having a lead people on the I see him or do what he's a video podcast and working over there at the daily wire and I said to\nMyself south let's get him on and we've got I'm On my clothes joins us now into a first and foremost men for coming on today taken time of the Senate you're out and about doing stuff and ah ah let's jump right into it there's a caravan coming here Michael and what is the Trump stirred gonna do\nYou know he has handled this simply perfectly and I don't think that you say that about every every single thing the president has done he is really nailed it on this which is this is an unacceptable\nOr a front to our sovereignty frankly as it happens much more frequently than we all want to admit obviously this one is a little larger ten thousand people but every single day we arrest one to two thousand people crossing illegally at the border who knows how many make it through undetected\nAnd what he said is okay that's fine you don't want to deal with this problem Mexico you don't want to deal with this problem under us that's okay we're going to cut off your eight\nAnd I think he could go even further and threaten remittances from a Mexican nationals who are working in the United states if you decided to slap that tax on Western Union money transfers I think you would see this caravan as it turned to a trickle overnight\nBut I think he's handled it pretty well so far and we'll see I mean this could end up being a defining issue of the midterm elections\nYeah I you know what this in a weird way this has helped or the Republicans because what a perfect timing the cabin all people get excited for Kavanaugh but it was one of those things where you got to be hot at the right time and as we all know with ADD and this country and after a week or two I mean we haven't heard worried about cabinet\nAnd all of a sudden this pops up and is it there there are thousand miles away this is going to be an ongoing thing uh all the way and they're totally force company 'cause you know one day it's a thousand that it's two thousand four thousand and by the time they get here it could be eleven twelve Thirteen thousand God Knows how many and this is a perfect time and like a perfect storm for the Republicans\nWill I'll often\nThink that the greatest tool that Republicans have at our disposal is Democrats because somehow always managed to step in and they pick these\nAwful unpopular issues we are the illegal immigration and border security is the number one priority not just for a Republican but even for many Democrats and Democrats have become the party of open borders and abolish ice\nSo there there is this a wonderful\nStrategy I think in the Trump Administration which is to to make Democrat thank rate\nThen he makes the they go mad\nAnd then they finally started to act stupid and they're they're really stepping in it left and right here I also sometimes wonder you know we we know that uh George Soros and sores related groups are funding weightlifting from terrorists the group that is collecting this caravan pushing this caravan up\nDrew Web south and Central America but uh I sometimes wonder if secretly is a conservative operative because you know when when they do things like this is such an affront that even if the American people are willing to consider some form of amnesty some form of a path to citizenship all\nOf a sudden they say no way cut it off elect Republicans and build the wall a really helpful and I'll take the help wherever we can get it\nTalking to Michael knows the daily wire and uh we moved from there to this whole thing with a democracy Yogi which it it it it it's it's unraveling left right and center they don't know what to do\nTrump's got to be strong here right like he can't first of all what they what they spawn to us was the biggest bunch of horse turns of all time to even think of that and and at some point in time Michael the truth has to come out but\nWe we we he Trump just can't be like look we want the money I don't really care about this guy he's gotta he's gotta be a little bit non frumpy and in some ways I think in the way he handles is\nThat's right I think he needs a little bit of subtlety but I think you're seeing that out of the administration Jared Kushner gave an excellent interview was banned Jones today\nI was I think the first fair interview I'd ever seen on CNN and probably the last one that I'll ever see an CNN\nBut you know from the beginning of this story or you could tell it was a partisan job from the media and Democrats\nThey had nothing to run on in these midterm elections so they focus on the killing of an ex Saudi Government official named ... who for a couple of years has been ready for the Washington Post and they've tried to make it into a liberal secular western martyr\nHe is not is a radical Islamist he wept when Osama bin Laden died he uh is a supporter of Hamas one of his chief criticisms of the current Saudi regime is that they're too favorable toward Israel\nOr he is a decided Islam is he's been a member of the Muslim Brotherhood for a long time business justify an extrajudicial killings\nI I don't know I don't think so I don't I don't defend the Saudi Government but there's no news story or the Saudi Government commits heinous crimes day in and day out and it seems to me the lesson is if you ... around with radical Islam is bad things are going to happen uh fortunately President Trump has not\nSpoken out of turn on this I don't think but he would be a huge mistake for Republicans to get distracted by the story\nBecause we're winning on everything that actually matters to voters and it's a really desperate Hail Mary by Democrat to distract before the midterms\nThat you'd see video for

didn't confirmed that we're now hearing for more media outlets saying the same thing including from sky news as well as Chinese state media\nLumber one that I Know a lot of people talk about the blue wave and all that stuff I don't believe I happen to think federal election night you're going to find a very very close situation and maybe a handful of votes determining whether Democrats getting control of the house\nWhile independent Democrat Bernie Sanders trying to lower expectations two weeks and counting a show of hands how many see a blue wave not one person is putting their hands up maybe for tactical reasons those days really are done but what can we expect on Tuesday to Tuesday's from now two presidents do without from stage to stage hoping for different result twelve knocking each other's record\nSure let's just bring stability back sooner or later with this right now that these ... his book is out out you've got to go grab it it's the blue collar president Anthony you do me a favor with this book\nTell me what my comment question I get wherever I go outside New York since I Know President Trump a little bit\nIs why is he so popular why are people so loyal yet they really on the surface have very little in common with them\nBorn a a means uh become fabulously wealthy done international finance and uh and business he's been in a in ... in Hollywood these guys just what TV show the average American can't relate to that but in this title is the answer to that question\nYeah well I appreciate you saying that I actually stole the title from Donald Trump junior who used to call his father when they did The Apprentice the the the blue collar billionaire and so I thought about what's going on here he translated into his presidency and so what I tried to write Brian is a is a story that you're familiar with growing up the mess of equal bio and I grew up\nIn your counterpart town port Washington and so we grew up in blue collar neighborhoods most people didn't go to college everybody had an hourly wage\nA job like that or the work for the town or they were electricians ... sheet rock cops firemen et cetera and so those people relate to Donald Trump because\nHe is advocating for them they've decided that the political establishment in Washington has not helped them has not helped their families and she represents for them and avatar and ask her I had to try to make a change that system is so broken\nOh is it I'm gonna get back to the midterms and everything but this relates a so this relates to what we're discussing so\nYou talk about the fact that the person is always talked about much to the chagrin of people like Gary Cohn I Wonder we do these trade deals I Want to rebalance trade deals a you know we got to go back and we're getting robbed by NAFTA I Will never even consider the TPP the you've got to pay their fair share\nAnd everyone is thinking who are in high finance like you and I'm not saying well the person doesn't understand is you have any reason why he's been indefensible explaining it is because he knew feel as though it goes back to the Marshall Plan yes we got on balance when we decided and you thought it was the right move to rebuild Europe and we never rebalance how I'm going to come across\nA table right now and almost like hugging kiss you could you actually read the book bag impressed by with ... exactly what happened I'm trying to explain to the American people the Seventy five years of trade history why the United states made a strategic decision\nTo make the trade very unfair to the United states they were trying to raise working class middle class standards of living around the world because they believe that that would create more global economic interdependence see\nBut they kept pushing and he kept pushing it it was the lack city in the malpractice of elected officials that didn't start checking those trade deals didn't start refining those trade deals resetting them et cetera up as a write up happening is because it's very uneven trading system that hollowed out\nOr lower middle class families ... remember Ross Perot you what did he say there's going to be a great sucking sound if we signed NAFTA sixty five thousand factories evaporated\nMove to uh Mexico when I was in New Mexico Albuquerque New Mexico Brian uh people there were saying hey this is in New Mexico anymore that new New Mexico is Mexico and that's what they're responding to ah to the Trump through the eyes\nOf the hearing was for international business was if we were able to get someone else make this stuff without the American unions and demands for high wages\nThey were going to get cheaper products here and Americans will adapt to this new job market both those what happened is gradually the middle class of evaporated so the president is doing something that a lot of your friends don't think it's possible trying to go back to the future and bring this manufacturing again\nCall he's calling for symmetries calling for trade fairness um I think that the the real truth of the matter is because of the robotics in the increase in technology and things like that the actual volume of jobs is never going to return but if you can bring the manufacturing back in the capital equipment goods and services back\nBut ends up happening is the town start to re popular you know you get the\nLocal hardware store it and you get the local deli you get the local thing connected to your home start growing again Brian and so so that will start happening you know the wall Street Journal about two weeks ago uh they said that the bottom ten percent of the United states has experienced five and a half percent wage growth\nSince the Trump presidency started over the last Eighteen Nineteen months and so that's a sign that the president's policies is working for the people that he was talking\nTo so I Want you to hear what President Obama said yesterday and the dueling press conference the president was in Las Vegas in Nevada trying to boost Dean Heller of a longtime critic come a confidant we've got about a two point lead in there comes a popular former president Brock Obama listen to what he said about the Donald Trump blue collar economy cut sixteen\nSo by the wages were arriving insurance rate was falling\nAnd that's what I ended up\nTalk about economic miracles right now\nTo the right place partially right\nI mean we're where he's really wrong and she'll never admitted that he ... the United states economy with regulation that cost businesses industry industries like mind but also manufacturers the hedge fund busy yeah yeah and that's where we'll just money management in general he probably added about two hundred and fifty billion dollars\nOf costs like literally putting a mill stone on the next of the of the nation of the world's greatest economy and so\nAh he he's right that the economy ... due to the aggressive monetary policy the said\nHe's right that we're able to get the the thing yeah right size I Want to be fair to him I was against the auto bailout and the way she engineered the auto bailout what Steve Rattner when it was happening he was right I was wrong I Want to be fair to him I think they did a good job at the auto bailout for\nChrysler which they gave to a company that was what I\nWould say that they they gave Chrysler way but in general they got it right here is the big problem you have an a catastrophe like that you're in a full financial ... situation not going to get every patient a fix the appropriate but in general they were right I Want to be fair to them and that\nWhere I think the president has been absolutely transformative\nIs that he recognizes that we need regulation but we need the mama bear of regulation we don't need the\nPop up there where Obama was and so was ended up happening now is that he's such a pro business president and he's giving such pro business guidance on taxation and regulation that American corporations CEOs in businesses large and small are opening up their purses it's starting to invest back in America\n... where he's wrong well Brock Obama knew that we would do for a corporate tax cut Bodie wanted in exchange was too much for Republicans to digest and that was a hike in the upper tax bracket so this this we were to hide what are we at thirty five could not get it down to twenty where we were not competitive we are we\nAre over taxing the society but we're also overspending and so yeah so this is a ridiculous cycle that really can't continue so so you've got this wildly over tax I mean his friend before you live here in New York and you're and you're you're listening from New York and you're the highest tax bracket\nYou've got a fifty three percent marginal tax are now the minority partner in your own life the money comes in you can only keep forty seventh as if you're not the highest tax bracket let's say you're in the medium one state local taxes plus your property taxes plus your federal tax is why you're at forty percent\nSo now you have a huge partner in your business called the government\nYou have a huge part are taking your economic treasury away from you called the government\nSo should we hold these people accountable shouldn't we look at the end the way here being evaluated on the job I get evaluated on my job even though I'm the founder of the company I let my my staff evaluate me you're obviously being evaluated our listeners are being evaluated why are we allowing this level of laxity and the lack of accountability in our in our uh\nOur public service and this is where the president has come in as literally a disruptive human wrecking ball and smashing into the system and blue collar people love it as you grow up with a lot of Brian\nMoody is with us out Trump the blue collar presidents here are the book is now out here is a look back at what President a President Obama then President Obama
