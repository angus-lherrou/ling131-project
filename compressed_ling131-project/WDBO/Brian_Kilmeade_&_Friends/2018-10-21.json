did this rather than his assent his secretary of state I think is one of his best choices ever Mike Pompeo\nLast two days he's been the Saudi Arabia you're denying it and he's been to Istanbul in Turkey where your mouth shut Kobe the Saudi journalist ah was missing\nAnd we have two reports went when the British newspaper one from the the New York post talking about audio revealing du Jamal could show he was tortured and decapitated I you know I I shutter to go down this road I suspect ... all of this is true\nBecause we know we went in Istanbul, Turkey so the Saudi console he went in and he never came out that we know so\nDo I suspect based on his criticisms of the kingdom Saudi Arabia\nUm you know that you're not dealing with the best of actors on either side of this you know just this week we had an American pastor released after being held two years and one of their prisons why because he's a Christian so not exactly that company\nIn Turkey or everyone the you know lunatic that he is now emerged into and norm I competed\nAnd I'm the one that's most critical of Saudi Arabia than anyone else in the media and their mistreatment of women their persecution and murder of gays and lesbians their persecution of Christians and Jews\nYou know it's I Know they gave to the Clinton Foundation and seemed to get much criticism from any Democrat or the Clintons in this but somehow I mean it boggles my mind\nYou know that everybody rushed to judgment and\nYou know saying that the president while the president saying he's not walking away waiting for the facts to commit he's asked turkey now to reveal any Oreos any tapes they may have half they may have and there are reports that pact that they have and the New York post their reporting that in fact ... to show he was tortured and decapitated inside\nThe Saudi consulate in Istanbul\nAlso have a Turkish newspaper reporting as much because she'll get did work for the Washington Post he managed to after visiting the consulate you lived in Saudi Arabia he's not an American citizen but he he wrote for the Washington Post for many years\nSaudi council and it can be heard on the tape saying during the show these tortured do this outside you're going to get me in trouble\nOr in another tape and unknown person again I Can't corroborate doesn't only telling you what the New York\nPost and the British newspapers are reporting on one Turkish newspaper if you want to live when you come to Saudi Arabia being quiet\nAnyway returned to Riyadh on Tuesday I had a plan search of his residence part of the official Turkish probe and took the show gays disappearance that is the the Saudi council he's back in Saudi Arabia\nMiddle East English language website holding a Turkish sources saying that there were no attempt to interrogate cause show ... but that us Saudi hip team came to kill him\nThe source told the site that his dad took seven minutes runs a physician doctor Salah Mohammed al ... body listening to music as he began to cut to show these body while he was still alive\nIn New York Post Turkish authorities believe the show he was killed by a special team of Fifteen Saudi officials though the kingdom the crown prince of Saudi Arabia denying that says these claims are baseless\nThis report comes as Mike Pompeo met Wednesday after being in in Saudi Arabia now meeting with the Turkish president aired on and the Turkish foreign minister ... rubber arriving from reality where he said the Saudis promised a thorough investigation\nMike Pompeo on Wednesday refusing to blame Riyadh said he didn't want to talk about any of the facts the day after the president said there's got to be a presumption of innocence but he wants all the facts\nHelp us deployment diplomat Wednesday refusing to blame\nRiyadh blah blah blah blah several of the members of the alleged tip team were found to a close ties to the crown prince\nMohammed bin Salman\nSolomon according to a a photo by the New York times Turkish officials have shared an audio recording with the U.S in Saudi Arabia that they say ... was murdered by Saudi operatives of except the president say they didn't get any tape but this time\nThey have a pro government newspaper reporting that ... apple watch recorded the interrogation torturing killing\nWell I Would assume that watch exist in this happened and what we believe that he might have been taken out and body pieces not sure that they wouldn't take the watch at that point but before leaving reality Pompeo told reporters at the Saudi leaders made no exception on who they would hold accountable\nAnyway so now according to the British newspapers are saying circus of fish or Turkish officials have a recording of\nBlah blah blah and that that in fact happened on the apple watch and you have some of the other people saying it's highly unlikely to show that you could have broadcast the signal from his apple watches it was too far for Bluetooth connection\nAnd I think what's happened clearly as the Turks and the Saudi ... had the Saturday counseling wired they have transmitters and the Turks don't trust any diplomats that have been into most of the embassies most consulates in Turkey and they listen to what's going on\nAnd we'll find out in this case um my take I think it probably all happen but I don't think we should rush to judgment\nBecause the truth is going to come out probably sooner rather than later joining us now Dr Sebastian Gorka former White House advisers brand new book is phenomenal by the way why we fight defending the feeding rather not defending the feeding America's enemies with no apologies also Dan hop but Fox\nNews contribute a Thirty Years' CIA up operations officer a doctor Gorka I assume you agree with me that all signs point to the Saudis assassinating murdering this guy in a a barbaric way that's what I'm thinking\nYou know there's a ruining warfare or report from the battlefield must be questioned\nUh I think this man is that whether or not these audio tapes exist is another question but it's absolutely certain that this individual was caught between two nations that wants to dominate the Sunni Muslim world\nThat's the meal often I'm an avid wand regime of turkey and the birth place of Islam Saudi Arabia and this man was caught in the middle\nHowever however this isn't the fake news we've got to be accurate this man was a journalist wasn't in America that trying to spin it was a foreign national read them and it was a common type that you wrote commentary and he has a long decades long history\nOf factor the Muslim Brotherhood and there's also related to the figures Arab um the ... of the twentieth century ... so all of these things are total statements of factual\nWhat do you think a missed the hop and it's been a while my uh my friend Dan is good to have your back I Know this has been your life and your business for so many years\nUm my gut is pretty clear on this uh I think this man was murdered and the most evil Bruce Bruce brutal way possible and I think that the president is wise knowing that we're going to get to the truth no there's no doubt we'll go and we're going to have the truth rushing to that point is not smart in my opinion\nI I agree with you uh look there's a lot of evidence that we have already we nailed it Fifteen Saudi traveled on the Gulf Stream Arafat arrived if it costs to lift the day the show he entered and we know eat fish again never exited the costs ...\nA week do the makeup of those of the fifteenth out for them apparently part of ... one of them the forensic doctor you referred to is listening to music well allegedly this membrane ... body after he was killed\nOr what we don't know\nWhat were the orders that were given for these Fifteen Saudi and who gave them the orders and then to whom did they report posts for them those are all questions we need to answer\nThat President I think with a hundred percent right to just fashion secretary said the cat or the fact emphasize that they were issue of grave concern to us we'll get that fact with accuracy and a lack of the that's what matters I Will remind the listeners that when Sergei Filin was poisoned back in March\nBritish home secretary said they needed to avoid speculation while we allow the police carry on their investigation I think that's what's going on here in the last thing I Would guess highlight is that Well Secretary of all I'm saying it was meeting and doing it public diplomacy I'm quite sure what the the FBI legalized fish in Riyadh\nAnd the other in a central or an ... an uncle or probably meeting with their Turkish and Saudi counterparts to collect the evidence but it to be a part of reviewing it shows\nKnow it's the I Wish everything could fit in nicely neatly into a box assuming that I Believe that the Saudis are involved and whether it goes straight to the top I don't know the crown prince is denying it I'm kind of having a hard time buying that myself but\nKnowing that there are very different country but now it gets complicated because fall so the Saudis the Egyptians Jordanians the Israelis the United states the Emirates they're all fighting against the Iranian had you had many in the region and their quest for nuclear weapons and\nThe instability that would cause the entire world um I Know everybody Dr Gorka would like to say that okay we're cutting off all ties with Saudi Arabia were done where this with that um I think this will be consequences severe consequences the president said\nFour hours a day\nWe have the latest information on the situation with Saudi journalist ... who was killed last week President Trump has some information on that\nWe'd like to find out where it is and what happens and I think we're we're inching our way they're\nNot helpful for us to cancel it order like that\nThat are far more that urge them\nPresident Trump told you about the arms deal with Saudi Arabia tens of thousands of reporters gathering in central London calling for a second referendum on Britain's exit from the EU activists taking part in the people's vote march they say they want the public to have the final

way to help and so did so many others and that's why so many artists have worked with you on these beautiful illustrations tell us about that\nRight we have twenty plus different artists who each donated their time services talent or to to illustrate the book\nUm each artist has their own different style but the way that they go together in the book it's just so cohesive the characters the story it's just so perfect the way the aligned um and the way we assigned the artist we've got so lucky or for example the last piece of art in the book\nUh it's very realistic it's very different from most of the art in the book the rest of the very ... um but just one piece of art is just so realistic that\nIt lets the reader know that the very end of the book this is real it happened it just wouldn't have worked anywhere else in the book\nIt it is a really a stunning way to end yeah would you want us to talk about ... you have a high schoolers\nWe ... we have a high school students involved or Jacob park from ... um he his mom works with me and uh when I told his mom about the book she said my son has to be involved and\nHe said I Want to be involved I Want to help out I Want to do I want to do something good for the community um and he just an incredible illustrations of our head artist eastern long met him last week for the first time and they had such a good conversation after his odds to hope they do collaboration after this\nYeah and again this is focusing on on trying to give kids an opportunity to work to their feelings with the pulse but as you said that it's really any tragedy and helping them express themselves right\nRight it can be applied to any kind of tragedy uh there's nothing controversial in the book it's all very much about helping\nAnd I think the art particularly for younger kids is really going to help with that and there's also at the back of the books some resources you wouldn't let people know like things you can do is is lifted out\nRight or can you Tio gave me his hand flip the he used to help kids who were affected by pulse and he's let us use that in the back of the book it give tips a lot of what we talked about in the story itself the the three tips for staying safe or it's goes more in depth on those\nTalks about the symptoms and things to look out for signals of acting out losing interest activities not wanting to close doors withdrawal of clumsiness change an appetite things that let you know that maybe your kid needs a little bit of extra help\n[noise] now let's let people know how to get a copy of this\nIf you'd be purchased that my tears pulse dot com or new has creative group dot com which is my publishing company\nAnd once people purchased this the proceeds will benefit the Orlando United assistance center so Joelle thank you for being patient with us in getting ready to me that I'm so glad you're here let us know about the Orlando United assistance center\nYes so you're allowed to you know just as a center is a place are free support resources and hope for those impacted by the post tragedy it's basically a collaboration between the city of Orlando harder Florida United Way and the Orange County government\nWhere I currently serve as a community partnership developer when it first opened it was a victim advocate but now the community partnership developer and many people are unaware of the ... the ... primary primary audience for its programs are survivors of the attack a pulse nightclub on June twelfth twenty six scene\nAnd the families of those who are killed or injured there over two years down the O U ac has provided services of support through unique personalized case management\nBehavior health emergency basic needs onsite mental health counseling and a twenty four seven confidential crisis hotline which is a four Seventy five hundred ...\nReferrals to legal services crime victim research financial training in appointments\nEmployment services and support and navigating health services all outreach and support we're providing confidence to protect the survivors and the families and in general is the first to provide overall wraparound services in the south east east United States\nRecently we have brought in our reach to everyone impacted by the incident because we know there should be a focus our resilience as we recognize the ripple effects of the tragedy and this is why it was so important for us to collaborate on my ... supposed to provide a resource for parents and do this for the future\nHave you been getting calls in fact from parents about what to do\nOh yeah we've been getting calls even before like I'm I'm Keith had this wonderful idea of having this concept and there was nothing out their life that helps a caregiver or families to be able to talk about the situation in a very thoughtful way so yeah we've been getting phone calls and all the parents as she got a copy of it\nAnd they're so appreciated and now they have a tool to engage their um children\nThat's great and you know you you said ripple effects tell us about some of those ripple effects because all of the services you listed I Know somebody just didn't wake up and go this is all we can a neat I bet people asking questions and then you were saying how can we make that happen\nYes the ripple effects are really oh let me tell you we haven't started we haven't even seen the effects of what happened in central Florida due to pause we probably won't see the major effects of five or ten years down the road recently we actually had people that were trigger from nine eleven then never seek services before and mind you just ... years after\nThat now they're looking for the services so that's just example of one tragedy that people maybe they didn't have those services are the single services initially but then years later something else happens in their life or the real life\nWhile I never dealt with this especially when we talk about polls would there's a lot of people of color and on Latinos who don't seek mental health services because it's so stigmatized and community\nAnd a lot of times what we do in our household meaning Puerto Rican and I know that we don't talk about situations we don't we don't we don't share\nAnd hopefully with books like bees and just bringing awareness to the ripple effect because the team's conversations that people are open and honest and if the person is not there next to king maybe find that person to be able to talk to\n[noise] yeah so you're only now discovering some of those effects and you know getting the counseling like you say is something that people may hesitate to do but also I think it's some situations people don't realize they need the counseling they don't realize how much it's hurt\nThem exactly and I always say this everyone\nEveryone should have access to mental health services a lot of people on the ... oh I went through a tragedy I went to a traumatic experience I Need to seek mental health or really and reality there's a lot of stuff in our childhood that we'd probably having dealt with yet that you know having those services across the board I mean and things happening every day right\nNow we need to process so safe and having that mental health support was for someone or is it very healing\nAnd when you say things like employment counseling employment assistance I mean this is going in a lot of different directions and surely it's because you see the need\nYes so basically a lot of people like let's say ... directly impacted you know you go to a traumatic event like pause and then everything it's like a puzzle piece just opposes all fall out of place\nSo you know maybe that they lost their jobs as certain reasons are there the tragedy affected them to find employment or or maybe the appointment they had at that moment does it fit for where they are right now\nYou know so those are things that we help people and some of the people who are like looking for like ... they're looking for now unemployment that wasn't working before so we try to provide every type of service we can\n[noise] so the city as a whole is it's again it's still raw it's still something we're all trying to go through how do you at the Orlando United assistance center work with the city\nYou mean for the like the outreach orange yeah the outrage\nJust being out there talking to people engaging being in every community event that we can be just have conversations and let the city no and in the way we work with the city of Atlanta in orange county government is providing what are what are the gaps what are we seeing right now and what we need to pool there and\nIf it's something that's not available than let's make habits\nWe work also with national partners because um there was a lot of people that were undocumented there that night and a lotta people aren't aware of that when you're undocumented your victim of a crime\nYou qualify for the call you these are so then we have to get a national partners like immigration equality in New York to come down now hope our clients to that need was here wow yeah so\nSo it's a lot of stuff and then people don't realize that ripple effect in the layers that come out of never would have thought of that and oh yeah\nI even had um clients and people I worked with closely that we're living with HIV and not being treated for it but it's a whole that door it's kind of open and now they're in treatment now they're undetectable but if it wasn't for polls they party we haven't dealt with that\nBecause that's something that the that within the past and they just kind of like mass it over but now there's tragedy kind of like took that layer off so there's that's just one example\nSo you're doing referrals to organizations that are already taken\nIf you're not familiar with the mark street senior center is it's it's downtown that's a very far from the courthouse just north of the courthouse mark street uh just north of colonial drive so we hope to see their\nThen explain to us why Tiffany more wrestle circuit courts wanted to have this kind of event\n[noise] this is one of the ... for the Orange County clerk records because again the clerk's office actually handles restraining orders so what we call injunction Z and all types of which are restraining orders a we have all the filing of those and we assist\nPeople with filing those are so this is\nJust the synergy is there is this is an event hum and cause a that that we work on the court records so that that's why we hold this event in each year we tried to draw awareness towards domestic violence we just attended a harbor houses purple door luncheon were where they\nAre working to increase awareness of domestic violence and raise money towards it uh so again you know it just goes hand in hand with what we do here and for anybody out there ever needing an injunction or restraining order or go to our website again and we have all the information\nThere for you and we can help by all these for you that then go to the court to help those situations\nGreat information and again we want to remind people do that they can attend the event on the twenty fifth its quirks against domestic violence it's a workshop and so once again let people know how to get involved with asked\nYeah just visit our website and you can read his shirt or you can actually just show up quite honestly again it will be at the mark street senior center\n... a Thursday October twenty fifth at six o'clock is when will start\nAnd again we're going to have some information there with the clerk's office can help you do harbor house is going to have information there's going to be a presentation called reflections of trauma of that uh the mental health association is putting on there is a one of their counselors puts on this presentation of seen it before it's really good\nA meaning anybody who's gone through these sorts of trauma he's got\nTips of how to deal with that and um and how to work through that and then again there'll be a self defense class that Orlando police will be putting on so there'd be some good information there and so we hope you can come out\n... is director of communications and public affairs for the Orange County clerk of court\nTime Jenny do Bre or Washington watchdog and this is where Orlando turns first for

your annual fur ball and I'm Sorry to let people know are happy to let people know that you're\nYou're already sold out with tickets but you're looking for some auction items so we want to talk about that and we also want to let people know about um some special effort you have underway right now to rescue some dogs from that hurricane area so let's start first with the fur ball go ahead and tell people what you need\nOh well thank you very much ah we are really excited for this year's for about ... is our twenty seventh annual\n... gala and it is one of our largest fundraisers that we do have every year and this year it's taking place on November tent and we're very excited that we have so the little ever five hundred tickets are ready and it's going to be a great event\nAnd in order for us to make it the most successful event that we can financially possible for us on some of the fundraising things that we do at the event I included a silent auction and what we can really look for in our silent auction is restaurant\nGift cards and hotel gift cards and experiences and jewelry and sunglasses and things like that to our gas can bet on um we're hoping to get those things donated and our guest bet on them and they help us raise a lot of money for the pedal I had that night\nHow do people get that to you so they could either call me\nOn my phone number here or they can email it to email me whatever they have and we can usually make arrangements um either for them to drop it off at one of our to shelter location so want us in Orlando among us and tampered or we have lots of volunteers that can help it actually come to you and pick it up\nThat's great and of course this is going for such a good cause that yeah I I'm so happy sold out people can get tickets but they could still be a part of it by donating does items let's talk about your mission and what you're doing with pets\nSo we have a lot going on so this past year ah we adopted out a little over seven thousand animals from our ... said the exact number seven thousand one hundred and eleven animals that we adopted out from our to shelter locations we're are\nReally excited about that uh we are an owner surrender only shelter location so that means um people that are in situations that they can no longer keep their pets so sometimes they're moving or their health is declining or they are allergic or they have a new baby things like that I'm\nJust bring situations in their lives where they can no longer keep their pets so they would bring us bring them to us and their pet dog or cat will stay with us and tell they find their new forever family here and they get real well taken care of while they're here they've got\nLots of love we have lots of people that take the dogs out and they run with the dogs and they play with the dogs and we had kitty toddlers that love on the cat while they're here too\nAnd of course people can volunteer to help out\nAbsolutely I'm absolutely we are always looking for volunteers on tears are such a large part of what we do here at the pet alliance we can actually do what we do without them for last year we had\nWe had a little over Seventy nine thousand hours that were donated to us by volunteers and for us\nThat equals almost thirty eight full time staff people so we thank goodness every single day for the volunteers that come in here and they work out in the shelters and they help us with the dogs and the cats we can do it without them\nNow let's talk about what's going on you weren't going to be locating those animals that have been displaced due to the hurricane and connecting them with a home\n... yes we are so what what we're doing now so we've we've\nAlways try to help when called upon so we did it last year when we\nWere dealing with the hurricanes out in the Virgin Islands last year we worked with a couple of different organizations and we wound up rescuing um well we bought into our own shelters three a little over three hundred dogs and cats that came from Puerto Rico and the Virgin Islands after Hurricane Maria and\nWhat happens is after\nThings like this happen many dogs and cats are displaced their owners have to evacuate and they are left to themselves and the shelters are already full so they any play says the ... the shelters\nAt the locations me places where they can send the\nPets that are there so they can bring in more pets so what we do is we work real closely with various organizations to transfer the pets are from those areas\nOut of where they're at and they we bring them to us so right now we've already gone up to the panhandle and we've brought a few animals out of the shelters are the panhandle is we're currently working on transferring over a hundred of animals out I'm of the shelters out there and getting them to new shelters where they can find there forever home now\nBecause you're going through all of this and because of the experience do you advise everyone to go ahead and get their pet chipped\nI think it's a great idea I'm absolutely it it certainly makes it easier to track down your pet after or something like this happens obviously if you have to evacuate first choices to bring your pet with you wherever you're going but we know that that's not always possible so yes a tip is very helpful\nOkay and of course you know you're raising the money at the fur ball once again you can use items uh auction items raffle items but taking care of those pets or you use those funds for everything from what food to frankly just keeping the lights on don't you\nSo yes we do so art\nCost in every adoptable dog that comes in is around three hundred and fifty dollars so\nEvery dog that we adopt out and every cat as well\nAre all either ... or neutered they all get the rabies vaccine they're ... they're treated for fleas\nThey get their heart worm tests and they get heart worm preventative so really when they leave here and they go to their next family they are fully vetted at that point so yes the funds um the funds that we raise had events like that some of the\nFunds that we raised throughout the year help us continue to do that so we take care of the animals that come in and make sure that they are nice and healthy for their next owner\nName of that too though right hey Justin we have a Ross on the phone here are heroes on the phone roses plenty quest rose how can we help you today\n[noise]\nAnd now we do we know that and we had a circulating hot water this then put in and it reminded me of it when that other animal was talking about not being able to get hot wire now than we really enjoyed that I think I think the water to every state in the media hot water\nFor all the way it is\nYeah but my question is if we ever in your mind to build another how practical efficient system or is there a better way\nPractical inefficient in\nYou know cost like electric and all that\nUm I I think they are the the pumps themselves don't use or or move 'em a large volume of water it's kind of de do it gradually and slowly throughout the course of the day and they they keep that line a little warmer than than they normally be so that\nGets you into hot water a little bit quicker at it it's not something that uses a tremendous amount of electricity [noise] okay\nYeah I should be easy I Need you going to build a new house you will be if you do do they go into the five is survive because you need to complete the loop road and a wrong there does need to be that loop yeah did you need to have a ... pie going from that far away from the ... that that\nI mean I Know the plumbing desperate but I I this is what I had every day\nSo good to get him for the water heated annoyed astro by to go on to the pilot away from that to the house of the part ... part of their way ... or ... connections right there in the water away to college\nAnd then you also have the option to insulate the line you want to inflate it which is important I we had\nFour thousand square foot house apartment on one end and there any water area where you\nAsk them to do that it is it is the Germans of that size usually it's a great idea to have a re circulating says okay yeah cause the distance between the heater in the for the six year we want to ask is is\nIs that usually ... is a broad too many ... thank God Knows what the point that you need water to do is\nBe forty ... right exactly what to do water every day giving rose thanks for going in the\nRight to have\nBeen one of the day I got a quick morning quick\nQuestion I have a water main coming into my house that he said it's exposed to sun and the house was built thousands one I'm just wondering if\nThere is a lifespan that we should expect that that TV starts become really in the sun\nWill be a great question you know here here in Florida where the the sun can be quite brutal\nUh the PVC you know it gets very oxidized and it gets brutal very quick um it's not like we do need to make an important distinction between ... and in PBC or if it is if it's the ... and uses the current brings\nWe need to get you the protection on it immediately because that stuff breaks down very quick um but if it is BBC and it's a mainline coming in um I feed them because\nI mean how many just to talk to one Eighteen Seventeen years yeah I I think it's time to do something productive\nThey tend to get rid of all the time I found ... they get brittle with time and then unfortunately what happens is that they get hit with lawn equipment and when they're brittle out in the sun for several years they get hit with lawn equipment than they break\nThe law and much more the really the heart of it on these issues to break yeah that's\nOK because what is going to install water treatment system sauce and our and still probably just doubt that surrounded with some mulch or something that a lot of quitting doesn't come near it right\nAnd and at that point they'd be hopefully I'm not sure who the provider the installer as but hopefully the the the correct way to do that they'd be digging down below earth level to um to to uncover drug with his wife and then run it to to the filtration system\nSweat out there that\nIf you have to bank didn't expose now we've got so nice relation there\nThe ... and we use for the for a seat in\nBig cities these gold or insulation yeah\nYou can use that gate or does religion they say they protect you know it'll be for the ... one day all night long wise I mean Alan say go get it every single time by your guy more chances to sort of buy in for this by yeah you wouldn't have a minimal level of protection on that and the idea of\nIs it also freeze in the wintertime was totally exposing surprise has been frozen so far began you want to bring a little bit under the ground I don't know what the code is it there actually is water code burying depth on that I'm not sure but the gator installations granted here but yeah you might as well get it while you're there because you're at the end of his life span for sure and in that on some prevention worth about if you're\nNot gonna help we made me want you can give to that of a number of ...\nYeah okay I I loved born in ... when we got what kind of hoping that we\nMight have somebody ready but our phone number protest his four oh seven to nine one one six four four four o seven to nine one one six four four bleak doctors phone number on the phone numbers is four o seven four to six\nNine nine nine five All right so hey Hector traders are rebates going on right just as a rundown in time I Would imagine that have been on for a little bit to\nWe got a load of rebates come here right now I don't do that are really money need all the news is no like an air conditioned yes and that condition\nWhat are these these ... and don't have to go to a credit card to use um we had to be one or the process a thousand dollar credit out doing houses on his grade is what kind of been a major choose\nAll you see in fight until it got over two thousand voters mall and neither did you buy a plea for an adult I mean ... this is wrong and you have one of the kitchen table they were going to say look\nThis is one that really back to you right now in these through money\nA Duke Energy got up to a hundred dollars okay so you can buy a couple of days once when they do tend to have three thousand dollars\nBut amazing that is amazing and approach that we don't raise the price to lower the price you have a certain normal trained price unlikely XP twenty as a thousand dollars you actually Eighteen anything is eight hundred dollars and ...\nAnd put that with the power company ... it's a true great time of the year to do it and reason why train does is is it it's getting slower up north not necessarily in Florida as they try and keep their markets strong for a few more months were offering rebates kind of makes sense but it is the real deal is that it's not a story\nAnd uh there are some rebates on some plumbing products as well through different municipalities UC has one right to Justin\nHybrid high efficiency water heater she yeah and then jump toilets high fish and sea toilets and things so\nYeah checked with us when we're out there and we can hook you up on the phone number is four o seven to nine one one six four four and they're All right so guys have you ever been to the store and you need to measure something but you left the ruler at home mhm\nAgenda Justin never does he is so prepared and he's probably beat the Siberian Navy is probably a boy scout\nYou know I was I loved scouting okay flood oh so you're preparing always have a tape measure with you right yeah I don't either but I Know ... and all the time I sometimes I have one or two in my truck than they have ... you know yeah\nSo but I go to the store you want to measure something what do you do well you know a dollar bill because that's all I have I don't have twenties or fifties like Hector maybe does\nBut I just got dollars it'll sorry under the big appreciate a fix on Georgia what you see that one thing they're all the same size so that's oh there are all the American that's true\nBut it's approximately six inches long mhm yeah so if I Need to measure six inches I got a dollar bill if I Need to measure half of that folded and a half I got three inches ... put 'em together at nine inches so yeah it's pretty pretty so dollar bills a great way to measure something just closest not perfect 'cause actually six point something inches last so my\n... seven and a half yeah yeah okay okay yeah so I don't have anything in my wallet if I Do high debt credit card\nJust pay 'em come back later and if that goes through your replaces it bothers you measure on the dock hopping on that that would allow me to go read it because I was going to the three ... that's been one host\n... oh yeah I lose [noise] All right guys thank you thank you very much just there was a great great show um we'd be back with this Sunday we may get a good answer grapevine live a life like we we live I mean I thought it'd be live this week and I thought I guy will be back thank you [noise]\n\nThis is news Ninety six point five or ... or ... and do turns first for breaking news\nFour hours a day\nOn the clock a new study states going five double duty be off a D. V. oh we're off to a cooler day we'll check the forecast\nIn just a couple of minutes our top story for early voting begins in for central Florida counties on Monday and voters in orange seminal lake Anna Flagler counties will be able to cast their ballots for the midterm elections chat line Johnny Fernandez looking at the tight race in the U.S Senate\nAs this month a recent poll shows US Senator Bill Nelson is in a dead heat with Governor Rick Scott in the U.S Senate race of all done by Mason Dixon calling in Jacksonville shows a survey of the eight hundred Fifteen of likely voters the result shows now than it had a forty seven forty six percent lead over Scott\nSome of these bubbles ... some of these crazy as some of the uh ups and downs we see in the market because it's so intertwined with our emotions that that tends to get underway and create some of these\nUh you know these these headaches and these ups and downs so I thought we do is go through a couple of these and I'm a ... you\nKnow full disclosure Michael I kind of know the answer to writing the question so we'll do some rhetorical [laughter] some rhetorical questions already put together for you guys to consider a listening at home or in the car or some of these quizzes to see uh what you think about some market mania so the first question\nIs ah what is often considered one of history's first speculative bubbles that occurred more than three hundred and fifty years ago\nAnd revolver out of this own expected item so what was credited as the first bubble so we've had the tech bubble we've tried to real estate bubble all these different things but what's the first bubble that actually was three hundred and fifty years ago so was it\nFrench champagne ... was it Indian saffron Chinese jewelry or Dutch tulips\nNow we've talked about this on the show before yeah so regular listeners are renting we talked about this topic is about a year ago so regular stuff about soccer show may know what is credited as the item in the first bubble but what are you got John\nSo the ... it wasn't champagne saffron jewelry or tulips and of course it was the last one tulips fill up the other two above all is often credited as the first bubble\nWhen it comes to investing which is pretty interesting\nIt is sixteen sixteen thirty yeah when that bubble occurred and it was basically that was a pretty big thing that they traded back then tulip bulbs\nAnd so the value of tulip bulbs continued to rise and even they started to actually next to the colors together and there's it's actually fascinating yet yeah er into the market and into bubbles and mania is it is ... it's a fascinating to read what happened on that because again it it was a bubble without technology\nYeah well and you think about it you know those are there a formal futures markets therapist and so we worry you know in the future we trade coffee and commodities and these kinds of things we have futures market and we think of those is being so advanced but at the Nineteen thirties the futures market got people in a lot of trouble he had came to tulips\nBecause it was this you know luxury item and ah and we actually see that today with with roses and things around you know\nA different holidays or whatever farmers are like I'm going to stop growing corn because the prices of roses are through the roof that's kind of what was happening with tulips as people were\nSelling their land and uh not farming food and and you know getting rid of cattle all these things like this land can be used to grow tulips 'cause it's the most precious commodity in the world right and it turned obviously into a bubble and then people had a bunch of\nUseless or to a play on some very interesting\nExactly yeah that was credited as the first bubble tulip mania basically the first bubble sixteen thirty the says let's talk to your show talking all about bubbles in mania is you want to be a part of eight for for two two zero\nZero Ninety six five or you can always go to let's talk future dot com bust through the next one now this is about scientist so which scientists got caught up in the south sea bubble\nSo which famous scientist got caught up in the south sea bubble was that Newton\nGalileo burn a Cass or Darwin\n[noise] um I actually don't I actually didn't see this one so I'm going to guess that it was ...\nYeah I didn't I actually did not know this one and so south sea bubble occurred in Seventeen eleven and it was basically a British stock\nYour joints stock company which basically took the debt of Britain companies in bundled it together and it created a bubble in a famous scientist that got caught up into it was Newton and he was just at this this has dazzled by the south seas ...\nGrowth because again it in bubbles and mania is there's a lot of growth early on that's what attracts people to it holy cow I can make so much money so quickly and so that's what attracts people in in this case Newton of all people got caught up in the south sea bubble\nYeah so that was Seventeen eleven so again a lot of correlations to present day you think of you know mortgage backed securities and these you know our bundling debt and resell it sounds like such a modern thing\nBut apparently it's not right [laughter] so uh you know Isaac Newton was caught up in just such a scandal what a great quote from Isaac Newton and talking about it he said\nI can calculate the motions of heavenly bodies but not the madness of people yeah right and that's really what are the markets and and you know these mania is that we get caught up in our is a collection of people's emotions sure uh you know making bets here and there on the future and and when you have that going on\nYou can easily see how it can lead to such a collapse\nPlenty to your neighbor making so much money sure you know and they are the first two examples\nAnd tulips all my neighbors make a whole bunch of money and tulips I should be in the toilet bowl business as well even I don't probably know that much about tulips and here this is with a stock this was you know I traded stock that that they basically bundled some debt together and of all people Newt and got caught up into it\nYup yup so let's go to the next one here as we're talking through OK so this is a good one so I'm the most famous\nUh mania ending in a frenzy was October Nineteen twenty nine the stock market crash which uh you know spur the start of the great depression but how much in market value was raised on what is now called black Tuesday which was October twenty nights Nineteen twenty nine so how much\nAh how much money or how much market value was raised on just that one day or the six billion fourteen billion twenty nine billion or fifty billion ...\nAnd the answer is the second one which is fourteen billion dollars to the Dow Jones industrial average fell twelve percent on black Tuesday it's a a decline of thirty points so which is pretty interesting how many points do we lose just last week\nThe little pulled back we had it was over you know well over a thousand yeah solvency productive yeah thirty points on the Dow in Nineteen twenty nine was a big deal which was\nA right before I did for Thirteen percent so it was it was so heavy that are sixteen million shares of stock exchange hands and that was a record that stood for the next um forty years so for forty years we didn't have\nAs much of a sell off as we did in Nineteen twenty nine pretty incredible now of course fourteen billion dollars is you know chump change in today's markets but back in Nineteen twenty nine was a very big deal\nSure absolutely well let's let's talk to your show talking all about mania is an bubbles and so let's go to the next one this is an interesting one and I think people are going to know that one so here's the question collectible items became somewhat of a mania as virus hope that the latest consumer fad became the next rare baseball card\nThat's occurred in the Nineteen nineties and had somewhat of a childish seemed to it mhm is it a beanie babies tickle me Elmo pogs or I'm a Gucci setting the Nineteen nineties we had a bubble if you will on disk collectible\nAnd all of those actually that you mentioned there all four of those kind of had a bit of a mania behind they did with the ...\nWas a you know huge craze tickle me Elmo of course there was you know trampling deaths than people trying to run over each other going into Walmart\nI still have pogs yeah ... you know ... or\nThe answer is the number one uh you know toy craze of the mall which has beanie babies yes ah we were actually talking about this uh last night we were at a a a a dinner with some friends share and uh this topic came up and it's almost ... have you seen the picture which is kind of iconic now and it's in a courtroom\nAnd it's a couple ... in a divorce court room\nAnd they're ... they're actually on the ground separating their beanie babies and I think it was the mid nineties or late nineties whenever you have at the height of the crisis was and there was a court or a divorce court judge witnessing the separation of there'll be any bad that's fire and it's become kind of an iconic picture if you haven't seen it I'm sure you can find it on\nGoogle but you know that kind of just I'm capture encapsulates what a crazy this really was\nYeah it's crazy\nI was like a Princess Diana won that sold for you know tens of thousands of dollars and you had to keep a tag on him\n[laughter] whys Eric I think that's one of the one that the freshest in people's minds obviously are ones from two or three hundred years ago people may not remember but we are up on a bright but want to throw one\nOut before the break this was pretty big in the Nineteen fifties and Nineteen sixties and it was basically a popular game so it was a drive in theaters hula hoops bowling or television broadcast so what was really popular what was the bubble in the Nineteen\nFifties and Nineteen sixties drive in theaters hoops bowling or TV broadcasts will tell you when we get back to show is all about you your finances and your future that's why
