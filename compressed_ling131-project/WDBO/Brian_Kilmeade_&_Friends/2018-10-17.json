your low cost providers and a target fun but the problem I have is um I Know you own locked index fine so how do you get over the fact that you indirectly own stock the company that you do not like\nYou know I indirectly own shares and banks that I bash all the time and so in a sense I'm hurting my own investments I also am an indirect owner of companies I don't trust and don't respect\nAnd the way I look at it is that that is passive investing I'm not making the decisions that not choosing to put money in in that or not it's just part of a basket of hundreds or thousands of companies that little teeny amounts of my money go into\nAnd I just accept that that is\nWhat is a tiny part of what I'm invested in there's an expression perfect is the enemy of the good that you end up if you keep trying to do everything perfectly you end up doing nothing\nAnd so the advantage to her on balance is so great being in that target retirement fund\nThat is essentially in large part of a variety

Sasse have you want to put and ... says it's trying to get our society today in perspective what about getting American history and prospective Doris Kearns Goodwin us in Studio and uh she has a a great new book out called leadership interviewing turbulent times\nOr if there's a better story in the country I just don't know who it is um she draws upon\nA all four presidents in particular Abraham Lincoln theatre Roosevelt FDR and LBJ a prison she knew a lot about going in right doors\nYeah I spent many years with them so many years that I felt like I was waking up with them in the morning and thinking about that when I went to bed at night\nThat's so interesting because uh the way I looked at this book I said did you call from what you know or did you have to go back and dig again\nI definitely have to take again I mean the reason I chose to these four instead of writing about a whole new president was it each time I would leave the guy behind when I went from FDR to Lincoln or Lincoln to teddy I'd feel like I was leaving an old boyfriend hind feel guilty so I thought what if I keep my four guys\nBut look at them through the lens of leadership and I had to learn a lot more waited there and mission come from how did they run for office the first time\nHow did they were in ... change from South to something larger questions that weren't part of my sprawling biography so and I read a lot of literature from business actually 'cause there's so many leadership literature is because I ended up doing case study of all of them which sort of along the business lines\nSo you said you you read the business to find out about the leadership principles in the as applied to these guys in\nMany ways I did I've been lecturing for the last couple of decades to leadership groups in business many times as well as universities\nAnd they write about leadership more than a lot of other people do so I think it's human nature if you're a leader of a huge company than the traits you need to have a a a team that works well to infuse purpose in the team to be able to communicate to the team to reach out beyond the puppy on ... these are all qualities that we need in politics as well\nSo are you going to bring Lincoln he was not born a great leader right\nAbraham Lincoln it's an extraordinary story I mean to think about this young man who only has twelve months of schooling he has to scour the countryside for books and read everything he could lay his hands on but he was born with empathy there was a sense in this little kid even when he saw his friends put hot coals on turtles to make them are eagle he told them that's wrong\nHe came by a drunk and man on a highway one time not highway road\nAnd all of his friends passed by he lifted him up and carried him to a fire and take taking care of him there was something inside that guy that I think was there from the beginning but boy he had to develop\nWho tell me what to wear this story you know and can go corroborate\nHe uh he didn't like his dad his dad was really tough man and his dad used to know son was very wrestler and he's the rest of them for money and one time he takes on a I don't know all strokes first name was a jak yep jak I'm saying so they ended up wrestling and when his father and what his father went to finish them off\nWell wanted him to finish it more if you let 'em up and then the mob would after Lincoln and Armstrong was the one to push them back and said he ... he beat me fair and square that ended up being friends for that is\nA story that I've heard too and I think the important part of that story too\nIs the father was always resentful of the fact that Abraham Lincoln wanted to read books he thought it was lazy in a physical culture that demand a constant effort to fail the trees and plants across he would take the books away from him at times so we had to fight for education against it very father and I think that's where the alienation took place 'cause he wanted to learn so badly\nSo you have somebody to an end noon or you know you the civil war when people say Lincoln he takes office as tough as as as much as he had empathy he also knew we had to win a war and it would mean tens or hundreds of tens of thousands being dead\nAnd he said he's pushing his generals to fight to the man who didn't want to put a cold in the back of a frog nobody had to push generals to have one American shoot another American is that part of leadership doing making the tough decision that may rank who your rank who your instincts\nWithout a question he wants said how strange it is that he had hated violence ... never even want it to kill a turkey when he was young would find himself in the middle of the bloodiest war in time\nAnd yes you have to be both merciless and merciful you have to be both patient and perseverance\nAnd he was both things at the same time he encountered that side of the great place where the empathy comes out is once he is winning the war once the union is coming to an end with the war he gives the second inaugural and talks about reconciling with the south but until that moment of triumph he was willing to expend every bit of bloody hacked to in order to get the war one and get slavery ended up\nIt's amazing to or if you think about ah the humidity at do you think humility has something to do with great leadership some say good shows weakness to say I don't know what somebody else whose ideas come out and not be yours that could show vulnerability where does humidity and vulnerability come in\nSome way some for some reason in today's world it seems vulnerable to admit weaknesses in the earlier days certainly for Abraham Lincoln when he runs for office the first time it's a wonderful statement he makes every man has his peculiar ambition minus to be a steam death by my fellow man\nBut I'm not sure if you'll understand me and I'm not sure if you vote for me\nAnd if I Do lose I won't be too chagrin because I'm familiar with disappointment but then he says but I'm going to try five or six times until I'm too humiliated and then I won't try again I promise\nSo he says to me ... you come with me on this bill and you bring your Republicans to help break the southern democratic filibuster two hundred years from now schoolchildren will know only two names Abraham Lincoln an effort to says how conduction resist that's going on all different levels he's he's trying to persuade people\nSo what was the America that FDR took over\nWhen you think about it he was so worried in February of thirty three that the whole house of cards might collapse before he even got their people were taking their money out of the banks because the banks didn't have their deposits on hand to take care of people's savings as they were pulling them out\nThe banking system was collapsing for one out of four people had only had jobs and the jobs were for small numbers of wages and a few hours\nThere were people in the streets who are hungry there was a feeling that capitalism itself with at risk\nAnd when he came on what he had to give most importantly was contagious optimism it wasn't that he didn't like I'd be knowledge in his inaugural he said only a foolish optimist would not deny the dark realities of the moment\nBut if we can come together as a people and if the government can help with the problems we have they have to help with jobs the private sector couldn't do it any more states couldn't do it even ... even if it's make work jobs you give people back a dignity until the economy gets going and then you had the longer kind of jobs that would be possible once the economy got going\nAnd he got them into the sea Sisi the civilian conservation corps a whole generation of young people would have been without jobs and they're working in the woods and they're learning camaraderie and they're learning common mission something I Wish we had today as well\nSue W PA a W PA and the ... WALDS wonderful initials he had but you know in fact the interesting thing is they had two different people working on jobs one must Harry Hopkins who like the small term make work jobs if it needed to be even if it's ... and you get the person to going across the street and coming back\nAnd then Harold Ickes the secretary and interior wanted long jobs like dams and public works projects that would last and then come back to the economy and they began to fight in public and he didn't like that so we ... them on a cruise in the Panama Canal for three weeks so they could drink and fish together by that time their fight was undone and that's how you have to deal with those kinds of problems inside your government\nComing out of the depression and you are looming ahead is a World War\nSo how are we going to afford to fight in this world let's stay out of the American public didn't want any part of it at the same time how do we stand up this economy\nAnd then a lot of pushback from conservatives who don't want the social programs correct correct as their instincts or social programs are going to be hard to break up which we don't really in programs even today which is why we're seven hundred and eighty billion dollars over budget right now\nAre on the deficit so he was able to get through it now bringing me to the psyche of FDR where's this leadership come from\nYou know I think from the time he was young he was confident he was gifted with an optimistic temperament\nBut I think he was the kind of person who experiment it through the new deal and then to even during the war\nYou try something if it doesn't work you say to yourself I have to find something else\nAnd the great thing you did during World War two as he realized that his relationship with the business community\nWas at odds obviously and he needed them to build the ships the tanks the planes and the weapons convert their factories so he put up an olive branch to them he stopped antitrust regulation he'd build their factories he gave them profits that they would already have\nAnd it was the most magnificent government business relationship in the history of our country three shifts today what they produced in planes and airplanes which we gave to lend lease all over the world it was an extraordinary partnership I I Love thinking about that whole mobilization\nKeeping the country together in keeping the allies together in one of those allies is Joseph stone\n[noise] and he saw only at the end of his life he began to see what was going to happen with stones he needed style in her early on Russia was essential for keeping the German forces out of Russia and so many Germans were killed because of the Russians he\nNeeded Russia he thought to come into Japan if we were going to invade Japan we would lose a million people he wanted the UN and he needed Russia for that so he wasn't in the best of health when he made those decisions but I think he would have made them anyway\nThen stolen became a much more complicated character then he'd rely LBJ\nComes out at one thing about um you mentioned before that he does do deals we don't do any deals anymore you know we don't really compromise and his wife just play just for a for a Ben Sasse Jeff Flake saying there's no ... there's no rewarding compromising these days was it a different American LBJ now without question\nYou know the congressmen and senators used to stay in Washington they play poker together they weren't racing home to raise their money\nThey their wives knew each other their kids know each other I mean he could call on friendships that were true I mean there were real friendships but he also never stopped calling he'd call it's six in the morning he'd call it new and even colder senator too and my hope but didn't wake you up but I Need you on this deal\nAnd he promised them what they needed for their states but there was a larger goal in mind that could be civil rights are voting rights or Medicare or Medicaid\nUm he knew what he was doing the means to the end but it worked and they they got something out of it and so did he instead of the country\nRight so if I was sitting there and and I want to teach leadership to my uh twelfth grade football team or a my son or daughter what can I take from FDR\nI think you could take that what a leader has to do is to have a bond with the people that he's talking with he\nKept up conversations in those fireside chats he knew as long as he explained the problems to the people\nAnd he told them why he was doing what he was doing they would then come along with him so he kept talking he kept listening I think having that communication with whoever you're trying to lead no way you're going and then be able to explain to the people why they should go there with you\nAnd then yeah there'll be J who was a leader a lot of people are but he also we cut deals the ends justify the means right\nYes and he would say what convinces his conviction in the end he knew what he wanted to do but in order to get there he had to do a lot of things to make it possible and that's what Congress used to be about why not just share some of the largest of what's happening in the cities in the states in the country is with with the nation\nOf Donald Trump shocked the world no doubt what advice would you give him now two years in two years left maybe six\nI think one of the things would be to get out of Washington more I mean Teddy Roosevelt went on a train for six weeks every spring and fall so he could visit people in local areas here their complaints listen to them\nAnd learn from them teddy said the worry for America and I still worry today is if people in different regions sections um parties religions begin to see each other as the other I mean that's partly what you were talking about before\nAnd the way to do that is to just go and see as many of those people as you can even if they haven't voted for you to expand your\nBase and under admitted that was the big worry the Thirteen colony so that they wanted you to stay in their own states they had to be convinced they had to ... were stronger together\nAnd that's why all George Washington went around the country to to be able to visit the different states to make them feel part of a hole we've lost that sense of common duties and common interest in the country and we have to re pain that sense of citizenship people in the military have it when they come back\nThey've had a common mission they care about that that goes across race party any kind of

do with just America and the stuff that happens here domestically globally and the world is watching on this one three two three five three twenty four twenty three and she had been some show is your Twitter Chuck Todd akin to join us here in a minute that's shut down\nDown here in Arizona with me I was going to be at this place called the big up the street here and he's he's meeting the midterms and the midterms are huge uh last night we had to battle with Sally and and cinema\nAnd then tonight you've gotten better when Cruz battling here the world is looking on what's gonna happen to the Senate gonna flip is the house gonna flip is it going to be both is going to be non\nAnd uh you know he's taken out of the road so it's very interesting for me to press Chuck Todd how you doing Chuck\nI'm pretty good how are you\nI Am doing great uh so you're out here in Arizona you're going to be meeting or the midterms very interesting uh it is a we've got a big battle going on out here but there's battles across the country yes\nYou do I mean uh I'm doing going out West is wait two days here and you guys and Phoenix than ah than today's in Nevada and then next week it took a while since ever basically the end is I tell\nEverybody the midterms are being followed and the sun belt right basically from Las Vegas to Orlando uh but the sunbelt states are going to decide which direction of politics has had left or right\nIt is it is very interesting obviously we have we have ah we have mix Sally in cinema who they didn't do the battle I thought they were going to do last night it didn't really it it looks kind of or just look robotic I'm interested obviously tonight to you've got the big one\nWas better and cruise but these things are I mean you know the world is watching here in America is watching big time because there's a few seats that have the potential to go from red to blue\nYou know it's funny in these debates that I think sometimes it's not fair to the candidates for Senate you know as viewers\nWe expect all of our candidates to debate like presidential candidate and the fact that these folks are not very um you know they don't do this very often and so I Do think many Senate debates can look more robotic\nUm then you're really because for many it's only the second or third time they've ever debated and in a format like that so I'm always a little bit I I Try to give each of them the benefit of doubt but I tell you this this Senate race fascinates\nMe because the two members of Congress before they started running against each other we're actually trying to beat each other one was planned to being a centrist to the to the left at one of the state of the centers that link right and then now they're both running as candidates that ... you're you're not quite sure if either one of the recognizes the campaigns are about\n... you don't want that that's it last night 'cause my take away when I watch the the the ... the you know you either used with Sally in their cinema and they're going at it and here you know they're going to do which one's going to get flake seat I walked away from it thinking to myself self I didn't learn anything new\nAnd I don't know what to believe anymore and and for all the stuff of worrying about a Russia Russia Russia checked the reality is dark money and all of these wacky commercials and this propaganda you get thrown out of it is far more confusing than that\nIt is and it doesn't help when I think in ... and frankly I'm going to\nGo after both candidates both candidates duck the press\nThey are they are interested in talking the local press um and and and they both ... you know they both been very hesitant about\nSitting down for for interviews whether it be our reporters reporters from other you know it hasn't battered what network there from it as a matter of any of that it is they have been\nLetting their money do the talking with voters and I think that is why you find yourself the way if you haven't scholars if you've been able to hear from either one of them in an authentic setting ride ... you've only seen them in a prepared studying either a television set where the debate without or a television set with the commercials cut\nYeah that's nuts it's nuts talking to Chuck Todd or for me depressed he's not doing meet the mid term so you're in Phoenix then you go to Vegas and then you're going to go out to the east coast you're gonna go we're Tampa and where else\nDallas uh where I'm not just that Senate race really in Texas more for the house races and all these places there's usually and all these places there's two or three competitive house seats to go with the competitive Senate race or the competitive governors [noise]\nYou know it's funny that you say we shouldn't get used to and I think so many people are used to Trump and the way he wasn't the debate and we think that every debate is going to be some sort of reality television show and it's not going to be that way it's never going to be that way the reality is is like you said these people haven't done this very much and and and everything is is very ...\nThey're all you know it strikes me as you can tell they all want to make sure they stay exactly whatever they have on our website and they don't give you more and and most most debate\nFormat\nFraternity they even get more right at the end of the day you're just finding out which one of them had better and articulate\n\nWhatever they are the best\nTime jak candidate is is in the unscripted setting it in the you know and you wish there were ten debates rather than just I think there's only been one out here and I don't know if they're going to have another one you\nDon't know you know and you can tell the two of them don't even talk\nIt's man that even looking at each other and that is that is a shame because you know the the\nYou know where you're you're you disagree without being disagreeable but if you're not even speak into each other um the two candidates running against each other well how you supposed to get used to work together to ensure you got to work with somebody on the other side\nSo true so

if you want Nancy Pelosi back in the the leadership you're going to vote Democrat and get that and she said I'm going to shut it down and I'm going to raise taxes if you put a Republican back in the leadership ... you're going to keep the start comeback\nGoing for our country and that's why people like Lee and Marquez Peterson and what a great leadership I mean she is the head of the Tucson Hispanic Chamber she's a business woman she will be such a great way in Congress and represent Arizona I thought well\nYou know I saw something today Rona that said that the the the for all of the stuff that's going on with the Democrats and you know the way that they the victims have been tallied all of these kinds of things and trying to bring in all these people of color they're struggling and a lot of ways with Latino voters I talked to a dreamer last night or are we talked for a good hour\nAnd he said you know minus the dreamer thing and he thinks oddly enough that he believes Trump is actually the one who's gonna end up getting dark and stuff actually done he said you don't mind is that the that a lot of Latino voters they don't look at the Democrats the way that I think they think that they should in all\n[noise] no and I think Hispanic voters Latino voters they recognize that unemployment and the Hispanic community is that the lowest\nThat had been in history people who are small businesses which so many people come to this country especially in the span of community owned small businesses they're seeing a growth on their businesses are able to hire more people because of deregulation because of the main academy\nAnd that's coming because of Republican\nPolicies and Democrats you know the president has reached out to Democrats he's willing to work with them they just rip off him at every level the only way you're going to get bipartisanship in Washington now it's actually reject the resistant obstruct\nPlay but that the Democrats have been running for two years and when they lose using that playbook they will have to come to Washington I work with President Trump and then I think we will get immigration reform and deal with the dreamers at all the things that so many people what\nTaking care of from their leaders and the and the nation's capital\nSo we look around the country and again you know from the the battleground here in Arizona with Mitch Sally and cinema and taking over flake seat to what's going on with with crews and bad do you go to hide cameras just pretty much over and done but\nWhat are some other races we should be watching that may surprise some people\nYou know because it again the whole number of things the polls that that kind of a lot of people now step back and say I don't really believe all those polls look what happened on you know in November of two years ago with Trump so we can't buy under those what are some races where maybe it doesn't look good but the reality is on the ground you're hearing something different\n[noise] well I think Minnesota's state to watch right now that Senate seat there you've got Karin Housley running against ... so that's going to be a really interesting race she the\nWife of a former NFL hockey an NHL Hockey player and a state that President Trump only lost by forty five thousand votes so they're somehow states their New Jersey Bob here again running against Menendez there's a lot of races across the\nThat tree that I'm looking at that there could be some guy does that surprise but most importantly we have to elect by the next ... at the Senate ... get in the ... year governor and we have to elect landmark has Peterson at Wendy Rogers and at ... and these great representative in Arizona\nYou know it's it it is as I sit here and talk to you who you argue the chair of the Republican National committee and people always say to me you know you'll have somebody like Renault why don't you have somebody on the on the Democratic side I said I offered to an all the time I said I've asked me I've asked I've asked cinema to come on a hundred times she won't I've asked everybody from the Democratic side I've got my bookers working on\nCome on I'll give you a platform I'm not even I'll ask you questions you can throw it out there I'm not here to spend it and the reality is wrong if they don't want to do it and it it it boggles my mind\nWell because they're running as one thing because the end they'll govern as another and send them as the classic example I mean Arizona is really need to go look at her record instead of the things she's right on that and and what she's running as now she's writing at the ... are going to wash that work with Republicans she well she absolutely well\nShe just wants to help them keep them already and and that's the game they playing all across the country will run it one thing and that will go to Washington and do whatever Chuck Schumer an ethical as they tell us to do and that's the most important thing otherwise they come on you're shall and they share\nWhat they're running out and they talk about their records and they take a tough question but if she comes died in ... back I'd love to ask a question [laughter]\nYeah well I I doubt that's going to happen in trust we've tried everything and and again not just\nYou know ... you're not just an Arizona nationwide we've we've tried everything with and none of them seem to want to come on and talk and I'm always one for talking and I think it's great when we can sit there and have a conversation and doesn't have to be a debate and\nYou get your eyes out your your your message out there and and use your voice out there I'll let it happen but a lot of times I get frustrated because they won't come on and people say why don't you I tried they don't want to uh run amok dinner appreciate you coming on day she's chair of the Republican National committee as always time of your busy but thanks so much for coming on spending time with us today\nThanks for having me and I'll come back anytime you take\nLike so much that you had mentioned shows your Twitter ca J. D. B. E. N. S. O. N. All right so now I you know I look at I look at the whole thing with this you know 'cause I'll get it people start treating me why don't you had this person when I ask\nEverybody right and here's my thing I Want you we all through my opinions out there when it's me when I bring somebody on my goal is to allow them to have their voice\nAsked some questions that maybe you would ask but not to be confrontational 'cause I don't think he gets anywhere you don't solve anything by screaming at each other but ask some fair questions and allow them to have the message and then you take that and you do with what you will but nobody wants to\nTalk and the one thing I'll say is Republicans by and large they'll come on to talk now in fairness mix Sally offered\nHer on numerous occasions she's not come on either or but she's been in the bill that she says she was going to come on and she's you know but in fairness they won't\nThey think the day you\nKnow I don't feel good and that frustrates the heck out of me because I think how are we going to have a conversation you know the one thing I like like banning the\nMinute you may not like him right but the fact that he went into like the under Bill Maher show and he did what he did and he said I'll only do\nEstablishment left leaning media I won't do right leaning media anymore only come onto the MSNBC said the bill Mars to the to the to the to the places that lean left because I'm okay with that 'cause I bring with it you know the ammunition I Need which is the fact that I have and we go from there I find that admirable\nAnd he's looking for confrontation I don't want competition I won't conversation\nAnd you'd be surprised how many times like no they'll ignore you they'll ignore you\nIt's sad three two three five three twenty

biggest decision that will affect and many many people potentially could be this in a in a weird way\nI understand what Trump's trying to do I do not only is it about the money\nAnd the hundred and ten billion dollars a will be flowing to some of these companies by the way only about fourteen point five billion of actually been signed sealed and delivered to these companies when it comes to the arms deal that we're doing with them but on top of that\nYou want to keep them close even though they're adversarial to us even though we have a very porous relationship at times with them to say the least uh they\nA big fans of us and we're not big fans of them but they hate us\nAnd we hate them but we really really hate the Iranians when it comes to a lot of this stuff and they really really hate the Iranians\nSo through default we find a way to deal with one another and the worry is that right when I say we hate the Iranians I mean we don't have the rating people we hate their leadership and we hate their nefarious miss those things where somebody can take that they hated Iran Iraq Islamic ...\nThe reality is they're worried the what is the what is what if Iran starts to grow their footprint\nExports more of their ... export more of their their ideology exports more of it and starts to spread things to the tip of the spear that's what they're worried about their footprint grows their influence grows to the point where they're going to be in a bad situation\n'cause they're not good friends\nTo the point where odd friends have come out of this which is Israel and Saudi Arabia because they do are not fans of Iran as we all know\n\nLindsey Graham today throwing down as he does this guy is a wrecking ball he had just gotten murdered in a conflict and turkey and to expect me to ignore it or feel Houston abuse I was on the floor every time defending Saudi Arabia because there is a good ally\nYeah and that's the big thing such walking a very tight line of what do I do at this moment in time because I don't want to lose them as an\nAlly in a situation where the middle east and this is this the friends for a nice it's Archduke Franz Ferdinand of this day and age is this

investment firms massive titans I may just you couldn't believe when you get them coming and saying we're not coming\nPeople are looking but the political side of things are totally different and Trump has to walk that fine fine line and I don't know what's gonna happen but he's got a serious decision and I think what he's trying to do at this moment in time is say look he told me no\nI asked him on the phone now you're saying they're guilty until proven innocent wow where we've heard this before but\nIntelligence to say no we got we got phone messages we got records we got text messages we got some means\n\nOf their self is to sell some say\nSo very interesting to see what will happen and from past to figure out what he's going to do and this is vitally important not just because of the money and that's what people in the left are going to make this all about\nBut because of what if because if Trump yes is wrong here says no were pulled out route and all of a sudden six months

who live long ago that may have lived in North and South American just holy unhelpful for any national later to cling to DNA to determine or or to establish that their Native American in this country\nYeah this is really backfired on her that's Chuck ah Hoskins a part of the Cherokee Nation and this is really backfired on her it has I think she thought she was going to get out in front of this is just because they look at this is going to be grades you got to be amazing\nAnd look at this I got in there but what do you think of those apples they're like slow down you know you're not even close and\nAnd yeah so you've got some uh I still gonna be Larry's to be just pay to pay ... million ... million bucks to the Cherokee here I'll give you guys a million bucks to make sure that she had a party\nOr niche so she has really taken a lot of heat from it on both sides of the\nRight the rights always laughed at her but the left has come out and kind of put their head and their hands on what oh this is not good and the Cherokee Nation because remember this is all about being part of the Cherokee Nation there like this this this we ... we got a bone to pick with you\nReally do than drill down to the issue of whether a person has Cherokee ancestor for example or ancestry of any particular tribe it's useful to uh connect herself with some when agents and useful determine paternity um but it does it narrowed down the scope of who you\nAnd says the word to any identifiable tribes\nNo no no zero\nBut this was to prove a point this is nothing she wanted to try to prove a point yesterday\nDoes she have some sort of made of yeah but how small is it potentially one thousand and twenty fourth one one thousand and twenty fourth is is what she is it is so ridiculous\nRight like the ... it is it's it's insane but remember\nThis is a woman who's talked about this over and over again talked about the fact that oh you know my mom and dad couldn't get married because you know there was no way because she was part Delaware part Cherokee all of these kind of the she is played this up a lot Brian Williams and a bunch of other people and really got played up when she was at Harvard now when Harvard said when they hired her\nThey thought she was as white as it comes I guess that she says why does she get on a house that's she goes and it was that way until they needed to have diversity in the faculty and then all of a sudden they said well let's do this and and then it became a much bigger thing\nAnd lo and behold the story blossomed from there\nWhat she's doing I think is a response to what the president United States has said\nAnd in Indian country we're looking at Washington DC and what we want to help and we want leadership and it's not particularly helpful the Indian country ah for this kind of debate to go back and forth we have a lot of issues we would rather the president United States than Senator Warren\nFocusing on things that affect us housing and healthcare clean water clean air there's a lot of issues that we can use their leadership on we don't think it's particularly useful to have them in a back and forth about DNA test and the name calling and that sort of thing\nI can give you one bit of advice Chuck again you're ... is the guy from the Cherokee Nation and give you one bit of advice stop looking at the government look at the lumber these\nRight North Carolina look at them they want nothing to do with the government even though people to petition I'll never have to have you know uh get they get they get money and this that near the lobbies want no part of it and if you look around when government has given more money\nTo to to Native American tribes and across the board and it fails miserably look at that and say to yourself you know what we're going to go out and do it ourselves\nThat's the best advice I can give you\nWrite the best advice I could give you get the hell away from that now it's saying that I mean I did a DNA test for\nA Father's Day it was interesting at least Fifteen million people have already taken a cheeks wa been sent a sample of their DNA that at home testing services you may not be one of them but some in your family may have done it and that means the chances of being linked up with a distant cousin are pretty good\nGod that is true as well as the angry mob where people say they are just Democrats who just being a rational there's so much Republicans they always assume that as the Democrats and Republicans are Republicans Democrats but I always wonder what independents\nThink about that I always wonder about what people who are undeclared think about that too many days and counting we still have a say we will have a second verdict on Trump's Republican Party and guess who was setting records already in their quest for reelection and twenty twenty\nI'll let you know what he's already done and that's the part of the United states he's already raised a hundred and eight million dollars if you combine it for what he raised with the RMC it's three hundred and thirty seven billion dollars\nHow impressive is that it is an all time record that is not hyperbole it is an all time record is written up by the Washington Post today who basically was in all of the ground game and the cyber game of the currency and Donald Trump and\nHis willingness to grow his base you know when he goes out there and does these rallies and some say do they should be televised they shouldn't have all the same and they're not it doesn't matter\nEven if the midterms do not produce the retain the house and Senate for the president\nKeep in mind every time these tens of thousands show up their names are recorded their backgrounds are are put into a computer database and volunteers or solicited especially volunteers who come out of the rally feeling as though Donald Trump\nIs talking to them so case these Democrats are going to wind up and double figures from Michael ... to Cory Booker you have an uphill battle\nJust because Donald Trump is atypical controversial uh unorthodox you think that he's vulnerable but the more you look at the machine that he has\nIt's ... the Republican Party which the month think of all even a year ago\nYou have to wonder if some Democrats are going to think twice I remember how thin the uh the the uh the race was and they can candidates were to get the Republican nomination when Bill Clinton was running for re election I mean it is a poll numbers are in a high fifties\nAnd it was coming off the beach when the Republicans took their best shot and lost so Bob Dole was the one who got the nomination with very little competition a Jack Kemp was running against him but he never had a shot\nAnd then when you saw the race wide open you saw double figures for the Republicans not as many for Democrats because the incumbent was almost Hillary Clinton\nNow you see double figures for Democrats 'cause they think this presidents vulnerable I just don't see it that way I think it's going to be a lot harder than they understand but when it comes to the midterms first things first\nThe part of the United states was asked a question and he was asked basically in the past past presidents have gone out and they've campaigned at the MIT terms and it hasn't worked out well\nBill Clinton pulled off the road by George Stephanopoulos when they said you're actually hurting these candidates first midterm uh George Bush never really went out heavily in the mid term elections rock Obama got ... first made terms those were his words in particular when he lost out almost lost the Senate he would eventually lose both\nSo Donald Trump's out he came out and so you know what I don't really think I'm hurting I think I'm helping build the headlines were Donald Trump says we lose it's not my responsibility how is that right by the way that was with the headlines on drugs as well which is shocking to me [noise]\nBut just to look at the midterm elections and see we're at right now the blue wave is not going to happen a blue taking of the house could happen however\nThe Senate seems secure where we are we talking on Labor Day that the Senate was in jeopardy but now Texas is steady in the upper cruise\nMarsha Blackburn seems firmly in control for now in Tennessee Governor Scott is close to taking that seat from Senator Bill Nelson who's just ancient and ineffective and you know you're dealing with a joke and it's not like you know you're trying to take out Marco Rubio a Republican in his prime your attorney ticket a Democrat who's just in visible in the Senate\nAnd then you have John James is going to be a guest on a different our in our show he's closing in Michigan McCaskill's in trouble in Missouri so we'll talk about

doesn't like him I get it you could still do it and as the president looked at as I'm attacking her not all women um attacking her as a as a president and the person not all Republicans\nBut it
