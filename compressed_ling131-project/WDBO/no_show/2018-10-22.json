you know the um stick it in your head and neck that with the car and it's still water everywhere right and so she said crack pipe crack pipe so anyway I was I was I'm actually relieved\nBecause I thought oh what is it going to cost to get my wife off crack right not mentioned that's a really expensive pipe yeah frack [laughter]\nUh I had to share that with you talked to taxes always are proud of them um anyway hey last night was it a problem for the dissenters campaign he looked fidgety and nervous and anxious to two shots didn't really doing any favors I mean in my opinion his coaches didn't coach him very well now he may be a fine governor and he may when\nI'm but Andrew Gillum just looked calm cool and collected Donald Trump though he just wait it out\nA dissent has had a great debate victory tonight against Andrew Gillum a mayor who presides over one of the worst drought and most corrupt cities in Florida run will build on the great job done by governor Rick Scott Gillum will make for the next Venezuela\nA Tom Nichols writes it was an amazing moment Jake Tapper do you think Trump is a good role model for your children to Santa's he move the embassy to Jerusalem which was awesome\nSo that was the response to that question let's bring in general and political expert Christopher heath who watch the full debate last night person I had a debate over this morning a Chris ... thanks for being with us number one number two as you said a million Floridians have already early voted so it won't really matter what\nHappened last night at least those votes\nAre thinking maybe five million six million Floridians will go and and as we stand here right now probably a million of those votes have already been cast in in the vote by mail across most of the the state you have in person\nEarly voting going on right now and by the time we have the next gubernatorial debate which will be Wednesday of this week uh we could be you know one point five million maybe two million people of already voted and\nYou know for for them they they made up their mind they're moving on it what it what it said how the debate goes consequential they know what candidates they're supporting\nSo the candidates tried to focus on important thing school safety climate change came up health care\nUm I thought Gillum made a pretty good point about it's tightening that our children have to go through you know active shooter drills\nYet regardless who was governor those types of things likely still happened to be tried to play on the fears of maybe the moderates who may are are in the middle and may use gun safety is their number one reason for voting for one of these candidates or was that an\nThink you bring up a good point there Greg I'm going for it and are working in school you know we did the duck and cover 'cause I grew up in Texas and we always were you know worried about the tornados coming through and we did bomb threats and you could have been back away to school we did fire drills I'm active shooter things obviously something that's come on really post Columbine but his accelerate it feels the last couple of years\nYou know I think that the line a lot of these and it's kind of walk is oh it is for school safety but how do you make that happen and they're either even those I'm On the right to or not a hundred percent comfortable\nWith arming staff and that was a real point of contention if you remember when the Marjory Stoneman Douglas bill was passed at the end of the legislative session was um you know there was some crazy nerves about whether or not we want to arm school staff and we want that happening\nAnd I think that's going to be the debate going forward is not just how that happened but how that gets implemented across the state what role does\nThe legislature have and how much of this should be pushed down the local level and say okay\nMaybe it works in ... county but in orange county it's just not going to fly so I think that's really where you'll see that kind of go and I don't know that either can't really flushed out those ideas last night but there there were definitely nibbling around that edge\nQuick question for you as we head into the second and final debate which is Wednesday in Broward County what needs to happen or for either candidate does does Rhonda Sanders have to go back to the drawing board or just keep you know a riding the coat tails as Andrew Gillum called him a donned Santa's as in downtown\nI mean you know I think when you look at a debate you can\nYou're not going to win an election on a debate you could possibly lose an election because of a debate if you have a really bad moment um you know off the top of my head I remember Rick Perry in the in the presidential debate when he couldn't remember the three agencies you want to cut you just looked at the cameras at groups and I think a lot of people are like okay that's the end of his candidacy um\nYou know going into the next debate I Would say for both candidates they're gonna probably you know they'd love to delight land that knockout punch but\nYou know saving that you go in you hopefully come out with the status\nQuo and if you're Andrew Gillum you say\nI'm happy with the status quo all the public polling has shown me ahead old old clothes but ahead um and if you're round as soon as you say you know what I Am still convinced that there is this large contingency out there that is just not being reflected the polling status quo was good for me I'll do well on election day and I'll be okay\nFour hours a day\nI folks Greg warmest end today with gene Wexler and our [noise]\nMajor producer here see the hanging out with us I Love I Love this team that they've put together at the video and I I'm

and I don't want to let down the loyal listeners so I've compiled some things that jumped off the page me this morning when I\nQuickly went through the news of the day\nUm we've talked about a couple of those were still yet going to talk about Colin Kaepernick Colin Kaepernick ah came to my attention I follow Christ Carter on Twitter I'm a sports guy from way back and I'm a sports fan and I'm a huge fan of Blake ... as a person I've known him literally since he was a little boy\nI Know the family they're from here they're good folks the stories that they tell me about the abuse that he takes in Jacksonville prior to this or losses that they've had\nUm granted he's well paid and and I know you know professional athletes but now this is where this comes into a news radio station um topic Chris Carter who played in the NFL and hall of famer this is just free advice these are his words this is just free advice for the Jacksonville Jaguars swallow your pride\nPick up the phone and call Colin Kaepernick you might be saying okay that name is familiar yet you know kneeling national anthem the whole NFL controversy\nAnd we have open Mike conversations that are happening if you'd like to chime in we'd love to hear you can use the open Mike inside the news Downey six point five W ... and here's a couple of more comments from listeners\nAny team anywhere taste calling ... Iowa I'm friend [noise] I didn't follow and on watch\nAds up promise heading pilot politics aside calling ... ended his career was a crappy quarterback and I believe he did all day to get the publicity I don't think it should be playing football for anybody\nAnd then I talked with a joke Kelly when we were discussing how to operate this beautiful new board and this new system in here and I ask him and he goes Jacksonville is also a different place\nYou know that is in a part of the state that is so heavily GOP and this won't go well that regardless of let's say this guy takes the jaguars to the super bowl it would not work\nBecause of the disdain and they'd be better off just keeping the status quo so interesting it's an interesting a quandary because the players\nOn the jaguars there was even a quote that played on our am um station\nThe top five eighty that talked about the players and the players thing could change needs to happen the coach even admitted today that they're going to change the quarterback it's an open competition beginning today a practice so are you open the Colin Kaepernick if it means taking the team to the Superbowl\nSo many people say that wins and losses cure everything but did they cure the national anthem controversy do they queue or taking a knee can you look past that\nWhat if he comes out and says I'm going to stand now for the national anthem I've made my point would that change how you feel about Colin Kaepernick or would it take you off so bad that you would be done with the jaguars done with the NFL et cetera also who won the debate last night does it matter\nAre you looking through rose colored glasses if you're a ... fan or a Gillum fan\nWhatever they say is right whatever the other person says is wrong dean notice someone appearing less comfortable on camera does that bother you is that part of being a good governor looking good on camera handling questions from Jake Tapper professionally that matter to you\nSome it might others don't really care they'll see the ... you know the Republican or Democrat or the independent and they'll vote\nAnother debate comes your way on Wednesday gene Wexler is also standing by with other big stories and Jean there is a lot going on the airport video to me is it is talk or ... or if you haven't seen it it is on the website uh-huh\nAnd to share it is unreal as well that this guy gets upset about a flight that he didn't catch give us the backstory on this and then how he reacted slash overreact\nYeah he's flying to Salt Lake City Utah and his flight was delayed um I\nDon't have the the full details on what happened with his flight getting delayed but we've all been there right Greg I'm any just happens to all of us when your flight gets delayed it a lot of the time there's not much that the folks at the airline can can do for you when it's delayed or the ... then he started freaking out on a Jet Blue employee cursing even\nThrowing some punches at the guy and uh the Jet Blue in places that this man was definitely drunk is eight year old son was nearby for the whole thing here is a five second clip [noise]\n... will run out one more time [noise]\nYeah great though the whole video that we have on our website is is is like two minutes long\nBut he he curses every other word so to actually play it on on the air and bleep every every Christ is kind of a daunting task ... an hour and is he physical at all or is this just verbal so so you get physically isn't land any punches but you get to see him swinging in the air\nAnd I saw one part about maybe he he shoved ... somebody there was a little bit of shoving didn't actually land any punches\nA although it looks like he he really went for a few in fact I'm looking at a picture of the whole thing now and I'm I'm Googling the word punch in this article ... I don't think he actually landed any punches Greg\nYou know these types of things I I I travel relatively frequently ... and ... don't make it any more difficult on others right you know we had the squirrel on the plane\nThe emotional support squirrel had to\nTurn that plant around the inconvenience the heck out of so many people got this idiot or at the airport there's no excuse for there's no excuse for it I mean I don't care if you missed a flight I don't care what was the reason I'm there is no excuse for that and that\nWhere are we in society are people's thing it's okay just to go off drunk or not in the airport to a Jet Blue person that that is so upsetting but\nI think this listener shares your your sentiment\nGray one my lives the way it I go by another coffee and read a chapter of my vote\nDifferent strokes for different phones [laughter]\nYeah I mean I Love that I mean when I first of all when you travel when you're going through an airport you got to kind of figure ... there may be the lay of weather delay a technical problem with the plane electrical or physical with the plane or maybe the crew had has been overworked and they have to have a ...\nIt can bring a new crew in because whatever I never\nGo to the airport thinking this is going to be I'm going to leave at this time and I'm an arrive at that time there's going to be no problems right always in the front of my mind is they're going to be a problem\nAlways even by waiting for your luggage is it going to make it and it's just that ... you go in you're not disappoint yeah yeah and all of the airports especially our airport if you do miss your flight for one year in Orlando so it's pretty good place to be stuck we got plenty of things to do eat drink\nAnd hang out um but I don't know I I just think that if you go to the airport thinking that they use something dealing they owe us safety\nIf if we land safely they've accomplished what I have purchased with my ticket in my destination it reminds me of just last week I flew over the damage in sky witness nine of the hurricane\nAnd I remember asking one of our pilots of channel nine I said this is kind of a dangerous job you have flying helicopter and he said what I Do every day to keep myself on it is I look at that machinery pointed towards a helicopter and I said to me myself that machine wants to kill me and my job is to make sure it doesn't\nBack with more of your calls in today's news at noon here on the radio\n[noise] this is six point five maybe be amended\nBefore with clean that he thought it was always my parents' dream for me to go to ... day one of my biggest regret is that I never finished I'm sure they would have treated any of my walks down the red carpet to the walking a cat and again\nMy mom always told me education is the key on knocking your dream to kind of believe stray or has it in ...
