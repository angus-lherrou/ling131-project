minutes to talk about it's brand new book and the hurricanes either genius of George Washington and the victory at Yorktown\nHead or the Daniel I Want to talk about the big war and history they were both witnessing but I Do want to do in conclusion even though the battle Yorktown happens we keep fighting\nAnd you said a ... who was the hero in Yorktown gets humiliated at the end you and you use the French resort the French libraries in order to get more a more information is yeah I\nMean it's it's really the unknown story we think of the grass is a great hero but in France but he's anything but because just a few months later in the Caribbean\nHe suffers a absolutely devastating and humiliating defeat to the British or admiral Ronny like that's what's known as the battle of the saints when Washington or got word of this he thought oh my God you know the victory we had at Yorktown there's ... nothing now because the British are going to come roaring back\nThey didn't because a popular sentiment back in England had had was had swayed against the war but it just shows you you know Washington never had a sense of I've done it because it was always in the balance\nRight you never had that great moment so uh that I knew a couple of things you care about American history how do you view with this whole nearly during the national anthem how do you think our founding fathers would view it\nYou know I think it's dangerous to say what would they do today a you know I I think you know a a a sense of reverence for the country was absolutely important back then\nYou know and things times change you know I I I'm you know I I I'm sympathetic to all sides in this I really think the important thing is people express patriotism in their own way and you know ... it's it's and so I'm I'm sort of one of those people whatever you do as long as you have America's Best interest\nIt's okay by me right or did you think kids you stand for the national anthem\nExcuse me do you think kids should stand for a while she's me the pledge of allegiance\nI yeah I mean I did at school or you know but I remember also being in the mix the Vietnam War and being very very you know not sure what was going on and you know I think it's an individual act I mean that's the thing we are uh you know individual freedom is essential to who we are\nAnd I think the important thing in America and what's unique about us is that we do allow people to express them so I had an individual\nThere's got to be some things that collectively we agree on Italy and\nThat's you know that's what was Washington's great theme after the revolution and once he became president it's the union that's what ... that's the only thing we can look at and um and I absolutely agree we have to have things we agree upon in terms of you know why do people come to this country because there's a lot right in this country\nAnd I think if you start taking it apart to the point that you know where we end up being a group of\nUh you know angry or sex screaming at each other is destroying America\nIt's a lack of appreciation too of what we haven't had much better it is even worse day we're still a destination right\nAnd you know we're never going to be perfect but that's the genius of America um we we we mess up but then eventually always too late we begin to figure it out and I think they are very few societies that have done that consistently over the sad time\nHow do you feel about this a war in our history and William and Mary they're talking about moving Jefferson statue where he went to college at Robert de leave statue on the in Charlottesville at the University of Virginia oh where do you stand\nWhere you know I I I I stand once again I think it's up to the institution where these are I mean I think it's a tragedy that we lose touch with what this country was about even if we don't agree with what this country was about because I think ... things like statues\nAre one of the more forceful ways of saying you know this is the way it was and as soon as we ... wallpaper the past with a picture of what we want today we forget we where we came so where are you\nIt worries me yeah do you ever see that slaves which clearly we can't even get rapper head around and he even wrestled with his wife should Washington and Jefferson and Monroe everyone really except John Adams early on should they be marginalized in history\nNo I don't think so because I mean you this is what we got to get to where America came from and ... this was a slave states and in many ways and we got to understand how we got from there to where we are now\nAnd to just turn their back on the past and and uh lose all touch with it is just to lose the ability to learn from the\nPast what about Confederate statues should they be more true they be taken out\nOnce again I think it's an individual it's it's up to a community to figure it out I think they they should not be burned or destroyed\nI think you're a guy that they were put on a commission to come up with a policy like they're doing it in New York City\nYeah listen it's a tough one and I think the great fear of of mind is that emotions in a moment we'll do something that\nWill jeopardize uh an entire future of historical memory you're keeping America's history alive in your brand new book in the hurricanes either
