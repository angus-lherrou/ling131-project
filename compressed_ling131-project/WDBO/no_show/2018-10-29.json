mean we whether it's on the economy whether it's on the environment whether it is a moving forward with helping our veterans heck even one of the issue and whether we want to continue doing that or we want to take a hard left turn out one of the issues that critical in Florida school choice\nA I'm a product of magnet schools and charter schools uh Florida under Rick Scott contribute over a billion annually to vouchers into helping school choice and it's something that that Gillum opposes so there are so many issues that affect everyday lives and you know it's which America do you want do you want Nancy Pelosi's America I I fought\nIn many veterans fought in the Cold War to the communism and socialism and now we have from the inside people wanting to take us that direction\nOr they're promising but look at OK CEO Cortez I mean there are promising free a free housing free medical care free college tuition free a student loan debt relief and and it only takes a few minutes with a voter to make them realize and remind them\nNothing for free that's going to get passed on to you and taxes\nAnd pumping more money through a government agency ended a bureaucratic state is not the answer for anybody who pushes for government run health care look at the VA it's actually doubled its budget and the last ten years twelve hundred hospitals and clinics being run by the government three hundred thousand employees and yet veterans still aren't getting the care\nThat they need President Trump comes in and says you know what if you've got to wait too long if you have to drive too far to get to a VA clinic you could take a car and go to your local provider get it done but yeah right I mean it's just commonsense practical legislation and that's what people want\nRight in for you personally you as a veteran green brave but also in a business so when you said you've already noticed in the break that nobody talks about the deregulation of said well what do you mean practically for your business you have a government contracts they took forever to get these contracts\nWe by the time you put all of the stuff that the government mandates in their these bids I mean just to do business with your local government or your federal government or five six seven hundred pages\nBy the time you pay lawyers accounting I mean it just blows up these small businesses overhead and that's money that they could be putting into their employees are investing in products and and growing our economy\nHow many years in the military twenty two so that service right that's right and they and they were an active in the reserves and active ... then you decided to start a local business sense right right yeah so you went to federal contracts have allowed to sit with their business right\nNow at ... absolutely we get we essentially go after bad guy money all over the world so when you hear about the Treasury Department putting sanctions in place or you hear about ISIS you know these terrorist groups in particular preach like they're ... they run themselves like the mob there and human trafficking oil and gas counterfeiting cigarettes you name it\nWe track the money down and shut it down so\nYou do that and they said I haven't done enough service after twenty two years I Want to go back yeah this out for the money\nNo ... this service for you this is true by and you know we can I tell people all the time yelling at the television posting things on Facebook\nThat don't count a ... step up and serve and whether it's running for office supporting someone's running for office working with your local community church to help others disaster relief\nWe need to get America back serving again the motto in my campaign as sort of leadership and that's coming as a Christian as well that's\n... that's truly how we should start humbly but with strengths\nAnd ah and that's what I'm all about this is about this is about serving this great country I think in many ways we face as many internal threats now as we face external threats and we need not only veterans combat veterans and eat those that we bring\nBut gosh we have trillions of dollars now or in our national budget and we have people that can't read a balance sheet\nOf managing that money the more business people the more veterans we get the better\nOff right and you have a lot of business people there uh Michael Wolff who's running against this Nancy Soderberg to be the next Congress for a person from the sixth district in Florida they run to save that says that the the Michael Waltz wants it

did talk about Florida governor's race he he called Andrew Gillum or a thief\nOr who is a mayor of a poorly run city among others the president seems to be taking the gloves off this morning\nHuh [noise] [noise] yeah that I Know that no slowing down and he talked about the caravan of immigrants coming to the United states saying please go back you will not be admitted ... uh this is an
