I Know you've been working really hard and it absolutely shows and I think that you're going to have a lot of fun at Jazz Fest and there is no doubt you guys are going to rocket\nWill last year in two thousand Seventeen the lawbreakers were opening bands for the two uh downtown concerts there is a we open up for George thorough good\nAnd we open up for Rick Springfield so we've had an opportunity to be on the big stage with professional found people\nAnd it's just absolutely a thrill to be up there on stage and after you get over a little bit of stage fright a little bit then it just all comes together and it is a whole lot of fun it's a dream I've had since I was Fifteen to be a rock stars the best closes I'm ever going to come but it's close enough to get that feeling\nYou're there this

listen to the lawbreakers that's November third head buddy thanks so much Roy great calls and questions I Do so much appreciate if I may have suggested for you for our doors and take pleasure in the beauty of nature and as always enjoy your friends or family\nMy name is Tom Olson the name of the show is also a law you're listening to news Ninety six five [noise]\nThis is news Ninety six point five or ... or ... and do it turns first for breaking news\nTo talk of news not just going by double duty be sunny dry or feel good forecasts just three minutes without top story to paint left by devastating hurricane Michael felt by deals we lost her husband the tree fell on their house in hard hit Mexico beach\nI told him hold on just hold on I'm calling for help now\nMaybe they don't have enough cash to close\nSo if you don't feel like you have enough cash to close you know that they're special programs available out there for you so we help get you going in the right direction we'll analyze your credit we review your income\nAnd we will help you if you need it with some downpayment assistance programs you know orange county's got a down payment assistance program seminal county's got a down payment assistance city of Orlando has got down payment assistance\nOsceola county ... county whatever county you're in right now I'm pretty confident that they have a down payment assistance program the only one that I've found that more challenging is Lake County but\nYou know at cross country mortgage we've got a special program available for people that don't fit into the box and can still assist them with that\nSo if you can't fit into the USDA qualifying box which you know we talk about that from time to time on the program it's a hundred percent program for Gerald that uh want to buy a home in their first time homebuyers\nAnd they don't really have any money well USDA and that is the people that use to stamp your steak with that purple stamp\nRight they will ensure alone for no money down now you've got to have pretty decent credit to get that program and your debt ratio cannot be too high what if you don't qualify for that program maybe your debt ratio is just a little out of the range well we've got other programs assist you\nThat could potentially assist you even with the down payment and get you in for his little is no down payment that doesn't always mean no closing costs but that's why we have Cleveland in his team and a group of talented real estate agents out there that I work with that will assist in negotiating closing costs\nFor you I had an incident a ship's I should say an opportunity this week where a client had been to Fort builders and looked at four different properties and could not get into the house who's a veteran who wanted to get in for no money out of pocket\nWell we found them a house and negotiated the closing costs and the sellers rejected the closing costs concession I got on the phone with the lifting agent\nWhich is generally uncommon but I got on the phone with the lifting agent and I explained to them that this client was well qualified\nThey're only challenge was cash out of pocket we negotiated seven thousand dollars on a retail property\nFor the cellar to pay closing costs that had originally refused to pay closing costs so sometimes it just takes a little bit of understanding from all aspects of the transaction and maybe that's just giving the seller or the sellers real estate agent\nUh warm and fuzzy feeling that it's kind of go OK provided we can come to a meeting of the mines on what this client needs and therefore will satisfy the sellers well well I see my great friend Cleveland is here joining us today I feel like\nCaptain Kirk here on the starship enterprise or this ... this new broadcasts so we are for all of our\nAh listening audience we are in a brand new studio or this is the Mack daddy studio as hot Kyl's actually\nGot his own room over there I feel like I'm not as high or just got to look at them in a different room it's amazing literally staring at twenty seven monitors that's right I I thought this is this is awesome but anyway thank you for turning into the lovely\nAnd report I Am cleave love landowners lovely and properties my family's been sell real estate in central Florida for about forty years now and um you know like I said look up and down your street chances are one of those rooftops we've helped sell it buy it or manage it um but Bruce you say you made a very good point there about getting on the phone with a seller do you know many offers I get from realtors coming into me on my listings\nAnd the agents don't even call me know and say hey can I get a background when are you going to talk to the seller what's the activity like\nA you know what's the you know what's your cellar want how how many ... are they are they okay on closing data that OK leaving the washer dryer\nGet none of those phone calls hardly\nEver do I want if you're not getting them from the agent how often would you possibly get them from the lender while you're on TALK you're the only lender I Know that does that in town but it's it's amazing because you know what is the seller really want when they accepting an offer they want something that's going to be relatively easy\nAnd predictable so they want to make sure that they're transaction that they may be going into isn't going to fall apart because as you know our businesses all domino effect so one transaction falls apart they can all fall apart and it may not have anything to do with you the buyer or the seller\nSo when all parties come together and have a meeting of the mind\nAnd habits or a clear game plan for getting that client into the closing smoothly and on time it makes people feel better and they're willing to negotiate so having that\nA conversation I think is vital to assisting my clients and the way I look at it cleave\nIf a real estate agent has a client that's made several offers on several properties and keeps getting shut down the clients starts to think that there might be something wrong with the real estate agent or something wrong\nWith a with the lender yeah and if they ditch the real estate agent it could potentially ditch the lender well I don't want anybody to leave me thinking that I might have been part of the problem rather than part of the solution is so jumping in there and helping that client a\nProcure that property is vital to me and I want to do whatever I can to help you so if you're a real estate agent out there and you're struggling on multiple offers situations\nYou know we've got a guaranteed Twenty one day close if I don't close your transaction in Twenty one days when your client uses my fast track program I Will reimburse your by her three hundred and Seventy five dollars for the appraisal\nAnd I will pay your cellar up to one hundred dollars a day for five days and I miss that closing cleave how many times you think I've had to pay it out a once maybe one time he told his four years ago and it will not happen again\nYeah I mean you've got a great team but I just want to talk about one thing I'm getting a lot of emails Bruce this time of year and it's like oh my gosh I wait till January list because our home sales down\nAnd the one thing I think that buyers know as you know the rates taking up by or should get in the house is going to cost them a little more next year probably as far as even the price and the rate but this time of year you know people say ask does it slow down and say well during the summer we sell a hundred and thirty to a hundred and forty homes a day in central Florida\nDuring the winter or the fall it's a hundred homes today so not much I mean it's a slow down a little bit but in this this is the other thing\nA lot of homes are on the market and we've got eight thousand homes on the market which is a tight market that is still a seller's market half those aren't in the market their price way out of where that is why they're not even getting any looks and it's funny you know I hired a gentleman this year that's all he does this call people trying to sell by owner\nAnd homes that didn't sell cars believe it or not every month there's about almost a thousand homes\nWhere people just give up their throw their hands up and go I got no activity in what's going on it's been three to six months for them and it's funny because you know spring ... you know February January February march or big listing months he's been slammed this last month talking to people in slamming my schedule I'm going I mean a lot of people and literally there's not\nThere's so many little fixes on doing to get them sold and get them under contract um you know just access a staging a little bit of prep work um\nI talked to some people and and they didn't even know what was going on a last listening they had there on the market for Ninety Days and hadn't heard from there listening agents and this is the type of service that you're not going to get your home so that way and then also not being served also mentioned for sale\nBy owners because you know statistically eighty percent of sale by owners will end up selling with real estate agent\nThey will yeah eighty percent and also if they do manage to get a contract themselves it's usually Ninety percent of market value well in mind\nOr they fall apart and the financing because that that that the client that's looking at that doesn't really have clear representation they did an online application they think they're approved so the seller prepares their home to sell and then finds out that the eleventh hour that the client really didn't qualify to begin with\nHow are we doing I Know with all this or that has made him on the stock market this week how does that affect race\n... can tell you something you can see that there is some ah some uncertainty in the market right now and so you know after the fed raise the fed rates on the twenty six\nUh it did jumped up rates as we protected in you and I talk about best every single week we're we're telling everybody what's going on\nSo we did see an uptick after that now actually this stock market crashing this week and I call it ... it's not a ... it's an adjustment it's all it is I hear that it's not a crash it's an adjustment and these things are necessary to keep things in check\nBut the reason for that is that the market is uncertain about interest rates which could potentially slowed down some housing if possible so they made an adjustment however you know that I saw a slight\nImprovement in interest rates from the stock market does poorly when the stock market does now a ... generally speaking for those that understand the market\nWhen stocks are doing well bonds are doing poorly and conversely when stocks are doing poorly bonds are doing better we want when bonds are doing well it improves the yield and we get improved interest rates but sometimes that does not work in concert\nSo we can talk a little bit about that after the next break if you like yeah I Want to talk about that and I want to talk about how important it is now work on things that can be\nLove to talk to you about it and sometimes I talked to people six months before they're ready to sell so where's the number for you

I think so I don't know but as I say I was on the verge because they are aging\nStarting in about eight years they're saying that all the baby boomers when they start moving into assisted living and dying off they're going to create a tidal wave of homes for sale\nAnd turn it into a buyer's market and this is the thing that\nRemember Nineteen Ninety nine when when why two K. was going to do most all oh yeah this is the kind of study that I don't like just based on you know people manipulating statistics and what are they say about specifically a statistic ... percent of them are made up yeah yeah yeah there are all made up\nBut you know think this is why it's important when in in your market it's totally different this is an article talking about how\nWe might shift to a buyer's market in eight or nine years\nUm because of a different aging population but who's to say there's not some other economic we're going to shift to a buyer's market anyway eventually yeah I mean come on and it never stays in one market on that market shrinks and that's why you tuning into this report\nYou know what I Do is I go talk to sellers about their market I talked to them about their general market which is within a mile of them are within their subdivision or within two miles of them maybe if they are a big lake front home it's within seven or eight miles of them and that's what I'm doing is interpreting that market for them but you know like right now we've got ... just under eight thousand homes for sale and central Florida", "show_name": "no_show", "year": "2018", "city": "Orlando", "day": "13"}
