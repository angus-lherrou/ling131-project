Washington to scare off the black widows so did he actually kill them or are they still now so we have some black widows safari ones I don't think that's right but they are the poisonous ones the brown one right around what is your body you this is a survival thing\nBecause you do have to I mean it's not a matter of catch him in a cup like daddy long legs not scary no nice but you don't kill them you don't burn them alive but the furry ones remember the one on the Brady Bunch they claimed a was at a school the manager Angela was that a treasure which they are free right\nWell that's scary I mean then you I Would have thank goodness Peter and a blow torch when it was on Greg\nVery true but I Will say that even if it's better than poisonous have you ever gotten bit by a spider their brutal my mom got that this summer she was sick for two weeks ... who is this how big was this but we don't we didn't see it but that was just what we figure it out it was when she had this ... and then she proceeded sort of getting infected and get really sick from it\nSo even if they're not like deadly poison is like the black widow they can cause some damage that around\nThe spider I don't know it was a bad couldn't be maybe we should have had a blow torch handy\nRight ... you always keep all by travel with one now [laughter] you get past the TSA Murphy bucks right yeah do you think the

friday will be in St Louis St Louis county library to go down and everyone who gets the ticket or we'll get Andrew Jackson America New Orleans\nAnd it'll be personalizing for you and then Saturday we're going to be in Baton Rouge in the afternoon and then Sunday in New Orleans Sunday it'll be New Orleans and also be their son convent right\nThere is one of the private and on Saturday Night and I knew I could go to that and there's I Believe they're getting tickets to the school that I'm not sure we got the tickets however on Sunday during the day at the Jaycee was Octavia bucks run gradually joining you and you'll have an awesome conversation on the ...\n... is premier historian former a decorated marine who knows more about the battle of New Orleans and they actually knows more about almost everything then everybody I Know but he wouldn't Douglas Brinkley says Brian talked around dressed before you start this book Douglas Brinkley knows everything and he's pointing me to him\nA birth so that'll be a great conversation birth or who's listening in Orlando news and he's six five papers to\nGreat what's on your mind\nOr watch fan at all they said they anybody talking about\nWhat we're trying but that's when that ice is doing and now I just getting a lot of blowback in these democratic ... states because they're doing their job\n\nAnd that's part of the problem with the illegals here they come in they get their visa illegally and they don't report back because a lot\nOf countries that we're talking about\n[noise] uh you know a lot are a lot of that is talking about\nClosing birther we've got to attack this thing after the midterms we have to attack it I'm so tired of people playing politics with border security and now to hear you been hearing the last few days we found all these Democrats talking like Republicans five or six years ago\nAnd they just flip the issue because they feel as though in many cases they'll be able to get Hispanic votes if they're the ones who legalize them rather than have caught on tape saying we have to put a border barrier incentive Schumer's case and Hillary Clinton's case a border barrier to keep them out\nThey've totally flip the script on it and it just hurts us\n[noise]\nExperts to birth wants to pick up either oh these illegals that's part of the problem part of the problem right now is the illegals that are here when I go to this group I'm up now they're getting blowback and places like Seattle and places like Illinois places like Minnesota in many cases so I think that's pretty terrible or the president spoke last night about the care of and\nHe is obsessed evidently they had a meeting late last night uh not late last night but you're late last a afternoon just about different tactics they could take to stop this caravan before it gets here out for error who's you know judge Alex on television he worked for the for the ... circuit court judge and obviously Hispanic descent\nHe says is that we really not sure really not sure what we can do at the border cut forty five\nThe problem is what leads to beyond that because if if let's say a wave of seven thousand or four thousand immigrants make it to the U.S border and Russia across there is no I I don't see how they're stopped there but what it does is it leaves the impression to other countries other people that that's the way to get into the U.S\nAnd that's the problem it's the message sent that's was another crack carbon building behind and you know the White House has said that we believe it's Venezuela paying in Nicaragua needs to go out and go marching create havoc on the border some say to embarrass the ah American friendly Honduras government regardless\nOf Venezuela who has no money is using money to pay people to leave their border countries and come to America can you imagine that more from Alex for forty six\nI actually think that if these immigrants were able to make it to the U.S by election day it was that would actually benefit Trump because I think that the videos of people just rushing across the border and overwhelming the border patrol\nI Can't imagine anything that would be a better argument for the wall that he wants so badly and I think there'll be a lot of trans don't you are saying on immigration if that were to happen\nAnd that's why Democrats are laying out they're not saying the president's being mean because they know the American people are concerned about border security and they're not anti Hispanic [noise]\nKeep in mind if we're talking Wednesday after election day about the house\nAt the house being Republicans hands still it's got to be because the panic vote the Democrats are under the impression when this president went down those dead escalator that they've forever would and got the nomination added what many people thought were a negative Hispanic stance always talking about his building the wall for security but they interpreted that way\nThat he would have these panic vote for the for the future he got more Hispanic votes then Romney got and McCain got and I don't see going that way they say a lot of Hispanics that are here legally and there are so many diversions rub it right now central and south Americans like Trump\nAnd like the tone and are proud of the fact that they got here they're legal they paid the money\nThey learn the language they pass the test and they belong here there's one report and wanting to bring to light and I went to prison to get this message the New York times is reporting that China and Russia are listening to the president's calls 'cause he insist on using his normal phone Mr President\nLet's go in debt because we want you to understand the stories we're talking about ... Washington bureau report on ... door you do have some breaking news here the\nCannon office building which is right next to the\nCapitol house offices are evacuated this hour what can you tell us\nYeah we just sent me to free over there and he tells us there's yellow tape independence avenue outside of Kennan is closed as well but he says there's no panic\nAnd no sirens going so at this point we're still working on reporting what exactly is going on that led to that evacuation but of course heightened awareness and and panic really uh because of the now ten\nOr eleven uh bombs being sent through the mail one or two at this point sent to house lawmakers or have their names on on the envelope in some ways so we are digging into seeing if it's connected but at this point uh we do not know that and don't know why can't and ...\nAnd again during reporting that can an office building evacuated in Washington the can of the oldest house office building right there up by the capital\nSo two ... two more package is maybe maybe three um addressed a former vice president Joe Biden actor Robert Deniro discovered today um and it sort of a blame game up there in Washington of course the president saying that the news media is a very big part of the anger in America\nOr the Democrats saying that the president is to blame so everybody's yelling at one another up their inside the\nBeltway huh Mm what's now right and uh\nBut we're seeing two different stories yesterday the president was a very measured in his response as as this uh developed throughout the day thing that Americans needed to come together and co peace and harmony and and we needed to reject political violence that it that was a ... an attack on our democracy\nToday though he's changing his tuna that are going after the media blaming them for the anger in society lawmakers that I've talked to a praised the president for the tone that he took yesterday thing that that is needed right now to heal to bring the heat down on political rhetoric\nAs all of the targets of these uh suspicious mail bonds has been you know political in nature killed right now he is he's doubling down that he's putting all federal resources needed into finding a who is responsible for for these at mailbox\nAnd yeah and again the can an office building evacuated their right by the uh\nThe Capitol building cannon is the

line one lane is open traffic should start to move\nA little bit better that it's been a problem all day long Torrance forget you caught up on that in just a little bit six eleven at new Ninety six point five WBFO little bit earlier this afternoon the NYPD an FBI\nHeld a news conference updating us on the ten packages that have been delivered bus far Aaron ... in New York was there an hour and what's the big takeaway from this\nTony the latest it is that no additional devices have been found in the last\nLittle while however uh that\nIs a subject to change because the FBI has raised the possibility that more devices have been or we'll be mailed that's the thing about when the devices go through the mail they don't know how many more light beer could be in the pipeline\nThe devices all ten of them are now believed to have gone at one point through the U.S postal system and that's a fear of law enforcement Tony because it's a vast network difficult to police\nAnd pipe bombs have now gone through undetected\nDid they say anything about the fact that none of the bombs have gone off I mean we now thank God thank God I asked a Brad Garrett this question yesterday fact that none of these have gone off makes us think that the person or persons sending them are just trying to send a threat or a message that that's\nThe thing they don't know because either so the case they built these things and did not attend them a intend them to go off or\nThey just built them poorly and maybe there was a design flaw or or a piece of the the bomb that was not properly constructed\nThe working belief after a preliminary assessment of these devices Tony is that they were\nMeant to go off because they contained glass shards that would've been shrapnel had the bombs going off a perhaps as intended it seems like steps or someone would take the or or or those things those components don't seem like steps\nSomeone just looking to send a message would take these were not hoax devices\nAnd and the intended to the center of courses is unknown\nRight so hopefully they're not as sophisticated as they could be and now and we're learning that they are focusing more on the Florida mail even though they didn't come from that in the news conference earlier\nBut clearly behind the scenes they've been working on analyzing the devices\nAnd that is going to be I think the the way that they ultimately are able to track down whoever's responsible [noise] the the ... in a cruel irony the more devices that that are out there the better the chances of getting a piece of forensic evidence right so they can exploit the devices for fingerprints or DNA\nTrying and trace the origin they they've been found now and and and the number of states there's a Florida connection
