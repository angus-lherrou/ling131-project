went to the Senate Judiciary committee hearing he was seated behind him the camera was sort of on his face throughout the whole thing\nUm hundreds of employees have spoken out against that so much so that Mark Zuckerberg has had to address this he said that he wouldn't have\nDone the same thing that kept one dead meaning he wouldn't have gone to the hearing but he says that he you know allows people do whatever they want to do in the free time it every time he he didn't break any rules but the big thing here is that Facebook executives are going to have a meeting about this today are believed to discuss caplin support for his\nFriend who's credible and they were trying to tell everybody would not conservative or liberal we don't try to act out because their reviews and search

Bob the child wandering Amos Lee alone around the terminal or Tim terminal instruct cures to guard the airport wait Monday the girl was taken to the airport police station shortly after the mom called in to ask whether the daughter had been\nFound police or the mom explains officers of the family are driven driven home and shepherd corps in each believe the girl was with the other parent while you

stranger was just searching for my parents were you I was about to wow Juliet I was totally fine I just went with a stranger my parents that they were holding the I looked completely okay\nAre you

depth because we want you to understand the stories we're talking about like Washington bureau reporter Justin grey and Justin I'm though those ... ... the latest book kind of sets the stage for a final vote in the chamber at some point in time tomorrow evening we think we we just kinda interesting open Mike\nOr listen to this open Mike here from one of our listeners\nSo we had a vote ... bay judge Kavanaugh although we've been debating him for two weeks [laughter]\nI I think a lot of people just sort of wondering what the world is going on out there why don't we I was doing it yeah right this\nIs an odd place that they have to vote to vote to vote and vote to debate the debate there's ah but yeah basically this is a vote to allow the next vote and that really comes down to it as a no vote here means you're likely to vote no\nA yes vote though doesn't necessarily mean you're a hundred percent going to vote yeah\nYeah so we were what fifty one forty nine there\nRight we started yesterday with five undecided three GOP to Democrats were down to two Senator Jeff flake just said he will be a yes unless something dramatic happens in the next thirty hours or Lisa Murkowski just saying her no means she's going to be voting no she's got to vote no in the ... and so it all comes down to two people\nSusan Collins a Republican and Joe Manchin a Democrat we're going to hear from Susan Collins on the Senate for three PM and that'll probably tell the story because you need both of those votes Democrats do if they're going to block this nomination\nYou mentioned a Democrat is in a very precarious spot because he's got a lot of folks there and in West Virginia I'm sure telling him Justin to vote for judge Kavanaugh even though he's a Democrat\nOr mentioned is a smart politician I used to work and live in West Virginia I Will tell you he's probably going to play the politics with this right there he's not going to go out on a limb here if Susan Collins\nIs voting yes you probably gonna see mentioned vote yes make things much easier for him back home she votes no and that's when you could possibly imagine go with her as well right out\nAnd really depends we're going to find out a lot here at three o'clock when Susan Collins takes the floor that could be it\nOkay well we look forward to that ... taking the floor it's three than a final vote for the Senate or what are we expecting to more around five six o'clock\nYeah it sounds like it that final vote will be three you know we've got an interesting situation where a senator Danes his ... his daughter is getting married tomorrow's and there's a little bit play with that trying to get him in to get the vote walk daughter down the aisle do the dance so\nThey again in the Senate is a weird place while they could start a vote at one time that could stretch out for hours while they wait for him to fly into town to cast his vote\nLet's see what my daughter down the aisle or vote in the Senate for a Supreme Court nominee ... I Wonder which one I'm a cake there we were we show the answer is vote your way to do both right exactly exactly alright thank you just didn't really do appreciate\nIt should be a very interesting oh twenty forty thirty six hours there in DC again descended voting to end debate on judge Kavanaugh Supreme Court nomination\nAnd now we expect a final vote in the Senate to come sometime early tomorrow

now\nThe boat this morning was closed fifty one forty nine one of the key boats moving Kavanaugh's nomination for was from Senator Joe Manchin a Democrat from West Virginia team coverage starts with ABC's Jonathan Karl on him\nWhat mentioned does first of all if if you voted no ah this still would have passed and just they would've needed the tie breaking vote by the vice president but what it does is it makes this not quite a total partisan vote you have a single Democrat voted to move forward on Brett Kavanaugh\nAnd here's the latest from our Washington watchdog Jamie ... when the final cabinet vote may come\nWe still don't know the exact time for a final vote but if all the thirty hours of extra debate has used it would be around five pm on Saturday\nAt this point it still isn't clear if Republicans will have enough votes or if they will need the tie breaking vote of the vice president that this morning's vote was a big victory for the White House and the big step to the
