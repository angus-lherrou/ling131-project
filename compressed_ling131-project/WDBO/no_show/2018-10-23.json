was speeding along and it's three times hunk of steel\nBreaking right well why not just ask them to stop or better yet the Olympia to text for them it might be a little awkward but believe me laugh\nTeam traffic every six minutes on your drive home it up to the minute traffic maps and the news Weinstein that this is Orlando evening news with Tony ... to a news any point five WB via it's inconceivable\nThat there are not um [noise]\nPeople of Middle Eastern descent in a crowd of more than seven thousand people advancing toward our border\n... is vice president Mike Pence speaking to the Washington Post today essentially doubling down on what President Trump has been saying let's welcome in Alex Stone from uh California how like it's\nAlways great to speak with you the my grand ... migrants caravan is growing in numbers regardless of who may be in it and I'm hearing pundits on both sides of the aisle now saying you know the whole world is watching to see what America is going to do\nYeah and the timing on this with the midterms coming up in two weeks from today that they both sides are using this eh it trying to use it to their benefit our latest polling showing about three days ago when the numbers came out that overall\nDemocrats Republicans independents Seventy percent of likely voters say immigration is a major topic in this election so Republicans and Democrats trying to grab onto it or the the caravan right now about seven thousand strong\nThere over eleven hundred miles away from the closest part of the border which should be on the other side of make Allen, Texas and these caravans are not new they've been going on for a long time they are getting a lot of attention now but most go that route because it's the the shortest distance\nIf they decide to do what they did several months ago and we met them in Tijuana\nThat that would be almost double the distance so nobody seems to know even a caravan where they're going and what border crossing they're going to try to get to a but they're the closest one would be make Allen, Texas\nOh President Trump you know blaming it on the three Central American countries that we give a lot of money too and also saying you know this is something that Mexico needs to take care of this could potentially play into the United states Mexico relationship\nI mean what what can they do there and Mexico and if the caravan gets to the border I mean what what what is going to happen\nTo the president is threatening today to cut off by any sort of age eight and to offer up sanctions potentially on those Central American countries uh but eh yeah there was a lot of talk before the last\nCaravan of putting military on the border and\nBeefing up the border patrol there\nFor the most part except for a couple of folks who tried to go off on their own as somebody who was there when that caravan arrived\nMost just sat there were families waiting on the Mexico side of the border and tell they could be brought in for processing for their asylum claims that it was in this angry crowd that was racing toward the border\nAnd this is very much the same kind of thing that I it is a lot of families making their their way toward wherever they end up on the border and uh and and no indication that they're going to be violent when they get to the border Mexico and sent federal police to to meet them to try to block them\nBut beyond that nothing is really worked in and police had met with so many families and the crowd that there's not a whole lot they can do there is no indication at this point we've got a lot of teams are marching do try to not as a merger with him but try to get information on those who are marching\nNo indication that there are despite the claims from the White House which today the president did say there was no proof of but that that he suspects there might be a any middle Easterners any terrorist group\nOr one of our team members speaks Arabic he has heard no Arabic and liberal so there is it on both sides this is being used politically\nBut how far it's got to go how many of the seven thousand will still be with a group when they get to the border nobody knows that earlier caravan was several thousand big then they got to the border and it was about a hundred and fifty people from those who at field off\nSo we don't know what this will look like in several weeks when they get to the border area\nYeah and as you mentioned Alex immigration was all ready a hot topic for the mid term elections and this really coming along at an opportune time or in opportune time and a lot of people do think realistically speaking like the president and vice president or saying if\nThere was someone trying to get into the country this would present an opportunity for them\nAnd uh as always that could be a few ah bad apples spoil it for everybody six fourteen at news about these things going on WBAL Alix dome for us tonight in uh Los

really tractor trailers because you've got a little what kind of like a Dali in the back end of it there so long they have to shut down the road because they're going to be creeping along either for
