and to get a hand it and they want to stay on a counter with us and keep it within a week um but as we have seen in this there's a lot of twists and turns so anything can happen when Shapiro's also with us tonight to react to all this great\nSo David Barstow is the one who put this or to go to get this monster article about the that the Trump family fortune to start with Fred Trump I Want you to hear what he said on CNN Today cut thirty\nHow do they avoid over five hundred million dollars in taxes I answer is two parts\nSome but it was through legitimate tax avoidance strategies for we also uncover worth the series of tax evasion strategy and one very simple component of that was the portrayed on tax returns\nTwenty million dollar apartment buildings than they were really only one million dollar apartment buildings\nOn tactics that the Trump families and we we know the president was involved in and setting up that strategy of the country was radically low ball and the value of real estate as a transfer from mom and dad to the kids\nHow do you know that that first off a hundred thousand they say documents from Fred Trump's days on this earth died in Nineteen Ninety eight tens of thousands of confidential record interviews with former employers pulleys of Fred Trump\nA and they claimed that he was always ... for the money to get just three years old that Donald Trump about three years old was earning two hundred thousand dollars a year he put them on the salary you know these companies [noise] ah and basically ditch all set up they do not know what Donald Trump actually did because they don't have his tax returns [noise] well\nYou know I think a lot of wealthy people look for ways to be as creative as they can within the law and asked the question I mean when you read down several paragraphs into this and says that there's\nIs there is no criminal charges the IRS never tried to uh proceed with any criminal charges with regard to that statute of limitations has kicked in on a number of the issues but there are there at the potential civil claims\nI mean you know this may go somewhere it may not it's no surprise that people are as creative as they possibly can be within the law to figure out ways to pay\nLower taxes um it's possible that some of those real estate investments that they were going on a mark to market accounting basis um of what they could have sold for at that time and maybe you know the properties appreciated later and were worth a lot more but my guess is that it's something along those lines will see\nHere's what he said about is Donald Trump could be could Donald Trump be in trouble if this is true cut thirty five\nBecause the vents that we're describing most of them happened in the Nineteen nineties in terms of the Dodgers that to Fargo that's too long ago it past the statute of limitations\nFor criminal accountability for tax evasion however civil tax fraud there's no statute of limitations on that so potentially\nTracks authorities could go back and look at these transactions with I decided that they were in the fraudulent describing the story\nThey could see birds the civil path\nSo they just an attack on this guy and I had this other story hoops crashed it he has dropped on the Forbes List substantially he's lost a lot of money to become president can't do anything international so wishes benefit this type\nOf scrutiny and it is as you pointed out he went bankrupt or a couple of times during the period that they're looking at so you know it would be interesting to know how that happens is if this is all true and you know you look back at the president during the campaign saying\nThat he knew that they was going to hurt his business but he was okay with that you know he said about my business I mean I basically passed it up to my children now I'm and I'm willing to sacrifice that financial gains are in order to to serve the country itself and that was a conscious decision that he made and and for\nPR reasons and otherwise there'd been reasons why some of his businesses have been hurt right\nOr they say he has his wealth has declined one billion dollars a since he became president hit stands at three point one billion a it was at\nA four point five billion and twenty fifth teeth\nSo now he stumbled down tumble down the for four hundred lists I think he'll still be okay how does he do that at All right but every fall on the billionaire less well he says one of the reasons Oprah will not run fifty percent of the country will hate or she likes to be love have

it may be wrapped up as early as today what are you hearing up there\nYeah I mean it's anyone's Baskin a there are those rumors that it will be wrapped up today that would be good for Senator Mitch McConnell who wants to schedule\nThat first a vote or required to get to a final confirmation I'm Brett Kavanaugh today ah he well he wants to wrap this thing up by the end of the week and to do that that process needs to start today a that being said it is still\nVery heated up on Capitol Hill on the issues surrounding Brett Kavanaugh Mitch McConnell and democratic minority leader Chuck Schumer has been going at each other every day to start the Senate session today Mitch McConnell are fighting back against Democrats claims that you know Brett Kavanaugh's conduct his\nHis anger and frustration and the way he spoke to some senators on the piano disqualifies him his partisanship that came out during last week's hearing disqualifies him if nothing else\nMitch McConnell pushing back against that today thing\nI I don't want to meet the person who wouldn't have reacted that way and been frustrated by their name being dragged through the mud so that's pretty much where we are a which is the same place where we were on that and what we do know though is how those three um Republicans who are still on the fence are going to vote yes like Susan Collins Lisa Murkowski\nWrite write I'm the president did make some comments last night about Dr forwarded a campaign rally um comments that better drawing criticism today\nFolks are wondering how those comments will affect the vote I Know Senator Flake did have a a a comment about what the president did last night so it it makes you do wonder how will that affect the Bodie if any\nYeah we and we don't know the answer to that Jeff Flake did say this morning on the today show that the the president mocking Christine Blasey Ford testimony was ... kind of a polling um and and we don't know how that's going to impact if at all Susan Collins and Lisa Murkowski\nThe reality is that uh that what President Trump did last night\nUh got the applies at his crowd and they appealed his base who thinks that this is all a sham by Democrats who it ostracized is\nOur women voters who we already know are flocking to the Democratic party and democratic candidates and five weeks out from a midterm election uh it's almost more significant to a question and look at the data on how those comments may\nFurther that push as opposed to you know how it'll affect two individuals and I don't carry\nSo what what are we looking at a vote here potentially dory\nMay maybe today maybe tomorrow maybe the next day I Wish I could tell you more specifically but at this point it is still a very fluid situation on Capitol Hill with a lot
