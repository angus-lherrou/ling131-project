point five\nMaybe [noise]\nHeard max thank you so much for the\nFact that the war in every single word given out tonight or voted on by the people you know what I'm\nLike that [noise]\nAnd that was good that was Taylor Swift oh hey hey hey how did you get a athlete amuse musician beer writer yeah but but not this last album no one bought this last out do they win by yeah know gee you're thinking of Katy Perry no no no I'm thinking about her I really do do you know one so\nWherever you told ten times the number of records and Katy Perry that's Katy Perry getting out of music which you can do\nUm be a January she has her own count her American Idol twenty five million dollars but you know music hanging out and looking at Orlando Bloom neck and that's what she's going to do what she she gonna do yeah I didn't know that\nYou'd have to do anything because it is up to Maine there living that's right Brian she talked to the traditional at all and she's already introduced ... yeah\nBecause I sort of Super Bowl show now she was mad\nBecause no one by record because she was so pro Hillary that that people are the you know half the musical electorate will turn out by it and and she's locked in the is it like that and by the way we do you mean awesome Hughes she uh she's no longer inspired and the same way she was when\nRight I I always do wonder that yeah I Know why apple each tapped to retire I don't understand we're musicians who can give a coherent interview can't write another historic Billy Joel is that right now\nSo I mean that's why ... is so fascinating because it's it's fleeting for many people and they have to wait for inspiration\nAnd sometimes that inspiration comes and mad rush and and they are overwhelmed with the amount of material that comes out of them I think of land is more set and a waste it\nAnd then that whatever vein is open suddenly closes and it's it's different from writing and writing words\nBecause I'm at someone there is a very funny quote that I Will paraphrase and you know it's like don't wait for inspiration to right if you wait for inspiration Europe poet\nOr something like that which is very funny right it's funny but I don't get it which part the tennis with telling people to vote thing\nOh no let's just go back to that for a second\nI chose was helping me can you there's no ... look what you made me to the ... you made me do yeah there there's not that stick out early man really we have to see it so why would Taylor Swift come out until everyone I'm not voting for Marsha Blackburn um we're voting for Bill Bryson which makes you think that\nYou know mostly democratic pure shows aren't grew they knew so why would she ... her audience\nBecause she's from Tennessee and it's it's safer than telling people to vote for Hillary\nAnd you know she she's been criticized in the past for not coming out against President Trump but she you know and voter registration has soared tense her ...\nTaylor Swift reputation name of the album released it in a release the last two years to the ... the last two years it's sold two million copies oh wow which one of us was right I agree with you yeah yeah now look at Katy Perry's latest release not good now why do you compare that to\nA because they hate each other ... um they had their career path have been similar and somebody addict in many ways and then I'm Katy Perry stole all\nTaylor Swift backup dancers a swift had to\nPut her career not her ... her tour on hold\nBecause she had to find on the back of the answers I did not know that how do you still backup dancers who's up to the back of interest to do to go to the best opt opportunity but you don't pay them like a ton of money became part of the trip was rejected ... well it so that didn't work out for them now\nSo the other thing would be oh I remember Tony Orlando when he lost on it was very sad sad but who do you lose him to the was in um [noise]\nCharlie Daniels and don't know it was George Michael with an end on mhm right George Michael Dunn when people know the end do important now well Kennedy I got to ask you something else is a true the country music next generation lean more left probably everyone does\nNot everybody but in the music and entertainment yeah country used to be\nKnocked outweigh reliably conservative yeah yeah but now with the Internet I mean I don't have

you will\nYou know I I you're right I lost cell phone service last wife by there's no power the hotel I'm Talking to on our broadcast device but it's none of the above and that's the only way I can get out and talk to the rest of the world right now that's how bad the storm was here\nHundred fifty five mile an hour winds at its center this storm was indeed a monster it will go down in Florida history as one of the worst that's ever hit the state and certainly the worst that's ever hit the panhandle\nIn history now what's going on now in Panama City beach we've got a lot of wind but not hurricane style when we don't even have a tropical storm force winds anymore just some gusts in fact the pavement is already dry here that's how fast this store moved\nThere is damage here and we can talk about that but the good news is I have not seen any indication is that there's been a massive loss of life among the people who would nor the evacuation warnings and state here and animosity beach\nFirst and foremost as far as we know now no loss of life that is the most important thing and you know you you spoke about the storm almost ... almost in past\nTense and that what would that is what we're hearing from a lot of people as the storm moved in and moved out that quickly\nOh my gosh I've never seen a storm move that fast it was\nIt came up really suddenly a very very quickly we went from zero wins at say two o'clock in the morning to hurricane force winds less than twelve hours later I mean hundred plus mile an hour winds here of animosity beach uh and then it died down and it is\nAs I said it's dry here now it's just remarkable there is damage left behind rules have been torn off their our power lines down power poles it pales in the ground upside down I've seen trees knocked down over roadways I have seen\nEvidence of flooding here up but as I said I didn't see that residential damage that would indicate a major loss of life\nAnd at this point you've got to say that's the big sigh of relief that's got to be the headline Europe I must say the beach maybe elsewhere but certainly here that are most of the beach\nAnd we'll hope that it stays that way or maybe we just haven't found out the worst of the news yet but uh it you know I don't I don't want to say things could've been worse because this was right on the verge of being a category five storm but as fast\nAs was moving I guess if there's any silver lining at all is that the storm was moving as fast as it was as it was\nYeah yeah that's a great point however our good fortune will be\nA the misfortune for Georgia and maybe even the Carolinas as the storm\nContinues to speed up the road right now it's a category three hurricane it's near Bainbridge, Georgia moving to the north north east\nThat will take it over places like felt dust out towards Augusta and did up toward the Carolinas and we've been talking about this for a couple of days now but they don't need any more storms they don't need any more rain and that's exactly what they're going to get as a this store Michael passes overhead\nRight absolutely right Pete combs in Panama City will let you run Pete I Know you're
