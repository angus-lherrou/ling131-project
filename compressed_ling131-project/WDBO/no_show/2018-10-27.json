we are back you're alive and the WTO studios we have Sarah wall for cross country mortgage there how are you doing great how good afternoon how are you I'm doing fantastic but I got to tell you what it seems to not only from what I'm hearing from cleave but the real estate market is on fire right now you know central\nFlorida has always been a really special real estate market because the city itself we just have so much economic growth than physical space to keep growing outwards and expanding that a lot of cities in the U.S down south yeah\nInitially in Florida of all the Florida cities because everybody else up ran into water Orlando doesn't have that problem\nCan keep growing out and you know Disney has always been such a strong um economic machine here for us over the years even the last five years\nThe growth in central Florida both in in business in real estate and it's just been it's been phenomenal ... strange way we get a little bit insulated from some of the deaths in the roller coaster that Israel said across the U.S and even though we got hit pretty hard when the market crashed\nUm we didn't get impacted quite as badly as some of the rest of the country so it's been very interesting watching as the real estate market is shifting here and real estate professionals have been\nKind of speculating over the last few years that\nGoing to shift it will have like a little bit of a natural swing back it's been such an insane seller's market for the last several years everyone's saying it's not sustainable but we're kind of waiting for the other shoe to drop and not really sure when and if that's going to happen it's it's interesting\nYeah no it's it's it's it's it's seeing right now I mean we were just talking about before the show started rent rent rates right now if you're reading right now you're just losing money 'cause you could get into a house right now and cook your monthly payment and a half almost\n... sometimes you really can and and if your rent or you know exactly what we're talking about you're feeling the pain I'm\nRenting downtown or single family house I I tell people all the time and that is one of the questions we ask when we're\nStarting your loan application is what are you currently paying rent and then what's the comfortable range of the maximum you want to spend on your monthly mortgage and everyone always wants to save money on their mortgage because they know that their rent is too high it's\nReally fantastic to um be able to help someone pay less for their mortgage and build equity and a house in there than there are throwing away a renting\nWhen we got a lot of great topics we're going to jump into right now but uh no greater topic and your phone calls let's give up the phone number said for for two two zero zero nine six five again if you have anything in any type of question if you've been rejected so many times these gifts or a third opinion fourth opinion something like that she might be able to help you\nAte for for two two zero\nZero nine six five eight four for two two zero\nZero nine six five lawyers timely topic today what are the ones that want to kick it off with Sarah because this was a popular a question or earlier today on me all the money show and again during um also malls that are getting financed after a divorce\nSo it's funny I don't know if it's seasonal but it seems to be this time it seems to be\nLonely Dolly by doing another Thanksgiving when idol family and those\nDon't ask to be I'm really not sure what it is but I'm sure there's some psychology behind it actually what we deal with a lot is people before they started divorce proceedings and how crucial it has to understand exactly what you're getting into so let's talk about this for a moment the reason why this comes into play is that\nIt it is state specific it has to do with Florida's home studying laws which is a wonderful tax benefit\nTo people who own a primary home here in Florida you can file for homestead exemption\nAnd get a deduction off the assessed value of your house you're paying less property tax it's a wonderful benefit but it kind of cuts both ways when you're on the other side of the fence so let's say you own a primary home with your spouse and you are in the process of\nStarting a separation or a divorce you are not legally divorced\nSo when one party wants to leave and go by their own place but they're still tethered to the existing property with their legal south we have a problem and here's what that comes down to when you try to buy a new primary home\nAnd you were still legally married your legal spouse has to sign off on the mortgage deed of trust acknowledging that you are about to take out\nA huge loan you're going to take a mortgage they are not finding anything that obligates them to the note which is the promise to repay\nThey are simply acknowledging that you they're legal south or taking out this mortgage you at your spouse must be there to sign the D. of trust if your spouse\nDoes not want to sign it you are not buying a house and so this becomes a very delicate dance when you're when you're working with one of these parties because Florida doesn't really have a wreck at least in the mortgage sense a recognizable legal separation\nSo sometimes this gets very confusing for buyers coming from out of state because legal separation is a real thing for them but in Florida because of our home studying laws\nEveryone has to be on board and so this is kind of making it very sensitive\nBecause the seller needs to be aware that this could be a problem all the realtors need to know your lender and then of course he was the buyer because we'll get it all the time yes it's a ... my spouse will sign they can change their mind up into the last minute and you're in big trouble so we have to make it very clear and walk you through all your options\nAre to decide whether it's something that you need to let's go ahead and do it now so that you guys can smoothly move forward with your separation divorce or that might be something that you need to wait until you're legal procedure finalized to move forward but it's\nIt's something that's a little bit different in every case by case but this is why when we start asking very personal questions when you're applying for a mortgage there is relevance I promise\n... bought us a lot of great information or so we'll get into that\nConversation could almost one facts as we continue on and a shower but on the phone number ... for for two two zero\nZero Ninety six five if uh the Syria hit a chord with you and I got a question didn't eat for for two two zero zero nine six five needs in Orlando is ... got a question for you ... and go ahead you're almost sure won't cross country mortgage\n[noise] hey Nathan can you hear is [noise] ... watch\nFiring well Nathan are barely can here is real quick ... put them back on hold and ... and wanted to know how we can begin the process of starting to buy a house where does he need\nWell you're you're taking the first rights that which is give us a call let's talk to Nathan what's going to happen is I'm going to start with your pre qualification so we're going to ask you questions like\nWhat do you do for a living with your income level how do you get paid so we're going to take a look at your credit report what's your credit score and your credit reports also going to tell us what kind of monthly debt you're obligated to repay that let's just put together your debt to income ratio\nAnd then lastly we're going to talk about your finances your current assets right how much money you have saved up for a down payment how much of that money you want to spend and we'll start putting together kind of your budget what's the maximum you can afford\nWhat do you actually want to purchase and then from there will start working on your pre approval which is collecting your financial documents once you've got your pre approval next best thing is to actually send you into pre underwritten status that something unique to cross country that we offer\nThat uh we can get your loan fully approved so\nWell in Ethan is back to get them on the line and go ahead with the euro comment or question for sure\nI'd be job is to go to college so that you will be the job to do something to be\nMade me think great question

you can you can make your first purchased so what we're going to want to do is take a look at your credit and start\nBuilding your path so that you know if there are things that we need to help bring up your credit score or even establish credit in your case a nascent you're here for school or are you currently working\n[noise] you're just getting into too much you don't look\nCongratulate you
