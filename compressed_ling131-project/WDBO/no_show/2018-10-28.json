ways\nWell I definitely feel a lot better they'll healthier I'm like you know a lot of eating so much junk food before and you know very unhealthy foods staff stared at\nDifferent times of the day and night that I shouldn't be eating and never really eating as healthy as I have right now I'm actually learning delight said they'll never thought I Would like to grill on the train a lot of new vegetables and things like that\nYou know what's interesting you're chase a probably change for food is that right they have\nI'm actually not even a craving some of the things that I used to eat before which are a lot of fried foods and pizzas and stuff like that I have a ... those are all about them actually enjoying the little\nYou know it's interesting people you know they're always worried about cravings are a lot of people are they going to get these cravings and really you know what if you're out there listening you got cravings and you can't you know drive by a fast food place you know without stopping in uh it's it's not the it's not the food that you really craving it's the chemicals in the food\nAnd once you ... once you find out that you really busy manipulated by the food companies and the fast food chains they actually put these chemicals into foods that they do create craving for you so if you can unite or you know you want to show more candy and that's how they do it\nAnd I truly believe that because I live that daily Diet Coke drinker and just given that up alone and it has the first I tell you the first seven days I had the worst headaches\nIn the world and how to do with the ingredients that were in there that aspartame and all that stuff like that yeah the artificial sweeteners I Would use in my coffee\nAnd I've given up completely and so now today's date twenty and I haven't had a lick of that twenty days I don't have headaches anymore and and I actually feel better without having it\nYou know which we call those feeling headaches just to let you go because your body is feeling so if you stop smoking stop a a particular food you know that have those chemicals that's really your body's reaction to the chemicals you know you got to get your fix you got to get your fast food fix and typically a\nYou know once you're addicted to those kinds of foods or depended on those type of chemicals\nOr you know it's all downhill from there because chemicals always when you know a a cravings increase appetite increase hunger and you always got to eat\nYou know many times because the foods that you buy at fast food just are not very nutritious so our Vicki will that to see how simple that was\nThat was just a as we are close uh uh this segment here you're a date twenty how many pounds or you know Twenty one pounds\nAnd what would
