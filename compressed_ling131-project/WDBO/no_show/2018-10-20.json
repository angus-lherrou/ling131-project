work with you all on a regular basis and thank you for that\nPeople when they come to see it first state planning they're awful kind of confusing don't really know what's happening in ... words which direction to go and we help them figure that out and so it gives them a lot of a peace of mind to get their state planning done and so that they know everything will be taking care of if they passed away\nWe are happy to make things in school and easy for you and for your loved ones and\nGive you that peace of mind that you had these documents than\nWe do offer free initial console to talk about your state planning and certainly if you've got an existing well you have an existing trust what you should bring it with you will take a look at it\nMaybe that document is working and maybe or maybe it just simply needs to be changed a little bit but\nYou know our pricing can go down we typically for documents for people we do or will we do a living will decoration were you asked that you not be kept alive by machines we do a health care surrogates or if you're not able to your appointing somebody to decide what doctors what hospital what medications\nAnd we do a durable power of attorney for financial fares so that's for documents so we do for a typical client if you got so's\nTo those are already working for you we only have to do to that of course we can just start pricing down\nPeople appreciate that it is her document\nAnd the fact that often times it exactly like you said Tom people will have existing documents some of them will work and then other times they need to be updated and it depends upon won its first and foremost do they still say what they want them to say\nAnd then we also know on documents such as a financial power of attorney often times it's critical that those are ... up to date to ensure that your financial institutions will honor says\nLet's go to Francis for land or for instance you're on news Ninety six five go ahead\nI had a kennel at at least six part of Canada and I didn't really yet at age ... a new one like starting first do I have to get right\nWell you're leases expired but you still have at least with them but you're on a month to month basis so you could do nothing and you'd have a month to month lease but when you're a if you want to do a brand new lease and you can start and you can have your starting data November first for example\nUh situations within the within the area because you're going to be able to travel easier we got the high speed rail is coming and you've got a lot of transit that is moving in a direction it's going to be closer to like almost like in Atlanta at some point here which is going to continuously in steadily increased our values here\nYeah and it's just and it's funny at all I wanted to ask you also about you know I saw the stock market had a bumpy week hopefully\nLast two weeks have been a little little rocky did that help rates and actually did you know but they're ... you have to remember and it's it's an interesting dynamic because if you understand what drives interest rates generally when the stock market cleave is doing poorly we're going to see an improvement in interest rates and we did see some very\nA very slight improvements ah on an intra day basis\nFrom time to time during the last two weeks however typically when the stock market is doing exceptionally well the bond market he's doing poor and when the bond market or or excuse me when the stock market is doing poor the bond market is doing well and that's driving interest rates down\nNow ironically there has not been a lot of of institutional money flowing in the direction of bonds which would cause rates to go down so we're not seeing what we typically would see with that teeter totter effect\nWith the with the equities or stocks going down\nSo I've got a great credit score great income buying a house I'm going to be five percent of the thirty year\nYeah you're close to five percent you might be in the high force\nBut you know the days of the low fours are really gone and I'm hearing I had a couple of clients call me earlier this week that said oh you know Bruce you're quoting me like five and three or four and three quarters five percent\nAnd yet I'm getting quotes from other institutions that are closer to the mid force but by the time I got those numbers to me and they sent me the paperwork\nYet of course you're in the air force but you're paying points to do this points to do that you want to pay points there's always an option to do that but typically paying points is that what you're doing is pre paying your interest so give me more money up front and I'll give you a lower leg raise you can do that to everybody can do that is\nWhy it's a bit of a bait and switch and that's what's happened to me I I won't take them anymore this used to happen to me all the time of closing with the Internet lenders originally and I can hop on ... on on line and they're going to give me a better mortgage\nBut what happened was Dave Dave close encounters of documents come in and the interest rates nowhere near what they were quoted or the weather is way high on the cross or way higher and that and that's why it really kind of shopping or you explain somebody you tell them what they're closing costs are and go over the a P R like the total cost\nAbsolutely well you know I Believe that uh you know even though we've gotten into a society where we feel like we can do everything on the Internet and some things we can do better if you want you know you want to buy a product over the Internet it's easy to do but when it comes to a mortgage there's a lot of moving parts\nAnd part of the moving parts are humans so that when you've got so much going on within a alone file and you've got one borrower with one situation and the other borrowers got a different situation and you've got to blend the two together\nAnd where did the money come from and you know what credit issues to one by or have over a different ... ... ... ... it requires somebody that's got an attention to detail that can sort through that and\nOften times we will help the client improve their score to get them a better interest rate and a lot of lenders just look at that and go you know what you know your score is six twenty five and yeah you don't qualify\nWill look at that and say you know what we've analyzed your credit we believe that if we do this we pay the Sears car down to this we pay the cap one down to this pay off that collection we get the score up to six sixty and now you're in in business to purchase property\nSo and that's what's important is sitting down with a professional so I Want to bring in one of our professors we use tremendously\nAll the time my office is limited got a bad phone going to their office for all the property manager got Lorenzo here with protests Casey and plumbing how're you doing the Reza I'm doing pretty good how are you and one thing you know I've had property management my business for about twelve years now\nAnd it just I've had other companies and just amazes me that you guys have these services under one roof and the response and the the feedback I get from the tenants I Want to keep them happy so they're paying the rent on time\nBut the feedback and the landlords you know they're happy with the prices are happy with the work done\nAnd I just get great service from your from your team so tell everybody about protests ac implement\nAs opposed to if we are we are open twenty four seven clique so we never close you call her office for all seven to nine one one six four four we have an actual protest employ the answer the phone\nGet you to take out their quick response and that's the thing we charge Ninety nine dollars for a full diagnostic\nSo we don't have to charge a low price just to get in and find something broken or try to sell the customers something they don't need to go to the encyclopedia outside do a full report let them know what needs to be done and then their decision they want to move forward we don't pressure mental\nYeah and it's just as right now I Know you guys we I mean we had Ninety degree heat and it's October is almost over so you guys been busy right\nWe've been busy in right now is the time to buy a new air conditioning a train is offering rebates right now up to a thousand dollars in you know they appreciate this time of the slow season now that we're having and we don't mark up the price on that\nWe just directly straight to the consumer thousand dollar rebate melon rebates and also the power companies also gave up to six hundred dollar rebate when you install the high efficiency system\nAnd when somebody think about Wednesday and time for that new system like what's the age and and what's you know the four hundred dollar power bills that the trigger when you've got a two thousand square foot home what are they looking for that's\nDefinitely the trigger but anything that's ten eleven years old twelve years that is actually running right now so in his running his best time to replace it you can have you can buy some time pick the right system for your home make the good decision take the day off when you need to get the system install you don't have to rush everything and just throw something in the first person comes knocking at your door\nAll right great new and I were having a discussion before the show and I'm a Bruce to chime in on this talking about how home prices are up interest rates are up so here's an article probably by this is out of the wall Street Journal probably by somebody here ... um she probably doesn't even own a home she's talking about how more people are thinking we should rent it\nAnd I always want to preface this by I've never met a rich renter never ever ever ever unless they were in their eighties and nineties and gone into assisted\nLiving they had yeah I knew they had own before yeah yes so now there are some rich people that live in New York City in a penthouse that might rent but yes that's a little different story unless that is you you're probably better off\nTo become a homeowner and look at cleave you and I both know when a client comes to you or comes to me and says hey I Want to buy four hundred thousand dollar house and I'm going to put twenty thirty forty percent down or more whatever\nWhere does that money typically come from the sale of the last ... exactly right seldom does it come from them saving and they're checking account or savings account\nOccasionally will occasionally it might come from an inheritance occasionally they may borrow from a four O. one K. but the bulk of the time when somebody's coming to you and I that has a pocket full of money it's coming from the sale of one house and going into the next house\nIf you've got any questions about that if you want to you want to run a scenario buys called me at four O. seven to three zero six five nine nine if you want to talk off the air or if you want to talk on the air calls at eight for for two two zero\nZero seven six five either way we're happy to field your call or we can discuss your situation if you like on the air\nAnd ah we've got some really cool things were going to talk about some multiple offers this week Bruce are real quick mentioned fast track and how that works to help the buyer so fast track is this is a step beyond the pre qualification which is really a loan officer discussing your credit over the phone pulling your credit report talking to you about your income and assets\nThe next step would be a pre approval where you've set the loan officer your tax returns or pay stubs your bank statements your photo ID that's a pre qualification once those documents have been analyzed well we do is we'll actually put your file in front of one of our alone are under writers\nPhysically underwrite the file that's typically coming after you're already in contract to purchase a home\nSo we're putting that step ahead so that you can confidently negotiate a transaction and will guarantee a Twenty one day close ... close that transaction and Twenty one days when you've when you've gone through my fast track program I reimburse the buyer the money for the appraisal up to three hundred and Seventy five dollars\nAnd we'll pay the seller up to a hundred dollars a day for five days and we miss that closing and that's a great that's a great\nWay to put your money where your mouth is and it's funny 'cause I had of the offers I got birds on keeping track\nSeventy eight percent of the office I got this week did not even have a pre call with them or ... ... I've got to chase the other agent and check and make sure we got our eyes ... crossed and it's just part of a complete offers so that's part of what I Do is listening agent trying to find out what's the background\nAnd when the other agent tells me oh I don't know this is this is their bank I don't know I didn't talk to them at all much worse downpayment money at worst these questions they don't know and that's what you got to find out 'cause I don't want to enter into a contract with a weak fire because they haven't done this for homework and then find out that way there's a divorce and they're still in ...\nA seasonal energy efficiency ratio it's more like a miles per gallon vehicle when you go and buy that you know a vehicle that's has the forty five forty five miles per gallon\nThat's what the serious so that's what they go by like code right now at fourteen is the lowest in on the market right now is it ... me twenty which the twenty year and that's the one that train give that melon rebates up to a thousand dollars for\nAnd so that's I mean typically with the higher Syria have lower energy costs and you're gonna get paid back on that even that costs another thousand bucks or two thousand bucks or vessels going to get paid back on that 'cause it's using less energy\nYes what they actually twenty that's out right now in the market the train XP twenty they're cutting their power back up to fifty\nPercent great art so um we're at the bottom of the hour here heartbreak what's the phone number for them to reach protect a seeing plenty oral seven to nine one one six or first quickly ... ranger for oh seven to three zero six\nFive nine nine you got an awesome down payment is unbelievable we're going to talk about that we come back the next segment leave love land lovely on properties look up and down your street chances are one of those rooftops I have help sell\nI've helped somebody by it or I've helped somebody to collect rent from that tenant on that investment property for zero seven three five to eight one eight and call the number of them to call in\nAnd of course said for for two two zero zero nine six five that said for for two two zero zero nine six five times the latest news weather traffic with the wall\nIs news Ninety six point by your baby Orlando\nTurns first for breaking news weather\nTwelve thirty or news only six point five W ... feels kinda warm but we've got to change the weather coming up we'll update Joan before cash just a couple of minutes from the top stories volunteers and cocoa beach cleanup thousands of dead fish as a result of red tide local businesses\nAre concerned about the impact or many tourists as their first time the anti\n...
