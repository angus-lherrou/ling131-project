impede combs from Pittsburgh actually I'll just outside of Pittsburgh there and Pete um\n[noise]\nI I have I have mixed emotions on this like a lot of other people some of the folks that are some I'm going to make that clear some of the folks that are not happy about President Trump being there saying it was going to create a distraction at all\nYou know that's evident by evidenced by the fact that you and I are now going to talk about President Trump being there and we're not talking about the Rosenthal brothers are who are laid to rest today and some of the other victims but some of those same people are the ones that are protesting now in creating even more of a distraction send the president being there\nAnd distraction Tony came in the form of blocked off street as many as ... or ... or the tree of life temple where the president was at the time now it's all sort of came to a head at a barricade about a block away from\nThe synagogue or where protesters were held up by a leash and kind of a tense moment after the president has left by another route there was a a a small motorcade carrying some dignitaries who don't know but not affiliated with the White House somebody else was there to meet the president and that a motorcade\nCame through the area where the protesters were faced off against police that cost\nA bit of a disturbance one protester was arrested all of this to prove your only choice that this has been a very tense time and some fear factor by the very fact that the president came here when he did later the week\nThis wouldn't have been any kind of an issue\nYeah I mean I hate when anything so horrific so quickly becomes political but you could see over the weekend you know how disturbed by the event that the president was and with\nSo much media there and everybody else there I feel like the president you know just wanted to go in and and pay his respects as well and maybe if you waited a week it wouldn't have been as much of a distraction with you know everything else that was going on but uh it may not as being as as poignant as it was today\nYeah that's that's very well said I mean look the president has an ... role is good solar in any president does it went bad things happen that's one of those presidents do what they do so uh the question as I said here was one of timing\nAnd not just from that point of view of a you know there's not a a an apropos moment but also because resources here are very very thin I mean they've got not only to guard at\nThe very active crime she'd have to set a guy that the tree of life but now they have\nFunerals there were three different funerals for people eat to rest today alone there are still seven other people will be laid to rest between now and I believe it's friday a and that also requires a very heavy police presence you have to have traffic control and security given the nature of what happened on Saturday\nNight and it it is the president come to tell\nYou I'm Sorry feet in the effort of time let me just ask you this so the rabbi Jeffrey Myers he was one of the people that originally said ah he was okay with the president visiting and he was excited about it and then he reversed course on that do you think you reverse course he\nGot into a raft of emails he said he got flooded with emails is inbox was ... with emails of protests people saying please do not welcome the president here\nAnd the irony is of course the rabbi Mars was simply trying to be non political and welcoming to the nation's chief executive and I think it was nothing more than that and that pretty much\nFor my observation Tony is where this thing went from being a matter of consolation to becoming about her all the\nYeah All right Pete combs for us in Pittsburgh tonight Pete thank
