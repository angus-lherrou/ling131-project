now 'cause there's\nThere's still a lot of people who don't have our lotto is a you know things are still not back to anything that resembles normal panhandle so he's still got a lot to do up there I'll\nTell how she's pretty much back on its feet so Andrew Gillum back getting back out on the campaign trail correspond to Santa ... you know never really off the campaign trail um does take a couple of days off to raise some supplies some other things up you know to help out with recovery and he'll go up there doing the\nJob with a soda going up some of the federal installations touring and that kind of\nDoing what he can from the federal side those at temple Airforce base\n[noise] so but you know getting back on the trail so think starting to get back\nTo normal for all four of our our major candidates here and you know listen we're we're less than two weeks until election day early voting starts in person next week mail ballots\nPretty coming in so you know you've got to start making some decisions and and you know there's yeah there's a feeling cost or hurricane but the same time you know these campaigns got at trying to get that candidate back out there in front of people because those are going to start getting cast\nWith the um but with the hurricane regardless I mean that there's so there's so many lives are just devastated up there right people's home yeah all of their belongings everything completely gone some families suffering deaths in the family\nI mean regardless of the early voting and the extra voting polls that they're going to open in the pan handle this is still still could have a real big effect on the election I mean you would if you would expect a lot of these people are not going to turn out\nWell hard to say I mean you just wonder you know if some people listen I mean I I put myself in some of their shoes and I said my my family was still trying to get the power\nTo rebuild our house and you know I'm I'm going to save voting may not be the biggest thing on my mind to get down to the polling place I've got other things to worry about but yes I mean the governor doing something that I think you know everyone who thinks that we should do more to increase\nParticipation in the process can applaud and that what you're saying what kind of barriers to knock down to make sure that these people who are dealing with you know some of the worst circumstances imaginable\nDon't have one more optical between them and voting if they choose to go vote let's make it as easy as possible and you know I think for the most part we see you know both parties come out and say it's a good thing to try and help out these people if they choose to load if they start you know what I'm going to take a break from\nGetting power back on to go vote right I'm going to make it easier that that that's I think the right decision we heard that really from from both ... both sides of the aisle\nAlright Christopher he first tonight uh from channel nine eye witness news Chris thank you do appreciate it oh one more quick thing last thirty forty reactions here so CNN is saying that the the governor's campaign a Rick and Rick Scott campaign and the bill Nelson campaign couldn't come to terms\nOn a date to reschedule that debate a but the but but the Rick Scott campaign is saying that that it was all senator Nelson you know this is one of\nThe inside of this is this both campaigns are kind of pushed it back and then tried to come together with a new date they could agree on\nEither side could agree um they they eventually just agree to disagree and as well as things were Scott's campaigns like well Nelson was being inflexible no campaigns like well we propose these days Scott couldn't agree to it um I mean it's it's the the finger pointing continues on that\nOne and so yeah it's I think it to once again to the detriment of voters who might have got here these to flush out some of their ideas for the U.S Senate We're not going to get that debate and listen to your finger pointing waters that's kind of what both campaigns are doing right now\nI Christopher Hayes thank you very much as always we appreciate it and as Christopher has
