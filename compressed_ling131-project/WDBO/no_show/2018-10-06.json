I Know I Can't remember the name of it from the big short there was a quotient there was a there was a number for the the the omega of of mortgages that was there were interferes was like eighty percent right and I'm sure right now we're like point eight\nPercent or you can look at the foreclosure market is is it's called ... non existent now it'll never be completely gone because people run into circumstances there's deaths in family there's\nA people lose jobs people get sick they can't work anymore but typically we are finding that uh the ... are foreclosures are not\nAt a high rate you don't see short sales and foreclosures all over the ... they're hardly out there in ... that really focused on that as their next are trying to figure out how to get back into real estate right now too\nSo now you know there's a few other things that I wanted to talk to you about and when it comes to the bubble I get asked about that all the time I even I'm doing alone right now for a big real estate broker and and he says Bruce I got to be honest with ya I'm a little concerned about what's going to go on in the market will my business continue to go at this pace\nAnd I shared with him because I celebrated my thirtieth year in the industry back last march I'll be hidden thirty one years this year or a this march coming up\nUm and our business actually gets a little bit of a bolster when rates start to rise and I believe the ... the consumer that whole held off on buying a home when they were in the three percent range\n[noise] then got panic because it was in the four percent range now they see the five percent range what's next six or seven so people start to jump in and go you know what I'd rather headed at five ... that I Would at seven\nWell and I'm sitting down with a lot of people and we're taught to Carlson is talking about this when I sit down with people I'm giving them a price to sell their home most of them are very surprised they looked at a couple of the online value waiters which are it's on the Internet so it's wrong\nAnd I'm I'm showing them what do you mean you don't believe that everything on the Internet oh well they don't know that the last houses so that the skews that number was a zombie house it was a you know rental rented by five different runners and beat the heck\nYou know not professionally managed and so I I give them a value that's ten percent higher than what they thought they were going to get her five percent higher there's pleasantly surprised by that and when I worked in numbers for them and usually like I just sat down with somebody I said I said what's your main reason for selling and said we want to downsize a little bit and simplify\nWhere do you want your payment to be well I plugged in a basic interest rate for him I said All right we're going to get about this much money from selling your home worst case\nAnd I showed them I said All right you're good to buy up to around five hundred thousand dollars so they're coming down from above that and they looked at that going okay All right that will save us to seven or eight hundred dollars a month off our our monthly budget who want to be on I can do that for people and kind of plot that out say\nIf you're if you're listening to the show and you think it 'cause I just heard what ... said okay so they're\nDownsizing do five hundred thousand dollar house so if that's not you it's okay to call to showcase of your life will still healthy and don't worry about that ever prices even ... those clients okay to fail all the big shots go to cleave I take 'em all over the place is forty thousand\nMiles in one year on my car this year so but let's talk to the important man here that gets us all a gets the cellar on gets the seller pay hardly do yes so got Carlos with equitable title how you're gonna die for people that haven't heard you before Carlos tell them what equitable titled is who you guys are what you guys do\nWell uh we're taught her company I'm tired of the company is the director you know it starts with I'm going to go all the way forward when buyers sit at our table the first thing they say is\nIs titled clear yes that's why we're sitting here and that's what the company does a company makes sure\nThat the seller can sell their home that they have the right to sell their home and when they transfer title to the buyer that the buyer will have full access to the property with nobody else having rights to it New Orleans no judgments\nAre no long laws uncle that writes the property you know Thirty years ago and that sort of thing\nOnly what happened car lesser fat did happen so let's say that somebody closed down home and they had obtained title insurance policy and a a mechanics lane or something came up that was never found what happens that\nThat's what title insurance for on the stand that at every closing titled companies I'm not guaranteeing anything but they are ensuring everything\nThere is no guarantees there is human error or we are protecting the consumer the buyer from mistakes made by the search department the underwriting attorneys that might have reviewed the search employees at a ton of company um anybody\nBut even that county or the city that didn't properly record a lean it ...\nIt happens sometimes there's the gap period on that too um we do at closing on Monday a but something was recorded on friday that had not shut up and public records yet\n[noise] so what would happen to consumer if they did close on home and there was let's say say it was five thousand dollar lean from an air conditioning company or something like that\nOne or two things could happen um titled companies do not like having a hit on the record the fact is the more claims people make\nThem worse you look with making errors 'em if something like that were to happen something was miss if it was that title company's fault a smart title you're more likely take care of themselves no go ahead and write a check they don't want someone to make a claim of five thousand dollars they rather write a check for five thousand dollars take care of it so we missed that\n... that was made a mistake made by the underwriter the search they're pointing to themselves miss that completely\nThey'll explain to the person how to make a claim and they will be taken care of\nRight so you're covered that's where you kind of insurance covers you correct so you don't have to worry about losing your home if something was missed\nAnd you'll ... you'll Joe Joe running Barrett comes back from the seminal Indian tribes saying wait a minute that was my ... my great grandpa land\nWell and those kinda things you know it sounds mysterious but those kinda things could happen it happens with\nVacant land a
