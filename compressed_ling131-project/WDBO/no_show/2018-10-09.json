in New Hampshire and it's one of the few states that the Republicans are actually on the off and so most of the places where the Republicans are running we're on the defense because of the map that we have being in the majority but because of the retirement\nOf Carol Shea Porter it's an open seat Eddie which has a great shot at winning that he's a different kind of can't eat it all on a law and order kinda Kenny he's a veteran and he is someone who connects very well with the people in the hamster\nBut he needs to raise money he should increase it profile and each and make sure that he is supporting that Trump's agenda and if that happens the people in the ... will reward him and sent to Congress\nAnd just with that was bringing Eddie Edwards running for Congress in New Hampshire first district against Chris Pappas or was it feel like you would ask you who's from New Hampshire new corner like that\nI was always great to have a a fellow rather staid are supporting a state of skills good and you so much for having me on the show\nSo why do you get into politics your guy who's been in the navy a small business owner former chief of police in over in South Hampton you know a graduate the FBI Academy why do you want to run for Congress\n[laughter] well because I actually worked in government to things happen to you I Believe you want to do more that you want to tell the people what's really going on marketing transparency government because that's what motivated me to get into a politics it's what motivated me to run for office I I Believe the citizens of this country\nNeeds to be back in charge of the government we need more moms and dads in charge of communities we need more is in charge of government not the other way around\nAnd you also want to be the first African American elected in this district right in the state\nThat that that I Want to be a I have to tell you that are being African American my opponent is they openly gay male those things are not important to the Granite State is what's important at moms and dads what you can do for their families to make sure to protect it\nYou know I've often said that uh I'm not special because I'm black my opponent not special because he's gay what makes you a special is what you get back\nTo your country your family or community that's what defines who has an American that's what makes you special skin color your ethnicity or your sexual orientation\nYou know a lot of stuff do you see the chaos that's taken place especially around the cabin you Kevin stuff and he ... he said why do I want to go there but it won't want to go there where people are being shouted down for doing their job\nBecause we have to fight that we have to stand up as Americans and push back we have a small window that changed the course of this country\nAnd we have to bring it back around and I and I believe and I've always believed the Republican Party has always been a party that stepped\nForward to bring our country back and you're not in our country a couple of things that we've always relied on\nThat's the bill of rights of the constitution that's our flag declaration of independence our founding documents in our symbol of freedom and justice of liberty left what unites American and I think it's time that we bring our country together and the only way we can do that by rally around those things that we know from ... and a legacy that brought us together\nSo why run I'm sure you must get blowback I hear from Ben Carson we hear from Jim Brown others that you're you're African American you whereas the Republican all of a sudden you were a sell out I mean what made you go to the Republican Party lieutenant colonel Allen West who doesn't care about what anyone thinks in a good way so you end up as a Republican because\nMy grandmother play a role in my life uh taught me American values she taught me how the low on a plane to give out to be self reliant out to be independent and I'll get back your community and as I grew I learned those values and and those values aligned with the Republican Party and you have to look at\nThe legacy of his party the Republican Party has always been a party\nOther minorities has always been a party of women and from the thirteenth fourteenth fifteenth and Nineteen to limit the problem is is that people will say to you today whether the Republican Party is not the Republican Party of Eighteen fifty for what you couldn't be further from the truth the fact of the matter is the Republican Party never guaranteed the government will provide for you\nAs always guaranteed the government they will fight to make sure government didn't take for you\nSo that's why in the slavery that is why it's so hard for minorities and women in this country track of the matter is that we don't tell the truth as Republicans we don't fight hard enough to get things we've allowed a liberal some now the socialist that tell us or vilify uh thoughts on it right that somehow we are not supportive of of immigration for instance\nWe were stylish citizenship in this country the Republican Party establishment citizenship said we don't care about voting rights of course we do\nWish that I was holding my country so the fact of the matter is is any sensible person who looked at this country and believes in the values of this country would find themselves leaning more towards that conservative way of life in fact\nThat used to be a family principles our country we want less government when women dictatorship ... or ... or ... and now we will come to a place in our country was socialist roughly telling us that if we don't support government programs that we don't support a government officials and somehow\nYou're not black enough you're not you're not showing\nUp as a female or somehow you have to follow this line that uh if I don't get on the gravy train of government\nThat I'm not I'm not a pure black or I reject those type of silly notions\nAnd you know what you're putting your money where your mouth is you're running for Congress in New Hampshire first district heady Edwards thanks so much here to give it to the country does the the FBI in the navy and was going to get back even more good luck at a certain thanks for having me on your\nYou got to go to the brain to me that can't find out where
