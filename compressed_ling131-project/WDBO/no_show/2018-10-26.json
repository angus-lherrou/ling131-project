E. D. V. O. breaking news a suspect in the mailing of those suspicious packages arrested down in plantation\nAre down in South Florida the arrest happened late this morning we are getting more now from several of media outlets that his name is ...\nIs the name fifty six years of age uh according to reports he does have a criminal history it's alive George ... now in Washington\nAnd of course a Dorie um there there were another a couple of Bob packages suspicious packages found today I'm sure there is a big sigh of relief knowing that there is at least a suspect arrested in that case they're inside the beltway doors\nYeah since I was on the Jill Kelley this morning to more suspicious packages\nAre revealed by law enforcement and now in the rest of that man that you just referred to\nNow what we don't know from the FBI and and from the Justice Department is whether they believe that this is a single suspect or whether it's one of several people that they they are looking into at this point we will have a press conference with Justice Department and FBI officials\nAt two thirty pm we will of course be there for that and in the meantime officials we've talked to her being rather tight lipped about the process that went into tracking this man down in leading to his arrest\nYet here's what strikes me how\nThe easy it it it seemed to have been for the feds to find this guy because you would think if this guy wanted to send a message or wanted to do damage that he he would have made it a little bit harder to find him I mean but the guy who mailed these packages basically in the area where he lives so there are a lot of questions about this guy out there right now\nYeah and and we've been talking about this um all week you know I'm definitely not about investigations expert at don't seem to be that this person clearly had missteps that suggested to um to us that law enforcement would be able to find them rather rather easily so uh we also know that at the visuals\nAll federal law enforcement across the board was all hands on deck around the clock and trying to find this person as quickly as possible as you know this fear still existed around the country that there could be more of these explosive devices in the mail well\nLook if this is in fact a guy and he is a suspect right now obviously but if this guy is truly a President Trump supporter and there were reports that he has Trump bumper stickers all over this white bandage being um towed away now why would he do such a thing at a very important\nA part of the year where there is a midterm election coming up here
