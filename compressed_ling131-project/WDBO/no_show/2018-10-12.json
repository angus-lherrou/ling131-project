this week\nIt is very tough to do Scott to be honest with you because you don't have words that can adequately encompass this kind of disaster this sort of\nAn almost complete destruction where'd you walk down the street let's say on fifteenth street there in Panama City when you are looking around and and trying to to take it all in\nEverything you see has been damaged or destroyed by this storm and think about that the things you normally see the the fast food restaurant a car dealership the Mexican place you know the uh the houses the apartment complexes the billboards the phone poles the phone lines the cars in the last everything\nEverything has been damaged by the storm or has been utterly destroyed and when you look at it that way you're like\nWow I Can't comprehend yeah bring it in\nYeah yeah I I I Would probably say the same thing if I've seen what what you would have seen over the last three or four days Mexico beach was ground zero Pete and and we're talking about entire blocks of homes just obliterated there I I Can't imagine how long it's going to take to rebuild that community and because there's really no infrastructure\nIn Mexico beach in other hard hit areas I I also can't imagine how long it's going to be until people get to return to their homes and former homes there\nThat's a great point that a lot of people who didn't leave who stayed and wrote this storm out now much to their chagrin a lot of people were thinking about that there were thinking when will I be able to go back and I don't want to leave because I don't want to be kept away from my home now a lot of people who left\nAre pretty happy that they were away and the people who states say they'll never do that again and\nUm yeah ... what what what will will will strike you about this week I I Know you're probably hopefully for yourself you're going back home but um what will strike you about covering a hurricane Michael and and the aftermath this week for UP\nSo there are three

hear that terrible low rising and falling of a old modem that it was almost human life because the wind blew through the wires that around the buildings made the hair on the back of your neck stand up that's the shock and awe of this the second part is the aftermath were just talking about the outer destruction\nLeft behind the last time I saw anything anywhere like this was after hurricane Charlie in two thousand four and going through ... and looking at the\nWhat I described in as the fist of God that seems to have punched right through the walls of buildings and the final thing is\nThe people and how I get to go home and you feel almost guilty about it because my house is OK back in Atlanta but so many people lost everything and what's worse so many people who lost everything right now have nowhere to go one guy I talked to had to go back to the unstable\nOpen air rubble of his apartment because he had no place else to go and that's what's going to haunt me for a long time or the stories of the people\nWho had no food who have no home and now who have very little hope for the future because they don't know what the future holds for them\nVery well said Pete and a a great job
