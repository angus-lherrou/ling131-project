Democrats are saying that we need\nMore time to investigate here\nYeah well the one thing we know for sure is that Republicans want this to end didn't want it to end name they want to vote by the end of the week on Kavanaugh's confirmation Senate majority leader Mitch McConnell\nReiterating that again when he opened up the Senate for business this morning so we know that the the FBI is now investigating other witnesses beyond the poor that they were originally tasked with talking to a but we don't exactly know how expensive that that investigation will be or what kind of conclusion is that they will present\nTo a Senate Republicans and Democrats we also don't know for sure that that report will be finished by the time or the Senate takes their votes so a lot of question marks still remain that's\nThe I looked felt like it is I mean Ninety five percent of the Senate was pretty ... pretty much made up its mind um it's those five or six senators you know on either side of the aisle that that you know those flakes and the Murkowski use and and some others here who who have the fate of judge cabin on their hands\nYeah there is reporting today that McConnell is really focusing\nAll of his effort on three Senate Republicans Jeff Flake Lisa Murkowski and Susan Collins we still don't know exactly where they are in their thinking on Kavanaugh but you're exactly right that most of the Senate or doesn't need that report to make a decision I Will say it's been interesting to speak there are still several other\nSenate Republicans who won't give us a firm answer on on their vote we can assume that they are going to vote yes but they are still waiting at least for public appearances to make that a fish it\nLooks like the Democrats are going to march in lockstep maybe what the
