tell ya\nBuildings are just collapsed everywhere you know it's like a mobile home or something or trucks cars buses flipped over uh we just left the marina area just boats are just on top of each other's some boats just shredded before they finally thank the bottom of the bay there\nBut the destruction is just amazing and of course like any hurricane you know now is when the the people who want to\nCome out and see what it looks like\nA come out and in the streets just flooded with people just wanting to see what has happened to their city and of course everybody we talk to just as devastating you know grown men are crying air over what they're they're seen as they as they leave their houses and finally gets a day like to get a look around\nHere Scott I I can imagine I mean I'm looking at some of the pictures votes on top of boats here roofs blown off of houses houses on top of houses it's it's\nIt's amazing um and I know you had a a rather harrowing experience covering this hurricane just hours ago the what the Panama City civic center which is basically are Dr Phillip center here in Orlando it basically collapsed around you tell us about that\nWe backdoor you know we drive one of the storm chaser vehicles it's a great vehicle but at the height of the store you know it was supposed to come ashore as a category three then then\nOr then possibly of five\nOr we we still don't know whether it might be upgraded to a five but the ... got so bad the truck was bouncing around and we thought the best that was to go inside that civic center well once we got inside the the windows started crashing in around us and that caused furniture and garbage cans and chandeliers to come crashing through or\nUh or or down on us and all around us um right now as a matter of fact I'm passing\nBy two giant you all that are just toppled on their side they went back to that story went inside\nAnd probably had to spend an hour and a half to sort of hold in a corner as just the wind how old outside we had no idea feelings were falling down on us and it really really got dicey it was probably out of Twenty one hurricane is probably the scariest experience I had yet or was there with a\nA much higher for Mattel bikini and also this homeless man who was sort of outside trying to ... on his own and he finally found us we brought them into our car\nAnd then finally went inside of the civic center in the places just decimated inside so what they were gonna call there Dr Phillip center is a is out pretty much just destroyed inside\nAn amazing well luckily you guys are okay and that and now you're headed from that area to Mexico beach which was really ground zero hurricane Michael coming onshore [noise] um I Can't imagine what you're gonna see down there Steve\nYeah

in a spiral fashion well that's what we're looking at everywhere grows a tree that really looked like her instead of a hurricane ripping through them tornadoes ripped\nThrough that made it very well may be that\nIt was tornadoes and some of these places but it really from Panama City and I'm guessing all the way to Mexico beach in through the devastation is going to be the same and it's almost
