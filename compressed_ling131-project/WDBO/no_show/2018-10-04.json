police activity\nIn Saint cloud we'll get to all of that in a moment first does our top story on this Thursday centers have now gotten a look at the FBI's supplemental report on Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh that's\nBy the way before we get to Andy field big problem west bound for at least a road jak you'll Brian will be back to update you on that in just a few minutes All right let's welcome in\nAndy field from Capitol Hill where there's a lot of protesting going on a not only the Democrats inside the Capitol but folks have stormed the capital and the Supreme Court are protesting judge Kaplan I Andy what do you have for us\nBut yeah there's a lot of folks on both sides that aren't happy about any of this here [noise]\nUm but really the bottom line is when there's plenty of security up there I don't think there's a very worried about a riot but the bottom line is there are five people in the Senate that are going to decide whether judge Kavanaugh so it's all the Supreme Court\nA water them as already said some his dad left senator Heidi Heitkamp she's a Democrat\nWho was expected to vote for him a she's a very red state of North Dakota that are in fact her poll numbers are very bad and this could be the nail on the coffin of her career that she could actually\nLose her seat because of this vote for others three of them Republican Senator Susan Collins Jeff Flake and Senator Lisa Murkowski\nA slick and Collins said that they think that the FBI investigation was Thoreau that doesn't mean that they're going to vote yes or no just uh they're satisfied with the investigation or they're too wild card Senator Lisa Murkowski another wild card and then there is adjustment of a myth Joe mansion sorry\nOf West Virginia He's a Democrat in very red state West Virginia where the president has campaigned vigorously repeatedly the summer in this fall or to try to put him out of business\nUh Joe mansions doing okay the polling there he could vote no and still keep his job so there are a lot of variables here on the couch onto this vote on Saturday\nAnd let's go back to Jeff Flake for a moment he is the one who called for the additional FBI investigation to begin with last week said he could not vote unless there's some some more investigating done and as you pointed out he's looking at the report but\nWe don't know what that means as far as ... or no\nWe don't although he said are you satisfied with the liver schedule as thorough of course Democrats are saying it was of that there's some ... witnesses they say that we're not called by the FBI we don't know the reason for that\nBut at this point it it it no longer matters click with the um the clock is ticking and uh it's really up to these voters and also Ben Sasse another Republican who is open we sat on the floor yesterday that he wished the president would submit another nominee\nSo we knew he could possibly be voters oh\nAll right and let's bring listeners up to speed on what the procedure is here now the Judiciary Committee will vote tomorrow it that the ... and and they are going to pass it it'll go to the full Senate and the Judiciary Committee and they think there's going to be a vote on Saturday\nAll the Judiciary Committee has already voted voted to to put this out there that was a week ago but they they said that the the way we're in the Senate leadership voted to say well the way the main vote in the Senate for a week which is what they've done\nSo what do they call this cloture it basically stuff starts the clock and says we're going to have this many hours of debate and then we're going to have a vote\nThat's probably going to come tomorrow morning and the final and now if that doesn't pass it doesn't go any further which means that some of these holdouts others can say no we're not going to vote to end debate and then that's it it could be done tomorrow it's unlikely that's going to happen\nAnd then what's going to happen is those people who said yes you can debate for the next twenty four hours and then sometime Saturday probably lately afternoon that final vote will happen and uh I mean this is about as big a cliff hangers as you can get the less people tell us what they're going to do before\nYeah absolutely and it's all going to come down on a friday afternoon into the weekend All right Andy field for us on Capitol Hill Andy
