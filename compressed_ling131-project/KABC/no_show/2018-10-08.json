[noise]\nSo I'm just curious and I'm going to ask Dr or when this question too when you get someone who's diagnosed are dealing with a serious illness like cancer we talked about grief also being a sense of loss what would that look like if someone approaches Jewish family cetera and wants to set up some services well\nFirst thing we do is we go into a free consultation um so it's definitely Taylor and customize and everything we do we either work with their physicians are their health care team or we work with doctors that work within our healthcare teams so it's not just independent it's very collaborative\nAnd also a multi disciplinary in process so sometimes you know there's various different disciplines that they need from nutrition support to dietary to psychological to medical management we even have a\nPharmacy team that works with a twenty four hours a day that maybe help with management of the medicines in interactions and\nPretty things like that so it will vary from case to case but we start with first a free consultation see what those needs are\nIs it a higher skill level or something more supportive but what I Want to say that it's about us even if they don't need a license care there's always an R in case manager that's a sign that helps manage the case complementary even if it's not license\nNeeds that they need to make sure that the team and the care is being managed\nFollowed and that goes along with what we said this concept or if you're dealing with grief shouldn't be alone and there's experts like yourself that can help people deal with these issues as they're kind of maneuvering their way through and I'm Wondering Dr Irwin yourself to its cedars how would how would that process what would that process look like\nYeah well as a psychiatrist often focus more on the medical so looking at the diagnosis and then what's the treatment plan is going to be\nSo in grief there are a lot of depressive symptoms are feeling sad and blew down lonely or not getting joy in life but those symptoms usually come and go and they usually come in waves and they usually get better over time\nUm and if someone's having a little bit of trouble coping with that I'm going to suggest talk therapy there with our social workers are made to refer him to an outside provider such as yourself right um if it\nIs not getting better um if it's not coming in waves if it's pervasive with keeping them from being able to engage in their life and do the things they need to do in their lives we may be talking about clinical depression and and then in which case I still recommend the talk therapy\nAre but we may consider medications if we do have a a depressive illness going on as well\n[laughter] I Do want to mention the grief and also have sort of a cumulative effect would promise of for instance if a someone maybe has dealt with\nA death five or ten years ago when this suddenly that was very traumatic for them and they're suddenly dealing with a death right now in their family or you know a loved one that grief can actually affect them in a much more intense way it's like a wound that he was there and then suddenly gets re injured again\nBecause ah sometimes I I feel that people don't recognize the intensity and that's when they may need medication to get them back to a place where they can actually start processing and working through some of the experiences that are having pleasantly that are also being exacerbated by what they have in the past\nYeah I agree and I think people tend to cope and are now or in the ... and the president as I've cooked in the past\nAnd so those people that came out more resilient from their grief tend to realize that you know to get through it does it have been traumatized by their grave or just like people have been traumatized by other horrible things will be have happened often repeated grief for trauma can just sensitized them and make it worse and worse and worse and that's where we need to intervene\nYeah and also as we were talking about you know a a living and I were talking about it to break that a lot of times our culture and the way we were brought up or religious identity et cetera can affect how we deal with grief too and she wanted to share a story with our audience around the serious a loser why don't you take before\nOf all of them grow\nHow has it helped to transform maybe some of your concepts around grief\nUm we remind me kick ... what's the cartoon who made the cartoon that I found many around this beautiful cartoon that she\nIllustrates the difference between sympathy and empathy and a in a very visually and sympathy is if you're at your friends and a whole and you're on top of the hall and you say oh I'm so sorry you're down there that must really be bad and empathy is climbing into the basement went to ... them and just sitting with them being with them in that pain [noise]\nUm and in the pilots um you know Lee wants her sister to go to the apartment that she lived in with her husband and get the stuff for her because she can't be all and she's just sell locked in her pain\nAnd her sister says basically\nI cannot go for you but I Will hold your hand I Will sit with you I Will be in the dark with you as you do it and um it just it's one of those moments have jewels learns empathy she learns that that is what she needs and I'm going to be the grown up for a minute and and say I will sit with you and your pains\nAnd that's such a powerful experience I Know is this causes a lot of times that's what you end up doing and sometimes you feel like maybe you're not doing enough\nOr you're not solving an issue and then you realize just being able to open yourself up and sit in the pain with someone else it can be incredibly powerful experience for both people in the room so thank you for sharing that I'm\nDr ruining your thoughts around there I Know you deal with a lot of people who are dealing with you know critical situations\nAre exactly the right the ability to sit with somebody um to give them positive regard no judgment in a space I'm really can open up a lot of empathy is just so important and just the sitting there\nUm chemical along the way I think the work that I Do in my life has made me a lot more empathetic because I've seen the wide range of things that people go through and a wide range of things that are affected by what they're going through\nA minute's also ... reminder when I'm stuck in traffic on the one on one that there's a lot more serious things going on in people's lives um so it it gives a lot of perspective to life as\nA perspective is perfect that's exactly what I think to a shining your thoughts the transformative power of grief in your life\nActually being more appreciative and humbled and not allowing negativity and and forgiveness and things harbor in you because life is short and you want to appreciate people and and try to meet people where they are and be more supportive so I think that\nWhen I've seen things and and being with people at their more darkest hours it makes you more grateful and want to put out the right energy I I just want to say they put the right energy out there and not come with negativity but more energy of support and concerning connection and\nIt may not be like you said something just as simple as holding someone's hand are being there at that moment\nOffering some hope and encouragement and support\nSo one of the things I wanted to shut up to our audience about this is a it's so important if you're sitting with someone who has who's going through the process of grief that you'd be empathetic\nYou can not judgmental towards them and you allow yourself to open up to their experience\nAnd experience that depth in a sort of certain profound way that could be such a healing experiencing can also transform your own personal life and\nAnd and especially as we've been talking about this show how complex grief is and we just touched on it but I wanted our audience to hear that that there is no one way of dealing with grief there's it's such a personal experience I Want to go around and um\n[noise] talk to some people you know I Know that people are listening to this and people wanted to find out more about your work and the show how could they do so\nOn the show was very easy to find a stressful sorry sorry for your loss mom you can watch it a few ways you can watch it on your computer on your laptop on Facebook app to face the website if you just Google sorry for your loss are now Google you\nPlug it in search are able to come up and it's also available not smart TVs Iraq who you're Apple TV he downloads the face like ... it's like watching Netflix or Amazon on your smart TV\nUm he could go have watched Facebook on my TV something helpful they'll pop up on as is often the case of Googling um and for me I'm I'm available on Twitter I'm books are might be F F a and I respond to opt out tweets about the show um and ...\nAnd I'm just I'm my name's ... Stein counter\nOkay well thank you very much and I want to remind our audience if you missed any of that information you can always contact me Dr Howard ... live dot com and I will forward that information to you and Dr Irwin if people want to find out more about your work and the amazing things you're doing at cedars how could they do so\nUh well I'm On Facebook and Twitter and LinkedIn is Scott Irwin empty and also at the theaters a by\nSearching the Web for sitters and Scott Irwin or the Cancer Center you can find me there are color what eight hundred meters one number\nAnd I do want to remind our audience that you're also a consultant for a sorry for your loss and a available for consultation for anyone who's doing the greater project\nI thank you very lazy experience and they've been wonderful to work with the\nYeah the yeah I agree in China and if people wanted to get in touch you how could they do so\nUm they can reach us at our office at um I think you have the number of radio actually let me plug it again to his grave every year and it's a private costs us company nursing owned and operated we've talked about all that you offer but the number is three two three three sick for seven two to three thank you I'm happy to\nDo that we have a a couple of minutes left I like to go around to people and say you know if there's a final thought if there's a message you could give our audience when they're dealing with the issue of grief what would that be so ... ... lives Lizzie why don't we start with you\nUm I think you know what our show really you know that the delight is as writers that we've had so many different characters\nTo play with family really one of our central themes as there is no right way as we've had many times in this hour and we get to shell out these different characters some of them you know the main character and being very angry and you know pushing it down and then it coming out later and someone else\nYou know being perfect sister and not letting it you know just all these different ways of responding and um I guess that's\nThat's the message whatever your feeling is okay and the second thing is that was the beginning I think find a grave grab it it sounds incredible to me and I think they're mostly free in communities\nOh there's there's a lot of them are available and Dr ... has some of the there's\nA ... we have some grief work at theaters I also know on the west side there's a place called our house which has many groups that serves all sorts of ages for all sorts of trauma ...\nYeah I mean that's the one thing that work in the show that I hadn't had a lot of experience in great great but it it does seem like a a wonderful way to beat people people who totally understand what you're going\nAround also because it deals with the issue is up for her and talked about people isolating and then a lot of times when you isolate then you start dealing with severe issues that depression et cetera so just being in a group of connecting to people even if you don't feel like you have much to say that can be a very powerful empathetic experience ... we have a couple of minutes left any final thoughts\nAnd everything that he sat next I just would say just having as much patience with yourself and and being a kind of yourself as you can be um and it's being and being a kind of the people in your life is you can be are also going to their own pain\nAnd again it goes with the thought of not being judgmental Scott\nI'm a kid and this and I were talking over the break about how the despite creeping so different for everybody that the show is really resonated and there's all these stories of people that didn't know that they weren't alone or didn't know how to access services and well Facebook as a start\nUm I Hope it's also start for people to realize there are services out there I Hope it's a start for our government's realize we need more recently\nYes and that's a whole nother show we're going to do that one day Scott actually I Do want to say something quick about art to that I think is so powerful because when we're watching a show\nAnd ah we allow ourselves to be empathetic to the characters we touch different parts of ourselves and so yes we get entertained but we also are able to deal with some deeper experiences so having a very different cast of characters can also help us understand different parts of her own personal experience and what we're going through\nAbsolutely and I just say also there is not one size fits all solutions\nNow that's why we have lots of episodes cetera not everybody wants to be and how we're gonna have to say yes we're going to have a soft spot I Want to thank everyone for coming on the show we've just touched on the concept of the transformative power of grief what you've understood as complex you got to be empathetic to your loved ones dealing with it and there's definitely hope\nThat's the most important thing I wanted people

moneymakers here Sandy dunkley Finney let's talk more about the opportunities the average homeowner has\nBy utilizing their existing property and producing income because of that\nThis is a great up to ... to ... in Southern California and California to hold the Senate bill is allowing someone for something they never did before if you have a house\nYou're homeowner this Senate bill allows heat now generate income as well as providing health and somebody said somebody that you know how can we know that when a shortage in California\nAnd so we want to provide housing but in addition to that it's like a two fold we can now generate passive income far south by doing something one time and getting the money coming in every single month\nCan fit your garage to living space ... dollars we don't use our garage anything other than putting out by so called you know paint to what I Do and I met so many people recently\nAnd a gentleman that I met his wife actually passed away and he wanted to make sure that he had enough money so he called when he had to show and he said Sandy I have a big house full bedroom ... can I make my garage into living space moving to that\nAnd the main house and made a lot of sense to get the rental income in this area for that ... five hundred dollars a month John wow yeah so the cost of the construction and will cost him like three hundred dollars so he'll neck that two hundred thousand tons of profit every single month\nLet's go to those numbers again so in this particular case this production could rent out their primary home for thirty five hundred dollars a month and move into the smaller unit that you're going to construct the cost of that smaller unit is about three hundred dollars a month\nSo the net result of doing this is a net income of thirty two hundred dollars a month\nThat said two hundred thousand are incredible that's amazing and not to mention the ... says ... uh fourteen hundred so isn't that amount every month to month after month it's forty six hundred dollars a month to mention that\nThat's living the dream life and imagine you can do that too we can come out we share with you the shift that you have a ... and we can allow you to see the full potential of what you have\nAlready and flip the dream life with us it's all about living the dream life John and if you're not living the dream like we can help

putting a guess home on your property or converting your garage into a living space that you can rent out so reach out to Sandy and our team of construction and design professionals right now\nHere's the number eight three three four dream life that's a three three the number four dream life\nA three three for three seven thirty to sixty five\nThinking about what you could do it this additional monthly income pay off your debt to pay off your credit cards maybe pay off some college loans whatever the case is but by doing this one time construction you're also increasing the value of your existing property and I think this is a win win for everyone\nAnd we have a special guest on the line joining us today\nJoining us right now at California state senator Bob a cow ski center welcome to KB the\nLakes are having me down in uh Los Angeles area\nYeah great to have you well senator you've been very instrumental in getting laws passed allowing homeowners the opportunity to convert a space on their property to all living space so what motivated you to get this law passed\nWill you just see a lot of people have insurance would unnecessary barriers that government shop and I think in the in the granny unit a accessories ... there were numerous barriers that were put up by local governments and we want to\nEliminate those barriers in return the authority and the power to the owners to manage their property the way it is a day felt fit\nNow can a homeowner rent out these uh eighty use or are there restrictions based upon what the ZIP Code or city that you let them\nKnow absolutely statewide you can rent it out for a a ... percent of your choice that's that's the that's the idea here is we have a housing crisis and we think that ... offered one uh uh trying to improve it into a combat does\nSo it sounds like a win win situation a homeowner can supplement their monthly income by renting out their space and at the same time provide affordable housing for those people who need it because as you and I and everyone else knows there's a very severe affordable housing crisis here in California\nOne would think it will be but local officials and organizations really have are stuck on this idea that it should be local control says\nEvery city all four hundred and eighty cities should set the requirements of what is how their local environment a develops and we let them do that more or less for the last well since the beginning of the state but ended up for the last\nFifteen to Twenty years and what we have is\n... two hundred thousand on permitted facilities in living spaces in the state of California wow\nSo under this new law those could be converted legally and to make sure that they're up to a building codes correct\nCorrect we have an amnesty program a statewide amnesty program that we're going to give give the homeowners a ... a\nTime to bring a the facility up to a the a code word it as long as they're safe than they can get a temporary permit and they can continue to do it because we don't want us to have these people get hit with us fifty thousand dollar bill that this is what you need to do\nI'm sure this is the new bill the Senate field or a three one also eliminates some additional barriers that we have which are called which are impact fees which is for the pleasure\nOf having a constructing a\nLiving dwelling in in our city you must
