Naftali Bennett\nSometimes I think doctors trust women in some ways and in terms of prescribing opiates women often get put on opiates sooner than in ... and escalating do says\nI think that's very interesting and I think it's quite true we we don't see it I think as practitioners that you know women tend to be you know the stereotype more nurturing\nMore trusting or they're not going to come and con the dogs are out of getting medicines is that what your thoughts\nOn absolutely and so you have I think doctors more willing to give women a lot of controlled substances and escalating doses\nRight and I see it also a lot of ...\nFor the audience citizen familiar with that as being these are the anxiety drugs that are highly highly addicting and\nYou think are one of the biggest unseen problems in the addiction world because drugs like value ... are very very highly prescribe drugs and the problem is in of itself yes they can be very dangerous and harmful but oftentimes people will combine them with other drugs including opioids pain medicines\nAs well as alcohol and it's that combination\nWith ... that we often find these people overdosing and we're seeing these lethal outcomes you agreeing\nAn absolutely those in the celebrity death that we'll talk about probably later on yeah those are the ... cocktails that we see mhm\nAnd go ahead no I agree and I I Believe that uh that bends or die as a pain is very much downplayed\nA if not to recognize as being one of these drugs and in combination with opiates and ... say out are all could possibly kill you and uh the other thing is trying to titrate off of ... and I see this all the time you know this is uh you would think if\nIt's a very difficult in ... in my opinion it's harder to get off of these drugs that heroin yes yeah so we're all we're all in agreement it's\nI mean the the challenging thing is that these drugs also work because there are people that have panic disorder anxiety they're one of the most helpful medication so they just have this double edge\nThat's right but ... although that they work and they have their place I'm I'm sure both of you I'm also do some some therapy and and really some counseling and oftentimes we have to look at the root cause of the underlying anxiety and not just mascot with drugs and mass get like a band aid on a wound would you what what do you think about that\nI Would completely agree with that doctor asking I you know I I see 'em a practices that you can use in place of been today as a team breathing meditation um breath work especially you know that can relieve anxiety\nUm I mean I agree with you also Dr ... there is a there are some clients that I've worked with that they absolutely have to have\nA some form of anxiety and reducing medication\nCoding skills are so essential but yet people in my generation I think millennials want instant gratification and Benjamin as if he knows a lot easier to take them learning brats worker learning to meditate and I think that's a challenge we have to deal with as practitioners\nSure and then do you think there there's a stigma because a lot of times I Would say women who come in to see me and they want some help with anxiety I started talking about these other medications are like the s Sri class like\nProzac Paxil select saw ... these are the other types of medications that can actually put the chemicals back in balance in the brain and can help with an underlying generalized anxiety disorder or a major depressive disorder\nBut do you think that there's still a stigma for for women to be on these types of medications\nI think sometimes definitely and there's still some ... and the community thoughts about it [noise] weight gain so that can be an issue with those medications\nAnd also they don't start working immediately say you have to wait four to six weeks for an effect and so in that time I think people really want instant gratification like I said earlier and so the ... just a quick are fixed and that's that's our eyes\nShore so what is your strategy to end up or if a woman were to come in saying she's having these bad panic attacks are very anxious are having trouble sleeping for example are getting through the day where I Am of your a tactic strategies yeah I think\nIn terms of functional impairment I really like to see how functionally impair the woman is\nAnd then figure out from there what coping skills we can add if they're seen me on a weekly basis I'd love breath work and meditation and really try to go in that direction and actually some alternative medications can be helpful but if not we start the ss R I and even if ... if needed but I really try to avoid it because of how difficult it is to get off of\nThat is right and and done it in your experience working with women so closely do feel that women have different issues and men\nI absolutely fill the women have different issues and then um\nYou know in regards to taking an ss our eyes or anything for depression oriented depressants I find that some of the women I work with\nFeel embarrassed that they might be considered someone with mental illness mhm and that's a you know sort of a stigma they um [noise] but I think women are in my experience are my experience has been that women are much more secretive about um their their addiction or their problems\nI think that's a great place to take a break so we're going to do that we're going to come right back with this interesting conversation about women an addiction so thank you very much [noise]\nAre you

mines and I am Dr Damon we're asking them to fill in host today partner in crime with Dr Howard gloss\nWhere every week we talk about some\nI Would say a deeper level of working with addiction and addiction topics and today I have two amazing guess a substance use disorder counselor Donna Stanley as well as Dr Sara or a psychiatrist in private practice who also focuses and is very interested in addiction\nAnd we've been talking about some special patient populations today we've been talking a little bit about how are the differences in\nWomen's issues can affect addiction of and we were talking a little bit about how geriatrics an elderly patients actually also have a lot of\nIssues with addiction that might be different from the general population and then I thought we'd still a little bit differently on this third segment and talk a little bit about\nSort of the celebrity I mean we're in Los Angeles but everywhere really uh there's this sort of miss that celebrity and fame is sort of linked with addiction and we see\nSometimes you know the idea of the rock and roll are and how they're sort of glamorous and glorify addiction issues and I'd like to just take a few minutes and look deeper into this issue of celebrities and let's say artists right doesn't mean necessarily that they have to be celebrities but artists and a lot of artists that I see in my practice say that\nTheir substance use whatever that has helped fuel their creativity and makes them more productive and makes them more interesting and I would love to hear why don't we start with you Donna I'm told me about your thoughts about the link between artists and addiction\n[noise] so um I agree with you Dr asking um I I find that celebrities in particular musicians hum you know that that's the the big sort of caught out so to speak you know the drugs and alcohol may be more creative at ... you know there's a creative juices I'm able to accomplish\nThings and and the original you know get original thoughts from using drugs that sort of thing so you know they're actually that's the mindset and it's very difficult to change that um when I'm working with a celebrity musicians short distance but what's the reality Donna [noise]\nWhat's the reality is I you know just the experience that I've had and I can only based on that and is that I find\nA an artist who's clean and sober and you know has the best original ideas absolutely yeah and so you know if you can sort of cell that idea to someone who thinks that the only way they're going to be creative is if they take a lot of drugs and alcohol and that's the hard part right it is a hard part you know so convincing a person that you know that they actually have that in them\nAnd they you know they can be much more original and much more you know I'm a productive if they're clean and sober\nAnd why ... why do you think that there there is this sort of myth that there is more addiction in the smartest field in the celebrities do you think it's the pressure of fame for example or\nAdd certainly part of it but I Wonder if these people just have the brains that are sort of set up for about ... when you think about addiction\nAnd it's really wanting reward and thrill seeking and in some ways successful artist successful thinkers are the same they're willing to take risks that some other risk averse people are and and so I Wonder if the brain is just set up for people to use those substances but also have that great creativity and they're sort of stock in linked together\nWhen it's just like a characteristic of both but I certainly think that\nI'm an artist you know and people that changed the world and have new thoughts and all of that\nMaybe are set up in some ways this addicted brain and the sense of wanting thrills and and and sort of thinking outside the box in ways that other people might not sure and so on Lincoln was as a challenge the oh and certainly I think from experience some people feel that they do have mind altering experiences and it somehow opens up their creativity\nBut I have some experience as Donald says where people that are creative creative without the stops and says but it's hard to sort of\nTake them apart because of the cultural sort of strength of that that phenomenon\nSo what do you do for these patients really I mean do you um treat them like everyone else do you treat them special because that's what they think they are or\nOr well I think treating patients the same as always great for patients no matter who they are\nOn that always gets the best care um but I think it's it's trying to challenge them in this belief that they're somehow and sort of better thinkers or more artistic with the drugs and seeing what it's like off of the drugs and and what other coping skills or what else they can do to sort of\nBring them to that open mindedness or whatever they feel that could bring them to more artistic creativity\nShore and what about the idea that some of these celebrities are artists are just using the drugs or the substance the alcohol to sort of escape all of the chaos that is sometimes surrounding them um do you think that there is some element of that as well Donna\nI definitely think there is some element of that I'm also to keep up with their busy or you know huge a social agenda or you know just the workload or just getting you know meeting their targets or I see that a lot as well\nI've worked with quite a few celebrities and issues with addiction as well in my private practice was as well as in some treatment centers\nUm and I've also seen that oftentimes these people are surrounded by a little coffee you know that are paid and they are paid to say yes to these celebrities right they're paid to say\nThey're not paid to say no don't do that they're not paid to say you know what I'm not a good idea maybe but they're actually paid to go and say yes here's here's the cocaine or here's the alcohol or let me by this for you\nAnd they're not ever hearing no mhm and what do you think about that\nI mean something we haven't talked about and just in all of our population is how important it is to have a great social support some people who are on the same team and sort of want the same objectives and when you surround yourself with people who sort of want to do whatever you say to tell them to do I mean and that's a tough situation and so on linking not I think is a first step\nAbsolutely I mean you're talking about having a community I think as part of your recovery 'cause again you know it's easy for a lot of patients in my opinion and I'm sure it is for you as well to to get sober\nI mean you can get sober in a beautiful it doesn't matter whether it's a beautiful home in Malibu in the hills overlooking the ocean or whether it's in um you know a sober living or what not it doesn't really matter but that part is yes it can be medically challenging and deal with that but there's comfort in Atlanta and there are medications that can deal with that\nBut it's really the sort of post recovery and especially when we're talking about a celebrity is like well what do I do next door who am I really am I going to be able to be the same person that I was before\nThose those patients in our audience who don't know tell us just a minute about functional medicine what that means so functional\nMedicine as an alternative um it's actually a very scientifically based um on you know the results of a blood test saliva tests that sort of thing\nTo identify out and it says in your physiology that could be creating cravings mhm or depression or and that sort of thing you know to see if you're you have some uh\nUh problems with your gut which is a whole new science and sells and uh and that sort of thing so any sort of out in the ... and physiology can it can be corrected with alternative medicine such as micro nutrients um [noise] uh let's see uh amino acids\nAnd I I think that's very promising and I don't think it's mutually exclusive to western medicine would you agree I I Would agree but it's funny because I Do have some patients who are very opposed to western medicine\nUm they are just not wanting to take drugs they don't want these ss our eyes and we were talking about the Prozac and selects ... they'd rather try these types of natural a micro nutrients that you're saying so it's great to know that you offer that in addition to the therapy\nAbsolutely and we were not trying to discourage somebody from getting off of any sort of a needed medication psychotropic medication that sort of thing right so you know it's complimentary has waited a complementary great we also offer a breath work yoga meditation and that sort of a ... in modalities\nAn excellent excellent um and Dr Oric if someone were to want to contact you what's the best way of doing so\nYes my website is Sarah ... dot com and that's S. A. R. A. H. O. R. A. C. K. A. N. D. dot com one more time essay R. E. H. O. R. A. C. K. A. N. D. dot com and my number three one zero seven three seven to eight seven six\nThree one zero seven three seven to eight seven six and I'm In a private practice in Brentwood\nAnd I offer services that are complimentary as well I really need the patient where they are at if they want more psychotherapy alternative medications will go that route but if they want medication assisted treatment for their addiction issue then we go that way um it's really kind of tailored to the individual patient\nShore and a lot of people you know I Do a lot with medication assisted therapy as well a lot of people don't even realize that there are medications that can help with cravings and then you can help not just detox to patients but help prevent relapse is that is that what you\nDid Oh absolutely because of underutilized especially for alcohol use disorder\nAbsolutely and there are medicines like now ... and there are many others there's injectable medicines ones monthly there's some other medicines that are used off label that we can usually used to help with um these cravings and to help people stay on the right track and it's not\nYou know it used to be the old a thing was don't use medicines that's a crutch right and what are your thoughts about that\nI think that's still a difficult thing because they can be so helpful but I think sometimes that sort of prevails in that community and so I think it's really important to look at all of your options and I find that people who have been having issues with alcohol for twenty Thirty years have no idea these medications or alternative exists that's right\nAnd that is really challenging so it's really wonderful to be able to tell them that they have another sort of tool in the tool box\nTo help them if exactly what I what I say a tool and the tool box and not you were mentioning alcohol but also with opiate which is the big epidemic there are some great medications that not just help with a detox but help prevent relapse and we're not just talking about the old school methadone wouldn't have any are familiar with there's new or a you know people\nKnow about your pornography and there's now a buprenorphine injection once a month to make it easier for patients so there's a lot of things on the horizon now because this is really an epidemic that we have to have to look at it and it's a big challenge [noise]\nSo just for the last few minutes Donna I'm you know we were focusing on some special patient populations and I know you have a special interest in women are we're also talking about the elderly with addiction issues as well as celebrities an artist\nSo just in the last couple of minutes is there something that you I just like to make sure that there's everything that that you wanted to say that you've said today if there is something that you want to leave the audience with what is that\nGosh hanging on to it we've pretty much covered all the bases that um\nYou know I just find that in the population I work with most which are are women you know that a compassion\nAnd goes a long long way and I didn't really expound on that very much but you know I've just seen the most amazing you know compassionate recovery is what I'd really like to sort of and with because you know it's it's just so effective as so effective and what I mean for at least in my experience has been so effective\nSo for the woman out there right now in our audience who's listening who's struggling with alcohol or opiates or amphetamines or any of these other stuff is is that we were talking about what do you have specifically to say to her tonight\nAnd I'd like to say just you know how come forward come forward and you know find find help you know if you're out there and you're and it's you know you feel guilty or you're a shame you know please come forward give me a call for one five two three five seven to zero I'll talk to you day or\nNight so I think that's really valuable advice and and I think if if we we leave with a with the promise of hope tonight I think that we've done something good for the audience for those patients who are struggling or those who have family members or friends who are going through this and they don't know how to help them there are professionals like both of you that are out there\nUm and and myself included who can help these patients and how about your doctor or is there something that we didn't say tonight especially about these\nSpecific patient populations whether it's the elderly or whether it's the the female or the artist that uh you want it to say tonight\nYeah so I work a lot with pregnant women and that can be a really challenging time for any hormones that and you and and if you're using substances during that time were before you find out that you're pregnant that can be highly stigmatized\nAnd um I really like working with that population because pregnancy can be such a time of wonderful change and hope absolutely and I think again come forward because we're willing to help you and and nonjudgmental way\nAnd even the post pregnancy females you know I saw one this week who had a a baby seven weeks ago it was her second child in the first child was after the delivery no problem but this time you know she came and just for a regular checkup and she started crying and I said well you know what's going on and she's like I don't know and I said\nWell you know a tell me well she's like it's been stressful and the baby's not sleeping and and just crying for no reason and so this is the perfect patient um because she she kind of said to me she's like yeah and now I'm kind of having a drink during the day and I felt that this is going to be going into a\nA place that could be very dark and disturbing\nAnd I I definitely want it to her for her and get her some help on sort of thing and not necessarily from medicine at her friend's wedding dress to start with the right diagnosis and the

I'm a longtime subscriber in a long time listener and my question is about a pensions I'm a a fifty six and a half and eligible to receive a pension payment of her time in service when I hit\nSixty and I intend to take that and uh that call and our benefits they said that a pension is a backed up by the pension benefit guarantee corporation like pensions got to be about thirty four hundred a month\nAnd uh that are looking up information on the uh looks like\nA er payments for twenty Eighteen on those are guaranteed for about thirty five hundred a month and benefits said they're guaranteed perhaps about five thousand a month I question for you is that I have\nAnything to worry about as far as that or income stream that portion of my income income stream and retirement [noise]\nWell uh it would seem to me that any pension that you have earned would be dependent on their ability to meet their pension obligations is that makes sense to you\nMakes sense to me\nAnd I was that stand right now you know they've they've been under stress their pension obligations\nAre underfunded but um that from what I understood that uh that the pension benefit guarantee a corpus somewhat of an analogous to FDIC insurance that ah it's paid for by companies that participate\nAnd you're not if you have a ... a large pension or let's\nSay whatever aid and grant or something like that it that that's not going to be covered but after a certain ... am I Am I correct in that or am I mistaken\nI Would say this that I'm thirty four hundred dollars a month that's an annual pension of over forty thousand dollars a year\nSo what I what I Would check would be what the limits are on the pension benefit guarantee corporation payouts relative to what you are expecting because I mean that's what's going to determine if and if this thing winds up in the hands of a\nPension benefit guarantee then the question is will you get all or most of what you were expecting so I Would require at pension benefit guarantee to see what their limits are and and how that would compare to your situation\n[noise] [noise] yeah this uh this money\nAt age sixty ... it would be a about like maybe thirty five percent of my income stream that I counted on at six\nSo I mean I uh my uh four one K. and my IRA money is is basically that sounds like a disaster that I can with your choice as a model year up your act to pass it ... in my own personal investments are but I mean this this uh\nThis money would come in handy you know and and I I just want to see if it's something that I have to have to plan on and like you said well look I got look up the government website and look up pension benefit guarantee and yeah and and\nSee what the details are yeah that's what I Would do but I mean I my guess would be the worst case\nAnd this is only a guess but worst case which seemed to me you'd be likely to get a even with pension benefit guarantee you'd be likely to get a really good chunk of that pension income worst case\nThat that sort of kinda sounded like it kinda sounded like from the tables the information\nThat I looked up yeah that for you know on and I'm looking to be paid that I'd be pretty much covered and\nFind out what it sounds like yeah well that's good that is a pension benefit guarantee is that somewhat analogous to a FDIC insurance\nWell I think there are I don't like that I'll let me tell you why I don't like that comparison nobody's ever lost the nickel\nNobody's ever lost a nickel in a in a fully insured balance by the FDIC All right they have a perfect record of paying off everybody with uninsured amount up to the insurance limit\nAnd I and I think that that's what makes your situation different because in the case of pension benefit guarantee you there are a lot of people who have only received a portion of their pension because their pension that they earn was greater than what pension benefit guarantee pays out so that's the difference\nGot it so for what they pay out for what they pay out the percentage or the amount that they do pay out on the get attention\nI Believe that uh I Believe that if I were in that position I Would expect them to pay a\nOkay
