[laughter]\nYeah now I'm so before we went to a break Albert you were telling us the story and ah you said well I'm going to finish or I'm going to start it again when we when we when we get back so I Want to hear this\nYet so I'm I'm really passionate about business like business as my passion like I'm passionate like some people they're happy working you know Monday through friday they work eight hours a day and then the weekends they like to have the weekends for fun for for rest\nI Would kill myself if I had if the if if that was my option 'cause I I just don't I don't enjoy that like I enjoy staying busy and ... I Love business business is what makes me happy will fulfills me yes so so and and George is the same way as a business so I think when you get to a point where where your business is growing\nAnd then you add to your like here and then you want to get to the next level you have a lot of people that depend\nOn you know so like when you asked me do you sometimes just like feel like or what was your question about that about\nOh when it's just like a break like yeah you know take our because he said you just sometimes take one day off of a working out and you couldn't find one yet\nSo you have so many people that depend on you like like your your employees or you have your family so sometimes you just can't and even if you feel like it you've taken a break you can because you have to help those people a lot of people rely on you\nAnd it's not about you any more now it's about you like you said building your legacy and and and and going after your dreams yeah so like George\nHe reminds me a like his he has a business so whenever I whenever I Need somebody that owns a legitimate business like I get really excited pumped up like you could see them in my I think I get excited to talk about it yeah is it that's my question that's why I pick Patrick I chose Patrick in grant to be my mentors and\nAnd I was lucky that they accept it and\nKind of what what do you are you actually a ... I loved how you said that this is a whole another show that you paid for their friendship but he really did you pay to go to the Senate argue paid to put yourself in front of them and that paid off and that is correct car down and Patrick that day that uh the two people who spoke at the driven event yet yeah that\nI supported them and so I committed and they said you know what there's a price to pay\nBut if that's the price I have to pay to get into that circle we're now my five friends that I spend the most time with are going to be people like grand Patrick and those and I'm not going to have and then I have my business run yeah so I'm just really careful to the circle I'm Around because if you if you if you're around the uh people that are not\nAs intelligent as you then you're not you're not going to learn anymore you're not you're going to keep going better so it's always good to always girl with your relationships and if they don't want to grow with you then you have to leave him behind and create new relationship because you can't afford people to drag you down and they can't afford to stop because right now it's it's like uh\nGoing because they have my family my wife and my daughter\nAnd I have people like when ... when when somebody like George puts his trusted me he like in the U.S and he's he he sponsors driven\nHe commits now now I have a commitment to him so if if if I'm not helping him I don't feel good if I'm not helping them among like ... my company so I don't feel good if people that go to driven don't get value out of it on I don't feel good so\nWhat I see in Georgia's\nLike he took his company that started in the seventies his dad started it and then he grew it like ... I mean first you got to a certain level\nAnd what it always called J. G. demolition no my father just use his his name it was a ... and then I was just clean up okay and I remember he's used to make like simple shirts with his name and you split little dump truck on it and now it's going to do is just where we've just kind of\n... in in rebranded in in in you ran with it\nAnd every company starts with with zero it's they start at zero so you're I read a logo like McDonalds logo I don't think it's the best logo but it's probably one of the most popular ones in the world and fortunately\nCatches my eye yeah it'll kill McDonnell exactly so when I met George I just saw this because real estate you know how I Love him missing restraint George's investing in realistic to he's getting adding property says portfolio that's another business that is a business that's the business that just runs by Harley now George when when they saw his the whole concept of\nJAG demolition and then when I met him I just started spinning ideas because they said damn this makes perfect sense he's the perfect brand like he was just as his image his image himself he's the perfect brand\nTo brand the perfect running for that company demolition like he could demolish like physically and emotionally arise you'd\nBe surprised how many times they'll show up to like a job Walker and meeting and people are like you must be the demo guy I think you know they are they know and they're like you could do this with your bare hands\nThat you're not going to really tight and that's a perfect last name gorilla and imagine imagine if you if you imagine [laughter]\n... somewhere of yourself standing next to a regular size [laughter]\nBecause you know it's been going on back to like what are we talking about right now\nYou know I I don't like first of all I'm not like one to\nShow my face on things and others like do you need to ... and show yourself because I mean again you you have like the perfect of Oso honestly like visual of like one\nOf one that ... the like I mean if you were out in the WW easier after whatever they call it now you'd be like demolition man I mean that's what you look like you you just have like a Sledge Hammer and you you you literally fit the what you do perfectly\nAnd for people just tuning in we're talking to a George grow up and he's a massive like almost six foot eight do I'm totally bills workout by me looked like Schwarzenegger in his heyday and\nUm he just something that I've been looking guy and so yes you should be out there your faith that shouldn't be on\nAnd he goes you know talking about advertising and marketing yeah it was just a matter of tone over look you know what I'm never I've never really marketed I've never advertised all my or business has been word of mouth so Albert cyclic we need to do this we need we need we need to build you know the specific type of Web page\nLittle fact for everybody listening today we're often works so well I'm just it just yeah I'm not hungry then throughout the day anyway let's get back to driven look if you you know you you wanted to know what keeps me energetic it's my diet I take tons of vitamins and I'm you know I I don't eat unless I'm hungry\nSo that's what gives me the energy to get through the day I Know you guys are drinking the rebels right now\nAt a lover [laughter]\nIt's all areas they crack I'm open on air and like yeah\nI mean since you're up at like three thirty four AM I Would be exhausted by now Albert I would be absolutely opposite end and and you are listening to driven with our press Seattle inside the press the auto\nWe had a very special guest George girl up who owns J.

has George done for you\nIt's funny because we've helped each other out like a I mean I learned I learned a lot of things from George\nLike he's a smart man and and and and sometimes he'll tell me like a you can do this at the gym or do this or he'll give me some business ideas in them just the role with them and like maybe I could tweak a little a few things here and there\nBut he also refers us a lot of business like he was driven and I'm making sure that's where he really quick but humidity he met some somebody saw him and driven and he just got a pretty nice job from that person\nBut like ... also George he always we help them yeah and it's it it always comes from when you focus on helping everything comes\nIt's true and and so he's referred us like so many people I think he's

a friend who is a is hyper thyroid but she's\nVery very good at reading and studying natural natural solutions for that so she's she's scared completely clear away from all the medications\nThat requires a lot of Rick cause is here to kill\nYeah there are actually and just some of these things are genetics can be one of the things which is as kind of a tough one you know when you just have a family history of hyper thyroid is and you just can't get away from that and that's where you just have to treat it the best way you can which will get into later with some natural therapies things you might try but\nInterestingly I'm I was reading that women are actually seven times more likely to develop graves disease than men are so for ladies out there that's I'm I'm Sorry for that\nBit of bad news by their parents and ladies is just much more of a common thing for them or grays disease usually develops after age twenty a stress can be a can be a root cause smoking a pregnancy which is interesting I I don't think that's a biggie but it's just a you know something that we we want to mention\nAnd what holistic doctors tend to look out with food out or with a with a\nA hyper thyroid isn't a food allergy such and such as gluten they can trigger auto immunity and goons have biggie Dr singer is estimated that thirty to fifty percent\nOf the population suffer some gluten sensitivity so we do our product called digestive health which helps to a a one specific digestive aid and they're called a\nDeep ... for actually helps digest that gluten so that's something we'll talk about another show but there are\nA help uh helps out there for people with gluten sensitivity um overall hormone balance out particularly less a stress hormones such as the ha and cortisol which modulate immune system\nA toxic metals that's that can be a problem because there's so much toxic stuff in the air people even eat a lot of tuna fish and then she got a lot of mercury there um I've mentioned on the show I think my lead levels are actually a little high and there are things that are\nThat I'm doing right now to bring that down 'cause I was raising my ah ...\nNow did some of that last land in your ... or\n[laughter] my dad used to have you foot when you're driving I mean I just find that if that was totally unscripted and your fast car anyway\nThe digestive function environmental toxins such as pesticides so you can see that the things that we talk about the show uh the the pesticides and herbicides and the food eating clean foods produce especially the meets with the hormones\nThese things can lead to so many different problems so just being careful about what you're putting in your body is really really important so anyway um so there were a couple of things I think you want to bring a male and then when you talk about some of the some of the practical helps that people might find a way to deal with this issue\nYes there's there are some testing techniques out there and fight rate hormone levels and antibodies can be tested ... with with blood tests food allergies insensitivity is can be tested with floods tool I left for ... testing toxic metals can be tested with the urine the blight led the hair\nDigested functioning absorption can be tested through stolen houses and you're in\nAn environmental toxin levels can be tested through the blood and urine and

says he focused on a diet that is rich and whole foods and their natural state\nThings like vegetables fruits fish ... nuts and seeds and non gluten grains and you can also drink shakes that are made with protein anti inflammatory herbs and and other nutrients those can be helpful but you want to avoid again\nAnything that I had ... and it's so wry barley we most of the oats and you know open themselves typically are not uh something to be concerned with\nSpecifically with Clinton the problem is is that in less than ... is certified as non gluten and the bigger concern is that a lot of times those fields are so close to gluten related field so the ride the barley the wheat fields are quite often very close to the field so\nThat's why there can be concerned about gluten contamination and I'm also Casey and free a diet so a diet free as cow's milk and you can also avoid artificial dyes coloring sweeteners and simple sugars\nYes and you know going back to your testing techniques um that's one of the things you you might be getting the sense that this hyper thyroid is I mean it's not something generally that you can go into health food store and say oh I Need yourself meant for hyper thyroid ism in fact we do not have a supplement\nThat can really effectively deal with this issue is a\nIt's a very comprehensive approach that you have to take with us and when you talk about

risk of having a stroke researchers are suggesting researchers analyzed hospitalizations of more than two million talkers\nOr two million marijuana users between the ages of Eighteen\nAnd eighty four I guess that would cover Willie Nelson between the years two thousand ten and two thousand fourteen\nRates of stroke among non marijuana users didn't change however rates among recreational\nMarijuana users jumped by Fifteen Percent that's recreational I guess that would be like maybe weekend talkers donors which usually leads to you know daily\nUh use which usually leads to about every other our

putting themselves\nAt if their token up every hour\nOr two or three times a day\nThe researchers conducted on adults\nAnd marijuana users in the compounds in marijuana in their studies are showing that the blood vessels in the brain are narrowing and when you have narrow blood vessels in the brain it could trigger the most common form of stroke called esteem mix stroke\nThat's what the scientists are ... and of course now we know that\nMarijuana can be taken for medicinal reasons in thirty us states\nAll over the place and more and more states are now legalizing it for medicinal reasons Oklahoma was the most recent one\nAnd over four years the rate of all strokes among marijuana users in this study rose Fifteen Percent who wouldn't want to increase the risk of stroke I don't get it now there's been conflicting information\nIn the past ah they've talked about in studies about how smoking marijuana actually reduces stroke and helps people who have had a stroke recover faster\nAnd you know I can only wonder after reading this study if that was sponsored by and it was sort of like eight bought and paid for by the Canada's growers USA\nI don't know I I had you know that's why I pointed out that you\nKnow it's a serious condition stroke is a hundred and forty people die of stroke every year it's like the fourth leading cause of death in the United states first as
