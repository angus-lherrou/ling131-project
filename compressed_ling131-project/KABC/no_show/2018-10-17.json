knows for that that's who I Would love to have a wet that out and get it right away and the worry what\nThis country to be in ... years from now that was the war he would like it to be do you want\nHere's something I got out of that yeah you want to hear something negative about the vote that there was some talk that ... one Susan Collins came out for Kavanaugh then mentioned felt safe voting that way he certainly wasn't I don't know if this is true\nBut this is what I heard he certainly wasn't going to be the one that put Kavanaugh over but one's columns made her speech and came out and said she was going to vote for Kevin onto it was obvious that he was going to win then mentioned was comfortable doing that now you know I may be true may not be true uh\nOf course I mean he seems like an idea that I write you didn't hear too okay good I did I did\nHear that that's what they want to pick his brain about I'll just get that in general if the guy asking the question why did you vote the way he did\nIt get their hair is complete ads because he really didn't give an answer I mean you just basically voted for him and I I was pretty impressed with the Democrats are going to take a bucket of crap from the Democrats than we ever what does he said the the negative towards\nUm [noise] but uh I Would just like the ... data they picked at it what do you see what he's really got going on in his head although again\nI'm being hurt in him and I shouldn't be seems like a nice guys I just said\nOn the fact is Trump did when white or by forty points or something ridiculous in West Virginia\nSo did he really ... yeah and we've been talk also the last few nights about the Senate and house races and uh he may keep it is because of what he did right\nPeople may feel the way you said that hey he was courageous and he did vote for Kavanaugh so I hear I hear we are or at least I Am being unfair maybe he really felt that way would have always voted that way\nOr there was no

of life for me to tell you about that\nIs that what it is by the way forty nine cents I think it is I use forever stamps I I don't know for sure I just get some on Tuesday officials said they are noticing a disturbing trend young people failing to mail in their absentee ballots because they don't have against\nIt's amazing one thing that came up which I heard from my own kids but as a quote but I thought they were just nerdy was that the students will go through the process of applying for a male and absentee ballot they will fill out the ballot and then they don't know where to get stamps\nThat seems to be like a think tank across these guys are really tough and these snowflakes that really geniuses counters went on to say\nIs that many of the focus group said quote they knew lots of people who did not send it to the balance because it was too much of a hassle or they didn't know where to get a snap these these guys are something else across the board there all nodding and had a very spirited conversation about oh yeah I Know so many people who didn't send there's in because they didn't have to stand\nAs a way to combat this apps obsession for the upcoming midterm elections the county is focusing on aware raising awareness of in person as the vote the ballot voting\nWhich students can do while they're home on fall break you know the other problem is they don't know whether they get to vote in their college town or they get to vote or where they live at home but what do you expect from a generation that only use the Internet of course that could look up they never thought of as I guess\nThey could look up where their nearest post office is\nYes yes there's a big if if they even knew what a or know what a post office is\nSo much for the Generation Z vote\nBy the way he's the generations their names I often think about that\nSo you know you can let me know tomorrow if you go to vote absentee and if you know where to get stamps that seems to be a problem and what do you think the same day voting I don't want to make it easier for people if I said yesterday I think they should care enough\nTo go out of their way some people in other countries I think it was a Salvador have been shot\nWhile waiting to vote I think that purple and they're in a way of voting of some ... or something like that and they would show it off with the blood\nBecause they care that much they knew what it meant to finally have the uh the privilege and the right to vote\nAnd by the way I don't want an uninformed people to vote I wouldn't want them to not going to
