{"content": "Talk talk talk beautiful bowls\nG. A. B. C. [noise]\nSeven Ninety ABC will come back thanks for joining us this weekend living the dream here in Southern California and that dream could become a reality for you\nWhy because of a new California law that allows homeowners to have\nA guest house or converting their garage into a living space that you can rent out\nSo think about this folks let's say you live in a\nThree thousand square foot house and you have enough room to put a guest house in your backyard\nImagined building and the ultimate\nDream guest house that you can rent out or possibly move into later in life and then rent out your existing larger home so in Studio today as our real estate moneymaker Sandy dunkley sheen or design team and construction team decided to your guest houses also\nThanks to a new California law you could also do this converting your garage\nInto a one bedroom or studio apartment so standing a few minutes I'll give out our phone number for all the k._b._c. listeners to reach out to you but after they make this phone call and speak to directly then what happens\nAfter they speak to meet the right to the I'm able to actually go online and did a lot of the diligence on the ... which is a site that a lot of\nDesign is he is and I can also go to Google us and look at the ... the the site pan and we can see you know what to a ball if it's the garage is the garage and then we'll know know what needs to go in that when we go out and meet with them to sign a can decide with a homeowner what they actually want seen this unit\nSo everything is kind of in place and I also let them know intense that the rent you know what are the ... have a\nA one bedroom studio or we build a guest house in the back yard that could be a two bedroom two bath and it could be two stories he could have to live in space down staff and the bedrooms upstairs so I I look at the rents in the area and I let them know\nThat this is what the rents going for you to death\nBut this is what we can do and I can come out and sit with you and we can go open things in more detail\nBut when I go out we kind of see what design they want and the flaw pan and we'll let them know that this is a separate address its self sustainable from the main house and you have your privacy and not going to have any encroachment with the neighbors we can put a call ... so that they can feel more secure with the you know the opposite to she'll tough\nAnd then you walk in the ... we have to shake a cabinet so white cabinets we have the you know the granite countertops it could be the courts\nOpen plan we have a nice engineer with flaws that looked really pizza pulled their very terrible but also tankers water he says ... has a ... system everything is soundproof\nAs a one hour firewall between the ... everything's energy efficient with title twenty four and like I said it has its own separate address and whatever they want like a terrorist or you know anything nice like some garages have kept the chill feeling\nThose are really nice when you walk in and see like open and so we can keep those and the set the utilities all said that\nSo what about this person wants we can make it work for them we measure up when we come out the design of comes out with me in some cases some cases I go out and and you know take pictures and you know you know did all the measurements and then I get that information to the designer and then he knows what he's doing but he'll actually do a lot that did diligence as well\nHe goes out and then when everybody decides you know this is what we want to do want to move forward then we'll do the joints and everybody was approved the home and it was say at this is what I Want that can you move the window on this side maybe um can you make that that\nThat you moved to this side can you make that bought them on this side and then they kind of sweet cats but it's a space that's brand new and every square foot to utilize so because John it's one of these brand new space say it's ... it's actually you know you can receive ... dollars in rent I mean some people have received in twenty five hundred dollars a month\nSome people have his even three thousand dollars a month depending on where they are then this other sort of the than anywhere from twelve hundred said Fifteen hundred Seventeen hundreds of all the pens\nAnd not be able to tell you what you can obtain from Maine to not that space\nBut like hell let's say every week it reminds me of the ... the ... hotel because it's spaces brand new it's not like a thirty forty year old building that's you know have maybe like five or ten tenants it's brand new and it looks nice and you wouldn't mind moving in the south John\nAnd I think that's the key is to design the guest house the way you would like it or if you're going to convert your garage so now you have the option later life to move into the smaller unit and then rent out\nThe existing larger property for maybe three or four or five thousand dollars a month so imagine\nUsing your home as an income source as you get older and most people take a pay cut as they get older when they only collect Social Security but I imagine living the dream life right here in Southern California and not leaving because you do this one time construction that could generate just passive\nMonthly income for the rest of your life so folks rents are skyrocketing especially here in Southern California so as the rents increased so could your monthly income and that's why I'm doing this now could really set you up financially\nFor the rest of your life to reach out to Sandy entered designing construction professionals to take a look into having a guest house on your property or converting garage into a living space that you can rent out here than these number eight three three four dream life\nThat's a three three the number four dream life\nA three three for three seven\nThirty to sixty five and if you don't get through on the phone lines during the show Sandy will take your phone call after the show the number again a three three for three seven thirty to sixty five let's go to studio city and feet to Chris Chris you're next on seven Ninety KBC say hello to Sandy\nSaid thank you for taking my call\nNo problem\nI had a question for ... to ... go to the garage and a total long skinny girls you park too close in it but the one behind the other and I wanted to maybe can voted once you've gone through any value though I knew the ... kind of an odd should ... you\nKnow we we've done this tent and garages before and we utilize every space and then we make it very you know economical way you feel like you know you're walking to the Taj Mahal maybe that's not good example but\nIt's one of those places that look nice so it doesn't matter that his hands and we can you know put the Boston when makes sense and then we can put that living space in the Bakken up front could be the you know as open pan and the kitchen ...\nSo it makes a lot of sense and also the value of your property will increase by doing this by the way because now you have more\nLiving space like for example if it's you know I used to ... times because if the garage is four hundred square feet wet his hand them all you know side by side to talk of odd but it's now and living space and the price per square footage in this area is four hundred dollars\nAnd four hundred square feet that increase your value to a hundred and sixty thousand dollars so you know it's definitely something that you can rent ... late to run off your kid is gone\nAnd on and you can get that income and more so if you wanted to move out of your main home and you know make I don't know if you're alone or whatever the case says that he could move into that space you can make it nice enough when you south and ... the main house the costs more money and I can tell you what you can obtain from ... in the area that you're in\nAlthough you know truly into oh no problem I look forward to meet you I mean we can get this done about to be quickly by the time you get it in place now in two thousand Nineteen you have that income coming in month after month after month\nAnd I imagine that you do the new construction now and possibly have that new income source coming in and twenty Nineteen talk about a a great New Year's resolution of course they all in studio city so folks if you'd like to reach out to Sandy enter designing construction professionals take advantage of this new California law\nThat allows you to put a guest house on your property or convert

and then they get the total package because\nBecause you like finances the loan for them\nSo Hudson so that it may call if they want to get a whole because a lot of the time so most lenders\nThey don't pick up the phone and and realtors to like a big open a deal or and it's a family's like most important thing in in their life like it's on the line like it's probably the first property they buy yeah and there's so many so many bad agents and battling officers and the the the old ... and ... and they disappear for weeks now\nAnd then you're wondering like what's worst my loan with what's going on so the cool thing is that if you catch one of them you catch both of them and they say and it's a good team and that that's the same thing to me and seal did 'cause she wasn't in real estate when I met her so I introduce or to\nSee I thought you were doing like I thought you were nope indoor multi\nAll I did was I was a host restaurant and then I was a waitress and then I was a bartender so that's how I got my people when they when they met her when they met her she used to work in ... no no\nWe're not even a crowded place red lobster shack\nUsed new to me oh yeah the robs you take me lobsters God I\nYou get them the fifty dollar lobster 'cause I had a fifty percent as it was only twenty five bucks\nOkay well you know she used to bring you lobsters like at night and I know it was just waiting there like um you know hang you know that's that's\nWhat's his name your car or was it\nWas before the market\nCrashed I was when I was still doing good in in the ... or I mean when I was losing it all\n[laughter] and she would bring the lobsters than I Would just be at home chilling like having like some ... drinks that I Would make making my bar and she would have showed venue the lobster and then we would be hanging out and then that's when we were dating yes\nBut then I got her into real estate and then she ... she had talent she had a lot of telling then she got into real estate and in a year go like Mike ... a year\nShe closed like he was closing like\nWhat was your first your first year you did also like twelve or fourteen sells\nCars I met an investor by being that open houses Monday through Sunday literally like wow I have nothing else to do no kids no responsibilities just my car and bills to pay but nothing major you know so it's like okay when you have nothing it lights\nBut okay so I this is how much I Know I'm I\nOpen houses were just on the weekends you can do an open up about one ever you want if I haven't had a listing like the best things happen when I was ... like what are you doing on a Wednesday right and I'm like well I have nothing else to do so I'm going to go sit at my open house for a few hours on a Wednesday and I would find the buyer he went to the loan and then it'd be a\nTriple deal rather than to me that in one day she like she like she got into trouble like me and and she couldn't drive so she would take the bus from law up one day all the way to south central and carry a middle\nLived on a bus you this is before ... and I didn't have money for it to know why God\nSherry eight and this was when we were both broke and and she would carry a heavy metals real estate science put them in the corner of south central ... home and do an open house and one of those days\nShe sold the property for I think it was like four fifty or something like that and she got a fourteen thousand dollar commission\nYeah wow and and ... and that's when we were like barely kind of getting back on track that helps a lot yeah and I told her don't do that open house like where you gonna do it open house rent on it's a it's a Thursday and then she said no I got to do it and they said okay let's do it\nThen that doesn't sound like you usually are like go do it back in the day I\nWas ... it was back in a day and ... and she was going to go to south central Seoul South central isn't like the best neighbors oh it was I didn't want it and she's like we have to do and I'm like okay fine although\nI I just didn't go to a veteran [laughter] so you end up\nGoing and she ends up getting like a big sale and then and then but she's always been there like when when that was an all there and and when she was an all there I was I was there and I think like you lay it might have that same relationship and most importantly what they do is that they help families\nThey help families and and they come from a point of giving yeah and that makes the money like when he just comes out of medically but he liked a lot of the time she cuts just like whatever feces his commission fuel lower it and sometimes he'll I mean they've seen him do a mortgage for free\nWhy does the ... and like I\nJust don't have money [laughter] so just as a family\nGet or get their house or low on funds and it's happened so every now and there but I've seen you lay like just pretty much do the loan for free\nYou know and then the Mike also he'll give part of the lower his commission to help the family and I'm of course they're not doing it every single deal sure but whenever they have to they have a heart like to help people and and that's what we do here at the mortgage crisis an ambulance realty like we're\nHe couldn't qualify you know he's like oh I Can't buy a house I tried three times it's just not going to happen\nAnd you know so I said hey you know let let's it's always good to try to get a different opinion see if there's something you can do\nUm he was desperate you know he was a already had put in his uh three um his notice to get out of the property when he was renting and at that point you have these potential buyers that are already at risk of getting kicked out because they already put in their words to leave their apartment and he even received a three day right to vacate so he was like oh my God my family and my kids\nThey're going to kick us out already tried three times everybody said no and I'm I'm I'm a person and Mike is the same way we are very persistent we're out we don't like to say no to people we are I think the word no we've been grown and developed to take the word no as no\nEnd on me All right and that's it no no I mean I Try a little harder\nYeah today today I Would\nSay to me I was like All right so there's a maybe here so let's figure it out you know so obviously took the application\nReviewed the credit in nothing wrong with credit everything was fine with it and I think the problem a lot of people had that didn't do a lot of research I I think a lot of lenders or banks institutions they monopolize more on the fact of getting the higher criteria clients because of the money right they want money they want commission they want\nA they forget about the aspect of making hard to mount and making them feel wanted that we want their business not just money\nBusiness and their relationship\nBecause you never know if they're going to go one in five years to buy something else so use you again I don't think that oh it's a small loan we don't wanna forget how we're not going to do it like why\nAnd exotic and actually it's funny how you said that it it really was a small town it was only a hundred and Ninety five thousand dollars so I mean\nAt the numbers don't really matter it's ... and when it comes to money to me the numbers and people matter because that's where you're going to get your referral you're going to get your ... repetition and a lot of lenders who haven't been in the business for years will realize hey don't worry about the money will come in time just treat everybody with respect\nWork hard do everything you can to make it possible for the dream of homeownership for that individual come true\nAnd and that's going to be the best the best outcome because if you say no to everybody\nThen there's no there's no dream there is no reality show and and at the end of the whole thing with him as I was able to get them approved a I think the problem they had with the other lenders they couldn't figure out his income and they they had a variety of different jobs are part time job here a fulltime job here and the daughter was\nYou know there's a mixture of it and I think going that extra mile or how subtle tremendously because it's it's not hard it's not really hard stuff to do it just requires a couple more hours of work and and that's okay you know you might it's not about me it's not about\nThe mortgage is not about the money it's about\nChanging lives and making them believe that there's somebody out there besides themselves that cares enough to give them an opportunity to do something something different and it's really nice that me Michael able to get people keys whenever situations like this arise and they they've been told no they've been told no by everybody and then at the end what do we say we say yes\nAnd so what is this guy do I mean the family what was it was he just like wow how did you do that\nThe the thing about him he had tears tears and and it's it's something different about seeing e\nFive year old man in tears and their kids are all crying because they never thought this was going to happen you know and it only took three and a half percent down the and we figured out ways to how to come up with the money in the right in the right method and it was a very unique situation
