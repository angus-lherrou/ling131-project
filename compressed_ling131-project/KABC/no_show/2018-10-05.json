no was it\nWas before two thousand I or because it was it had to be during Bush is it'd be during the Bush before two thousand nine but Schumer brought it up a during the Bush administration went and just just a ... in case one of the Supreme Court justices died said we should not be the the policy of the Senate\nTo nominate a a Supreme Court justice during the presidential election year right by the way the stink wasn't as big it was for a little bit and then people realize oh Hillary is going to kill Trump so we don't have to worry about it we'll just get it afterwards but\nDelaying a nomination that has been an idea that both Democrats and Republicans have been promoted for a couple of months to allow the next president who all the polls and all the Democrats thought would be Hillary Clinton\nIs not the same as the famed mean a person's character\n\nBy calling them calling that person a gang rape is\nA sexual assault tour without any evidence besides an allegation which the witnesses that the people that brought those allegations about their witnesses could not cooperated and in the case of Dr Ford\nWho claimed she has the evidence that would cooperate it she refuses to give it to the body that would make that decision which is the Senate Judiciary committee\n\nSo to make that case I mean that's probably the strongest argument which is a weak argument\nThat I've heard was well since they held the Garland murder Garland real they deserved it what do you mean that was done through the majority leader said you know we've got the majority\nMhm but ah we'll hold it even if we have the majority after the next president does a lot right irrespective of whether it's a Democrat or Republican\nThat's the same as defame ing and destroying somebody's life right with allegations that are not provable I didn't see any attacks on Merrick Garland\nNone\nAnd so everything that you know ... every allegation that has been brought up\nIs suspect mhm\nUh because the witnesses that they brought forward could not cooperate it right\nThe things that they said changed that the the the alleged victims claim changed as we went along\nAnd that's what we'd go by in our system whether it's the political whether it's political justice whether it's civil justice or whether it's criminal justice the presumption a vivid evidence and the fact that an allegation and stop and think about it the protesters right now that you saw yesterday and you're going to see all day again today\nThat may get arrested again today and there may be you know ... thousand more who knows they're saying believe the survivors which means you always believe the accuser will do they believe that no we all know they don't know we all know that sort of August are do you believe the accuser if they're on our political side\nThis is the social media or approach now to ah to\nActivists or activism it's exactly what you see on social media you know we talked about the fact that real\nPeople don't live their lives like you know people are act on social media we talk about that a lot well the people who are activists far left trolls\nAnd celebrities do they live in a virtual world will celebrities live in a virtual world that's what they do for a living anyway\nThere are immersed in it I mean it is not for them that's nothing different you just live the fantasy and the family fantasies whatever it is whatever whatever you say it is because you have a blank canvass\nThat's exactly how they think that's how they act what you're seeing here is social social media type activism taken to the street\nThat\nDoesn't happen to be backed up buying anything I posted it therefore it's real I say it therefore it's true\nWork that way you know in the real world right so overall when we look at the last two weeks and who knows what the vote will be this weekend I I I don't know I mean I haven't seen any\nA count yet I'm I guess we we will see right and we will know when we come back in Sunday night Monday morning all I Know it was for the last two weeks of covering this\nUh there's not been an issue where there has been more passion\nSince the election but I have not seen this type of unity\nIn the Republican Party and think about it think about what it would take I mean I I didn't think that you would see the unity in the Republican Party this soon and it's solid right now because I think they now see\nThat whatever their differences are with Donald Trump whatever ear or whatever irritate them about the the the president whatever they find
