act ever heard of that and I think you need proper medical care\nMaybe when I'm Medicare eligible I can get my medical and fell on my parade\nThis is this is weird you've been listening that Carl Garber\nWorkplace Lehrer show I'm Carl Gerber I really am a real workplace lawyer and we've covered pregnancy which is really actually a topic that unfortunately leads to a lot of lawsuits I don't think employers quite get it that the FM LA is separate from the laws pertain the pregnancy\nPregnant women are allowed time off for being pregnant and it doesn't have to go for the FM LA and the laws are different and\nA lot of employers just got a ... wrong a lot of employers asked for medical documentation they're not entitled to and there are combinations of have to be made all the things we've talked about\nTonight are actually real issues of pregnancy ... you know taking eleven years because my son has been pregnant for eleven years I might feel that way but\nIt does come to an end and at the time in which employers should be helpful and understanding and they shouldn't be I'm challenging doctors' notes a certain number of these pregnancy discrimination lawsuits we'd like to challenge is to doctors' notes and\nClaims that they're not understood claims that they can accommodate them and I've I've actually have won the case for the CNA who had a ten pound lifting restriction and\nIt was determined that there was plenty of work that kind of given her and you can't just say you know we can't have any CNA were pregnant because a lot of women are CNA and a lot of childbearing age and that would reject them throw out a lot of people from employment besides the I don't understand the no case\nA lot of his presidency cases involve on some type of a leave of absence at some point and a lot of times the employee is simply not reinstate it the\nThe employer does have to reinstate the employee when they come back from the pregnancy leave and they need to to do that to a comparable position and\nIf you have pregnancy case or you have any type of employment case where someone's been fired their own a lot of wages sexual harassment\nI Would like to hear about it off air at eight seven seven five to five zero seven hundred once again eight seven seven five to five zero seven hundred for our real workplace law firm employment lawyers group\nThat eight seven seven five to five is there a seven hundred I Believe that next week we're going to have a ... episode and it may involve a bit of Los Angeles history and I have a feeling it's also going to involved and you don't work

at this time seven to eight o'clock on TALK radio seven Ninety KBC\nAnd we come up with different scenarios we scripted every week to keep it entertaining keep the jokes following the cover real workplace scenarios without having to put pregnant women through\nThe horrors of having to talk about their cases no trials and to make it much more entertaining to you and give you some\nExamples which are a little bit fanciful severe you remember them even if someone is pregnant for nine or ten months I've got to be accommodated so thank you for listening and I hope that you're listening again next Sunday this is Carl Garber of the car Gerber workplace Lehrer show on\nTalk radio seven Ninety KBC\nNah nah I don't know why\nI'm doing\nThis show British spy Harlem River and employment lawyers root\nFor nine three here the national word and five\nDollars\nThere's been bumps in by to pick\n... Los Angeles Orange County a beautiful\nStory the midterms mass and Michael I'm Evan hanging there growing bipartisan calls the whole Saudi Arabia to account for the death of journalist ... from Riyadh corresponded Sam highly reports how the kingdom story has changed\nAnd underlying learning a lot of that is this compulsive behavior exactly that people can't really cook control their compulsion and that can also be part of what these gets defined as an addiction right and a daring your thoughts\nYeah going off of that idea of compulsive behavior I Love that you know because I think a big component of addiction is when the person's mind becomes so focused on obtaining whatever their object to the obsession is that the rest of the things in their life start to fall aside and so they they end up in chaos and despair\nAnd you know oftentimes ended up in trouble financially or legally and all of that manifests out of the obsession to get the drug or or to you know you have in ways and\nRights of the drug basically takes up your\nLot of a lot of space in your yet again for the drone your whole life starts to revolve around that right and and Gary your thoughts to sort of add to our definition\nI think the panelists have covered it well or the other thing I Would add is um that addiction is a chronic and relapsing condition and so when individuals relapse is something that we talk about in the field um it's actually a nature of the condition or and so\nUm we are increasingly treating addiction as a chronic conditions similar to other health conditions such as diabetes hypertension et cetera\nBut it's actually a brain disease I mean there was actually patterns\nOr in the brain that have changed pathways that are changed because of the drug so I agree completely that this is a disease just like I treat because I'm an internist as well treat high blood pressure and diabetes are actually addiction and the same way\nAnd I want to add one of the things I like about what Jerry said\nIs a big issue for a lot of patience is a sense of shame\nThat somehow they ah they failed that went into rehab and they failed and what you're saying that this is a chronic condition is a process so it's not about judging based on one experience rehab looking at it as a lifelong process and that can help\nOr as us are cautious with the whole issue of shame a doctor asking I wanted to ask you a question you know we can you just find some of the categories of what actual prescription drugs are and sort of how what they're addictive qualities are in other words someone who's taking short a sedative ...\nShirt so there's different categories of medicine is just like you said that have the potential to be addicting they're all ... what are we call controlled substances so the first category are pain medications which are already familiar with these are the opiate category of medicine is their drugs that you're familiar with like fight it in and Percocet or even ... some people don't feel that's addictive but it can be\nAnd then of course there's harder core ones are ... patches and lollipops and other kinds of whether it's awfully fun as well yeah you could actually talk on the ...\nAre usually for cancer patients and those who are dying but are they not forgive ... exactly and then there's the category of drugs called ... their drugs that we use for anxiety disorders these are drugs like ... valley Yemen's Xanax which is highly addicting\nAre so these medicines can be used appropriately for panic attacks that are often misused\nAnd abused by patients\nAnd then we have of course the amphetamine drugs and these are drugs or that people are using for attention deficit disorder so we're talking about drugs like Ritalin and Adderall and concert on\nUm these types of medications and again uh these can be often misused and abused um let's see what else what am I missing a there's also I'm sleeping pills I'll say\nI'm you know we don't use as many of the barbiturates which are are very dangerous drugs are but those are occasionally but we still use drugs like Ambien uh ... uh and and several others in this category which can also be considered controlled substances and misused as well well\nGary let me ask you a question since you're also a psychiatrist a medical doctor for the drugs that doctor raskin mentioned or there's some that are potentially more addictive and more dangerous than others in those categories the categories you had mentioned\nSo certainly nationally the opioid epidemic his front and center and has gotten a lot of attention um\nAnd you know a lot of lives have been affected by the opioid epidemic I'm In LA county an interesting numbers that yes opioids are increasingly involved in emergency room visits hospitalizations\nBut when you look at the composition of all prescriptions in LA county\nA ... which Dr asking mentioned are actually number two opioids are number one right and so as dire as it pains or number two and so I think while a lot of attention is being paid to opioids and rightfully so that we also need to be paying attention to some of these other prescription drugs such\nAs the big problem is just to pick up on what Gary thing is that a lot of patients are using the combination of opiates with bands at as a pains and if you look at some of these deaths these overdose deaths\nAre of opiates that are often seen by in celebrities there's actually usually more than one category of these types of prescription drugs in their bloodstream upon death so they're not just taking one they're often combining these things and sometimes even with alcohol which makes it a triple combination of death\nYeah and I do want to remind our listeners the number again as one eight hundred to two to five to two two I'm going to ask my two therapists answer question why do you think this is going on from the patients that you see why do you think there's such an increase in let's say bends of diets being user opiate is we'll start with a ...\nUm well I I absolutely believe that the number that Dr ... how'd you to large amounts of bends as being number two because with the younger people that I work with um fences are rampant I'm then they'll use both in terms of\nUm you know getting doctor shopping and getting prescription after prescription and then just also just getting them off the street um and I think\nThey think it's because we have a population of young people who are highly anxious yeah I guess I mean that's where I think to to have to take a break in a moment and then I Want to get a daring opinion to talk to you more about it but I'm curious what's going on in our society what's going on in this world that we have ... and opiates well that you know are on such a high\nRise news so we're going to figure that out soon if you want to call in the numbers one eight hundred to two to five to two two I'm Dr gee we'll be back right after the

to two to five to ... you were talking about prescription drug addiction I have an amazing panel here to answer any questions you may have so the number again is one eight hundred\nTo two to five to to to\nAnd Dr fine but before the commercial I wanted to ask you a question we started to talk about it it's sort of philosophical psychological whatever he wants to call it but the sense of why\nIs there such a high use ... let's say in your own population to do to me why do you see such a high usa bends of diets ...\nWell I think it's because number one I like I said it's mostly young people that I see the high high rates of mental abuse and\nUm I think it's a combination of people having a lot of anxiety issues and of knowing that taking a Xanax is so much easier than talking about your feelings are going to therapy or telling her parents that you want to go to therapy\nUm it's so much easier to just pop Xanax and then as Dr Atkins said these are this is a highly addictive substance so and if you build a tolerance\nPredisposition which there can be whether there's some other changes that our brain pathways when trauma ... or things like a you know some traumatic event ... things happened last uh these things can change our brain and cause chemical reaction but I'd love to hear what Gary has to say\nI think the other thing is um addiction a behavioral health conditions are they are biomedical in nature they're also psychological social cultural spiritual oftentimes\nI and so that's one really important thing to consider that there is a um quote actually from a British author that says a opposite of addiction is not sobriety at the opposite of addiction social connection\nAnd so I I agree with that and I think the opposite of addiction is free will you know shoes ...\nI just wanted to say that you know a ... ... ... you know why is the catch ... and those are all good I've thought about that you were\nJust going to have to wrap it up Gary but I Hope we read it

more we had to let us on TALK radio seven Ninety KBC\nWelcome back to engaging minds with your host Dr Howard glass licensed clinical psychologist\n[noise]\nWith gauging mine we're talking about\nPrescription drug addiction epidemic\nA couple of takeaways I wanted to mention that I'm learning from my panel is how important it is if you're struggling with an addiction to find a way to make social contacts to not isolate yourself\nThat many times if you can find someone who is trust in like a therapist or a family member or someone that you care about to be able to express your emotions and feelings and the nonjudgmental way that can help a lot towards\nYou at least getting the motivation and the ability to start dealing with an addiction\nThe other thought that you're seeing from our panel is that it's a very complex a\nSituation when it comes to addiction there many factors that come into play so if you're trying to look for that one reason why you may be struggling with addiction you're better off looking at it as though it's a complex form of different uh you know reasons that come together to form an addiction\nIt might uh actually in the long run make your struggle with addiction much more\nSuccessful and then there are powerful medical and psychological reasons why you may be struggling with an addiction and I'm happy to\nA break I was talking to Darren he brought up a great concert he wanted to elaborate on it he wanted to discuss what the difference was between sobriety in recovery so darn it's all yours thank you\nUm yeah so I just thought it was important to point out the difference between the two you know sobriety you you might go into a lockdown unit or you might go into an inpatient unit and get sober and that means you know biological you're not using the drugs anymore your your system is cleaned out but when you leave there and you start to live your life\nThat's when you start to live in recovery you know and that is a long term committed day in day out process\nAnd you know through that process you really should have a minimum of five people including your primary care physician who knows absolutely everything about your whole story\nSo it's not just enough to stop using and stop the withdrawal you also have to learn how to read relate to your your life yes efforts yeah from the ground up in my book transforming the addicted mind that's what we part of the process that we help you start to do but yeah that's the whole idea it's a\nIt's an all encompassing process recovery from addiction it's not it's not a drive through it's not a one\nQuick fix it you know as you were saying earlier it's about you know relapse in recovery and then making mistakes over and over but you know what I feel\nAnd I want to hear what other people feel about this but\nIt's so many times when I deal with you I was I was dealing with someone this week who has an addiction to opiates\nAnd he said I just can't imagine not doing it I have no idea what my life would be without it and I said well you know what your life is with it and you keep repeating cycle you try to quit for a little while then you're back to it\nWhat about if we could make that journey exciting and interesting and something different and then he said well what is and I go I don't know\nBut we know what you have and finding a way to help people deal with ... they can actually make it\nNot in some ways I Want to say not so clinical but actually very exciting experience in their lives go down and say\nI think that that that is part of the difference between sobriety and recovery that sobriety Internet itself all by itself just being clean\nIsn't all that ... I mean it's good to have the stuff out of your system but it's not like oh my God my whole life is better now that I'm silver recovery is the part where it gets to be like well let's try to make this exciting and fun and maybe your life won't be exactly what it used to be maybe it'll be something even better now you know that's what\nI Know how how would you help someone Dr Rosekind who's going through that recovery phrase face from a medical standpoint\nFrom a medical standpoint there are certain medications that can help prevent relapse there are medicines that can help prevent cravings and they're also medications that can get to the root of some of the underlying reasons why they're using in the first place so if they did have\nMajor depression or other psychiatric illness we tried to treat that underlying psychiatric illness to get them on a sort of an even keel which gives it a little bit of a fair game so that they do have a chance of going out and living life\nWithout using drugs and the other thing I Do is I really encourage them to see people like two of our panelists because I think therapy is a really big component of course how are of\nCourse you've got to think about my life if you come back and I\nDo always encourage my patients that I tell them look it's not about medication in of itself but you have to involve therapy\nI've had patients you know a tell me that you know once they're clean they they actually become\nA really passionate about something new that they were unfamiliar with sometimes people will change careers because they realize they were happy in their career and that led to them going down the federal regulations yeah relationships all kinds of things right oh those are the some of the things that I Do um as a as a leader in the field\nThere's also a service and ... people just Google um S. P. A. T. aspect um you can find a list of our contract providers are with all their contact information so a really are trying to expand access to a substance you services for\nUm LA county residents and I I think\nThat's fantastic area and if people missed any of that why don't you shut up the number one more time in\nEight for for eight oh four Seventy five hundred a ... phone number for substance abuse service help\nLines and again if you want to get in touch with me Dr Howard ... live dot com I Will for all of Dr a phase a information and ah\nDarren [noise] uh yeah if you needed to get a hold of this subtle Center for recovery we have offices in West LA we have offices in Long Beach and in Newport Beach um you can just go to San ... essay and a recovery dot com and uh our publications or at ... dot com\nAnd a ... can you say that number again [laughter] so ah so the phone number is five six two three five six eight six eight six\nImportant say twice because sometimes people missing we want to make sure you've been such amazing gift that they get in touch with you and Dr fine but\nYeah I have a private practice in West LA um private practice meaning I see my clients once a week sometimes twice a week or every other week depends on the client\nUm and my number is three to three to four seven eight eight eight and I have a website where people can email me Dr Natalie find black dot com and I'll spend the last thing real quick 'cause it to use the F.

want to see a therapist first thing we can figure out if you need rehab or not\nIs not everybody does depending on what's going on I'm so again my number is three to three to four seven eight eight

now he's\nSorry I also forgot to mention in addition to seeing clients in my office I also do video sessions so for people who are maybe in LA county but not necessarily in West LA I have the capacity to see them as well\nAnd I wanted to mention something ah with this uh uh people wanted to get in touch with me regarding cook fears detox LA they'd been listening to the commercials that company has started with Dr ... or ... idea was grade individualized discreet\nA rehab and detox in the privacy of someone's home they can also reach me directly at Dr Howard gloves that lived dot com be happy to share that information\nSo what I Want another thing I Want to audience to hear how we have this amazing panels that there's so many different services available on so many different levels so many different economic abilities et cetera so in some ways I wanted to say to our audience there's no reason why you can't get the help that you need\nAnd with our final segment I like to go around and go if there's any final thoughts something you wanted to say I want to make sure that you leave and dumped said to me in the parking lot you know I Wish I would've had a moment to share that with you so again I'll go round circle Gary any final thoughts or you want to share with our audience\nSo with respect to the opioid epidemic and prescription drug abuse um I Do want folks to know that we have a a county wide coalition called safe met LA um we have a website safe metal a dot org I'm where people can learn about it or it's actually the coalition is taking a multi pronged approach to address\nThe opioid epidemic by focusing on things like\nSafe prescribing medications for addiction treatment access to the locks on which is a an opioid overdose prevention medication safe drug disposal which is important because most people who um get access to prescription drugs get access through friends or family um and and community education a similar to the session that we're having now\n[noise] yeah it's very much his community education to give it that way but uh I'm learning a lot so I Hope you are and Darren\n[noise] um yeah I think an important part would be is if you're a family member of somebody who's an addict or a if you your if the addict is in treatment that you should also be an treatment and that you should make yourself available if you're there if if the addicts therapist is recommending that you get treatment\nYou know so so to bring in the whole family at a satellite so important I couldn't agree with you more of that so many times someone will go through rehab and then they'll end up going home or going into a toxic situation\nAnd it won't last very long a Natalie songs\nYeah I mean I certainly agree with the family could plenty to talk about that one for a long time yeah we could definitely do as Dr Atkins there have to break through our show yeah I'm In regard to the prescription drug issue you know I've worked with a lot of people who\nCome into treatment I'm not I mean there are plenty of people that come in and kind of tried to rationalize it all it's not that bad like I'm not taking drugs off the street or whatever\nWas that's what I thought was my earliest statement Trump is that people will say it's not that bad my doctor gave me the\nLanguage right but I've also dealt with people who kind of felt like\nThey didn't deserve treatment as much because it's like there and it's not that bad like object to what they should you should do it on cable to do it like I'm you know I'm not I'm not the shooting up in the street like it's not that bad and I just want people to know that that they deserve treatment just as much as anybody who's addicted to quote unquote street drugs\nUm addiction is addiction and it's rooted in pain and anybody who didn't paint deserts out\nWell I think again that goes with our our our society this sense of because you're not getting them any of the prescription drug from where you may be actually but some someone on the street but you're getting from doctors somehow that makes it a little better a little cleaner but in the end really it's not no inductive\nRescue that just to pick up on that this\nThis prescription drug epidemic really comes in every flavor we we did mention of course younger people taking Xanax\nBut I even see a let's say forty year old women who they can't handle the housework\nMaking dinner picking up their kids and so they come in and they ask for ... so the ... and then they need higher doses 'cause the lower dose would just wasn't effective and then they keep increasing the dos or I see very elderly people getting more and more prescriptions for medications including pain medications and they're taking it together with sleeping pills\nBecause they can't sleep and then they keep taking more because they have more pain so again all of these people deserve help and I think our panel was really really helpful in in explaining that but I just wanted to remind people that it comes in all flavors are not just talking about the young heroin users on the street these days\nUh no no I absolutely am that a lot of times it starts off in quote a good way because your doctor prescribes to help you but then going back to what Darren was singing everyone our panel if you're not going to learn how to talk about what's going on if you're just gonna grab a pill every time you feel a little anxious\nI Know it was a therapist Madden me sometimes I just wanted to reach out some so just talk to me stop taking so many pills maybe things will get a lot better and there'll be a little bit you know less abuse\nUm so we have a couple of minutes left again or any final thoughts cares you know I Know you want to say something\nOne

of the world's population but we use\n... percent of the world to be with us so what does that say ... or ... what does that say about our society which is a whole another topic about why why why do you think that's happening\nTo me it says that the opioid epidemic is a cultural issue I uh and that um you know we had a quick fix culture and it's a lot easier to reach for pills that is to do physical therapy or exercise or lose weight or all these other things that take you know a little bit more work\nMy sister in law's in France says she just got her a tooth pulled so she went to the

Hello Jennifer\nHow are you not genocide\nHi um I just had a couple of classes I have a lot of questions but really just wanted to touch base um regarding the ability to to do something with my property and constantly going to be retiring soon and\nI thought I might have to leave LA because you just can't afford it with you know what what you have\nOn on your retirement funds and I like as as a great option um yeah I I have a garage\nBut I also was thinking if I have enough room in the in the back yard for for building is their recommendation of what what is better is something you know do the permits um ... you know are they different depending on what what you're building converting your garage or or adding something to the back\nYard and and then what happens if if the law\nIt you know is is is rescinded are retracted what happens after the fact when you still have\nA you know something felt\nOK well once you're in you're in so once you have the permits in places they can't change those and as far as you know can you put this in the garage in the apartment the open panda one bedroom apartment or can you put a guest house in the back yard all kind of depends what you want to four\nAnd um you're gonna rent it out for income is that correct\nYes that would be you know passive income\nOkay so we can look at both options and see which one makes more sense to you but\nI can do a lot of the location and the um than let's say on the line from Google us we also have a website called the Mets and\nWe have topsy profiles and also I Do that as well as as a project\nManager which I Am as well to design a he'll look and see what makes sense if you have a big enough lots and you want to put it in the back yard and we can do so but if we just want to just you know use the existing garage in ... that to a an apartment because everything it's new it's insulated us no longer garage\nIt's all inflates heads you know read got it on the floor on the ceiling you know or insulated so it's now an apartment has to feel it doesn't have to feel like had garage anymore and um we can do what ever make sense to you because well I can also say is that\nMaybe later on you might wants to move in that yourself at sea attain more income from the main property and then you can make it nice enough\nThat you wouldn't mind moving into yourself and then you can meant the main house out for maybe should pull the income that you would get in for the guest house does that make sense out of\nGas that doesn't make sense thinking\nOkay so um I think I might find said all your
