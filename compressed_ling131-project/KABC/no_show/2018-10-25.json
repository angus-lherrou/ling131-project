quotas law enforcement officials said tests have determined that a powder found inside an envelope delivered to CNN along with the pipe bomb was harmless right not in the pipe bomb right and there's a there's a difference there so we just wanted to make note of that now we don't know and but there is a question that this is uh\nThree days is what the FBI said yesterday I knows whether these relied bonds or not\n\nThey know but they have not yet all we have gotten is potentially ... potential potentially explosive device and ... and and so you you asked yourself the question not in not in we're not in conspiracy theory mode were simply why in the investigation would they not want that released well\nIt'd be you know because there are a number of theories here are possibilities as to what this could be or what the motive could be\nBehind the individuals but ah that were responsible but the the concern here is is that um or I guess the question here is whether or not they at at at any point ... whether these devices were meant to send just a message\nOr whether they were\nIntended to kill or maim individuals\nThat's a very different motives and and mission by the person responsible ... those are the questions you would be asking as an investigator mhm\nAnd so you would want to know the answer to those questions my point is if it's leaking out from law enforcement\nThe ISIS parity flag and everything else and are these selective leaks why don't we have a link yet if sources are telling these news organizations\nDifferent things the powder isn't there why isn't anybody asking the question we're the bombs why would they have gone off with a on a timer\n\nIs there an investigative reason why they would not do that but they would be leaking out other information\nYeah right I don't know the answer and I I there's there's no sense of suspicion\nThere's no conspiracy theory here these are just questions that I hadn't because it it gets to the heart of wanting to you of a I think everybody wanting to know what the motivation of the person or persons who did this what the motivation is and you don't know until\nYou know you you can't even start to to come to a a a path of possibly a path to go down to figure out why this happened unless you know whether the bombs were actually bombs or they were fake bombs mhm\n\nBecause the motivation then can be completely different right\nWhile you're looking to send a message to the people are the the the would be recipients you're also looking to send a message to the country and the world knowing full well that this would make the news\nOr the interesting thing is when you actually go through it and you look we were when you look at Fox News and others are and I did mention that the wall Street Journal said called the pipe bombs and I said no we're in there did I see a quote in the wall Street Journal\nThat said pipe bombs that were for her to the FBI or investigators talking about it and so I've seen that in many different articles and human I've gone through a ton of different uh uh uh you know news reports overnight to try to find out\nYou know of anybody of it you know throughout the night if anybody is leaking whether these were actually working live bombs that had explosive material and the detonator and a timer or whatever you would use\nIn what they claim were crude devices right 'cause we would have been told they were you know type type like bombs crude devices potentially explosive devices I don't know what potentially means\n[noise] well that's the question of you use the word potentially does that mean it wasn't armed it wasn't triggered wasn't ready to be triggered\n\nThat potentially had it been armed it would have been explosive\nI don't know\nBut the phrasing the phrasing is is is a is key by the media because we don't\nWe haven't heard and this is why we're looking for quote from people actually doing the investigation well but then fighting the FBI I I I'm I may be taking the liberty here\nBut within\nThirty seconds mhm of looking at those bombs mhm an FBI bomb expert would be able to tell you whether it was legitimately a bomb or not mhm\n\nAnd whether it was a working or live bomb so if it's three days old why don't we know\nRight\nAnd I'm asking from an investigator point of view was a reason that they wouldn't tell you because it will tip offs something to the possible suspects I don't know I I but it's very strange for three days have gone by and other things to Blake\nLike the the image of the parity image of the ISIS flag the other picture to get her done that stuff's leaking we still don't know whether it was a lie bummer lie bomb or not or lied bombs lied bomb in that case for CNN or whatever we don't know why don't we know\n\nSo because they know mhm you know the FBI knows right yes and certainly the person responsible knows now that the FBI knows right\nIf you want to get in we do have a line open eight six six
