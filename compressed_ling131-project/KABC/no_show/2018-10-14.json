open pan\nYou know something very simple that I rented was able to rent from her\nUh Eighteen hundred dollars a month Eighteen hundred dollars a month that she didn't have come in and before she met me and before the Senate bill came into effect but I was able to sit down with a window with that we had a cup of coffee and we talked about it but before I went out I was able to go online and Google us\nAnd I saw the ... the eyepiece I knew what the fight penned the flight and\nThe footprint of the house then I pulled a proxy profile and then also I thought that that the law was you know seven thousand square feet the existing house was like a two thousand square feet and then she wanted to create the garage and say four hundred square feet just the two car garage and made it a guest house\nAnd I saw all of that before I went out in addition to that I\nWas able to see what the rent soft in the area so over the last four months I thought that the rents were able she was able to attain a sheet that that is you know she was able to paint anywhere from Seventeen to two thousand dollars a month\nAnd so we rented out to a nice family um I'd say family it was just said you know a

told me Sandy I don't want to be bought that with getting them rent every single month can you help me as a property manager so I'm thinking about that but\nActually she can do it has self because it's you know something very easy to do but the tenant with a nice pen and that way of looking at getting this ... the pace because if somebody that pays the bills on time I did the um analysis on them I did a background check on them I thought that they pay the bills on time so I took that threats away from her\nAnd was able to find out the right ten as well so we have from a to Z John eight

over a decision it does it really does it's just a choice away and I I always say because I Know a lot of people are like well don't go into those little deals well either\nYou start somewhere or you just never started because right well don't save a hundred two hundred three hundred four hundred grand I mean it's not realistic you know you could you could buy your house and then you have to find the right time to sell it so you can pull out that cash instead of just keeping a house that isn't going to give you any money and you're just going to be stuck there your whole life\nWhat what was the moment oh and I know where you're going to say one was a moment you made the decision well I'm not gonna lie I was I\nAlways wanted to buy investments because you know I saw these two people left and right all the time he doesn't mortgage but I was like a little nervous to sell everything we've had in California 'cause it's income it's passive income that do nothing for management handles that

it just\nYou have to make the right move at the right time yeah and for that you need people to know what they're doing and Albert I know you were going to say something [laughter]\n[laughter]\nI was

them a math so that means in a year you'll you'll you'll make Ninety six thousand\nSo that means you can buy you could just buy a Ford unit every year that doesn't make you a thousand a thousand a thousand and then all of them are doubling in in ... in value every ten years and then like it but sometimes it's the double and five years so let's see if in five years the market goes up\nAnd they go up a lot you could sell like six or seven of those properties and then by another by a bigger one then you could start by like forty or eighty and then also you could also open up businesses and keep working you just have a lot of options\nNow if you have to wait and sell it the right time to buy the right time south right I'm watching say oh it's not a great time to buy right now\nRight now we had a recession ten years ago so right now the market is at its peak\nAnd right now you have it's not going to go up anymore like for the last three months prices have been coming down a little bit slowly and and it's scary so if you have a lot of equity you should use it now yeah be before your equity comes down to four hundred or three fifty right\nRight now you could use it and and and if you take it out and then you're like well what uh what do I do whatever the market goes really bad well now you have five hundred thousand ...\nDiscount and that's what I Would want to do I'd wanna wait

I mean you just got to go for it you got to take chances you have to make mistakes because if you're not making mistakes and you might not even be alive you know like I've always just\nGone for it just worked really hard did whatever it takes I hear so many people especially some of these younger people these days like they're so lazy and they don't want to do the dirty work well you kinda have to you know until you can afford somebody to do you know the dirty work as people would say it's paperwork whatever things that you don't want to do\nYou have to you have to and you kind of have to just take steps steps steps that you might have a little set back then you just keep going keep going keep going but so many people just kind of give up\nBut you came from a place and you know you can tell you start you want but you came from a place that people would use they'd be victims well I you know my mom didn't have any money you know there are five kids you know we lived on ten dollars a day you have every excuse in the book not to be where you are today\nThat is true that is so true I could have just said oh poor me right now but I Love money too much [laughter]\nAnd I'm not scared to work hard and in reality it's just a combination of a lot of things also like running into the right people cutting the wrong people out of my life so that I could\nGet to the next level but more than anything was servicing our clients and being able to build a data base that would allow us to scale that would allow us to grow and you know just get residual like ... residual referrals I'm thinking about\nThe joy of referral referral after a referral you know and sometimes it's hard to delegate you know customer service because I Know exactly how to do it and then to other people it's a little bit you know it's not natural it doesn't come natural but it's just providing a service to people\nThen making the right moves like buying property and then letting it sit for a year or two or three depending on the equity and selling it and then going out of state whatever it is yeah or really helping people and it always comes back\nAlbert how important is it to get the people out of your life who tell you you can't who maybe gossip to create chaos who are you know maybe not where they want to be but they're telling you how do you live your life\nYou have to put your fast is Nike run issue and like the Brent and get away even of their family members get away from them you know we I I I had to ... I have to like run away from family members you know a lot of family members I did that I did it I don't go I don't go to family gatherings\nSometimes I have to force them but we don't go to everything yeah well somebody the same story and open you know\nWhat everybody everybody just talks about negativity above problems they get drunk and they started fighting and they just come back in the state of mind that I don't want to do that\nI think everybody though feels bad when it's a family member but I'll tell you something when I did that to a few family members I said I'm done\nLiving this way you're chaotic world you're not doing anything to forward your career your life you're always upset you're depressed is is when I got a dad guys I'm done and\nI took a year and I said I Will never forget this one decision I made I said I'm going to stop hanging out I wrote letters to friends of mine to tell them why I was no longer going to hang out with them and in a loving way but you know I you know there were people having affairs there were people lying there people cheating there were people taking drugs\nAnd I said I I I I Love you but I cannot be in this world anymore I Want to be successful I Want to be happy at Wilson I took a year with that one decision\nWithin a few months I had booked a TV show and I have looked to radio shows and then it went on to make one get one of my biggest jobs ever\nAnd that was in my that was when I was twenty seven years old and I I just said enough is enough I Am done living this way and guess what most of those people rose they saw me they were angry at me for a long time for the first few months like maybe six seven months\nThen they saw what I was doing and then they stop their behavior and they rose so when you cater to the lowest common denominator when you want everybody to be your friend or you feel bad because their family members or their longtime friends you weren't going to go down with them\nThat's right yeah literally have to get tired of being tired yeah I don't know if that makes any sense well actually [noise] hard work has never been a problem of mine because I Love working and I literally love money because you need money to them you just need it gives the options gives you choices that gives you the ability to help\nPeople right yeah so at twenty five something happened that I was just like so what are you doing yeah like what do you want what are you doing what are you\nDoing like what are you doing right and not very many people can do that most people would just continue the year after year after year after year with the same story the same people and the same BS great it's so true and I was like I'm making changes and this is what I'm going to do and this is what it's going to take and that's that and I never looked back\nThat's me a twenty seven took me a little longer than you you know some people some people wait till they're in their thirties before they say enough is enough I Am so sick of living like this right so not only does it take a change in your mind set list okay I'm done with living paycheck to paycheck I'm done with worrying about money I'm\nSo look if you have a single family right now with the equity it's just sitting there it's useless\nSo when you get rid of the ... of the property you get those funds three hundred thousand two hundred five hundred and you buy a multi unit apartment you hold them for ten years or five years that we just kept him for five years and then they go up in value they almost ours adult more than doubled in four years and a half\nSo now you get that money and now that gives you options we didn't have options when we had three thousand dollars we had no options but to risk it and get a three and their property F ha three and a half percent down because that's all that's the only option we had we weren't going to save two hundred thousand dollars ... ... but getting a little property is a little piggy bank\nThat appreciates and then that helps you make three hundred two hundred five hundred thousand dollars like this\nAnd then you use that money and then you could start a business I don't know about everybody else but my dream as not having real estate my dream is taking risks and opening up a business it's going to be worth the multi multi billions of dollars it is is that they want to know what you want to do I mean do we have the mortgage guys that's good that's a record business at the our vision is\nFor for it to be worth a hundred billion and that's not her only business things to them things to
