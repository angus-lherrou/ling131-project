{"content": "Is full California's a whole is an openness that came out in two thousand Seventeen Senate bill one oh six nine to ... eight three one and we are encouraging people to take an thoughts on it because we are in a very very high meant area and we can take a botched up this Senate bill because it here\nAnd we don't know how long it's going to last John\nSo let's take a look at some of the options number one you can put a guess home on your property in other words rent that out or you can move in a family member that you want closer to you or you can convert your garage into a one bedroom apartment that has a separate entrance that you can rent out so obviously this is a great opportunity\nFor the average homeowner just start generating monthly income without getting a second or third job you know we've heard so many people say that they haven't said enough for retirement they have a lot of debt they don't have enough cash but they have a lot of equity in their

much and um we've been trying to find a duplex to see if we could get something like that to create some sort of rental income on the side but\nThere's just nothing in our price range so we're looking at single family homes now and once I heard of this uh offer that you're mentioning I thought to myself you know this will be another opportunity to have some rental income come in to help us with the mortgage payment right now I'm the only a breadwinner of the family and I need to\nFind a way to generate some more money um how soon after getting a house could I start something like this\nWell to the Senate and there's no time frame that you know once you have to prop team we come out and assess the situation and we're able to put everything in place feeling get it done pretty fast\nAnd I think that's great for site that you haven't because if you can use the rent to pay for the primary mortgage\nI mean and now you've just your expenses and you're able to pay for that the mortgage that you're going to attain sell it that's a great idea and people are doing that all the time people call us all the time they said what savvy home when it's a ... on a single family like you are now becoming an investment on your own property and that's amazing\nYeah we're we're really excited about moving into a house but we also know that uh you know having an extra form of income would definitely be a big plus for us uh Woodson number again ... how can I reach you guys\nAll right here's a number a three three the number four dream life that's a three three\nFor three seven thirty to sixty five eight three three for three seven thirty to sixty five Dave thanks for the call and we're ... to have a great weekend angry she listening\nAll right we're talking about this new California law that allows homeowners to fully take advantage of their existing property and I know a lot of people say they want to move out of California is getting too expensive and the traffic is what it is but I imagine so utilizing your current property either moving into a smaller guest house on your property\nAnd renting out your larger home\nThat is possible thanks to a new California law and Sandy and her team of construction and design professionals specialize in constructing these guess homes and converting garages legally\nInto a living space that you can rent out so imagine generating an extra Fifteen hundred dollars a month two thousand dollars a month twenty five hundred dollars a month and imagine having that income coming in on a steady basis for the rest of your life\nImagine how that could supplement your Social Security imagine how that could change your financial future by having that residual income coming in so folks you don't necessarily have to take a second or third job\nYou just have to be smarter with your current real estate holdings\nSo Sandy let's talk about that because I think a lot of people have no idea that they can actually do\nThis and it can be done and that's why we have to show when we tell people if the dream life to be able to take a thoughts of what you already have and use it for potential\nAnd that's why the Senate bill if the game change it because now we're able to help people that\nHave homes to take a ... at the Senate bill and pull ... home a small portion vent out this new living space\nAnd be able to get pass an income and lift the dream life you know I mentioned to me the other day and he said Sandy and now what you have public just saved me from losing my house now I have an expert in the house and I didn't know I could take the ... you know use it to do this construction he said you know every month he's struggling so this actually save them from foreclosure John well and that's a game\nChanger because I think when when people are in a financial jam they don't know what to do they know what today until someone like you a professional can show them how to utilize their current assets and I think most people don't even realize Sandy the options that they have and when you go out to a location\nDo the measurements show them their options to floor plans suddenly they're probably saying themselves wow this is going to solve my financial problems that are mixed variance he now and possibly in the future\nYeah they say Sandy a godsend because I didn't know how it's going to make things work for myself\nAnd my family and every single month I'm struggling so I'd help people that just wanted to get more space I helped to lady that\nShe was actually a senior and she didn't know how she can do that since she was able to get a mortgage she pulled out some money out of the home and we did the construction and now she has more money coming in she didn't have ... so now she has income on top of that so ... so don't need to get a second job donate to move\nOut of state being in fact on your own property take a bunch of what you already own because he was hot blood sweat and tears you dead and you got this property now use it to his full potential and every single month for the rest of your life and matching making two thousand\nTwenty five hundred and ... values increased ... meant stop John at the same time so take advantage of property by increased says you on the seat a monthly income and\nYou can lift the dream life with everybody else that's being savvy and it's called asked to take a box of this opposition to the Senate bill that we do not know how long it's going to last week we just don't know can be gone tomorrow right John calling us before that happens\nSo folks if you're

much\nMore on the Los Angeles county cumulus station\nTo seat Brett Kavanaugh on the United States Supreme court\n[noise]\nThat was before the confirmation vote and this was the scene inside the Senate chamber as the voting began\nAnd what the market crashed I did too right I was like every other person out there in the mortgage business driving the nice car\nHouses lifestyle all that stuff but at the same time living paycheck to paycheck so I did not have I wasn't educated right right I didn't know okay so if you make some money invested in real estate\nI was investing in real estate but if I made eighty thousand a hundred thousand on a property I Would also spend it\nSo now of course what's changed with me is I Want to say most of the money I make goes into investing roasting\nWhy is that I think that\nI don't want to be the typical person and real estate that's going to be sixty Seventy years old chasing that next paycheck\nSure because ... you write who does right there so many people that have to work they they want to retire by sixty five they'd like to retire but they can't they have no investments they have I mean their savings is very little if any\nAnd who wants to keep working but if you do what's right with your money now investing like you do like Albert does like most of the people at driven do um you have a future that security you're not constantly worrying about money absolutely\nSo now you invest in real estate so when you started you didn't have a whole lot of money\nNo I I just started investing in real estate wisely only\nMaybe like three years ago and I say wisely because before it was like you know you buy a house or like Oreo hold onto it for six months to make a hundred grand and blow it but I started resting wisely interest only three years ago with the single family residents\nRight away I bought a two unit I sold those then I bought a nine unit six unit and right now I'm In the midst of a maybe buying a

five eight eight zero nine to Albert if I were and Sylvia fire somebody and listen to the show right now and I called you guys\nWhat's your life what would you say\nI Will tell you before you get married\nBut by for you know property and use the ha loan program and if you if even if you want to get married or if you're a boyfriend wants to get married with you you tell them I'm not going to get married with you\nUntil you buy your own for UNICEF ha and I buy my for UNICEF ha so I Would sell that house and then I Would get that money and keep it\nAnd then I Would get I Would buy a four units ha cause you qualify being single and then your boyfriend could buy for unit essay Jay 'cause he's single if you get married and then you no longer qualify for two of them\nSo when you're married you can only get one ... one for unit fighting in whatever one property for three and a half percent down you're not married then you can get to\nYes so you could get I mean you could you could afford it is okay and your boyfriend to get a four unit right your fiance or your boyfriend\nBut if you get married before and now you only qualify for one single family homes for us because now you're a married couple\nSo what do you have to get divorced hold off on the wedding yeah there you know you get more units essay jade only three and a half percent so you leverage and and the property is going to I mean it's going to get paid by the attendance right now your boyfriend gets another four unit\nAnd then you get married because then you have no other option but to put twenty five percent down and then you just keep those eight minutes for ten years they've doubled and then they doubled in price in ten years and ...\nAnd then you become millionaires just by just by what part time job\nJust with a part time job and three and a half percent down and there are on the outskirts of Los Angeles places you can buy from very little money down yes very little little yeah\nAnd would you guys is if I called and said hey I Am looking to do that and looking to maybe save some money up and put money down on a four unit property now you guys could then helped me with that as well yes well you just get pre approved there's uh\nA process we have to follow after that happens you know we identify where you are then we just give you a plan you know and as long as you follow through which means that could take six months it could take sometimes is credited issue sometimes there's too much debt to income\n... every ... seriously I Want to see that every single alone is different from we're all different where all have different live different bills to pay so\nSo I may have to clean up you know some debt or I mean I have to do a little more savings but pretty much you said that people can qualify with what five eighty credit scores like or little maybe a little bit higher by ... properties because the banks knows that it's going to be paid ... ... it's\nEasier to qualify for a for you know than for a single family\nIt's incredible all your bike or those even those lower obviously lower ... grams they'll probably get a little bit of a not so great right but it still can be done six forty five oh that is for us ha okay I've even six\nWhen you go lower what slows me like what you've done we'll\nProbably be yes I Want to loan five eighty and that was with three and a half percent down so the lower your credit ... anything under six twenty uh rates can be a little bit higher mustard gas or they're going to cap you\nOn on how much profit right of course I because it's it's more of a risk to the bank but if you are in a multi unit property it's less of a risk\nRight because then you have people paying off your mortgage they know it's not just you responsible for it you actually have renters not only paying you rent and and you're making money every month but you're marketed staff mhm you're paying they're paying your mortgage down for you you don't have a mortgage payment such a smarter decision than buying I'm\nA single family homes and you know what a lot of people are I mean right now is they're selling their homes and getting all the profit and buying a multi ended apartments\nSo ... has a lot of those deals going on and and then sort of way but they could reach out to Willie in Pasadena off as a gift you're in the in in an over the closer to that area\nPasadena Glendale area um we'd have the office over there and he has a strong team I think he has like the fourteen people Fifteen people in an office\nBut if they just called December that I'm getting I'm getting I Want to do when they can always ask for his office you can always ask if you're in Pasadena feared that way\nJust you know ask for Willie and they'll transfer you so the number if you're listening to the show right now\nAnd you want to start living a better life happier life why because you're not worried about finances all the time how horrible is that to worry about retirement to worry about your kid's college to worry if you're going to pay people to pay your mortgage or your rent\nYou know what about food or medication or if something goes wrong and you have hospital bills but\nThat's not really life you know not life it's worried things I ... that's going to make you sick and it's going to affect your relationship your marriage your kids yeah how about being financially sound that the way better life to live and you can achieve that\nYou can achieve that Albert and Sylvia can show you how and so can lily who's in the Pasadena office and you can call three one oh six two five eight eight zero nine I Know you're probably drive into like dinner or a club right now\nYou know and wasting our money on on certain things when you can be investing it so you have eight and amazing future ahead and maybe in a year from now your life is totally different\nDoesn't that sound great you know he went out it doesn't during without six two five eight eight zero nine it's the mortgage guys\nAnd I have tons of clients that perhaps they don't qualify because of many reasons and they say just tell me what I Need to do right because me and my family are committed\nAnd so that's something if you're listening you can call the mortgage guys and said what what do I need to do they're going to lay out a plan for you literally a plant as step by step plan you don't need to know math\nYou don't need to know where to look and what what to do and how to find and you don't need that you just need to know the step by step plan on how to get your first investment property they're going to say everything it really isn't hard folks it just takes that commitment like willy was saying just takes and and this is with Silvia says all the time\nIt's a decision that's all it is yeah it's a decision\nWell a totally different life is literally one decision away\nIt won't be easy but it will definitely be worth it\nAnd it takes a lot you know you have to tweak so many different things like the people you hang out with the choices that you make you know it's kinda like you want to have abs but you want to eat French fries and it's all day like it's not rocket science can have some good [laughter] you know but really you know and so\nI I see a lot of people like I Can't lose weight and I'm like you're eating candy drinking ... um so it all day eating chips and I'm Talking on a daily yeah like you're not going to lose weight I find it does that and I still don't like I don't\nEven want to hear it anymore [laughter] I I have a friend who does that I eat clean and this is the ... thing I eat clean and she's eating French fries as she says it\nAnd who well this is Jeff now but the notice every couple of dates every time I see every uh well it's it's special we're going out and then and this is why you you don't and it's\nJust talking about it I don't care I'm going to love you wait you know whether it's three hundred pounds two hundred pounds a hundred ... I don't care\nJust stop lying to yourself agreed you know and and that's the way that to me with your finances stop blind yourself about your friends\nGosh I cannot tell you I I had to says a while ago but I Want to change my life and I remember writing letters to some of my friends and telling them I Can't hang out with him anymore\nBecause I I don't feel better about it I did I sit in and every time you asked me for advice I spend hours with you on the phone and you go and do the same thing and they don't you come back and you you say well\nDoes it look what happened to me and I talked to I Can't do that every morning yeah because we have our own lives to work yeah with [laughter] yeah we all have our own issues right now you have somebody who's constantly draining or somebody who's always in chaos or somebody who's always in trouble or something\nYou know what they're going to figure it out I Love you but I'm enough stop draining you are an energy the empire get away from me let me tell you something I did that and I watched people either rise up and say wow I Want what you have whatever you did I watched you do that I\nGave you ask for it but look at where you're at now I Want that and then some people just ... just say I'm sad yeah they do whatever and and I'm done with that but the people who rose up happier lives better relationships and we did it\nBut it took a commitment it took me to make a decision with I'm not going to lead live a mediocre life anymore I'm done with this yeah yeah so it is a decision and it is a bit scary for people it does it change\nYeah it is one thing that comes to mind right now is\nHow being surrounded by the right people is important yeah there's some clients that come to us and see someone told me it's not a good time to buy [laughter] someone told me the race are too high and one told me you should be charging me five hundred dollars less\nMy question to them every single time is how success for the ... properties to them right on [laughter] that's right I could act natural you have to be really selective who you're getting your advice for\nSo many people say that to me well what I don't have this I Can't do that I Can't well somebody told me that some ... exactly what who's telling you this\nYou're on our I call it the armchair quarterback they sit back and their chair and they just they do allow ... commands when they're not doing anything with our lives why are you listening to somebody who is not successful\nWhy misery loves company that is true and there's some people who will just be there forever and there's nothing you can do no matter what how you tell them or talk sense into them or whatever I have a friend who I begged not to sell her house in a Las Vegas that was giving her almost Fifteen hundred dollars a month and this was\nUm during the crash sound a little to do I I my house has gone down I I Need to get rid of it I never why are you getting rid of it you're

Senate approves capital bump hale heads to North Korea on them hanging\nSkin term [noise] there are\nFor many people the first time you even hear the phrase fatty liver is when the doctor tells them they have it and that's much too late by then you're already at risk for and may even already have conditions such as diabetes\nThat's why it's essential to slash or risk now and that means giving up sugar sweetened drinks in addition limit off\nDoes it added sugar in your diet and of course limit your uncle Hal to only an occasional drink so then you know\nThat's really cool and you know the the soda pop there's other issues too where are their study that come out where I'm the karma color and soda pops can be I I Believe can our immune suppressive affects there's\nThere's so many bad things associate soda pop you know the ... that 'cause it's phosphorus and foster says a dialect or direct\nBiochemical linked calcium the phosphorus then can can leach calcium out of the body so just having that false workouts that can be a problem\nSo you know in our house we try and really our kids really drink very little they you know it's something they they never drink soda pop you know we got to a restaurant or whatever but\nIt's pretty rare and certainly isn't anything we would do you know daily or anything like that and so just you really want to be careful and if you're going to drink sugary drinks I Would I Would kind of stay away from the carbonated drinks because those typically you have the calcium issue that sort of coupled with the sugar issue\nSo bottom line at the other day drinking purified water is the best\nLiquid you can consume so I'm\nNow rank isn't there something else that sugar continue to body\nWell and it's really interesting I I learned this back in gosh like probably the late eighties early nineties from the ... work with\nBut he used to used to tell me had all these studies he tout and he'd say you know back in Loma Linda university back in the seventies they had to say they did on something called the bag goes psychotic index which I'm kinda like okay what's that\n... says one form of white cells in your body so you know when you get sick you're body your body mobilize as the white cells to attack whatever is making you sick whether it be bacterial virus or whatever\nAnd so these white cells are very active in your body all the time but then when you're sick they're they're additionally active to fight the illness\nWell when you consume sugar they did a study where this fad goes psychotic index they created an index and it was an index of what your wife activity is\nAnd what it showed when you consume sugar you're white so activity dropped below a level where you are susceptible to infection so it meant you know normally you are not that susceptible to affection infection\nBut then when you consume sugar you become very susceptible to infection and so people on sale when you're sick take vitamin C. what a big benefit with vitamin C. is that you need to take it for you get sick because what vitamin C. does is it keeps your wife activities up\nWhat they found is that when people consume sugar and they took vitamin C. that I guess our topic index did not drop so just sugar alone it drops with vitamin C. uh does not drop\nAnd then we'll say what about fruit while in God's great wisdom most fruit has some level of vitamin C. that accompanies the sugar in the fruit so you're naturally getting to see\nWith it but when you drink soda pop things like that they don't add is ... ... square made during Florence residency in their generally speaking and if even if they did it would be such a minute amount\nSo what I Try and do as a secondary issue\nConsuming vitamin C. morning and night\nAnd the blood retention time on vitamin C. is usually about four hours it could be a little bit longer so really in an ideal scenario you consume vitamin C. breakfast lunch and dinner but we actually use a form of vitamin C. and are multi vitamins called pure way see which actually has blood retention I met with what was it\nAn hour and twelve hours you can do to fight today and he had it in your system you know you've got\nThe whole day card you know so and so we did we change all the vitamin C in her motives to pure way see because that blood returns time is so important and uh and then eventually I Want to come out with a with a pure way vitamin C. by itself we're working on that so so so don't send me for that I'm working on it but it's something\nI really want a male and whole new development so that's the thing where you know as a company for a living breathing organisms so that means that as\nTechnology and or you know if there's advancements in nutrition in our industry like if there is really good research than we we we move in that direction so we can offer you better forms of nutrients has become available so you know it it we don't just say stagnant on just jazz or you\nKnow yeah and there's always new research is coming out and one of the things the reason I haven't done this yet is\nJust doing vitamin C. alone that's great but then if you put ... acid vitamin C ... that is now shown to do you know it's known to recycle vitamin C. invited me so basically repo ten sheets it out of his breaking down well then in the awful like poet said world\nThere's something called standard off like focus it which is a raise every scenic mixture it means is ... and are awful I pulled together but the are off like poke ass it according to the Linus Pauling Institute\nThe father of vitamin C. research\nUh the are as the superior form so I really want to put the are off like puck but that's a much more difficult raw material to obtain\nSo it's kind of work in progress but we make this vitamin C. product by itself it's going to be a great product where he'd say good morning and I and you have your fabulous I taught index would be at the optimal level twenty four hours a day which is what I Want 'cause I don't want to get sick and I don't think you guys do either so anyway\nThere you go out and do with that we're definitely out of time so we'll be right back [noise]\nAre you feeling exhausted

they're\nEverybody's thinking okay so I Need to go to the gym and put in my thirty five or forty five or an hour into the gym because that's what I Need to do no no no listen to this just two minutes two minutes\nA hundred and twenty seconds is all you need\nAs long as it's high intensity exercise it's as good as thirty minutes of moderate work out that's one of those new study finds but this isn't the only time I've read that or just in a few minutes a couple of minutes of exercise as hard as you can go\nCan or may be just good enough as a longer\nWork out at least at a cellular level a new study suggests and this is another one to add to the pilot studies if your usual exercise\nOr your usual ex huge for skipping exercise workouts is that you just don't have enough time well you'd better find a new excuse because\nOh you need is two minutes two minutes ... seconds will that work for you\nTo prevent major catastrophic problems\nHeart disease some forms of cancer obesity thyroid problem all bunch of things physical activity has nearly limitless health benefits everybody knows that right including helping to create a news cellular powerhouse in every cell in your body and conditioning the old ones\nResearchers at Victoria University in Australia found that just two minutes a hundred and twenty seconds of sprinting on a bicycle but I think you could do this on an elliptical to where you're moving upper and lower body which is best\nAs just as good for the study participants as a slower thirty minute ride\nFaster doing for thirty seconds cycling sprints will get you the same cellular benefits is thirty minutes of writing at a slower pace\nThe first rule of exercises obviously just do it right but Americans are working longer than ever more\nThan residents of other in most other developed countries and getting exercise can just feel like another time commitment we don't have room for and our calendar or a day's schedule\nTwo minutes that's all you need two minutes however isn't that much to ask is it\nDoes take enough time to keep your body going stronger longer just two minutes but you gotta go fast it's got to go boom and you don't want to do it if you're out of shape build up to get some uh training by an exercise physiologist or a trainer most of us look in the air\nOr look at the scale to get a sense of how effective are workout routines are but scientists on the other hand look at ourselves that's where the object of evidence lies\nAnd as we age those little powerhouses in our cells called mitochondria the Oregon Health that churn out energy\nFor a cells slow down and gradually producing less and less energy so we start to slow down too\nBut\nExercising especially rigorous exercise reinvigorate shows little powerhouse cells those mitochondria\nAnd the new research suggests that\nMay even have a faster and more efficient effect than exercising longer at a slower pace what's more physical activity also seems to signal mitochondria to replicate themselves more creating more energy sources for themselves so\nYou get out of what you put in as well if this is about you report you so at all of that it may not take much exercise to reap the benefits as long as you go\nAll out for just two minutes a hundred and twenty seconds\nAnd do that in four\nLittle sessions maybe thirty seconds sprints four times that get you
