America still represents the world and the promise of freedom\nAnd liberty and everything you want to talk about that so we we we have to recognize that because that that applies to places like Mexico and elsewhere just because they could walk in doesn't give them any more right to stay here than people who may be waiting ten years to get into the country\n[laughter] exactly yeah and that's you know again again going back to your initial question we support legal immigration we obviously support people coming through the legal channel mock coming here legally but we also support\nControls the legal immigration system you know you go back at you look throughout American history we had the great wave at the end of a an of a\nNineteen century the turn of the century but really that was a different time I mean when you go back and you look at that America was rapidly\nExpanding we weren't moving westward we were in the middle of ... or building building roads and and and ah\nYou know railroad tracks in the country was just expanding so quickly I think that's what I saw was that GDP was doubling basically every three years in the United states um but we were bringing people in at a rate of about nine hundred\nThousand to a million per year over the last Fifteen to Twenty years we've been bringing people in ... at roughly the same rate even a little bit higher this past year fiscal you're twenty Seventeen we bought at one point when ... bought our economy is not expanding as quickly as it was during the great wave but if you go back and you look at the time\nBetween the end of World War two and and really Nineteen Ninety as one at all change or you look at that time period and max the time or the country built the strongest\nMost stable middle class that that the world has ever seen before and the average immigration rate during that time period was about three hundred and fifty thousand so again we'd like to reduce legal immigration from its current level of about one point one million down to you know at least five hundred\nThousand and and just and just see\nYou know what kind of an impact would it have on our economy will leave it would have a positive impact not just on our economy on wages we think we would see wages go up here in the United states\nMay somebody's in unions and the left the don't support you and that is the least what do you think of people like in ... just we should take a pause in legal immigration to get this thing fix than straightened out [noise]\nYeah there there have been a lot of suggestions like that throughout\nThroughout the years and it's in the early Nineteen nineties I said it all changed around Nineteen Ninety there was the immigration act Nineteen Ninety that really exploded\nLegal immigration to a point that we're at now and in the early nineties when we saw the ramping up of legal immigration sauce go from bringing in roughly four or five hundred thousand people or is your during the\nThe the Nineteen eighties to more than a million ... here in the early nineties area we'd do as a representative at the time before he moved over to the Senate became Senate majority leader he actually introduced a bill that calls for an immigration or you know he actually said Democrats calling\nFrom ... to we actually as an organization called for an immigration oratory him back in two thousand nine when the stock market crashed and and we had the huge jobs crisis we have millions of people losing their jobs every couple of months or so we didn't think it was wise policy deeper gr\nBringing in more than a hundred and fifty thousand workers every single unplanned\nWhen a million Americans or jackets and it just makes sense to us\nSo we called for a while back that now under current circumstances you know the economy's doing pretty well we're creating strong number of jobs about a hundred and fifty thousand jobs per month but again if we're bringing more than a hundred and fifty thousand you foreign workers every single month for still bringing in more foreign workers and the economy is creating for jobs\nSo I don't think we need a fault tore him but again I think I think if we made some changes like like what ... ... and David produce suggested in\nThe White House has mentioned entertain migration and that the visa lottery that would at least reduce legal immigration by about three to four hundred thousand I think that would have a huge impact I don't know for necessarily at a point\nWhere we need a full are torn am but certainly I think if you side getting at other jobs crisis like we had about ten years ago rather than a moratorium should be considered\nIt is interesting to hear you talking about Harry Reid the changing but he wasn't the only one Hillary whoever you want to mention and the American public needs to hear this maybe some of your your decision or other political leaders that these guys are all on the other side they did you do with the wind when it benefits them politically or power was\nYeah and in fact that the immigration act of Nineteen Ninety part of that that there was a lot of concern in that it would have the actual impact that it did and that that's exploding legal immigration up to one point she won't more than one million new legal immigrants per year so one of the things that they they\nAdded into the legislation was that after a few years there will be a bipartisan congressional commission that would review the impacts of the legislation and make recommendations based on what was happening after passage of a law so that led to Bill Clinton is\nObviously a Democrat created this bipartisan commission it Nineteen nineties any assigned Barbara Jordan the former and and nobody would accused Barbara Jordan in ... and her democratic regret credentials as the chairwoman of of that bipartisan congressional commission and the Jordan commission recommended or\nWhat what we we advocate for today it is it called for ending chain migration and ending abuse a lottery and reducing legal immigration to their recommendation was to reduce it down to about five hundred fifty thousand which at that time the current level was about a million which is around where it's at today so so there was bipartisan support for this\nBut you had a huge push over the years especially in the early years in the in the mid to late nineties you had a huge\nCrush on big business U.S Chamber of commerce groups like that that that always want more workers because they look at us as as a a a\nSupply and demand issue if you have a large pool of labor than you can keep wages lower it's just simple again price supply and demand type type dairy um\nSo you have the big business groups\nPushing for more
