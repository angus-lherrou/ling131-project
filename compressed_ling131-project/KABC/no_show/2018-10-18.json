up we have in Massachusetts a flat\nRate income tax but five and a quarter or ... or it's in the constitution a number of states have flat rate Illinois that's\nA nice states have a flat ribs Iraq and uh what we find is if you are at a flat rate people think it's fair and they don't want to move away from it\nOr I was always told as a kid everybody agrees whichever progressive graduated income tax or some people pay ten percent two percent state taxes a federal taxes you know go to if tend to almost forty percent or\nIf you tax everyone at the same way it keeps the tax rate low for everybody in Massachusetts five times the Democrats liberals\nLet's go to a graduated tax and you know divide people into five or ten groups in tax with different lights and there's a very sophisticated discussion
