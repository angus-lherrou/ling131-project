fresh and wonderful voice almost want to have Emily on\nA couple of times a year and just play this so anyone going through the ... of a wedding planned can just maybe just ditch it talked about uh your first impressions when you heard this\nWell it is refreshing that the key word there because so many Koppel get tied up and not literally about planning a wedding that is there to you know maybe it than a dream of somebody for a long time but\nUltimately when that wedding is done and they're spending an average at thirty five thousand on a wedding now in America I'm\nOn a second you said thirty five thousand is the average\nYes that's the advocate does include our biggest city like New York at Seventy eight Chicago at sixty and LA at forty four but you know the reality is most couples are standing around it hadn't grants\nThat isn't the goal but for some folks how huge stretch and a couple that are having two hundred or so that is a big responsibility and let me tell you one that's done in the honeymoon is over\nYour reality is going to sat in on this is a commitment I Know for the rest of my life and what do I have to shop and letting them pictures some great memory absolutely those are all things that are important but what did he do\nThat's and that's that you had or back at the starting line of your marriage and and\nYou know coming into the marriage this first crisis point I actually think the wedding is the first crisis point\nAnd so if you to learn how to negotiate through that crisis point my wife and I did it fast like this we did a cheap\nBecause we just we are not encouraging debt to go into the future of our life as you as we've talked about the finances is one of the key streams on a marriage\nWhat a crazy weather and what a crazy precedent set for your marriage how are you going to handle all the crisis point the first house comes up you want to keep up with the Joneses you get a house you can't afford so on and so forth\nSo talk about as marriage coach how this is an opportunity for a good coach or to come between a couple and have them think about the long view of marriage and these other crisis financial points would come from a car to our house\nAnd to vacations where and how we spend our money on those three things to me to lead to financial ruin or the financial health than we know what happens to marriages that are financially healthy they have a better shot\nYeah they do and that you're on the same page for those things so I'm going to challenge folks that are listening to hate yes habit designer wedding one that fits your pocketbook your lifestyle and your goals that's an important lesson\nBut also have a designer marriage so many people go into the act of getting married that they don't consider how their relationship stages that and really no one where the other person is that when you make that let's face it business decision for life\nYou would not go into a partnership with the business without checking out the other person's motive and goals first\nAnd then no one that other per person is at in that you're on the same page why would you go into a lifelong commitment for marriage and not check things out I Believe it a lot of people that have a great great love for each other that don't take the time to do the double checks\nBefore they walk down the aisle and don't you want to know that you know that you know why you're marrying the person the good the bad and the ugly the things that really helps us identify none of us are perfect\nBut I Am willing and ready to make that commitment to that individual come hell or high water\nBecause this is my person that I'm going to a team with for the rest of my life and I love this person\nLet's not forget about that the second you throw the wedding ring engagement ring on sorry on your finger is the second most couples turn off the relationship building power and go into action and all I got to get this thing and this and this and you'll see it with a lot of brides they just go into the zone sometimes with their\nTheir mothers that they just get so involved in the wedding they forget about the relationship\nThey come to the day and that Brian is on one end of the aisle or the you know wherever you're getting married at it and the rooms of the other\nAnd she's going or he's going oh my gosh I Hope this works\nAnd if you think you're thinking that right now in your planning your wedding you need to stop and make sure you have a coach that can come along side you and to some of that pre marital poaching that is so so important I always say prepare and rich is one of the number one ways in thirty minutes\nThat you can find out where your strength areas are and what your challenge areas are so you as a couple can go through this lesson plan of six weeks and know where you're at", "show_name": "no_show", "station": "KABC", "day": "13", "city": "Los Angeles", "state": "CA", "month": "10", "year": "2018"}
