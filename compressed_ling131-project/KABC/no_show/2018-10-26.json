report\nGiven the the the nature of of of security cameras and how many there are right now in our society or if they know where the facility is than than certainly they may have at least a description as early as even this morning and then by the end of the day who knows maybe and I doubt\nYou know that's that's a one thing you come to realize that if you walk into any post office

through the cameras and people have been caught already on the cameras but there are cameras everywhere\nThese days and it depends on a lot easier to be caught short and it depends I I guess the the

who did it or another foreign influence I sought Chuck Todd saying he was\nAfraid that might be the Russians because the Russians again got exactly what they a moderate with the American public which is the American public at each other's throat again ... uh I'm paraphrasing he didn't actually don't use those words and as we said actually we don't need the Russians to do it [laughter] yeah it does yeah everybody knows you don't need the Russians do\nTo do that but again it's a is this somebody who is a bad bomb maker\nIs this somebody who uh you know decided to uh send it because he is a supporter\nA of a more of the of of the right wing\nAnd and uh you know just hates everybody on the left ... uh and it's just a bad bomb maker or is it somebody who\nUh you know again sent it from the left as a false flag or in order to make it seem like it was\nSomebody who was doing that now we know the fake uh hate crimes that exist remember after the the the president was elected and\nRemember all the fake hate crimes that happened the ... got national news and I believe almost every single one of them was fake ... all the huge stories that came out about\nA ... hate crimes from Trump supporters ended up being fake right and so we know people will ah will do it look we look at the Capitol and the fat Grassley going after and say look\n... and sweating to glide mhm we're going out to where we are I Believe we should prosecute them because I Believe that they they lied what is the extent that people will do it we don't know I mean we're we're we're\nWe are in New territory as to people willing to become sacrificial lambs ... and ... and I think it's\nImportant to look at the uh dynamics of either possibility politically like if it's somebody who supports Trump or the dynamics of that the ultimately it potentially could hurt Republicans in Trump if it is if it's found that it is someone that support strong\nAgain potentially at but it's you look at the other side being the false flag\nOr being someone who is liberal and sending it out\nAnd is doing it in an effort to make the the uh the the administration Republicans in general uh but but you I think you have to look at it certainly a Trump himself especially look bad that would be the the attempt right\nIt's depending on who the person is it's likely not going to do I guess politically much damage one way or the other except for the fact that you add I think on the left the behavior on the left here recently\nWhen you have Maxine Waters getting their face every opportunity you have the uh Ted Cruz being shouted out of a restaurant you have Hillary Clinton saying we can't be civil civil with the other side until we went in central and that's what she said it's impossible to\nBe so we we play these individually played Michael Moore from yesterday on MSNBC when asked should we toned down the rhetoric he says no on our side we have to wrap it up for it\nSo uh you\nKnow and plus we also must consider the mentally unstable person and ... somebody who was just doing it and\nReally not even thinking politically but it's clearly that there's some kind of political aspect to it but not putting as much thought as we might think into it\nWe're not going to stop mhm as it as a nation of free speech stopped going to stop you know just over but he knows didn't stop\nOr after the attempted assassination of Republican congressmen on a baseball field or did as it ratcheted up\nIn a way it or we go to the Michael Moore comment that we played earlier whereas on MSNBC with everything going on as a time to ratchet it now it's time for our side to wrap it up so\nIt's not it's not going to stop it doesn't stop in a society that has free speech\nLike we have it isn't clear now you need to pointed out you also have to understand why people use it mhm and that's why we have stayed in and we we spend a lot of time this week saying that I don't want people that have great with my position to be using that type of rhetoric right why\nNumber one I don't believe it's the right thing to do ... number two they do use it because they need to do it they had no other outlet\nThey don't have the substance of the ideas of with them they have to do it they feel they need to do it because they don't believe that they can convince anybody any other way except tub threatened them and intimidate them we don't need to do that when I say we\nAre I mean people that believe in the conservative philosophy you don't need to do that no no you can when you can win them over with logic and common sense the reason that a Claire McCaskill says she's separating herself from the crazy Democrats\n\nIs because she realizes that ... I've got to come across as somebody who is a common sense critical thinking person because that's what will attract you know the the the the people out there if I Pretend that high of critical thinking person and don't align myself with the crazy Democrats than people are more likely to accept\nMe that's how you get the independence as we said you're not going to convince you're not going to convince\nA loyal Republican devout Democrat you're not going to convince a loyal Democrat to vote Republican it's those people in the middle that you are trying to get the Democrats believe the only way to get them is to intimidate them with fear\nWe don't as conservatives we don't need they need to do it because they have no other and I'm coming from their point of view ... they need to do it because they can't back up the ideas\nRight I I think it will be interesting to see what happens the developments you and I've been watching and monitoring the uh\nThe uh uh all the news agencies overnight a and to see if there's any movement there with this new focus on Florida and and the possibility that the ... in terms of the authorities believing that at least some of these packages were sent through a a post office there in Florida\nIn the in the coming hours I think ... and over the weekend or possibly you're going to see this this story kind of play out once the authorities again once they find that location they won't be long before we were on the identity and and again that could be as soon as today\nA or at least have a description of the person then after that assuming that the person is is a is captured in and and taken into custody of live it's quite possible we could learn a lot more about the motivation of the person even if they aren't taken alive\nIf we learn the identity often do you go to their social media page or something like this and you see a history of maybe comments that were made and you can see their political affiliation but if we learn that motivation I don't know what changes about the election right now because you look at the bigger things right um\nThey I think the Kavanaugh thing the the the care of an situation or immigration in

see in the Senate right now yeah I saw hold it was about what one the last poll yeah I think\nSo here it is Claire McCaskill's latest at\nCapital ... that's not and I approve this nothing what do you

during all those town hall or Colorado afraid to stand up against their own party and Claire not one of those Democrats who were\n... not one of those crazy leading Democrats and we would look we've ... and set it you know ... of course we laughed\nAbout besides just laughing there is a serious side to this is a side that this was a Senate race so it means they're doing polling research like you can imagine you have to try to find out how to get the edge this was a dead heat how do we get those undecided independents that you know that\nSeemed to be leaning more conservative ...\nAh right now how do we get them to lean my way separate myself from not ah the extreme portion of my party or even the leadership it's the crazy Democrats an error picked up on this yesterday when you said\nIt's using the word crazy Democrat that using that term means that the feedback that Claire McCaskill\nIs getting we fear that you're one of those crazy Democrats which comes right from the Kavanaugh hearings I Believe it and if\nYou look at the the it's likely from call out research that was done and the comments that were made during that call out research or any kind of research that has done I keep in mind again official campaign ad you hear her voice on the ad for a reason that by law she has to be on that ad\nAnd so they use that word crazy before Democrat for a reason because it's likely it was it was said that way\nBy people they're concerned are going to vote right instead of left\nAnd they're trying to persuade them or trying to influence them and and let them know that she's not one of the problem is is that it's likely\nIn part because of the Kavanaugh saying and her vote in the Kavanaugh thing and we said that you don't have to be a you know someone else\nOr who's on the committee you don't have to be a Kamala Harris or anyone else who did something you know that you consider to be crazy or your voters potentially consider to be crazy in order to feel the effect of it\nIf you vote no then you're going to essentially condoned that kind of behavior and I think that's what she in part is facing right now in her state and that is your vote was everything that they
