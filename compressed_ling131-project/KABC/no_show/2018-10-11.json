last night at the rally in Pennsylvania are you know talking about the fed and you know what is the the fed doing that they're raising interest rates\nIs is complain I'm sure as are raising interest rates to quickly but then you have\nA in the the the bond market if you look at you know government bonds and treasury bills or that their interest rates keep going up and up and up and up and we've sent when you combine all those together when you combine still the uncertainty of the trade agreements formerly known as NAFTA\nOr if you look at the Chinese tariffs which ... an hour in effect\nAnd will hit a now as we enter the uh the the Christmas season we have you know always asked and\n[noise] and for the longest time I I think in a lot of good times we've all off and said\nNo matter whether it's this good time or other good times is the market overvalued [laughter] right well it began with yeah it is the is the optimism too great\nEven when the economy's doing good at times right right right and and so uh we are the experts were not the experts at predicting but looking at what the futures are doing overnight they expect it can be a couple of hundred points maybe even as high as three hundred point\nA drop or when the market\nOpens this morning [noise] interesting that one of the points that are going through a some comments made by Jim Kramer a CNBC and the street dot com\nAbout some of the indicators or or some of the science I guess at the market was looking at one of them being\nPacking materials and you don't think of that on a you know for us layman we don't we don't look at that but of course right if there is a drop in the in the cost of packing materials that means a that there is a demand there was a glut of those materials on the market semi conductors\nThe same thing on the technology side\nBecause of things going on with China China's slowing down a a a terrorist and everything else but their economy and and trying to slowing down as well but the so when demand slows down you know of course in that sector where the price starts to drop\nIn those sectors of those types of materials or we looked at uh the than the ... G A effect they lost ten percent\nOr as a result of and this is a company that's roughly what a hundred and Thirty years old\nUh and they talk about the raw materials and what they do and the and the and the coating is used in the automotive market and everything else\nUm those raw material costs going up\nSo they lose money and that has to do with a with terrorists and and a number of other things but when there's a glut on the market that's a bad sign because those that the that means that the demand has slowed\nOr when they're when the costs go up especially as a matter of policy that's a bad sign when especially when you don't know how long that's going to be around that are that effect that policy is going to be in place\nA regulation and you and I as we were discussing this last hour the hour before we both with us we're talking about it and went wow okay regulation or that the uh tech companies are are worried about what's that\nOh government policy when we talk about the fed oh government policy when we talk about the increase\nOr in in a in the interest rate in government bonds that's because of massive borrowing oh again government policy when we talked about terrorists irrespective what do you think they're justified or not raising the cost of doing a a a you know business all those regulation\nIncrease in interest rates are a tariffs all are doing what increasing the cost of business\nNo matter what when you increase the cost of businesses the economy will hurt not an opinion that is fact\nYou you know there's hundreds yeah ... ... and one of the elements are that the that basically what that was being assessed as the rise of the U.S dollar which is I yes I saw you know if you if you look at that the rise of the u._s. dollar based on what that is a growing often\nIt is the growing economy are and what happens is our trade partners when the dollar starts a two to drop a little bit\nThen they can because of the exchange rates\nIt makes it cheaper for them or to buy from the U.S okay so they go shopping in the U.S when it goes up and when it goes up that's quite the opposite so you see manufacturing down when manufacturing is down trucking is down transportation\nWent through a you know a slowdown between a twenty fourteen twenty Fifteen twenty sixteen in in there and it was one that people really had not you know looked at I guess we hadn't been watching closely enough\nBut that is the effect of a you know of of a a rising dollar and that is the fact that again it that makes it a\nYou know it it it changes how people are trade partners do business with us so that means manufacturers here and then the sucked the sectors that will\nSupport them like transportation and that's what by the way the freight um was one of the items that PG listed along with uh the the materials cost oil and freight costs rising again that that goes against earnings\nSo all of this is the the market assessing a what's happening there are there are things that are an adjustment as as an expansion of\nWell by the way that the the cost of oil whether you agree with that or or or not right and it's also based on on the government policy of ... of foreign policy of saying okay we need to put the sanctions on against Iran which does what means there's\nLess soil and again this isn't a judgment on whether you agree with it or not it's just the reality of supply and demand right of regulation of making things more expensive for whatever reason will hurt in an economy\nWell and and and I think the president was right to call out Saudi Arabia and and talk yeah I Know what they have been able to because they basically are now that I mean they and they have been for a long time they are OPEC if you if you talk about that\nSome also said that during said he should focus more on fixing the city and less on exploring the president's run during frequent ... outside of Los Angeles union spokesman told reporters that he promised that he would a hundred more city workers to undo the cuts from the recession Rob ...

prime and so this is the kind of system a tropical systems that are real good at bringing out the sponge\nAnd bringing down that moisture and so that's what I'm concerned about because\nTwo to three inches of rain falling in the areas near Fayette fill up the Raleigh up the Wilson that area that whole area from uh Florence up the Fayetteville is is low lying area and easily uh because of Florence
