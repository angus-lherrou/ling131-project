marine corps they would never have known each other they would never even understood that multiple America's exist\nSimultaneously depending on your education level your family's income status maybe but they were Marines they were combat Marines because of this fall and they were brothers as close\nAs if they were born to the same woman the mission orders they receive from the charging their squad leader I'm sure when something like this okay you're too clowns stand this post and let no one authorized personnel or vehicles pass\nAnd I'm sure he'll it hurt her than roll their eyes and set in unison something Jess ... we got him we know what we're doing screw you [noise]\nAgain I'm prior enlisted I Know how they think [noise]\nThey never leaves to other Marines on watch was it turned out what probably the two like his Marines on the earth that they may soon those pose Yale and hurt her a few minutes later ... very large blue trucks turned down the alleyway there was no more than a hundred yards and life\nIs fetish way through the serpentine concrete walls\nJersey walls truck stop just short of where these two were posted it detonated it killed both of them catastrophic Lee if you know with combat like you know what I'm Talking about when I say ...\nTwenty four brick Mason or the houses were damaged or destroyed by the blast a mosque a hundred meters away collapsed the trucks engine came to rest two hundred meters away and knocked down in the building before it came to rest\nDirect forces guys recognize that the blast was made by a bomb of at least two thousand pounds of explosive too died because these two young men in the room and died they didn't know how to run from danger\nA hundred and fifty men\nUS Marines than a hundred as Iraqis were saved\nWhen I read the situation report a few hours after it happened I call the ... commander Lou crap brought a massive for details about happens\nSeem different to me unfortunately Marines dying or being seriously wanted is common in combat we expect Marines and for that matter of soldiers sailors airmen and coast guardsmen regardless of rank to do their duty to stand their ground into die but that's what the mission requires\nThe radio commander had just returned from the site he agreed with me for report it to me that there were no where American witnesses just Iraqi Police\nI figured if there was any chance of finding out what actually happened and to recognize these young men for what they've done that have to go down there myself because I understood unfortunately that the bureaucrats in Washington would never accept\nIraqi statements for the taking place if there was any chance at all it had to come into my signature so I traveled to Ramadi the next day and spoke to half a dozen Iraqi Police all of whom told me the same story\nThey said the truck turned down into the alley can spit up as it made its way through the serpentine Jersey walls\nThey all said they knew immediately what was going on particularly when the rains began to fire\nThe Iraqis all began firing as well then to a man rent for safety just prior to the explosion\nThey all survived many were injured\nSome seriously injured\nBut it's one of the Iraqi said to me [noise] sure they'd run\nFrom the danger like any normal man would\nBut he didn't know until then he said and what he learned to veterans that was that Americans are not normal with tears rolling up he said to be sure in the name of Allah note saying man would have stood there and done what they did note saying man [noise]\nThey save all of us [noise]\n\nWhat we did know at the time what I didn't know at the time you know what he learned a couple of days later after I wrote a summary of statement of this of this bravery and submitted both Yale and hurt or for navy crosses which is the number to award\nFor Marines and sailors in combat but I didn't know was at one of the security cameras we had the location that was damaged initially in the blast had caught everything\nHappened exactly as these Iraqis described it to me it took exactly six seconds by that recording\nFrom the truck into the valley until it exploded six seconds and you can watch\nAnd I did watch many many times on this recording the last six seconds\nWhen it first started I suppose it took about a second a show for the Marines to separately come to the conclusion\nAbout what was going on\nThey had no time to talk it over\nOnly enough time to cap and instant and think about what the sergeant maybe had told him\nA few minutes before I let know unauthorized persons are vehicles to pass\nAt that point I think according to the recording this rain said about five seconds to lead thick of it five seconds to live\nThey didn't have time took about another two seconds for the two jar heads\nTo raise their weapons to take game to open up at the drug but this time the truck was halfway through the berries and gaining speed the whole time here the recording shows a number of Iraqi policemen some of whom had fired their AK forty sevens we're now scattering like the normal and rational Monday were\nSome running right past the Marines\nThe two Marines had about three seconds to live\nFor about two seconds ... the recording shows the Marines find their weapons nonstop\nThe trucks windshield exploded into shards of glass\nBut their rounds took it apart and the undoubtedly tore into the body of those terrorists that were trying to kill their brothers\nAnd aware of the danger at the time\nThe Marines and Iraqi soldiers could they'd come to the fact if they didn't know and the two Marines Ron watch\nAnd would die before they ran the truck for range to a stop immediately in front of the two mornings and all of this instantaneous violence yeah when I heard her never hesitated they never step back\nThey never even started step back they never shifted their weight\nWith their feet sprayed shoulder with the part that leaned into the fire and fired as fast as they could\nThey had only at this point one second to live\nAnd then the truck expose the camera goes blank\nAnd the two young men go to the guard\nNot enough time to think about the country or their flag\nOr about their lives or the deaths\nOf more than enough time for two very brave young men\nLike your sons and daughters\nLike their brothers and sisters\nLike your spouse's\nTwo very brave young men to do their duty for eternity\nThat\nThis is the kind of people who are on and watch for us all over the world\nTonight that is a kind of young men and women
