pictures of dead relatives\n... fall still again and max prompt his elbows on my table resting his chin on the heels of his up turned poems what about them he asked\nPointing to a picture of my sister and her family he'd known them his whole life just as he had known me played with my niece and nephew regularly making just a year older Matt two years younger than max\n... birthday parties and family dinners but I could see that he was beginning to grasp the change that we were about to undergo\nGym and I will be your aunt and uncle Megan in that will be your cousins sweet you fed looking into my face for the first time since it entered the room\nHis eyes were chocolate pools his thick dark hair a sleek shiny coat that made me want to run my fingers over it I don't have any boy cousins\nAnd how about him\nMy brother John well he'll be your uncle I was especially happy to share my younger brother with max John loved kids and being much like a giant kid himself had a knack for being silly with some\nResorted stacks of aunts and uncles cousins and friends wow you have a lot of people max side I suppose I Do\nHe began to finger through the stacks messing up what I'd sordid my original task no longer mattered\nAs we near the bottom of the stack honey thick warmth began to fill me perhaps my family was to be the unexpected dowry I'd bring to this little boy who'd already lost so much\nWill he claimed laughing at my third grade picture the one where my hair had been extended to do dimensions buying especially humid Indiana Day\nAt moments like those max was just a little boy point with energy easy with a laugh he ... he goes\nWatch teenage mutant ninja turtles and toss the halls\nAnd other times when he was still or thought no one was looking it seemed that the earth's pool was just a little stronger where he stood hugging the corners of his mouth downward making his eyes appearing years older than the number of his birthdays would imply\nJust as I was about to put the last of the pictures into the box max press to finger once more to face and who will this be to me\nBut ... his finger I could see the edges of my own space\nI was suddenly flooded with a heart swell for which I had known name\nThis child of the man I loved was becoming my son we have family Christmas cards in school are stuck with magnets to the fridge I'd make goody bag is a birthday party is snap pictures of graduations\nAll these things I'd never allowed myself to want thinking that perhaps my own history had left me to wounded to allow myself children of my own\nI was becoming a mother but without the benefit of a growing belly or a baby shower to prepare me\nI should know the answer to a simple question I should know how to say just the right why's magical thing but I didn't so I offered to therapists cop that question well what do you think\nMac shrugged then looked away and I knew it was my job to field this one jumbled words Bob to the surface up my mind like those triangle shaped answers floating in the blue waters of magic eight ball\nFinally the image rose to the surface of the your second mom I said oh I'm Sorry that your first mom died I liked her a lot\nSilence loaded between us then max leaned against me his chin still in his palms what should I call you he asked not looking at me I've known him his whole life and he told me that see all that time\nMy heart pound it against the cage of my ribs my stomach turned over momma I wanted to cry I'll be your mom and you'll be my son I resisted\nYou can call me mom or mama you can also call me ... if you'd rather whatever feels okay for you\nHe stood there a minute and I waited thinking I'd get a pronouncement of minute title what's for dinner he asked picking up his ball burgers sweet he said tossing the ball as he walked out of the room\n\nAt our wedding a few months later Tom and I said our vows to one another then Max's invited to stand beside us and I made vows to max I promise to step into the shoes his mother had been forced to leave behind and to be the best mother I could be\nI promised to help him remember her\nAfter the wedding for the next few days max tried on a new titled for me can we go bowling he'd ask and he'd follow the question by mouthing the word\nThe word was silent it seemed he was trying to get on seeing how it goes in his mouth\nMy hopes floated like a pinch helium balloons and then like a thousand hornets guilt attacked that balloon piercing it until it lost its hair and sank\nIt felt wrong to take such pleasure and seeing his little plump that's formed that singular sellable after all this new son of mine was an inheritance that I did not have if he and Tom hadn't sustain such enormous loss\nI felt smaller and smaller still when old habits resumed and Betsy was once again my only title I took the shameful disappointment away telling new one\nWeeks later as I drove them home from school max pulled out a baggy full of cheese it's from his ninja turtles lunch box he marched away licking each finger of it's orange dust was his focus deep inside the near empty snack bag he suddenly said\nI noticed I don't call your mom I Breathe to come my voice\nI noticed that one last cracker than four fingers topic when I say Betsy I'm mean mom I swallowed past the dry rock that informed in my throat thanks I said that's nice to know\nHe looked out the window moms die you know I think maybe it's safer if you're just Betsy\nWe could have had a long talk about magical thinking in death and how nothing he could say or not say could cause me to tire could have caused his mother to die\nBut this just didn't seem like the time for all of that I Will cheers away not wanting to overwhelm him he had so much to Terry thanks but I appreciate you telling me\nThose big chocolate ice found mine I waited he Pepsi yeah I said delighted with the new sound of my old name what's for dinner [noise]\nAnd what a beautifully told story Democrats Betsy

ABC News [noise]\n\nEven this is our American stories can we talk about everything you're on the show from the arts toward the history of course the sciences and we read a book review in the wall street\nJournal called it never hurts to ask and it was all about a book called why what makes us curious and the writer joins us professor Mary ... he's a professor of astrophysics an adjunct un Elvie\nAnd he worked at the Hubble Telescope for twenty four years and thanks for joining us\nSure my pleasure well let's talk about astrophysics first what is it and why were you curious about that because that obviously led to your life's work sir\nWhere a pro physics she's really about understanding the universe and by that I mean from the University of large you know why the universe\nExpand into what these they've Lucian of the universe or to understanding how galaxies form how stars form how planets form how life emerged in the universe all of that belongs to us for physics\nAnd talk about now your your quest to dig into this space called curiosity because I think this is what separates man from everybody else is the degree to which were curious and what we do about it a blight talking about that\nSo indeed the humans are really quite unique in the fact that they ask why even about unseen cause is I'm ... I'm In Missouri curious too but they don't normally ask why and especially the north about things that they cannot directly see\n'em so I was always a very curious person a and that one point they just became very curious about curiosity itself\nSo you know I decided to spend more than four years are studying you know what research is being done in psychology and neuroscience of us curiosity I spoke with many researchers in the field the visited some labs and so on and um that's the result these this book\nAre we naturally curious or is it something we develop is there a curiosity gene easy one\n[laughter] ... yes so we are naturally curious in the sense that studies show that I'm forty to fifty percent of a district of curiosity as with many other psychological traits are genetic\nNamely if your parents were very curious or grandparents were very curious chances are you'll also be very curious person so so some parts of these genetic but of course\nThere there is there are other parts that are um you know just environmental and depending on your particular circumstances I mean it depends on\nYour parents who and how they they talk to you your teachers or maybe the church you go to um things of that nature the environment in which we leave I mean does that allow you the luxury of being curious about certain things and not about others and so on\nFor curiosity has done a lot for human kind I mean you posit that it's kept us alive in many respects\nAnd if if if anything it's expanded our life expectancies in so many other things from the creation of fire which I think is you know we can take it all the way back there that was curiosity itself wasn't it the unseen and the next thing you know we're creating this thing out of nothing\n... this right so so curiosity and indeed the rise of course all scientific research it drives the process of education it plays a role you know in books we write films we see in even simple conversations I mean you don't want to have a conversation\nWith somebody unless you are somewhat curious about what they have to say\nI'm and indeed goes back all the way to the pre humans and the very early humans\nWho had to be curious about you know what does fire do you know how can I use that I Would do to do and and things of that nature that expended both the diets of the early humans and uh you know the fact that they could start to do all kinds of other things that they couldn't before\nLet's talk about the two dimensions of curiosity you talked about in your book and one of them has to do with let's just say the senses and the other was the intellect I'm Talking about those two things\n[noise] so are there are various types of curiosity so why don't curiosities for example ... it was been dubbed
