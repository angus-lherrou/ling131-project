that\nIf he said that I went to a bar and I ordered seven drinks and he ordered Seventy drinks and they could prove that they might have a point but they're trying to quantify the people that are against Kevin unplugging the classmate\nTrying to quantify something that you can't quantify well and and saying in one case\nUm he if he had said this um that's actually what he did say then I'd be okay with it but he did say that right and so you're trying to determine\nThe level of intoxication of somebody thirty six years ago right and since we now have a society that gets high instead of drinking mhm since that seems to be the direction we're going that's like saying\nHow high was the yeah I was pretty high no dude you were just really stone that's\nPerjury see thinking about it I mean there's a thing you know by the less standard he could say if it were about\nPot he could say well he he tried it with but he didn't inhale [noise] that would be\n... separately for cabinet rod I drank beer but a spit it out of exactly Evers\n[laughter]\nI Know it was bad Clinton um yeah so but at the ... and that's why the ... this is refuting specifically about a specific you know something that she never did when it came to a polygraph that's not trying to figure out how drunk were you thirty six years ago right at\nA ... ... at\nNo specific time is designated as there is no incident to how drunk you were one specific time it's in general in your whole life right and in pretty wasted in times how wasted really wasted I think you were making a wasted ... yeah you're you're committed perjury you said really way said you were making wasted\n\nOh yeah and so I'm doing five years for perjury in prison for what they said it was really wasted and they believe the guy that said I was mega wasted\nWhat's the difference was likely PSA bus driving is drunk driving and then of course the drunk sitting in front of the TV and that's not [laughter] shut up it's not\nBut it it well I don't even though the by ... the ... the entire thing is is if technically ... you know when they do a whole because this is how I think of when I see the bus driving ... wait a minute\nIf I'm at point all five ... and I feel about it and I feel a buzz ... it is and drunk driving\nNot by the my state standard right\nYes not by not yes not by the state standard I I don't think anybody's below pointed way\nI don't know that anybody is I think they're trying to move something was there was a movement or or call to move it to point oh four right which would be okay bus driving can impair your you know your ability your skills behind the wheel\nThat's where you could but you could leave if you could look at that and say well do you were you ever charged with drunk driving ...\nUh uh\nAnd I I guess I'm I'm trying to think of would be the scenario but your word point let's say let's say your name is bad too\n\nAnd the cops pull you over but you don't run you didn't run\nYeah you have a much better scenario but but I could come up with yeah thank you very much I don't think the automatic than there is just out of nowhere\n[laughter]\nBut ... but by the way we think about the one with with ... that the the critique or whatever the review he gave it up some performance where he talked about\nYou know some dance performance you talked about why the mentally or either except for their big breasts or whatever some oh at an ... you know and he had apologized and and and yeah you can't say that he was Nineteen years old when he did it and it's like a\nWell no that doesn't apply to the election today either folks yeah right most like that does now you you know you you can bring it on ... somebody may not vote for him because of it but nobody in Austin, Texas is not going to not vote for him because\nIt's ... it's about what it says and does you know right now and then what he says right what he did back then\nBut how do you ... again so the the the department trying to make on perjury is a fact that hers is about a specific behavior that can be measured did your did you not tell somebody you said no we got to witness it said you did now do they find that woman\n... ah that'd be the next step right and they would find the woman mhm yeah now she doesn't have to testify\nNo no way to make the Senate can subpoena you can't yeah well and I think they want to do another hearing yeah\nBut that'd be entirely anybody can ... that somebody you know he's new that's come aboard will the FBI interviewing him and then they had the name of the woman they know the name of the woman that she helped\nHer name appears [noise]\nI I I don't know because it depends on really they they were given a broader scope on Monday\nThe president or maybe it actually officially happened late Sunday the president broadening the scope\nYou know to being able to interview anybody on anything that was that was tied to those claims but I don't know if it's not necessarily something that that she said in a ... that would be the investigation I'm Sorry the background check\nA would be would include that which is something she claimed\nYeah they have the name mix Senate McLean so I'm sure he's given the investigators her full name right and if she's alive I'm assuming\nThat\nYou know you wouldn't ... somebody in the Judiciary Committee if this thing went any further if they're going to stick with her as this witness and the Democrats are going to stick by this and Republicans are going to stick by the next thing would be to get her\nAnd then if you had the ... the U.S the boyfriend in his testimony and then the woman that she actually helped with the lie detector if she helped or the alleged helping limit the lie detector test\nIf she comes over and says yes she help move the lie detector test you got her Mm\n\n[noise] well here's my question to on asking for the materials that Grassley asked for by the way on the the video or audio related to or or of the process of the lie detector test\nHe's asked for that before my question is if the Senate committee officially asks her for that because that really was that was presented as evidence\n\nExcept for they didn't get to scrutinize the\nMethodology of it it was just the results right the results being presented as part of the evidence\nWill now that she has testified in front of the Senate because at first Grassley asked it before she testified buddies they're just the Senate have the power to subpoena\nThose those are\nThose documents that information\n... by denying these by the daytime they

bowl in Nineteen Ninety there'd be no wide right\nOr during the kick if they saw it was going to be wide right [laughter] [laughter] to have a bunch of Democrats that this is what we need I Would love to see that\nLet's hire a bunch of Democrats and liberals to be on the field during each kick this could be a new rule and when they kick if it looks like it's not they get they get a chance to correct it by moving the goalpost\nThey're good at it\nI'm going to play the Saudi of cut here this is odd but as a Senator Tom cotton or talking to Tucker Carlson okay are actually two nights ago but it's important here uh we didn't get chess late last night uh we didn't have the audio at the time but I Want to play it as he talks about where this is where we are at this point\nSoccer it is pretty one sided on here that army have started to get a lot bigger they're going to take me on because it's very easy to defend judge Kavanaugh yet it has a stellar record on the bench\nHe has a long and distinguished history of public service\nHas undergone six background checks tougher six background checks and that somehow the FBI is supposed to turn off new information and just a few days to satisfy all the Democrats yet as soon as we agreed to have a limited investigation by the FBI\nAnd the current credible allegations of which I Would say there are no\nBut the humor them to give them a few days they immediately started moving the goalposts saying that we have to interview two dozen witnesses and has to take weeks and on and on and on it's never going to end Tucker this is not about trying to get the facts or get the proof it's about trying to stop\nKavanaugh from being confirmed for the Supreme Court that all comes in and this week tougher what I find so striking is a he's a sitting federal judge has authored scores scores of opinions and yeah we're not debating any of them\nHis initial philosophy is not even up for debate it's all about his high school yearbook does it strike in this conversation is on becoming a of a country as advanced as ours that's just so stupid finally\nDumb why it is it is pretty amazing to say Democratic senators poring over high school yearbook as if it were that the venture code\n[laughter]\nThat's my favorite line right out there right\nAh but you know that's that's where we are I Wonder how much you know talk today we only had\nA ... one called today which is very few ... this week we've been doing this for a long time as I said this is my this week marks my twenty ninth year end talk radio ... we know when the Democrats have an argument or when they believed to have an argument we know Democrats don't have an argument and they don't believe that they have an argument the polls show\nThat you know for example the most at Seventy five percent of Americans which means that's close to almost half of Democrats when you get to that kind of level or they believed John Feinstein was completely wrong for ... for not you know taking that letter and and going through the process\nAnd so right from that point on the Democrats haven't been able to sell their message to half of their party looks at it and say ...\nUh okay that's that's just not good there is a ... as we said the the the poll that shows that sixty percent of Americans\nA belief that if the FBI has no cooperating evidence of after this\nUh you you can for him right you you can burn them to be a Supreme Court a justice Americans look at Americans believe in due process so the one call we have today didn't even talk about anything\nWell here's unprofessional because of the way that he acted which is again was the talking point but we and as we reminded the color he's about two or three days past that talking point which really died\nA
