that\nYou selflessness and self sacrifice aren't generally words people use for most CEO's in America we can we can say that safely Sam talked about the Coleman play because one of the things about bill Russell and we're going to learn more about some of these other captain is this word called desire\nAnd my goodness anybody who played around bill Russell understood what that word meant\n[noise]

ABC News\n\nThis is our\nAmerican stories and we continue our conversation with Sam Walker author of the casting classes for anybody out there who's listening leading anything anyone who's\nA sports fan but even if you're not what a great discussion we were just talking about Tim Duncan probably the highest paid person to ever written in academic psychology paper because Collins' him he co authored one titled\nBlowhard snobs and our sisters interpersonal reactions to excessive ego autism in the opening paragraph as the line quote simply put we don't like you go to ... people so even as an undergrad Tim Duncan got it\nJust shows you the level of intelligence and motion intelligence that the great leaders ... and I don't know I think I think that my sense with junk I've ever spoken to her about this I Know he's very proud of the paper but I think that really was who he was and that that research that he did really explain to him\nThat he was as a leader you were to look like a leader that you would you would pick out of a crowd I mean to me it's always said if you walked into practice you never imagined that he was a leader team didn't\nShe wanted a loud voice or um he wasn't a huge presence of a charismatic person who parked out orders enjoy anything we use is supposed to do\nWhat I found in my book the way I Hope is inspiring and it to people is that you know you may not think that you have readership characteristics you may think that there are things that you just heard good at but really the truth is that\nAll of the things that these leaders did were really about behavior and the choices that they made and the team contacts every day\nAnd behavior can be models and leadership can be\nCan be a improved choices can do better and when you start to understand what leadership really involved and you start to separate out the myths than you can see why someone like Tim Duncan may not be the guy on posters and every kid's bedroom but he is by far the winningest and most effective leader generation\nYou know his coach one said that Duncan didn't have an ounce of MTV him him even agreed to be paid less than market value why did he do that what was he thinking and his agent must have went to me what are you talking about you want the maximum so I can get the maximum commission what are you doing\nYou know Tom Brady to the same thing with\nThe patriots than you would restructure the contract to every year so that they could have more salary cap room to sign other players I mean it's that's\nWhat you do he's made more money I'm sure that he ever imagined he would make his life and and as most of the players have and\nIt's not an application I mean he cared about the team\nAnd the teams result that's for all his satisfaction came from ... much more than his satisfaction from having more money in the bank or having you know you had another super car garage and and that stuff didn't matter and she's an incredible person and you know I have so much respect for him and I\nI Do think that there's a lot of appreciation for him but he is often left out of the conversation on people talk about the greatest players a lot of time and\nI just don't understand it I don't understand the hall of fame mentality where you know we separate out an individual from his teammates and say this person does or special praise I don't understand how any\nI think they knew that their whatever they are accomplishments we're we're all depend on the other people that you can't really divided team to it's important parts and it's less important parts or are they all one unit\nAnd do you don't want to quote from the book because it's such a good quote and it's something we all know inexperience in any workplace quote one of the great paradoxes of management is it the people who pursue leadership positions most ardent lead or off in the wrong people for the job\nYou cited a study of super story CEOs now as they lifted themselves up they often lower others in the process Tim Duncan and so many members of your captain class they did the exact opposite talk about that\nWhen my favorite example of this is a woman named Carla over back and I doubt that you owe immediately remember that name\nShe was the captain of that great Nineteen Ninety nine us women's soccer team that won the world cup and\nYou know really dominated that sport for about five or six years of just one of the best soccer teams of all time and\nYou remember mia Hamm and Julie fatty and Brandi chest pain all the big stars of that team but\nThere's a reason you don't know Carla over backwards because she did not care she did not want you know who she was she had no interest in the spotlight whatsoever any personal accolades and she was not the best player on the team she was central defender and\nYou should never didn't flashy she never scored she you know we would pass the ball often minutes she got it to one of her teenage son she you\nKnow she just played with his relentless pace but\nWhat was amazing about her that I think she understood what leadership is really about and it's really about service she was incredible with this because she did things I'd never seen before when this team would go on a long road trip to Japan or Norway\nTherefore to use a truck insurance expertise to protect us like a mother protects a

Michael continues the path\nAnd a north north easterly direction as all tracks are saying that that's the way that it will turn and go over those states there in the southeast including Georgia the Carolinas\nUh and and so and then back out into the Atlantic later this week but we will hear from Tom here and just a bit after the bottom of the hour\nWhen you when I started the the the week uh and some of the productions that came out was initially that this might be a category one that would have right well first it was you know they could be a tropical storm that it was category one category too than category three then category for an hour up to a hundred and forty miles an hour so we're well into a category of four would still\nI have to increase a significant amount to get to a category five but still an extremely dangerous or a a hurricane and even though uh for the pan handle a this in all will would break all the records as we know just down the coast\nOr in the you know the black sea Gulfport area back in Nineteen sixty nine is where when Camille head right and that was a category five when it hit yeah and that did just unprecedented uh uh you know kind of damage but when you think of it and and as Tom explained earlier and sort of John trout\nAre said that you know when when you look at these are called major hurricanes for reason one and two are called hurricane when it gets to you know three four and five that's when it moves to major hurricane status because it was a huge difference\nIn wind speeds or Seventy five to eighty miles an hour if you're in a category one to getting up to a hundred and forty miles a hundred and forty plus miles an hour remember those were sustains wins not does not include the guts and probably you're going to find guts\nAre in the civil hundred and fifty miles an hour this is as bad as it any tornado could be well and you ... and over a bigger ... over a bigger scale\nEthics it go and as it it it comes to shore or and on a bigger scale that means that those damaging wins\nWhile they may diminish are still going to be damaging the even inland are and and that's the point uh we're still talking about hurricane force winds well inland after Michael comes ashore so you you look at the also the\nPotential of and and I think this kind of spells it out if you need a visual and you're in your in your mind or you picture a well built home well built structure\nAnd you can expect in it in a hundred and forty mile an hour wind the roof coming right off of that structure and it may be again one that's built up to code or even greater or that may lose that that roof in a second and again it becomes dangerous\nNot only are the flooding that we've talked about the ... which would be the rainfall and the storm surge but the debris flying debris in a storm like this\nOr is extremely dangerous anybody with family or friends that may be in the path of hurricane Michael ah reach out to them or make sure that they are doing everything possible\nTo get out of the way of the storm and again we'll talk with Tom hill coming up after the bottom of the hour get caught up on this as the issue is his last report for us this morning before\nAh Michael is expected to uh come inland are there in the panhandle and and Big Bend area therefore to near Panama City\nSometime this afternoon between three and six they will narrow that down the closer we get\nBut it is still in that timeframe and as Tom pointed out those dangerous uh wins and and conditions with rain and and storm surge will start to begin the situation will start to deteriorate rapidly sometime around noon today in that area\nSome of those stories want to make sure that we are getting because we do have a lot of hurricane coverage of this hour\nUh Nikki Haley or resigning a as a un UN ambassador I guess caught a lot of people off guard you and I talked about how the I I woke up to it as soon as I woke up to it\nAnd then everybody speculating what it might be and everything to the point of on social media she's resigning because she had enough of this administration with Kavanaugh where I was like no I\n[laughter] I don't think there was any indication that that was a the the case and ah you know they uh they they spoke together she was a highly complementary you know you and I have talked about this that you know about Nikki Haley in and others in the administration\nWhen the media comes up to them and says well how was it ... you must disagree with this president at times and she said she will of course I Do but I'm the UN ambassador I I'm I'm not president I don't I don't projected it down and create ... it's like when John when John Bolton was asked to national security advisor\nWealth or does he does he always do what you say well no because we have different opinions on things and I'm an advisor I gave him his vice right I tell them that that's my role I give them advice doesn't mean he always follows my advice I don't expect him to mhm he wants me to analyze the situation and then I give him\nA the advice and once he decides to do something\nUh I you know I Will support what the administration wants to do it because he's the president and she had to do the same thing it's almost as if they're trying to find dissension anywhere well or you disagree with there isn't anyone in that's ever served any president Democrat or Republican\nThat doesn't agree that that doesn't disagree with something that the president is doing right happens all the time it seems so that it's only that they make it a huge case or a big case when it's a Republican and especially when it's when it's Trump but\nUh we'll see uh what her you know future plans are ah she said she has no plans to run for the presidency and twenty twenty will see or whether she doesn't twenty twenty four and then she could have the motto\nMaking America great again again\nYes she could uh seriously if you if the president's served two terms what what is your slogan if you're a Republican after that\nI'm parents it's my turn now [laughter]\nI don't know it I don't know I'm Sorry it's my turn has already been you oh that's right right it was ... speaking about her term in in other news and got to go to the news quickly to get back to the hurricane coverage but a Tom Cotton\nRobbers irks me that Senator Tom cotton believes that it was Chuck Schumer behind Ford's leaked letter Dr forge leak the letter he says I Believe Schumer's political operation was behind this from the very beginning\nA when he was on a huge deal with show ... credit for uh uh that uh the other thing is Rand Paul Kelly not Cory bookers rhetoric insane this rhetoric has got to stop it's coming from the Democrats and coming from mainstream Democrats\nIt's got to stop somebody is going to get killed yeah that that this this tone of of incivility is unacceptable and he brought up the fact that he was attacked and brought out the whole you know ... ...\nAttempt and as you brought up earlier this was an attempt to assassinate just one person no it was an attempt to assassinate members of Congress yes it was\nA multiple uh assassination attempt and that's where again I I Know a lot of people will try and and uh uh say that the Rand Paul is just this is hyperbole and fear mongering\nIt's very real on that day the shooter was out to kill multiple members of Congress there is no doubt there is no debating that\nSo if you look at what has happened since then now where we have mainstream the radical behavior the instability in fact the calls\nFor instability coming from Hillary Clinton Cory Booker Maxine Waters and I don't know anyone on the left who's saying we cannot call from the for this and that we must stop this in fact and that would be\nI don't care who who it is a Chuck Schumer or anyone else they're not stepping up and saying we need to end\nThis I notice is enough enough is enough in ... that and that that's why I wanted to bring it up here because as you mentioned Hillary Clinton she piled on again yesterday in a CNN interview here's part of that\nYou're not careful with a political party that wants to destroy what you found for what's your ... that's why I Believe if we are fortunate enough\nTo win back the house armed or the formal ... can start to [laughter]\nSo we're not going to be civil until we get our way in fact the instability right now if you look at the\nOperation dual force uses in states armed prohibited persons system database to find the weapons the people may have

Michael now a category for a hundred and forty mile an hour\nSustained wins off\nThe coast of Florida and heading for the panhandle and Big Bend area of Florida let's get back with no\nMeteorologist Tom hale who joins us once again a Tom a again a reminder of the timeline here when the strong wins a ... and overall I guess the conditions there are in the path of Michael will start to deteriorate\nWell the fastest deterioration will be at a point that you won't have time to evacuate and that's gonna be anytime from ten o'clock to noon and on as we get into the last four hours of it approaching at that point it's going to probably be fifty miles offshore\nMaybe a little bit further up\nMaybe Seventy five miles offshore assuming it picks up in speed from the Thirteen miles an hour it's traveling right now\n[noise] so what are we going to expect as that I come to the shore what kind of conditions are we looking at\n[noise] um well we're looking at water rising in like you're filling a bath tub\nAnd except instead of inches it's going to be rising and feet nine to Thirteen feet weather services estimate is that we'll be looking at nine to Thirteen feet\nFrom ten dull Airforce base base to keep the beach um and that pretty much takes you to to the\nAlmost uh almost overt toward a Fort Walton\nFrom Keith in it goes over to Fort Walton that's going to be six to nine feet and the same thing from a from Keith in beach the other way\nTo cedar key uh will be six to nine feet\nSo if you started cedar key and you had on all the way over to as far as\nFort Walton Beach you're going to be looking at a minimum of six to nine foot rise and in the heart of this action Pensacola or a Panama City beach and down the Appalachian cola and south of Tallahassee you're looking at possibly nine to Thirteen feet now remember\nWind driven waves on top of that could be an additional four or five six whatever feed 'em which will drive it and basically be a battering ram on top

and\nLet me give you an idea tropical storm winds now extend out a hundred and eighty five miles out from the storm that's forty mile an hour winds now if you've ever tried to stand in a forty mile an hour wind you know this it's it's a little bit difficult and\nAh and so that extends out a hundred and eighty five miles and\nMichael is a hundred and forty miles away from Panama City and a hundred and thirty miles away from a Appalachian coal ... so they're already starting to feel these wins and by the time we get the sun up we're going to probably start seeing reports of these wins increasing now\nInitially they'll start is with us then they will become steady and then from there\nThey'll start rising the water so the first two or three feet of water rice um\nIt is going to start inundating any of the roads that you would have otherwise driven to get out of here right\nSo you know time is of the time as as of the essence and er I shared this at the top of the hour and I I
