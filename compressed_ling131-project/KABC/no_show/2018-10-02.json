I'm a I'm an introvert um you know just by nature so running to me and if you saw or Iran up in the hills uh north of San Francisco uh it's it's a beautiful setting I'm I'm Out by myself\nI have a very close relationship with nature I'm almost more comfortable running in nature that I Am and groups of people in fact I Am more comfortable and I think that you know unfortunate that something that's been lost as we've all as a species as we've lost this relationship\nWith the outdoors with nature and to me that's you know that that's part of the human experience and it it makes me feel spiritually and live is when I'm outside running through the hills um and you know it it unfortunately a lot of people\nAre in the industrialized world just don't have access to that experience to you know they live in cities that are so built up but I Would encourage folks to try their best you know even on the weekends to get some are wild and just you know immerse yourself in the grand is of of this planet of ours\nIndeed and by the way we Reader's Digest in a long piece on the health and wellness of people who take long walks or exercise in and around nature and it was remarkable what the findings were dean it's not surprising to me we broadcast just south of Memphis\nAnd when you draw a circle around Memphis around two hundred miles or so you can find almost all the great American musicians and writers teams from this area in the area of music it's remarkable and it's these wide open spaces and these peace of mind\nAnd having to fill up your own space\nBut I Know I you know it's it ironically I'm I've written all of my books I've written for books now I write all of them when I'm running because I have some of my most clarity I thought\nI wanted him out by myself running and so I carry a digital recorder with me and I just dictate and today says I'm running\nAnd then type of my notes and you know even in each case that the only you know that the only real thoughts are those that occur while you're moving [laughter] and I you know so I can completely relate to what you're saying there\nWas so it's so true and and talk to us about the diet thing because you said you know eating really was a fundamental part of you and your performance and so talk about that ... that regiment you go through what you eat and what you do any more\nYeah so I I've really refined my died over the years and I've kind of self selected on um those foods that leave me with the most energy and\nFeeling the best um I eat more of those foods that you know leave me feeling lethargic and you know kind of dragged me down I've cut from my diet and I basically arrived at a place where eight no processed food nothing that that has to go through a machine or be refined so\nIt's ten till
