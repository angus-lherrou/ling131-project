ABC News\nWe continue with our conversation with Ryan Holiday his book perennial seller and here's Ryan telling the story of how stumbling onto a band influenced the rest of his life and the rest of his career\nIn two thousand one I I Would have been maybe fourteen years old and\nI was trying to illegally downloading Metallica song pirating site audio galaxy and I accidentally downloaded a song by the band iron maiden I don't remember what Metallica song I was trying to download but\nThe one that I did get is etched in my memory it was a song called hallowed be thy name by iron maiden and I couldn't have known as a Thirteen year old or a fourteen year old at that seven minutes song\nI think it's about condemn demand last night on earth that this song would take me on this strange journey that I see the band and many times over the next Seventeen years over many different presidents that that even contained within that so I Would the lessons that I Would help me make a living as a writer\nBut a few weeks ago I was in San Antonio and I saw I made in play\nSold out show it would have been you know twenty thousand people in the audience and next to the same friend that I remember telling on instant messenger about this ban that I just heard of\nAnd in front of us was this for a decade old heavy metal band from east London that since Nineteen Seventy\nFive and produce sixteen studio albums you know it doesn't live albums two dozen world tours literally thousands of concerts in sixty of countries that sold close to a hundred billion albums that hit number one five different times\nFifteen million social media followers\nTwo hundred and fifty million streams on spot fire which is more than prince or Madonna this is a band that hasn't been on the radio since will really ever\nAnd what iron maiden is what they inspired in me and why I think there are a lesson to most create is is that they are perennial in the sense that they have an audience\nThat they own that they perform exclusively for right so most fans are trying to put out a single to be on television to be on the radio to get new fans and an Iron Man they said that their lead singer Bruce Dickinson ... he said\nYou know we're like farmers we have our field and we're killing that field\nWe don't really care what's going on on these other fields\nThere's supposedly a story between\nThe lead singer of iron maiden manager of iron maiden and at an industry event and some young agent came up to them and said look I Know I admire he said this to iron man's manager he said I admire what you do it's just incredible or the success that you've had and and\nThe manager said to him you probably think that I'm In the music business and the guy said yeah of course and he said I'm not in the music business he said I'm In the iron maiden business\n... him what he meant is that he didn't care about trends are fads or whatever announces doing he didn't care about other acts even in their niche she only cared about this one band in about making something that's true for those fans and and something that that that they cared about and so as a writer I've always\nI've always taken a great lesson from that how how do you how do you not care what's going on around you and only care what those true fans want and need and how do you make something special that goes to some core part of the the human experience for them\nAnd make it so good that they want to invite other people to join that exclusive\nSort of community or Coulter club with you and and so when I was trying to ride in perennial sellers sort of a recipe for how to do that you know how to how to develop that\nThing you know step funds which I Would say and and obviously he lived many years before I made and he he would say that the most valuable thing\nFor an artist to achieve is a faithful following a reliable group of readers who looked forward to every book and bought it who trusted me and who's trust I must not disappoint\nThen I think that's wonderful advice whether you're you know a Baker or a mechanic or a best selling author or a multi platinum musician is how do you achieve that following and and build that platform that that's that's what the book is ultimately about\nLots to cover with Robert workman in sports\nMonday Night football Packers rally past the forty niners thirty three thirty to wrap
