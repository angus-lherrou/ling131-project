{"content": "Do the judge helping to seize this whole debacle mhm she declared a mistrial what in the world that removes films ... Chevy think they can ride horses into the courtroom\nThe judge said that we could only deliberate and the jury room they had to get the horses and to the jury room that's where the election for for a person was going to take place\nUsually for people for a jury you know just like elected by a raise our hands\nIt's a long story but Alexandria ... sees are worried about the trial she moved into Los Angeles county temporarily got called to this jury trial and ended up running for election for four person\n'cause this is this is crazy about that [laughter] watched him for personal or you campaign and stuff like\nThat what's crazy if I got fired for serving injury even though they didn't come to a verdict\nWere you specifically told that your employer didn't think the law covered your absence 'cause you know the jury didn't come to a verdict\nNo not ban but\nAt the unemployment hearing that enough ascent said he was tired of the dog bites dog fights shirt sensing ... an ... but the fixer set up the fight of fix or [laughter]\nWow that's not actually his name he's the foreman of the soy mountain assembly line I didn't know that at first but he was getting my coworkers Tibet on dog fights and the mixing room\nAs usual this raises many questions dogs and the mixing\nRoom and Perry mutual betting on dog fights which is animal cruelty\nI jumped fifty five gallons to go on the fixer when I\nWhen I found out what it was to me I hardly think that the punishment well kind of a mother would sweep all thought I was as if I ... the maker and a fixture into the U.S\n[laughter] you do have a point there\nI was okay with the Holly Holly races in the hallways or you know when I heard the plaza moving fast I just thought the fixer was exercising the bulls in the hallway\nDidn't you win any money on these races I usually broke even how many of your co worker has brought their dogs\nTo this food manufacturing plant\nLenny count ... ... ... most of production quality control upper management that check people\nThere were a lot of dogs at work if upper management was bringing the dogs to work presumably roaming around in the food manufacturing area of the work condoning this\nBut they told the unemployment judge the health department shut them down when I was on jury trial everybody who brought a dog to work with fired is that true\nWell I Know the health department at times and I know organic ostrich got in big trouble but they didn't fire everybody who brought their canine children to work your way to this thing\nSo train the people who weren't fired and the people who were who brought their canines to their place of employment\nLet's see\n[noise] you know all the winners were fired every mom and dad and the fights winners and the races\nI\nRetaliated against us because our dogs one our dogs are winners\nAnd I mean me and I was fired I Am the mother of winners\nMy children are winners [noise] I don't think at our gang hostage\nLike my boss meats and if they kept me\nMiss dogma should we\nStill too maybe this is a mixed motives case you know the timing was terrible they fired\nYou instead of letting you work after you're a jury heard that but there's a little bit of an sanitary conditions here with bringing dogs to work too\nYeah I'm an ... selling would be good for the balls they fired me because the bulls are winners they did as a favor\nOh right you're listening to the Carl Garber workplace\nLawyer show and what you've heard is actually not that much different than the way a lot of clients react a lotta times they come in all I Want to be suing for being fired I got fired wrongfully and then they kind of decide quickly that they shouldn't\nAnd a lot of these cases involve a lesson clear cut situation here obviously if you fire someone the minute they come back from jury service it certainly sounds like they got fired for sitting on a jury which is a violation of California labor code two thirty\nAnd it said no no you can sue for wrongful termination of violation labor code to thirty but if there's something else going on at work like someone is bring a dog to work at a manufacturing facility for food products and there\nHave dogs that are barking a lot like we've heard on this show and they're getting into fights with average dogs and it's becoming a problem that would be caused the fire someone in many places of employment\nAnd so you have to say why was this person fire where they fired for going on jury service or were they fired because they were bringing their dog to work in a food manufacturing business and all that and then\nIf that is the case Mm uh oh yeah that would be what's called the mixed motives case a mix motive case is when there is a legitimate reason for firing somebody from the job but there's also a legitimate reason and\nThe law kind of change and it says if it's a mixed motives you might still have a case but I think in the real world of jury deliberations the jury would just say look what was it was this woman fired for going on jury service or fired for Viagra things that they're going to fire if these are things\nWhat happened you know a long time ago she's been bringing the dog to work for a long time why did they have to wait to the minute she came back from jury duty and so that is one possible\nWay a case could come down like that they also could be looking at um other situations going on in the workplace like doesn't really matter if his job exists anymore because the whole company got shut down by the health department so\nEven if there was this great wrongful termination case the company got shut down but not having wants to fire itself\nIt Keith becoming more and more of a mystery and investigation about why someone has fired if you were fired from your job sexually harassed discriminated against the work on a lot of wages I'd like to talk to you off Eric eight seven seven five to five zero seven hundred\nOnce again eight seven seven five to five zero seven hundred that's eight seven seven\nFive to five zero seven hundred I'm Carl Gerber and I really do represent employees statewide in California and what's funny is\nI was talking to a client this week she didn't realize that I'm the same person on the show because I guess my demeanor off the show was very different than on this show as a real lawyer the taste cases very seriously so\nThat's a interesting phenomena but we try to make these episodes funny stuff that you can remember some of the absurd hypotheticals\nAnd we want to entertain you so we're heard every Sunday night from seven to eight on this station and you should also listen to old episode that Carl Garber on the k._b._c. website or it workplace lawyer dot org or any of us sounds sharing places [noise]\nIt's been nice having you listen I'll talk to you next week on the car Gerber workplace lawyer shows [noise]\nLike\nIn\nThis show furnished by Harlem River and employment lawyers

or a dictatorship of a far quad which is this guy's got his own issues which will get into basically advantage does anything weird as kind of you\nKnow there's a lot of ah metaphors here or there is no God he is compensating for that point\nSo these fairy tale creatures are banished to his swamp so he's got his whole motivation as well I don't want these people in my land a I got to get my swamp back\nAnd along the way he meets donkey which is a talking donkey um any sort of saved his life and I'm ... much ... chagrin dog he becomes is\nFriend what he likes to talk to you don't actually becomes as therapists and actually if I see my movie where the ... line down and donkeys behind him the only thing missing is a ...\nHave you very much for therapy [laughter] that's true although that was my therapist I Would search\n[laughter] I Know I read the other fairy tale crews from ... yeah and so they go in this adventure travel or you can't and that's why I Would be an issue any people to lie to me um [laughter]\nAnd shows on this journey\nTo go on this journey and they they ... the only way I'll get it back as if he rescues this princess for lord far ... so he takes on the task again\nUnder the guise to get his swam back he's not looking to connect with people he's not looking to shatter that worldview along the way he meets a princess and uh and obviously him and donkey become closer it's his first and only friend and um I don't want to spoil the ending\nBut you know uh some butterflies flapping their wings and their ... and uh they they fall in love with this princess and unbeknownst to Shrek\nPrincess Fiona is like half time ogre at\nNight [laughter] you know again I Want to point oh there's so many psychological metaphors here is that you know he feels rejected he goes in to that depresses the ashes of the swamp\nAnd then he has someone who saves him princess Fiona take them out of the but in the process she's also serving herself exactly which a lot of therapists tend to do with their patients will return we will go there [laughter] so I wanted to ask you Alison I'm\nA little bit about your own history and how you know one of the questions I'd gone when people found the actors were coming on the show because they wanted to know a little bit above the craft how you connected to princess Fiona and how you were able to sort of portrays up to the world\nYeah well um\nTo give you a little bit of Jimmy I'm absolutely a so she's a print that she was born a princess and she is also and she's seven years old she is locked away in a tower of trauma yes because she's told by her parents that this is what princesses do they wait\nAnd its power all alone until a prince come and rescue her so her for Twenty years she's in this hour reading fairy tale stories about other princesses who you know\nWaited and waited and and finally got their happy ending and so she has learned that that's how a princess lives her life and I'm\nSo those are the gender roles I'm going to keep acting as therapists those are the gender roles she learns to except\nExactly and you know she's expecting it so these very tell stories to tell her for help and to have to act and look and they have to be beautiful and they they have to stand this way and taught this land in this way and\nThe the man who's going to come rescue her has to be handsome and strong and so she's she's completely by the book and she is\n[noise] so what she learns in the process we're going to take a break in the ... which are a lot of our listeners are dealing with two is in order to deal with her life she's got to think outside the box and she was going to be a little creative and how she find solutions but if you watch\nThe movie and I know it's in the play too that there's a

with us\nSo okay so so Fiennes shut away in the tower for basically her whole life um the other side of her story is that when she was young a which cast a spell on her\nAnd every night she transformed into an ogre\nI'm and she has also learned that that is not how it princess should look and you know any of her ... instincts should be suppressed because that's just not the storybook malls that she needs to fit into\nSo she she lives in that sort of the darker side of herself that shadow that recall psychology and that's really their oversight and in order to become more if you have to learn to accept that part of herself\nYes exactly but um\nSo how did you approached role as an actress when you were dealing with those issues\nWell I think personally it's ... it's such a big deal in life to learn to stop caring about what other people think about you and how other people view and to really live\nIn your truth and own who you are\nEverything that makes you unique and that's such a big part of you on his journey is breaking free as the the print tests mold and accepting that maybe\nHer ogre side is a little more of her ... and her she really and where she gets her power from you know if it's learning to break that persona down and actually connecting to sort of the deeper side of yourself in that you become a little bit more whole\nYeah exactly and I and

Harry ... character you could think of you know in the show we have no ...\nWe have the big bad wolf we have to like in which there whites yeah we we just you know it's it's it's it's multi cultural fairy tale\nUm and I was saying so they all live in this world of the show and lord far quiet wants perfection in the world so he banish is all of these fairy tale characters who have their quirks and\nYou know they're they're uniqueness as and and everything and and he managed to them because they don't fit into his perfect mold and his\nPerception of what he thinks the world should be instead of to understand that a multi cultural perspective a lauded turns can enrich us\nExactly and not limit us he calls them freaks and he gets rid of them right and um what I think it's a smart about that the writing of the show is that the audience comes into the show with ...\nThe notions about these characters because we've all heard their stories before we know them very well you know Nokia wants to be a real boy and he lives in his ... and you know so well everyone who comes to see the show comes in with\nA preconceived notion about who these characters are and it's revealed in the story that either are all rumor is that we've all been told about how how they are about their personalities and and the big bad wolf isn't big and bad and the wicked\nWitch you know she she the nice lady\nWho had a heart trial she's trying to have you got wolf is a drag queen we knew that [laughter]\nSo how many I on the way wrote down these\nHalloween CIA [laughter] [laughter]\nI I Want to see that all you see it [laughter]\nUm but that's what I go ahead anyway yeah so I'm so along the way somebody wrote down these stories and it's been passed down to everybody who's ... and I'm so talented the audience to change\nTheir perceptions of who these characters are and it it\nAnd I'm going to have this you know I I've been holding on to this I couldn't think of a better time for this show to happen right now given what we're dealing with in this country that a lot of times you know we have to break these preconceived notions we have to be more accepting of people that we may that may frighten us because they come from cultures that we don't understand\nBut a ... again that's why I think it's so powerful that I'm going to just say Trent you and I were talking about that to this whole idea that these characters because I mean these are fairytale characters\nThat lord far corps has a problem with the just mansions them instead of trying to grow and challenging himself which is exactly what we're dealing with in this country to make us more rich\nSo what I was wondering you sort of talk about that seemed to me at the commercials all the good stuff\nI don't want to share it with our audience to\nYeah absolutely well I think I think especially with lord far quiet bashing these people I mean that's you can't not look at the parallels that we face yeah current\nPolitical other how reason to go see they could actually well and it's true it's that and he ... it's hard to say in this show whether all the people that live in his kingdom agree with them or not there I was so afraid of them\n[laughter] because I I Know in the movies are signs like applause yeah and I think yeah exactly\nAnd he has total control and it's just it's all based off these antiquated notions of that these people are bad or good or weird or different as opposed to strengthening you know a community with diversity they they want to get rid of anything not along that doesn't align with them because they're afraid of ultimately afraid right and\nAnd makes me sad because in the you know lord\nFor ... ... ... ... ...\nYeah uh I can spell it in my head I pronounce I've I have dyslexia brain [laughter] I'm\nHis idea of his own insecurities which happens law and that this was a great compensation\nAbsolutely yeah and he he's he's clearly and it's great 'cause we get the dive into those insecurities in the in the musical which man I Wish we had that opportunity and\n... and you share a little bit of that we already ... boiler alerts and now the\nLearning to embrace what makes them a weird and and funny and that's interesting an interesting and that's that's unique unique mhm that yeah ...\nAnd in that we're all United like we're all just in the fact that we all have a unique things that's something that we're all there's a lot we can unite over in the fact that we are similar to each other in fact we all have our own different things nobody's excluded from that\nAnd ah I I couldn't I couldn't agree with you more I was just thinking about that that that's the message so many times I'm trying to get to my clients and patience to is that those things a lot of times that you feel are so unacceptable to the world\nAre the things a lot of times it can make you so much stronger and yes there will be people along the line who won't accept it and will run from it but eventually you're gonna find those people that connect and those people will say you were a lot longer [noise] um we we have uh our last segment so I wanted to ask you\nWant me to start with Patrick I wanted to ask you again can you share that information of how people can find out about the show\nYeah um you cannot it's we like I said we open October Nineteen switches friday and we will play through October twenty eighth\nOr it isn't the civic arts plaza in Thousand Oaks and you can either go to a five star theatrical dot com to get tickets you can get tickets at the box office or you can call five star theatrical is I think you have the number I don't know off yes I Will get that while you keep talking um\nAnd uh and I strongly strongly recommend them into the great thing about this show is an this musical is that it appeals to every member ... it has some deep issues as we've been talking about for the last hour but\nIt also appeals to kids that has so much humor in it and so much fun\nBut it but it but again it's for the whole family because the parents will get as we've been discussing so much more pay us out of it ... out of what is these people are about an about people being different and that's OK to be different and um and yet the kids have a chance to like I said party which track\nAnd field and ... and the rest of the fairy tale character so it really offer something up for the whole family\nAnd a lot of times you know I think also it's powerful for parents and reason because the the show is it gives them something to relate to their kids about so they can actually communicate with their kids through these characters uh as far as learning a lot of a very important life lessons yeah I I said makes it makes life it accessible\nYeah I said earlier there's a lyric in the show that were struck says that fairy tales should really be updated [laughter] I agree and I and I do I I agree with that too I mean the world needs to be updated\nAnd I think the owners should be running for president ... how would you up to your ... your ... of put you on the spot\nWell well I think I don't I don't have to really go too far because I mean I don't I don't want to give away the end of the south [laughter] but um you know they're maybe I shouldn't\n...\nUm well at the end of the show Fiona chooses to be the oversight of herself right in the movie too right right that's true that's\nI mean that it's the acceptance of that yeah and it's it's ...\nYeah that's what I Love about it because you you talked about expectation you expected to become the princes in the end she's even surprised when she turns around and go what happened I'm Still an ogre and truck because that's a good thing\nExactly and it's not until he ... he sees her in that way that she accepts set for herself and because of the way that he loves her\nAnd I think that's such a powerful message for young women to have right now is is that the power and self except and I'm\nWondering Trent what are your thoughts about you know we've talked about so many themes psychological things what do you think of one in your in your opinion a powerful theme that you've you want our audience to understand about the Trump sure\nUm I was going to say one more thing I Do think that's funny what am I [laughter] I think it's hilarious as as a moment in uh in regards to see on a donkey figures out the secret that she's\nA an ogre at night far before Shrek does and I think it's funny that Fiona is scared of Shrek an ogre knowing that she is an ogre [laughter]\nSo I find that I find that dynamic when we're ... I I just saw the movie again yeah so she's that she's like you can't tell Shrek that I've become an ogre at night and nobody can know even those records another ... self an ogre so that fear of like I like coming out as an ogre right in front of an interesting dynamic that if\nYou really have to a coming of journey could be saying like coming out as a gay per ... wanting the gay person to know yeah exactly and the interesting thing that keeps me in business\nYeah [laughter] [laughter] I never really thought about getting myself\nThinking of which I have something to us no [laughter] oh why oh I've got to take it back [laughter] um\nBut I think I you know the main thing is is is we aren't ... we're all different um that's a good thing the things that you tell yourself are probably not true because you don't know whether or not\nYou were just the same as everybody else and ... and some essence you know rich poor or whatever um you know fat than pretty not for all the same\nHuman mind whether you want to pretend like you are not you know whether you think you are you on mosque or you know whatever like you were all on the same level playing field and um why why would you not choose happiness and then the one thing I Do love at the end and I don't think there's a spoiling us that\nShrek kind of has everybody ended up living on a swamp and in a way he's now being of surface to people and finding himself happy and he's being of service to his friends and like\nJust certain what Patrick talked about earlier about teaching the same ... exactly\nAnd like within that um I've heard this many times but esteem mobile acts you know create self esteem and so I think that's one of the the the most powerful parts of the the story is that you know that starts with loving yourself but once you can do that and you are now\nBeing a service to people and and and inviting people into your heart and saying what can I Do for you or um how can I be of health is is really the most powerful thing you can do\nAnd a lot of times that's the powerful myth of the connection by helping other people you're also connecting to yourself much deeper ways and that is the creative process yeah that's a so important\nTo talk about you know we only have a few minutes left so I'm going to go and talk to Patrick [laughter] we have two minutes I was told so quickly a final thoughts that you'd want our audience about the show\nThe shows about about love the true love it's about forgiveness it's about humility it's about being yourself um those are all the I think the things that you know we as people\nCould learn from I agree with that and announcing your thought\nOh man [laughter]\nReally light of that but um yeah\nSelf love loving loving who you are and accepting who you are and and I'm allowing other people to lift you up when when you when you can't see yourself that way but the but they see something in you and and just the power of uniting over\nOver that yeah I couldn't agree with you more on that that sense of uh we keep talking about it but it's so important to reiterate it to our audience to the sense of self acceptance\nAnd print your final thought get over your trust that show [laughter] live your life [laughter] okay well let's let me give you that information again it's October nineteenth October twenty eight to ...

their backyard or to make a legal garage conversion into a living space and this is a new California law so joining us on the line right now is California state senator Bob ... senator welcome back to seven Ninety KBC thanks for joining us\nWell thanks for having me on KABC it's good to be back\nYeah it's great to have you back so let's talk a little bit about this law because I think many people have yet to learn about it and that's why we're doing this radio show is to try to educate homeowners what they can and cannot do what they're existing home so if you can just shed some light on the opportunities for homeowners\nYeah so what we did is we found out that you know there's a lot of barriers to constructing accessory ... eighty use you know the mother in law units we change the label of them so that they become an accessory to your house not a second unit\nSo that we got we eliminate some of the barriers that local governments did and what we basically said it said everybody has a right to build an eighty you on their house\nIf they're within a half mile of transit and that that you had an it was a permissive Yusuf had an absolute right to do it if you had a bus stop within half mile of your house and we saw just in Los Angeles\nYou know and in two thousand sixteen when we pass this law there were eighty permits that were approved by the city for eighty years\nOne year later last year in two thousand Seventeen there were two thousand applications while there was just it just sky rocket so I had another build this past year a Senate bill a three one which would have further eliminated some of the\nBarriers and I'm Talking about impact fees you go there you're ready to build them and you find out that your city wants to charge you thirty thousand dollars I'm an amnesty program to allow people a pathway to legalize their units that you know there's studies are saying there's three hundred thousand on permit it you know it's just in LA county just in LA there's\nThere's three hundred of these bootleg unit so we have a temporary setback but the enthusiasm and that does that your listeners and the whole state of California is tremendous if people want to find out more about an eighty you how they can build it at their existing house and what the local agencies how they can help now they can stop them\nIs there anything that you can talk about regarding some of the local cities and towns that may try to maybe block what the state has already approved and and what happens if you encounter some of those road blocks what what is your one do\nWas one of the things is that we said that they you know we put into you had to prove a permit within a hundred and twenty days okay\nAnd if we said that if you're in law was\nInconsistent with the Senate filled that we pass than it was ... which means that the state law prevail in this local jurisdictions and many of the city attorney said in the city managers they just ignored it and the housing and community development agency and the state's contacted them and said your law is inconsistent your local law\nIs void you can't stop these people from getting the permits and they've just avoided them Santa Barbara was a big problem lots lots of other cities because they had provisions that you know like they said well you know we we don't allow any secondary units and we said no you can't there by the bus line they should be able to do it so\nThe new bill that we're going to be introducing in December I'm going to introduce another bill to get this done is going to hold these local agencies accountable and the\nThis department of housing community that film which is which is our state agency they're going to have authority to review the ordinances and submit written critiques of why this ordinances void\nAnd then they're going to notify the attorney general who is going to have the power to actually force the cities to comply with state law and order issue the building permit and then we'll we'll get to do is we're going to move the hundred and ...\nIt's day period down to sixty three because it's actually been the law in the state of California cities just supposed to review your permits within sixty days I did some more research and found out when I took an amendment that the actual laws sixty days we're going to go back to what the law is to make the cities and the counties complies\nSo we know it's a problem and I think I got the language that's got to help the homeowner if through this turtle if you've got the cities that are still blocking
