and southeastern Virginia\nThat rain is going to be renewing flooding problems across parts of North Carolina and South Carolina especially the eastern half of the states that there's going to be a

storm is moving northward we could see a chance for some tornadoes as well and that's going to be a possibility throughout the especially the eastern Carolinas but not as much in the western half of those north and South Carolina\nWe're also going to be looking at rainy weather in general in through the north east as a cold front is pushing eastward and that is going to be able to bring

thoughts\nI Know the relative speed with which Michael surged a short compared let's say with the Florence the last notable storm which was virtually guilty of loitering why the difference\nWell hurricanes or or like ... and the stream where um the stream as a kind of their background atmosphere flow of scaring the storm in case of Florence is kind of slow me entering streams so state over a long a period or an area over a long period of time\nOr as a Michael is in a fast moving stream and is there for moving quickly to the north\nI gather that the terms of wind velocity there's no

are not related ride\nRight to to aren't related yeah\nA storm surge again or is there a loitering stormed more likely to cause more in the way of water damage than one that moves rapidly\nIt
