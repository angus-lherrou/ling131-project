I can go and I can put their name in and I can\nSay this law is going to work on this I on Saturday from eleven AM to next Wednesday at Fort Pierre okay\nAnd you put the person's name and their and then what's also interesting is that you have a full log of when they when they come and go or eggs actually when they come into the building so you'll know exactly who's coming in at what time okay [noise]\nUm and you can program this remotely program this right on the Internet\nOr you can do it within an app I have found that the easiest way is to use the leg lock if not the best of luck it's an inexpensive lock if you're looking for them all the best of luck with more bells and whistles there's something called the August pro Gen\nAnd the August ... is the best but\nWhen you start looking at locks that they have different system so you ... you can't just buy the lock and it goes on the Internet\nIs that you buy the lock and then it connects to a hub okay and so you have like a smart things have or you have what what I have is the next year up okay\nAnd then within the next the Hubbard is where things have you'll find that there are other things that you can do so like if you wanted certain lights to come on in the middle you know say from eleven PM to six am when nobody's there so at least illuminates maybe less likely for somebody to break in\nIs that you can program the lights for that if you had certain cameras you could do that as well if you were worried about a water damage when nobody's actually there and it's snowing and the pipes are freezing you know what I'm saying\nAnd that there are water detection sensors you could also put in there that you can get alerts so one sure once you get the hub Charles what I'm saying is that once you get the hobby started

power\nA time in Scottsdale, Arizona a low there\nTom blow their Kim what's going on well I have a question\nUh uh I'm just give it a little set up here I'm a dentist and ah have a a website that I have one son line right now what I'm trying to put together for another part of my practice and I've been toying with the idea of putting a check a function not sure what you call it\nA in the website to where people could ask questions before they came in and the question I Would have for you is it is a beneficial or that you you would do is just\nSo easy to do and of course what kind of back up to I Need to have as far as employment of people to support that are the questions and what have you\nAlways ... yeah all really good questions by the way Tom I'm you know we read deployed shop dot commando dot com\nAnd uh you know we put a chat function in the shopping website oh my gosh it's amazing\nYou know uh how how many people have basic question than him by you having a human being there it really will help with your return on your investment are you thinking that you're going to get overwhelmed by these questions\nWell obviously I have to have someone to play so I just recently was approached by a company that said they would do is they would have ah\nThey employ individuals to support the ah the ... function somehow that would work because they would give me thirty quite or I Would give them thirty questions ... ... a perspective of clients would ask them to know so the third question so I Would give them the interest as well so\nAs I as a person would call him they would get a hold of this company and they would have if they asked a question though she they had the the canned answer that I've already given but of course are those soon 'cause she goes oh those sort of question\nYeah and say here's the reason why I'm hesitating fact is that I think if you were dealing with a product okay and I'm not saying that you're dentistry is not a product\nBut you're also providing a very personalized service right but and I don't know if that would work with a personalized service such as yours doctor I'm like we we looked into that for the shop to but part of us\nIn our businesses that I Want people to know that you know we're with them right we're not a bunch of robots that they can depend upon us they can trust us and to a large extended that I have to trust you with my family members and friends and also with myself for my oral history and my real hygiene right so so\nI Would be hesitant to doing that I Would put a check up on the website and see what kind of volume that you get and you you are able to turn it off you can say that it's only available from eight to five so maybe there's a gallery guy in the office that you could say you know what you're going to get it a couple of hours a day you're going to get a couple of hours a day a couple of hours a day\nAnd you may find that you are truly in fact getting the same\nThe ... time and time again of which then you know that you need to put maybe a different button on the website make something more prominent or maybe there could be part of those thirty questions later on\nBut I think you'll find that the volume isn't going to be that high and the people that will that you will engage will be people that you can convert to a a paying client\nBecause they're going to feel that human touch now when you start looking at different chat depending upon where you get your website it may already be built in as a function may cost you a couple of hundred or maybe a couple of bucks a month for that\nIf you're building your site from scratch they have names like than desk chat is free uh there's also a live chat and there's also live agent um are you building the side or somebody building for you\nAh yes well the the we do have a a website it's already been built and we have another company building or another website all over again but but when we have a third tempting as telling me about that in this chat function\nAnd I don't I wouldn't I wouldn't add I wouldn't let the third party do it yet I Would I Would I Would just I Would encourage you just to test the waters seem kind of questions you get\nAnd then you can also listen to those questions under FA cues as part of the website but if you have a person behind this instead of an automated robot and I know that there's a lot of AI that's happening in chats and bought and things like that\nOr is that you're able to say you know now that I've helped you can we make an appointment right now the doctors able to see you next Tuesday so then we can immediately convert that inquiry into a paying customer thank you so much for your call come right back we're going to talk about browsing without all the bad news
