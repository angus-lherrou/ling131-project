money tip is moments away it's ten free things at every Amazon Prime member gets you don't want to miss this back to the phones we go with a let's see him in young ville Louisiana\nTim hey how are you I'm fantastic how can I help you today sir\nI got a three part question right yeah\nMy question it's a ... to ... all along reputation management I guess my first thought would be like what would be the best ... that I can find for small medical office and also what I was looking at it those\nOr a I'm a software that you ... and then the the the oldest search engine optimization have to go with oil all ...\nAll right well let's talk a little bit so so what's going on with your business on line\nAll the problem with some of it\nIs obviously what most of us have is you know if you have as many good reviews that go on line to help you out right that they would balance it out but obviously it doesn't work that way you know the people who have experience it's usually doesn't go online and put both the\nPositive experiences with you at your business [noise] so what happened here it's mostly the negative responses that are starting to add up more than than the positive responses to what I Need to do is find something someone to neutralize the negative responses that happened to my business a lot\nOkay All right so here's the deal before I Would contract with any reputation type management firm okay is I Would encourage you to do this yourself because\nYou may be able to do it more effectively and do exactly what they do ... and then you will further understand how this all works okay\nBecause as a as a small business owner and I'm a small business owner too is that you know you it's one thing tell somebody do a job it's another thing tell somebody to do the job when you've already done the job right\nAnd so what I Would do is it is are these on like Yelp or where where is it so I'm Glad for\nAll the medical or it's like ... grade the car okay all leading the example\nOkay so okay you a couple of things you can do number one to mitigate the negative you have to accelerate the positive okay\nSo anybody who comes in they should be given a card from the gal the front desk that says we appreciate positive reviews so with their ... and on your receipt it says we appreciate positive reviews think of every touch point that you have with that client\nAnd tell them that you appreciate positive reviews okay because I guarantee that if you start telling them that this is what you need this is what you want to switch you appreciate this is what you're thankful for you know if they had a great time they're happy to do that\nAnd you know if somebody says gosh you know gosh doctor you just saved my life I mean I never looked and felt so great ever before because they know can you help on line and\nJust drop some rep in there and I think over time say four to six weeks you'll find that those positive reviews are now outweighing the negative reviews\nOkay okay so that's the ... the other thing you can get let me finish\nThe other thing you can do is with health grades as drop them a note and say I don't agree with this negative review I'd like to be able to respond to it\nAnd what I have heard is that when you do this that health grades will remove it health grades also has a program called recognize Dr status\nAnd that'll put you at the top and then it will also you'll have because now you're having more positive reviews you'll be able to get that recognition there okay um there are some sites and it's nothing other than an extortion scam\nI get I get it\nBut where if you pay them a certain fee\nThat they will spotlight your business you'll have more tools available to you you'll have other ways to say I want this review to be front and center and I don't want to be I don't want this review to be on the top anymore\nSo\nSo in answer to your question instead of signing up with a service to do this and I haven't heard a lot of good positive feedback from people who have signed up for the service and that's why I'm encouraging you refer you to do it yourself\nWell though is that to to accentuate that positive okay and to work with search engine optimization\nAnd to learn what it is before you hire affirmed because there are so many scammers out there who purport to know everything about as CEO and they say over five thousand dollars we'll put you at the top of the Google Search results that well right All right well you know you can be at the top of the Google Search results right now\nHe presents would to

driving future\nAll right I just hope it when they open source of all they\nDo a better job of that than actually building the cars so governments are trying to get involved to putting controls around these self driving cars or I the D O D can even change the default password on a computer controlling warheads and as far as Tesla's go\nI'd be shocked if they were in business just a few years from now\nBut I don't tell you there's a lot of self driving car news this past week and you may have heard of the way that is Google's self driving taxis right\nAnd it's rolling out across the United

bit more about\nThe noise is four years in the making\nAnd it was designed specifically to be audible by pedestrians but\nNot heard by anybody inside the car\nAnd this is funny the first the technicians developed as down that was like they say a size five space craft but they had to shelve it because people when the car was driving by they would look up in the sky rather than at the road so back to the lab they when they came up with a brand new down\nAnd it's a minute former speaker located behind the front and grilled since we heard in every direction so let's take a listen to the
