southern migrant caravan continues to approach the American border and both sides on the side of the other side of evil on it the illegal immigrant caravan continues to move up through Mexico there about a thousand miles from the border right now probably less on there that had only ten thousand people are walking toward the border\nThe folks who are in that care of and as I said I think many of them are looking for a better life\nThey're looking to come into the United states that doesn't mean that the United states has to admit all of those people or any of those people the United states to pick and choose who we decided to admit to the country and yet this is Catherine the great moral issue if you believe that America should secure it's more of this means the or racist and nasty and bigoted and terrible and if you believe that people should be admitted to the country\nBecause they need a better place to live than this because you don't care about America's interests the truth is that people who believe in free flow of immigration even for a while the legal immigration generally they believe that that make the country better because\nOn a moral level we have to uphold certain charitable instinct\nI disagree with that assessment that that's where that's coming from and from people say we have to take care of or that is also coming from a good place it's coming from the idea that any country in the wishes to preserve its strength that can help other people have to have limits on who gets to enter the country\nSo again there's a way to explain this debate and which we examine everybody ...\nIt's it's hard to do that in a polarized political environment so President Trump\nHe uh he had said about the illegal immigrant caravan that there were random middle Easterners in the middle of it and criminals in the middle of it it turns out there may be criminal I'd be shocked if they're not criminals in the middle of that people have been convicted of crimes and deported for now trying to come back and there's no evidence of of random middle Easterners and he was asked about it here was his statement in response\nWill be [noise]\nExistence of anything but they could very well\nHey there could very well be is not a good answer to an accusation he made about people who are trying to come into the United states again that is a political tactic by the president in order to get people to talk about the ... pie in criminality of the folks who are in that march\nBut it is one it's another way of polarizing ... his wife had both right and left are responsible for what's happening right now in the country I'm not going to pretend that this is only on one side for my own political purposes I just don't think that's on it\nAt the same time you see the response to that which is Jorge Ramos who sat there no Middle Eastern Easter is in the Caribbean and Tucker is like um there are so criminals and that caravan and Jorge Ramos is right that they're no middle Easterners like well now you're deliberately missing the point in order to castigate the other side of the ...\nI spent two days with these refugees and I haven't seen a single person from the middle east that's alive and I think a sober you up [noise]\nYou have to tell the truth through your audience and you don't have you have to make sure that [noise] um [noise] people are not lying about this kind of on because [noise] people from the middle east are not part of the one he let me their\nStupidity on one side rescue putting you on the other one the president says they're middle Easterners without evidence for part of the ... and ... says well there are no middle Easterners that means the caravans good\nThis is not the central argument in any way shape or form obviously\nCentral argument about the caravan is whether the United states ought to have more that are protected or whether the United states is obligated by morality and decency an international walk let people freely across the border making that latter cases Tom ... is the head of the DNC and this gets down to the root of the issue and this is where Americans really shouldn't be decided in the ocean on the basis of stupidity is about middle Easterners and a caravan\nBut on the basis of what are the values we wish for holding the country and how do we protect the country but\nThere are some press getting the wrong answer Jake Tapper on CNN\nWe are a nation of laws and the laws that are on the books\nDeal with issues of refugees and asylum status and those are the laws that have always applied a it's a humanitarian issue of significance and our laws require that people will be treated with dignity and given that process\nOkay well they are given that profit they can go to any checkpoint that they wish to go to and they can apply for asylum in the United states again the implication by Tom per se or a little bit is that folks on the other side I don't want to treat people who are trying to cross the border illegally with dignity\nThat is inherently unfair all go in and they seem of today's show and what should be the theme of our politics if we want to have serious discussions both on the other side we have to cut out the idea that they are inherently bad evil folks were manifesting that bad and that evil in ways designed to destroy the country all of us have to stop and we don't stop it and things are going to get a lot worse\nBefore they get any better we'll be back here tomorrow with\nAll the latest maybe we'll know Seventy ... white certainly bring you updates on the bench here [laughter]\n[laughter] Los Angeles orange Mueller station [noise]\nTalk radio seven Ninety ABC News alive and\nLocal at ten o'clock I'm Joe Myers the FBI is reportedly looking for a possible seven target of suspicious packages that may be an explosive device this would address to former vice president Joe Biden NBC reports just already thinking maybe on his way back to a return address\nWe do nothing except these were suspicious packages we have no idea who sent them we have no idea what the political motivation is behind it we still don't know whether these were alive bombs are not Eric as you and I write have brought about when we looked at this\nBy the way the national review also we just mentioned Andrew McCarthy's column but the national review had a story last uh last night that said that both the bomb and the powder were harmless than they quoted a social one ... CNN\nYeah the one side to CNN yes the one that was sent to to CNN was um [noise] uh the powder was harmless and\nBut when you read the actual Associated Press story and you and I are looking at each other's said man you've got a parks everything these days yeah you got to be very careful could be it says the powder the outer right without her along with the bomb right\nThat was and it it was a ... there's ... there's nowhere in the story or any other source that we've seen that says that authorities say that the or any stores says that the\nA suspicious package that was sent there the explosive device potentially explosive device was was harmless ... it's just the powder the powder according to a source ...\nRight at an early in the day the NYPD had bad that the um\nUh that the uh the ... there was the the the suspected pipe bomb\nAnd another powder right mhm which was you know whether whether it would be you know I I don't know rice or would they suspected might be right center you know who knows [noise] um\nBut it that that turned out to be harmless National Review has the story that both the bomb and the powder are harmless were harmless and we looked at you know who they source for that which was Associated Press and Associated Press nowhere in their says yeah that the that their sources that the bomb was was harmless but we don't know whether the bottom was harmless or not because\nFrom what I've seen and what I have read the FBI has not come out and said these were bomb no no these were allied bombs ready to go ...\nIn nature um and and so you know potentially harmful devices these are the phrase is they've been using the authorities have been using but the media's been using because the ... what is the media do inevitably\nThey bring on as they're covering this live they bring on you know somebody who was an explosives expert and then they look at it except they're not on site looking at it they have no idea what they're looking at really except for what it appears to be\nAnd\nAnd so the the the point being is that we have no idea what's going on here so I suppose it is somebody that supports the president\nAnd the Republicans well you just heard the side that you support if that's if that's\nFound out we have no idea what it is but if that's the case in that somebody who just write a less than two weeks before a major election\nYou just hurt their chances\nAnd and by the end and so when you you look at it as we said I mean this is a and we've said this all along but there was a rush rush in collusion or a case like this we look at it from the investigative ... your point of view and if you're an investigator and you're looking at something like this ah and you know some of the questions that you're thinking of\nA based on the fact that you have a lack of information and nobody has said that these were actually live bombs where you say okay\nUh when we find out if they were you know live bombs ... well then you know that without question was an attempt to kill these people that would end so right you go from it from you go from it from that point of view trying to figure that out if it was\nThey find out that none of the bombs were active\nThat none of the bombs had any potential of going off\nThen you look you would be looking I Believe that two different things or if you're looking at it from an investigator's point of view which would be All right this was a scare tactic to either scare these people or it was political in nature mhm it was meant\nJust a couple of weeks before an election to help drive which is again something that you would have to look at it was to help drive the the motivation here was to help\nDrive an election to a a certain side mhm and at that point you would look at it and say well it's if they did this to help Trump did to help from\nAnd then you would look at it from the other side which was okay\nAh this was to set up Trump and make it look suspicious because of the things that Trump has said the provocative things he has said and help change the the uh public discourse to blaming Trump as that's at like I said it has that started already without any\nEvidence whatsoever but that's the most incredible thing with the media starts talking about whether it's you know soccer whatever yesterday from CNN it going after the you know going after the president going after the right talking about the divisive\nComments out there will nothing could ... be more divisive than accusing another side or a person\nBlaming them for something where there is a complete lack of evidence as to the motivation\nOf the person or persons who did a particular deed mhm they don't they don't they're not jumping in China and the signing on to something nothing could be nothing could be more device them so as they sit there on their high horse screaming that your devices\nThey had committed the ultimate sins and divisiveness not\nWell Hillary comes out and says we must be more civil just days after saying there's no way to be civil with the other side\nThat it's not possible she shut the door on that just days ago well look this this is where we\nWe have the conversation but it's ridiculous and I say it's ridiculous for for this reason uh after steep skull east was shot and you had a man who was a Bernie Sanders supporter\nWho's goal was to assassinate and kill and he uh he did not succeed in doing it thank thank goodness to the Capitol police but his goal was to kill as many Republican members of Congress as possible\nWould you say that that has brought down the divisive rhetoric on the left over the last year and\nNo no no\nAnd none of it's going to all of this is to get a political advantage one way or another what you're hearing yesterday is about getting a political advantage because you cannot debate the point that we've just made\nThat the most divisive you have these people sitting in their ivory towers the media elite ivory towers claiming that they care about civility and they are anti divisive\nThat's what they're about and they have the divisiveness that exist today and then they commit the ultimate sin of divisiveness and that is to blame somebody for potentially you know a a terrorist attack\nWould they complete lack of evidence to back up their claim there is no evidence of either way there's no one and we may not have it for a long time and the fact is they don't see that\nNo they don't they don't see that they don't and it's obvious anybody who is a political hack understands how obvious it is\nSo not really much more to talk about I mean it it's we either there's a will there's a again a we've said this many times on topics that we are ignorant about which means topics that we don't have the facts on mhm not much you can\nSay the only thing we can report or the the few facts that we do have a total rewrite seven yeah now suspicious packages according to the FBI or they were sent to you know prominent members or or or uh or backers of the Democrats and so\nThat's all we can say that's it that's all we know about it\nAnd as soon as they release it more information will you know will pass that along when we know the whole story if we ever know the whole story\nThat we can talk about it but right now\nAbout without knowing the motivation unless that person comes forward and tells us what the motivation was\nWe can't assign it to anything we have no idea absolutely no idea no idea\nAnd\nSo that that's where\nWe stand right when we find out more information we'll give you more information\nBut speculation on these things is useless but the thing is that's the kind of nation that we live in ... Will Shortz started right away you know and I was thinking too that you know the media getting on their high horse you know that ... that you know hey we don't ever cause any type of device of rice right in and all I have to say is Ferguson\nMhm built on a lie mhm\nCompletely built an ally CNN and MSNBC all over that mhm enabling\nThe the uh\nUh as in in my opinion enabling the range that existed uh attacking law enforcement you and I remember\n\nJake Tapper writing and writing tapper can you believe this police are there in ... has been riots for the last few days of course they're going to stage police in riot gear ... they were they kept pushing\nNarrative\nTo this is political terrorists so\nThis is American Federer is\nThis is red versus blow terrorism\nAnd that we have

that you know you and I do the kind of show that we've always done is and and and talk about the issues of whether we talk about the issues and talked about the substance of the ideas is because we believe that we can explain them easy and the majority of Americans will agree with us\nWe have fun at times we sort of fake name call it and you know and and the worst we ever call anybody who's an idiot because we call ourselves idiots\n[laughter] and and that's really about the the ... the worst that we um we do we get passionate at at at times\nBut that's one of the reasons we've always set for any Republican out there you don't need to use any type of of rhetoric that the opposition can ever used against you in any way it's part of the discussion\nThat we've had over the last couple of days for Republicans and and the president and general take the winning move on take ... take the ... that's the goal the goal is to win\nThe goal is not to get in a better rhetorical means shot

win\nEvery single debate at times that might mean you have to say look I'm not sure I'll get back to you on that one it's one of the reasons why we really we ask questions on many issues but we don't speculators fact\nNow we don't speculate to the point of conclusion right I'm On things that we don't have all the facts on 'em and and that's what it comes down to for me is that uh you the\nFrustration I think right now is with me at least is the fact that for the first time in a long time\nThe Republican Party is motivated by a president who on many economic things and national things can get things done mhm focus on those but beyond that build the momentum forward\nAnd you know I've got a couple of emails from yesterday's show you know in talking about well you think that people are really going to be turned off by the horse race thing and blah blah blah blah blah blah you know these people are with them they hold on a second you missed part of the conversation we're

ABC News live in local at eleven o'clock I'm Joe Myers\nAfter a series of packages with explosives were sent to several high profile Democrats and CNN Today the FBI is investigating the incidents as domestic terrorism corresponded tearing case reports authorities are warning there may be more devices\nOf these devices that are showing up\nOn our point with the deployment is uh we want to make sure the terrorist act doesn't succeed\nIn New York ... President Trump pointed the finger at his opponents in the news media tonight for the turbulent national political environment correspondent Caitlin Collins has more on the president's approach\nOr you solve all the towards the end the game and he's been lights that whether you starting or relieving\nSo you ... you know what I mean it's these guys I mean Kobe boundaries coming off the bench I mean he's not fresh he's holding in the sense of he's not in the swing of the game these guys are not going to be able to go up there and really come up with the bake it the way Roberts is thinking you start to get in the need to be in the flow of the game I Hope we come back now the series as it's just a Los Angeles\nComing up on friday that we see Ballenger starting in there\nWell I'm ... I'm going to say this you know Boston I'm not going to say it's over but I'm\nGoing to say this it's ...\nGoing to be very hard for the Dodgers to to um when does this world's here yeah of course by going to be taught why are you going to war to fight and they got what they did was they got it done the red socks that are done they took care of home court now this is where\nHomemade vantage starts to come into play you know before it was just like it was just ... when the game really there's really no home advantage but now this is where home advantage come into play why is because really all the red Sox need to do man it's just the way one game in LA\nThey wouldn't want to get him in LA it's a rat you know I'll be honest with you just going to be it's a rat because they can go home they got the home crowd that's when the home and then it's going to play that's why I said that series a ship Dodgers really it's very important right now they're just trying to survive\nThey gotta going tomorrow you got to take a gate I mean he got to take it a game at a time they go to LA they've got to win that game and they have to win back to back it cannot be brat\nThey win the game today and then me on a aren't they win the game on a friday and then they did that Lou Saturday I Can't it can't happen that way you you gotta when you literally have to win two games back to back you gotta take care of those two gangs and hopefully end what'd you do is you that game shifts\nWere you what you want in this case you want to be a three to going back to Boston and of course they have is\nThat anyone who thinks they've got somewhat of a ... nose I gotta win all three games they have to because they're not going to win too in Boston\nThey can't there's not going to happen you know so they're going to definitely have to take care of those games that they don't it it's over\nOne eight hundred to two to five to two to let's go to the phones and say a load our good friends Solomon in lake ... Solomon you're on behind the my thoughts on tonight\nA gentleman yeah got a few of course\nI'm right now as I told you the other evening the Dodgers just looked out out matched you know they just look at me look overwhelmed from the company's guys they absolutely absolutely taken the to the Dodgers\nAnd you're absolutely correct if they have a stone's throw in the ocean in the ocean to to to come back when the series and possibly win it which would be a miracle maybe the doctor and the skies looking over them or they got to win three straight at home and then you've got to shop\nIs right now you you said at Brett when you lose the first two games you have to win four of the next five games against the teams like the Boston Red Sox\nUm I didn't want to mention one thing about the Roberts that I'm not trying to nit pick on him the demand has been an incredible manager gotten the Dodgers back to the world series which is a huge huge accomplishment in a big task\nBut if this series goes down and he plays for the Dodgers I think the turning point is going to the last night when he didn't leave by us and\nTo complete that and I agree and disagree you know I interviewed by as\nIt was that was the was the key of the game right there that last game you know he should have left in the early you don't have a guy go in and pitch ... didn't pull them out that will just again like I said over coaching\nSo far that's the moment of the series that we could all point to no question saying that's what cost them so far but yeah I just think um he's kind of outsmarting himself here to to some extent I really believe that like I said I don't know why you're not starting a ... month the max Monday's heady Cinderella type season why are you sending him now\nBrad read you know why he doesn't do this because I'm telling you man he was a little bit too much by the books it's that analytics is strangling him sometimes you have to manage you have to do the smell test what are your eyes till you\nYou know a biased was lights out he was a hit a ball okay and and if you want to go even stats\nAre in and and Dave a rubber sitting in an interview afterwards she said no you know I was comfortable with Alex would there really let's look at the stats for Alex would\nRead post game us gives me three postseason appearances each time first better home run that's not a good step to me I'm not comfortable with that not a pitcher argue and you want it you want to put him over Pedro buys who's been lights out\nDoesn't make any sense but again he goes back to those analytics because the book says this and blah blah blah what through your eyes tell you it's the smell test you have the feel of the game and you got to manage like that a little bit and I think Robert she still has a tough time with that then\nYeah it's going to take a little bit too uh definitely um convince him to do otherwise like I said the day off the travel day hopefully that's one of those things that kind of get to everybody reset coming back out here to LA Solomon thanks for the call we appreciate\nMy pleasure thank you\nIt's behind the Mike life here on KBC radio we take a break more after this\nIs

game\nTwo of the world series tonight and before the break obviously we were just kind of going over everything that is kind of gone wrong so far in the series for the Dodgers and a lot is gone right for Boston\nBut I still don't think that this series is over yes I Will admit this is going to be an uphill climb which I think we all thought from the beginning of the series just off the I test from the AOL and the sea acids last round but\nIt it's close they were more competitive tonight forwarded to if not for the fifth inning this is a game that they have the lead to the one who knows how things shake out and look I said last night you gotta figure five six runs each night to have a shot to win these type of games or they're close I think they're getting there\nWho caught a few balls on on on Saturday Night against Arizona\nI really like how to use them\nAs a safety valve when everybody else was covered oh you ... them from the ball and Kelly\nOh for big gains are the options to start the click\nNow what we really need on friday night for the one\nWe need better defense um the defense got the job done last week against the Wildcats are no doubt about that they got the big play when they needed them they got that amazing a forced funded by by ... Holmes\nWho I don't know how he caught up the the er Arizona running back\nBut he managed to do it and they manage to knocked the ball out into the end zone\nOr where he recovered it sit for the touch that they gotta catch limits that they get what out of quitting lake or in the end zone\nThey stop they stopped the Wildcats when they needed to stop the Wildcats a toy that can't be\nThat that that's exactly what it's about you know it's this is one of those games where in the past I Would think that uh where UCLA would have stopped the jaws of of defeat\nFrom the hand right through we've seen it I'm not\nExactly we've seen that way way too many times during the Jim more era and the and somehow some way these guys managed to pull together and you know even when even on that final drive six ... six and a half minute drive\nTo run out the clock\nUh for the final drive after they held Arizona to a field goal\nIt's been impressive no doubt it was in ... I mean how can how can you complain about that you really can't understand what I like I said we starting I went five to where they are now I'm ...

ahead to this game against Utah look we know at this point the uterus thorn in every one side and oh yeah it didn't matter your heart Henry and we've seen that with us see absolutely bunch of other teams as well\nTalk to us about what the Bruins need to do this week defensively kinda got into a little bit before the break but you know kind of containing the Utah rushing attack\nAbsolutely they've ... they've ... they've got to stop a ... moss from London the bald they've got to stop a Utah's quarterback um type of ... from London the ball um UCLA did not have a good game\nUh with the Russian defence last week they gave up the most rushing yards they have all season and or if they want to win on friday night they've they've got to contain the Utah rushing game\nJoe who who is the guy on UCLA who's the X factor in this game coming up who's gonna be the X factor for UCLA in order for them to be successful and be Utah\nWell I think I think it's I I really think it's going to come down to the play the defensive line of lifted defensive line can stop the raw and then uh then then there'll be successful\nUm hopefully somebody on the defensive line steps up and and get the job done all I'd like to personally I my favorite guy on the defensive line is a freshman by the name of ... uh Tony ... may be um this guy's he's huge\n... almost ... almost four hundred pounds\nBut he's very athletic uh he's another one of those tackles a I think he's got the opportunity to come up big\nUm you know that would be my that would be my choice this you know if I if you said who who do I want to who I Want to be that rule that run soccer this week he's got\nA thing that some of these guys can eventually develop in the past Russia is because I I don't think they're content at this point where the pastor I tried it somewhat of a work in progress in the\n... the pass pass Russia's definitely work in progress that hasn't been helped\nVery much by injury I mean they did lose to jail and Philips or one of their one other outside line backers are for the fees and they lost and the two concussion a few weeks ago [noise] um so he's a year or he was probably one of their best past Russia's in terms of the past Rosh\nUm I'd like to see a defensive lineman right Wade step it up rake is or\nHas played well um most of the season he played real well a against Cincinnati um if he can step it up and and and get some pressure on the quarterback um well as long as they contain them\nI think uh I think that'll that'll pay off big\nYou know we're UCLA and I'm just looking at something you're on their schedule but you know when you start to really start to get it going it was that Washington game if you look at it anywhere in any money off of that for the state Los\nYeah they they play Washington they lost it in thirty one twenty four and then they play they can't be beat cow then they turned around and they beat Arizona in that that's really where that that big turnaround was even though they lost a Washington\nAnd uh yeah know obviously this team is going in the right direction now and I mean yeah why it's they really have kind of turn things around here a little bit you know when you get too far ahead of ourselves but\nFor the moment here not too bad\nNot too bad at all man they're doing a great job and I'm there right in the thick of things and that's what they want to be I think chip Kelly a he had in his mind like look I just wanted to be in the hunt Mets it if we can have our opportunity\nThen great message successful season for them in and look all they can do from ours continued to build so right now he's in the hut and what's\nEven going to be even more weird is that next week he's going back to Oregon he hasn't been there since he left a great point so I I'm sure they're going to give him innovation because ... D develop that program from the jump but uh in rural to pack team we come back to talking\nAbout Oregon football as much as we do is not for him being there and have successfully did\nExactly so um\nYou know you see all he's writing to her man and the rest of the teams like USC in Stamford in Arizona State\nThe garlic over their shoulder a little bit just a little bit the knowledge that they they\nBeat and some tea they beat two teams there being you know and I think it's easily\nMatch in the south but also they came close to beating the top ten team in the country that is so they are ... in Washington so uh but we know how you feel about why she exiled why should you have to you then they give a lot of teams that opportunity to get on central time ah\nIf you beat him or not that yeah that's just what happened hey by the way a quick reminder we're currently streaming live on periscope in addition to Facebook Live YouTube Live as well kind of covering the gamma right now with our live online streaming so once again plenty of different ways to watch the show and just kicking it up a couple of extra notches\nYeah it's been great to do great responses to that and so you know you want to make sure you follow us wherever it is if it's on social media or if you're in the car you'd make sure you turn on the road because you never know we have little give away in in prizes and things that people wind and stuff and we have a\nA vet coming up tomorrow I Believe and we do with the Lakers endeavors and we had a winner Solomon was our winter and he will be there and look\nIf you guys listen in and watch to see what's going on\nYou may be that Solomon never know\nStay tuned because like I said last night we have plenty of events we're currently planning for upcoming stuff you're associated with behind them like the show in general so you always got to be listening that's the biggest thing yeah\nYeah let's get into the Lakers here for a hot second first one of the season tonight against the signs and they did some good things right definitely this and they definitely there's some good things but let me tell you made a point about Josh heart starting tonight yeah it was called well pope and uh yeah a lot of people have been calling for that\nWell yeah I mean Luke Walton finally listening when people are saying you know and I know it takes them time to find out what your line up is\nUm I think I Would have liked to see the ... the reason that line up but you know he'll coming off the bench you need a type of spark auto pope actually play a little bit better coming off the bench I'm blond though even though it was shocking has some sightings as well this ... today so um it was a great game with the Lakers I mean ...\nTo me I must say the game is better than burning from ... to me is the second best player on the Lakers hands down\nI Would argue against that this point\nHonestly you could make the case okay it's fair to say you can make the case that Brandon Ingram still has maybe more upside he does but right now it's not even close\n... looks to come in and do damage to change it is Brandon Ingram is like one of those guys he's a methodical guy cubs is like am I play my role and I'm not looking he's not looking he he'll put up points\nBut he's not looking for that call ... like a lion pit bull ... if you're on him and he no he ... your pray he's on each charge each you alive that's how he is and that's what you need on that in that starting lineup you need someone like him who's willing in looking to do damage\nThis guy is not afraid to any of any moment in the gang he's not afraid to take shots he's not afraid to get the ball the last thing a matter of fact this kid once the ball at the last second he you know more than to be honest with you ... the Bronx looking to make place\nFor you hit the wide open guy he's not the Coby but you got a call ... who wants to the ball and you got to look for so he's more comfortable with that so\nYou know I I like the liar if they had in today is they picked up the pace a little bit a little bit more speed but it just it was kind of bittersweet why it's bittersweet for me is because the Kobe went ahead and tease on Jimmy Kimble that at the Lakers won all five\nThat he was going to consider to come back or he's considering it now is on low that's true and I could have been joking around wherever you\nKnow a bad really dry but actually a small percentage drop it in and let me tell you what's your last evangelists Kobe Bryant coming back to play with this team\nLed you don't have to do much really he doesn't have to do much coming\nPut a couple of shots up you know I tell you this\nIt would be a full blown mob mentality that whole entire game a whole entire team so you know I Would love to see that if that ever happened but look he's forty years old he's got other things and aspirations I Believe that he's trying to do that same effort you can't play but you know basketball a little time yeah I'm\nThat I'm I'm just glad that the Lakers to win tonight hopefully they can build from this or we lose that Luke Walton learn something about his team tonight is personnel um I don't really care about Michael easily not playing he should play Michael ... is a talented player in this other league\nAnd the bottom line is nobody can garner Michael Beasley went on line they can't\nThere's you you need to he's ... he's a title player where you cannot guard him one on one he can he can give you a Fifteen points again he's capable of giving you twenty again if you let him\nHe is you know don't forget what he did in New York when kids are are just offer ... was out you know he was ... so\nYou know Michael ... is a talented player who just deserted shot I'm Glad that he's getting his opportunity and this and you learn something about your team why raise arms out in the eyes out you start to learn things about your team but I think that laws are still\nThe should be coming off the bitch um when even raise on comes back\nA but he's to me what he's doing he's finding his niche in the game he's finding a way like look I can pull up some shots I was shouldn't be afraid to put a shot I shouldn't be afraid to get aggressive get to the whole they're starting to learn each other ... played a lot more minutes he's playing well last he was just starting to get into thinking things they got a team\nIt again everybody's all concerned are worried about what the Lakers are doing right now literally there are only you know and that are only going to get better I still say their top three in the western conference as down even though they lost some game they're still top three Utah is creeping up there I think you're talking to be that good\nOf what the grace and Allen over there with a with Michel we were doing the shelling out last night said it was a perfect fit yeah so it's going to be tough for them and surprising Portland is playing well and they don't even\nHave did you got Damon ... but that's all they need right now so you know wow\nYeah let these younger guys develop they're going to get better like I said no Wagner the rookies going to get back after he returns from his knee conclusion yeah\nLook yeah there's no reason to worry at all I Know there's no ... there was no reason to panic video in three start really wasn't there are only going to get better as Tom was along here and look Toronto's undefeated and we all know what happens on the trial ... defeated they\nUsually don't do anything at the end of the season yeah so you know everything I think it's kind of working its way out right now um as far as things go but the NBA season often running\nIt is it is is a great time and a man shut up to staffing curry fifty\nOne on a solution for John wallet Bradley bill being the top and the back or it could man clay Thompson and Steph Curry\nJust ate it up today and imagine if they decided not to say nights awesome time and the regular season with their hair man it's crazy hey great show tonight we're back at it tomorrow for Keith I'm Brad keep living the dream [noise]\nBurnish by Sally is media [noise]\nLos Angeles orange\nCumulus station\nWith down Trump advisor on the hill I'm currently a for instance as authorities source for a bomber who mailed devices to prominent Democrats and CNN Wednesday some lawmakers on Capitol Hill or urging both political science to take a break when the Kenyan report topic and\nJohn Kennedy said everyone needs to cool it down\nThe president's rhetoric has been hot here it's been a lot of hot political rhetoric frankly on both sides\nAnd he said these bomb scares represent a turning point\nI'm just sorry this happened I'm Sorry for the Clintons I'm Sorry for the Obamas I'm Sorry for Mr SARS for Mr Brennan I'm Sorry for CNN [noise] I'm Sorry for a\nDemocrat Jack Reid for for president must take the lead he can't condoned\nI'm not really a front says as authorities search for a bomber who mailed devices to prominent Democrats and CNN Wednesday some lawmakers on Capitol Hill are urging both political sides to take a break and the Kenyan report public and\nI don't know that it's going to stand up and the court I'm I'm not sure I'm not sure because I Will see where the the court challenge goes on this\nUm I don't have a problem with strict ticket voting right because I because you have the choice you can vote straight ticket or you can vote right eventually the choice is still there for an end after September first and a twenty twenty in our state will still have Republican or Democrat next to\nYou know the name so you're going to you know or next to the end of its name or libertarian or Green Party or\nKnow so it it you're going to know which party they belong to a in that case it just it it's so if you're let's say you're a community organizer and you're getting people to the polls all you tell them in that case is make sure that you fill in everything that says Democrat\nMhm that's that's it it it\nIt may encourage a more informed voter but it doesn't get you there that's that's my only concern with the ... I I don't know that it's going to be effective I don't know that it's going to be\nYou know states run their own elections so you know maybe the course won't have a problem with it at all I I think there was another state though there were there was a court challenge I have to double check that if if memory serves I was thinking there was a court challenge to it and it was overturned but\nI ... for me it's it's convenient I still go to the thing is is I still go through the ballot\nYou find yourself doing that with straight ticket you hit straight ticket but you'll go through the ballot because often there might be you know something else that you're going to have you know whatever else might be and I always preview the ballot too you can do that on line now very easy you know so it's it's you know that\nSaying that he will you know encourage people to to to to cast a more informed vote\nI I think is is a while it may be okay and its in its nature and its spirit and it's intense\nIt doesn't really get you there because there's an easy work around for it I I encourage people to be more informed but if they're not stay home [laughter]\nI don't I promote ignorance well\nI'd like to ignore a lot of things [laughter] for sure but I'm not one of those crazy\n... it's like we started to show off is ... [laughter] it's like we started to show off the this week and and\nDidn't get any comments has time on it normally we do maybe because people are used was doing it every year and we started out a couple of weeks before the election when especially on radio you'll you'll hear it on radio specially the DJ's go out and vote ... right if you don't vote you can't complain and we've always said the opposite no you don't agree with us don't vote\nAnd by the way home and complain right in fact that's wrong you know you don't have to\nYou you don't have to vote and you can still complain yeah that isn't to rule right everybody's throwing this rule if you don't vote you can't complain sure you can you're a citizen by the way that George Carlin said that [laughter] okay from Ireland so are you on the end\nWell of course you can you're a citizen you didn't plan on going God I've heard I've seen it done [laughter] exactly for me very capable of doing it well it it it's been you know you have you have no say so if you don't vote\nOr I Will quote the Canadian rock band rush [laughter] if you choose not to decide you still have\nMade a choice a you and you have you know why and because of the fear what we're seeing right now in the midterms ... is the is the electorate\nAnd which side of the electorate is energized to vote and that means if you're not energized to vote but non voting will lose your shit\nThat's right and you know because there you go back to uh what what was that the uh the midterms of two thousand six what was that about I mean there were a lot of Republicans that were not happy with ah not just the Bush administration but\nThe party and a lot of Republican stayed home and those midterms again that's part of the protest\nThey're not going to vote Democrat but they'll stay home now some people stay home just to watch the prices right you know drew Carey is very entertaining\n[laughter] oh is that where we ended up [laughter] yeah for the last Twenty years apparently um but the but it it is not you know it is one of those that's kind of part of the process\nLook you know\nYou and I been together a you know doing this show for for a Thirteen a and a half years a well over Thirteen Years and we get a lot of the uh you know the\nCalls for us to be um bullhorn guys call to action program were not a call to action program\nWe're going to have a discussion because the call to action program is kind of the same thing right it's the whole get out and vote I I I think our audience are smart enough I really don't want us All right and and do their own homework and if they're not that's their choice I refuse\nTo tell other adults how they should live their life and what they should do I'll give you my opinion and we can have passionate discussions on it but that's not us and we'll never be us it's not what we wanted to do we want it to be able to discuss the issues\nAnd get as close to the truth as we possibly can on every issue and then promote why we believe what we believe it's very very simple but we are call to action and never had been\nAnd we've been criticized for that and so be it that's not what we do\nI I'm I'm not ... yeah I'm I'm not you know the the whole fire in the belly is is is is built by a real passion or flaming hot Cheetos if ... if I really\nThink that it is\nAbsolutely necessary for me to tell other adults who are listening to the show how to live their life and what to do and to follow my lead and do exactly what I Want than we are too well [laughter]\nI Know that you know in that it is it is funny to say that but but really\nAh [laughter] I'm not your leader now because I think people I think everyone if it's funny because I had a friend on social media question one day you just jokingly what don't you think you've got the you know the the makings of a leader\nAnd I responded that I've known this guy you know a long long time and I said to you know what I said uh I Believe people and it I made a serious point and\nIn response to his ah the tongue in cheek a comment that he made I Believe people are capable of being leaders they all they do have the ability to be a leader yourself you lead you\nWell you know you mentioned that President a former President Obama speaking in Nevada the other day sounded like he was begging dying in both go on a boat we need to vote we need to vote I have never felt even in one there's been downturns I've never felt\nThat I have to tell the people who I Am I Am telling them why I Believe what I Believe ...

Democrats as domestic terrorism Steve Kestenbaum reported\nHappened while puppy Harlow and Jim Shooter were angering the news from a set of the CNN New York bureau and talking about the explosive devices tend to Iraq Obama and Hillary Clinton\nThan it was to send you know a terror threat or political message or both\nA the a P story that they use as the source there at National Review\nUm the line the effective line from that a ... story is a law enforcement official\nSays tests have determined that a powder found inside a non ... delivered to CNN along with a pipe bomb was harmless the powder was harmless\nNow not the powder in the pipe bomb right right and so\nThat's what they're that's what they're talking about again here in in that story but it's gone viral because the the National Review again unless National Review knows something that we don't but they don't\nState that understory they're sourcing strictly here the peace story but the reason that it's important is because as you see something like this go viral if that information is is incorrect or any information is incorrect\nAnd the discussions are surrounding this event clearly look there's the political aspect of this can't be ignored but the discussion is important because you can't discuss anything without knowing the complete facts you can't discuss much\nWithout knowing the complete facts we've discussed\nThe reaction by the media by uh the the uh Democrats and and what that has been we know very little\nAbout this well on its way and and that's why we had a set to uh a mystery soccer over at the CNN or or whether it was close to your Schumer and their their comments\nOr you know going after and you know and in essence blaming the president's first provocative statements claiming that they're against divisiveness it's interesting that the people that claim that we need to stop divisiveness are the ones that have accused somebody of responsibility of an incident where nobody has any idea no one\nHas any idea who the person might be who would have done this we don't know whether the bombs were allied bombs\nWould have gone off or not there is so much we don't know yet they are assessing blame that the ones who claim that they're against divisiveness are committing the the one of the biggest ... of divisive this and that is what blaming somebody\nWhen you don't have the facts behind you right\nRight\nAnd so as we've said we've discussed is a little bit and and gone through the different questions or as others have yesterday and and we we've asked a question that if it was it if they are like that if they were alive bombs\nAnd and they would have gone off a\nThen you have to look at that in a different way that if clearly none of them were alive bombs mhm that it would it be there'd been an attempt to scare or an attempt a possibility of an attempt to ah\nYou know look at manger figures in the Democratic party that are not lie well by members of the right in this country\nAnd you know try to you know give the tried to send the message that they're out to get them ... or that you know ... if if it was you know was it was a real bombing that's but if it was a big bomb it would be wasn't sent by somebody on the left\nTo try to blame the right there's a whole bunch of different scenarios and questions you would ask is an investigator based on whether the bombs were actually live or whether they were fake bombs right\n[noise] yeah and we can only ... will only know that if and when they find the person who or persons who are response\nRight and that could be never\nSo at the you can bet right now they have a number of great leads especially with the fact the nature of of how males sordid or by the secret service\nOr in ... in terms of the the Clintons when you look at and and the Obamas when you look at that situation um that I think you have to take into consideration\nWhat they already know about you know patterns of behavior by people who do such a thing and and the resources are there are probably on to some pretty solid leads right now then add to that of course cameras being everywhere\nSo you will you know as soon as we get information we can start having that discussion but we want to point that out that you're seeing that story from National Review go viral\nIt's important to have the discussion based on facts based on what we know right and there is a difference and we may learn that uh the authorities and and authorities will tell us or might tell us at some point that those devices were effectively harmless because they weren't set to go off\nBut that is not what you're seeing here and the a P report that was the source of the national review article which\nAgain just looking at social media overnight it has gone it has gone viral that see there was if we don't know that yet and rice Associated Press story does not state that\nAnd it's important that you know facts were brought up I was reading the daily wire story where they they talked about the\nA reporter for CNN and that looked Martha ... who was interviewing\nOne of a one of the bomb experts right and this bomb expert gave out all the possibilities who said look can be somebody from the right and he said it could be a you know it could be but you know a foreign state that is trying to destroy the you know this trying to disrupt the election or\nAs you said it could be a false flag from somebody on the left mhm\nSo what the CNN reporter pulled out was only the response\nFrom this expert of that it was somebody on the left and left out when this expert said it could be somebody from the right ... it can be a foreign actor or it could be a false flag from somebody on the left because the election is just two weeks away when I brought up all the possibilities and investigator would bring out\nAnd what did the CNN reporter to weed out just deport the report that apparently media matters poured out which is a left leaning a or you know media organization media\nA truth organization where they only put out just his opinion you know on the left as if that's who he blamed\nAnd Martha McCalla my oh yeah Oh absolutely yeah are fascinating and something like that she should have responded they all believe with somebody for fake news will know the fake news is the actual fact checking of the news\nYou didn't include the entire statement right\nAnd which is our point on this entire thing with the national review and the difference between the story that they used as their stores\nIt's important we give a lot of credibility to the national review and have for a long long time but it's important that as you as you\nYou've got twelve days here before the election this is all going to be in terms of the discussion not the investigation but the discussion about it in social media is all politically driven and has been from the start\n\nYou don't win anything by repeating false information\n\nNow you don't win anything by a you know at media matters by putting out incomplete\nInformation which indeed is false if you don't include the entire statement\n\nThat's how we deal I mean that's the world to really deal with you and I taught of talked about this many times that much we spend much more of our time just trying to disseminate what the truth is out there right\nAnd arguing the truth versus the conspiracy theories that have troops that are out there and and it does become frustrating at times now I Will admit that the story that you know the national review story that when we read the Associated Press ... when I read it off on so you when I read it\nThe first I said well ... are saying that the bomb and I read the first sentence and then I re read it again and went on and it's not
