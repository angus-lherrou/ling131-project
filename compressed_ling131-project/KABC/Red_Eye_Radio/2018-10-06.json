lending round where'd you come from body is often keep it going you enjoy it and you hear Lindsey Graham you point out\nSo here's what the three senators asked for that the uh for the people named ... for being interviewed by the FBI just not the committee\nAnd this Ramirez be interviewed by the bad that was done plus four or five other witnesses the results are in senator um um Collins and Senator Flake said they thought it was thorough they thought it was fair in these two people who are my friends have no idea what\nThey're talking about and let me to to my my friend Bob which all done as well [noise]\nYes [noise] Lindsey Graham\nAnd a lot of that okay and then orange cat could become be fun grumpy old man in the Senate it just fantastic Orrin Hatch who had he\nHasn't been happening social media to my clever does his whether it's just great but\nOrrin Hatch has basically turned to Walter mapped out and it's ... so here's here's Orrin Hatch is walking the halls and a protester comes up to him and Orrin Hatch jak deconstruct the guy [laughter]\n\n\nHave you emit that Senator Graham and senator Senator Hatch and this woman like how ... why don't you wave your hand it may it could actually screaming at him and he goes I'll be ready to talk to you when you grow up and says you grow up Senator Hatch is one thousand years old he grew up a long time ago\nAnd and then ... and then Senator Hatch as he's getting in the ... the the veteran brat as Senator Hatch you just start waving at them right by the Republicans finding is fine and pointed enjoyable and Republicans actually have a spine I have to say I'm I'm really getting a kick out of it that's pretty great\nJust to show you where the media aren't all that the media totally undercut their credibility and all of us and CNN particularly has just been absolutely got off on this issue just astonishingly that Allison ... who\nI used to have more respect for as a reporter she's really I mean she's like the Titanic had the iceberg down the story here she was talking on the end unless I wouldn't just be easier to do with a different nominee after all this after we've gone after this guy and they wonder if I'd allegation and reporting Julie sweating as a real story and\nPut my lab and Audi on network every five seconds and kind of ten for them and the green room now after all that one interesting better if you guys you know just what we wanted and got rid of cabinet nominee also camera objective reporting ring at worst\nHe sexually assaulted someone that's just a lousy for accuses easier at this point to go where the different nominee who doesn't have any of these problems you have time before January just start over this process has gotten too tainted start over and do a more clean process in a different nominee\nSo much in journalism ... Wow Did you hear all the journalism in that question\nAll the journalists who are why won't you just do what we want\nBeen trying to get from this story for months here why won't you would just do what we will you know and then I Love this from Jim shoot ... another reporter another objective reporter over at CNN hang it when people accuse people of gang rape that just politics that should help Hollis works oh really okay here's some more journalists being from CNN\nHere's a different Scott but but ... this was a person running for a lifetime when I'm running for being considered a lifetime position the fact is is this is Washington this is politics but political candidates have been accused of horrible things for years and and it becomes\nA gang or a really outweighs ... how do you respond to that and and trust me I'm not taking issue which we will ... is a fair question\nOkay now that's how politics works according to CNN and report Jim shoot up yep wonder why they can't track meet any day we'll be back here next week\nWith all of the latest when we have a new Supreme Court justice welcome to the bench for judge Kavanaugh rinse it off and on Monday we'll have all the effect that measure\nOf [laughter]\nLos Angeles orange\n... station [noise]\nABC News of live and local at ten o'clock I'm just little California senator Kamala Harris was\nFourteen I knew a\nNorth Dakota colleague in Randy Fuller has more details she's\nA grand push back you know it's a ... you know here what is the first thing to ... describing a semi degrading or\nThis is what happens when you go through quote this is what happens when you go through a trailer park with one hundred dollar bill\nThe audience gasped but quote leading Goldberg to clarify the crime was reciting the famous line said by someone else ... ... was actually referenced will comment made by James Carville and advisor to former President Bill Clinton about Paula Jones right who accused Clinton of sexually harassing\nHer in a in Nineteen Ninety One if you're dragging a hundred dollar bill to a trailer park you'll never know what you'll find her whole said of the Jones\nAfter she went public with the accusation\nGrab joked with the audience most of you are too young to remember this when Yahoo News posted the video the exchange on Twitter however\nIt paraphrased rams quote as everything he said was factual this is what you get when you go through a trailer park with on one hundred dollar bill giving the impression that Graham was referring to the doctor for right\nOr as so liberals and journalists on Twitter also spread tweets giving the false impression that the trailer park quote was from Graham only some deleted their tweets and apologize\nA gram um\nAnd then they go through the entire thing and finally a Yahoo did come out and said that they had deleted the tweet correct\nRight but they didn't correct in the tweet that incorrect no to say why they do\nOr why was incorrect they it and here's the the I guess if you call the corruption but a a tweet that came later after they delivered it we'd deleted a tweet that did not accurately reflect the context context of Lindsey Graham's quote in the blow video clip and that's all they put\nA I I bet you that a month from now I'll hear of that we will get\nDepending on you know what happens with the type of thing but I bet you we will get\nEmails and commute different communications from people on the left that will say yeah but Lindsey Graham said this because once it's out there and yeah spreads on social media it doesn't matter whether there was a correction in the store which which actually are there actually is not a question ... and\nThey just posted the video again and said we deleted a tweet that wasn't accurate well exactly how was it not accurate explain that well they can't bring themselves to defend Lindsey Graham that's the problem\n\nAre coming up on the show today by the way or the breaking news here in the last uh about our in twenty minutes report from the White House the background check on Kavanaugh\nA which the Senate will see a tomorrow no cooperation of sexual misconduct allegations yeah\nCorn to the report from being the source report by the way by the way somebody wrote me the other day and it was really great they said what do you mean when you say source report\nAnd that's a legit question I'm Glad that that they not an official statement from you know whatever it's done in the British or right it's not it's not a person and and I explained them and say sources say and it means nobody will go on the record and tell you what it is so they use the source\nOf it that's what a source story is where you don't have a name you just simply say sources in the White House say\nUh but uh the report a again a Wall Street journal had it was where I saw first uh that uh the uh a background\nCheck on cabin on the cooperation of sexual misconduct allegations was the cloture vote still a separate friday okay except\nFor friday and uh they could have a now some report saying a a a a broad vote could come\nAs soon as Saturday but I think uh at least a couple of organizations were reporting that uh it's more likely that it would have either late Saturday or Sunday they could actually do a vote on Sunday I'm guessing they're going to want to get this done as soon as possible so\nI Would look if I were if [laughter] if I were Chuck Todd\nI Would not miss work on Saturday [laughter]\nSo the the entire ah I I think there's an entire thing it's it's interesting because if the confirmation happens the cloture vote will on friday will tell them essentially the headcount\nWill tell them if they've got the fifty and with fifty they can the vice president could be the the fifty one to break the tie if they've got fifty on friday they're not going to wait a moment I think if they get to that fifty or plus I think they're going to do that vote on Saturday\nSo we'll\nWe'll see if that happens but if you've got the headcount you don't wait for another elevator doors are open\n[laughter] [laughter]\nShut down the elevated us down the aisle matters how everybody else those stairs [laughter] speaking of which they have\nRamped up security on Capitol Hill greatly\nOver the last few days as you can possibly imagine the ... you know right now the protestors are very active which there's enough itself that's not a problem peaceful protests hey I encourage that whatever it is you may be wrong but that's your right to go out and peacefully protest\nAs long as you're not a trespassing a and you're you know legally in that place than it's okay for you to carry on a good sign but that's not the concern that concern is that people are talking and and there's a lot of chatter on social media\nYou know about again the whole getting your face or as they call it going direct\nApproach and you you can't you can't have that if you want to have a group if you want to go out and protest if you want to have a voice no problem\nBut running up to senators in a hallway right now is likely not going to be tolerated by Capitol Hill security\n\nUh you know that I was telling you are in our pre show meaning about uh ice or that the uh the uh apparently it's the the union ... the ice union is asking the mayor of Portland, Oregon to give up control the city's police department\nSent letters Wednesday morning requesting federal and state investigations over his handling of the Occupy ice protest or this uh summer you remember they lasted for weeks for sea ice office in the city to shut down the national ice council union that represents ice officers says the mayor\nFueled the confrontations by expressing support for the protesters and in public and private statements made clear to police it they were to stand down ignoring some nine one one calls from agency employees being managed by protesters\nCouncil told attorney general Jeff Sessions that Mr wheelers directives violated those employees civil rights\nLeaving them without protections he is required to provide in separate letter to the Oregon attorney general the ice council attorney said the mayor broke state laws against official misconduct by telling police to ignore ongoing crimes among the protestors\nSo I mean that's that's the point where it's getting you know right now mhm that ... you know that the the belief is ice believes in\nAnd and they're going to have to you know the ... of course ... you know make their points solid I mean they're asking ah the the the the mayor to uh to do it we'll see you you know we'll see where this this whole thing goes but that's what they believe is happening that now you got politicians stating\nWell look if you disagree with me on us at a particular issue well then we're not going to protect you\nWere going to remove right the police were going to tell the police to stand on we're going to tell them no you protect those protesters you don't protect these protesters were going to protect your you're going to protect those protesters and those people that are actually committing crimes against other government entities\nAnd are in in in timid dating and uh uh ...\nUh uh the people trespassing doing the wrong thing and we're going to tell them to stand down and we're going to tell them not to do their job yes words going that's where it's going next yes so\nWe'll get to that and a more plus your calls and Thomas got a great show I I had a what is coming up next a we just told you the cloture vote to a set of well it's supposed to happen on a friday we'll see what happens tomorrow it's going to be a crazy\nDay we're being told that the ah it's being recorded I should say that that the Senate or has the three oh twos and is going over them as we speak um we keep in mind this is all behind closed doors we won't see the three oh two as well the reports\nRemember you don't ... nobody really I don't think anybody gets a cop you know\nWhy they they don't get an electronic copy they get a paper ... but\nThey're not supposed to when I read the staff is supposed to see it only the members of\nYes only rise Senate members yet only the study they're ... they're going over that right now the committee are also has it but really well committed by the end it's not it's it's not going to effectively it's\nIt's not going well ... well ... well the entire point is is is to make sure there's not a leak bought a here's the question if you don't get out if you don't make it public\nDo you end up\nHanding it right or another great opportunity for the Democrats to say you're hiding from the people whether the normal process is to keep it quiet as we all know about and

be confirmed to the high court tomorrow and other Republican Senator Susan Collins of Maine as well as Jeff Flake of Arizona and even Democrat Joe Manchin of West Virginia have said they'll vote yes by Republican Senator Lisa Murkowski of Alaska so she will not be supporting Kavanaugh\nIt I Want to attack like what he did that type of gesture who would sign them I wouldn't sign them ... and again I wouldn't ... and his status or he is right now there's many a cornerback I think an elite that are far more better than him and so and I didn't know much about 'em into the actually the ... or ... or ...\nYou know that's what we've seen hasn't been the same it hasn't ended they've been they say well I was Super Bowl ... yeah it's just on the ads have been saying you're not talking real terms for\nThe Seattle often though is interesting because again we talked about Russell Wilson and how he really is kind of propping up that whole group there they still have dug ball when they still have Tyler lock it but I don't see these guys really winning one on one matchups anymore and I ... that's really what you can boil down to people are like what happened in the Seattle office well they've gotten older number one\nAnd their skill position players really have not won battles on one on one against the there are the defenders who are who are guarding them so that that's a big problem I I think they can start to get things figured out a little bit I mean they have the potential to do it ... it's just a matter of\nA thing to me it just looks like this is a team that we know they're at the end of an era\nAnd I really think Keith that this might be ... last year\nOne of the court I yeah I think he leaves the by ... I mean yeah he's there he has a job for life yeah hockey one said but I think I think maybe to me the writing is on the wall a little bit I think and and he knows maybe this might be a good time to kind of step away because\nI don't think he's necessarily done coaching I think maybe he would like on the U.S you know I I think so I just think he's he's accomplished everything there that he possibly could he he's he's max it out sort of say with that group and\nI'm looking I mean he he won a championship in college when a championship in the NFL very very few people can say lay claim to that are so ... it's been very impressive what has been able to do obviously there was um a little bit a neat left on the bones sort of say potentially they thought they could have one more championships\nBut at the end of the day they still got one and I I think he may be looking to do something else maybe coach somewhere else at this point maybe that back in college I can only be\nThat'd be great to go back in college would be great to have him back at us that we're not having you know that would never happen but you know I'm One of the he lives out here in Manhattan beach\nThat says you never know so you never know at UCLA might be needed to add coach not\nI'm not that I can do it on to that area either USC guy so there's no way you're going to go to UCLA called they might try and\nThey might I wouldn't put a passing to potentially courtroom yeah at least a little bit that young man that would be really wild behind the Mike here lived KABC radio on a friday night we're reviewing the rams Sunday match up against the Seattle Seahawks and maybe the weather could play a factor as well we know especially in the afternoon\nGames up there you have the potential for rain in the windy conditions and you just you don't like you said it's a tough place to play and to me the bottom line is\nIf there's ever a sixty minute football game you need to play it will be this week yeah it will be up there against that team because I just think back to over the years and and so many games and in which\nIf you take Seattle being at home there and uh the visitor coming in so many games where it looks like the visitor is going to take care of business and on to the end when they don't play sixty minutes in Seattle is able to to nip\nUm so uh it it can definitely occur got to play it out and looked at Jared ... I've had a lot of high praise for him recently I think yeah he has just evolved his game and to potentially a top ten quarterback in this league they stop what we've seen through\n... two years and a quarter so far in his NFL career I look for him to kind of continue his ways and and look every week I feel like brand new cooks is becoming more and more out of all that often is right at the sky's the limit for what they can do with them and and it's it's really really scary for opposing defensive\nMan ed really every time like I say every time I hear his name\nI can the patriots are kicking themselves and for for getting rid of him like he's a great quarterback I mean a great receiver he's been doing some great things with the teen um and like you said he replay you fast\nSays receiver I think and I have to say Vassar deceive or right now in their field he creates separation he's a nightmare to defend yeah and um he just makes a big plays and he makes plays when it's needed\nI Love the combination of him in the woods right now like the the ages great on was a great tandem they remind me of ... when they have made me\nBut a lot to that ... they remind you of that and the more physical yes that's different much more visible\nThe other side we're going to preview the chargers and the raiders game on Sunday plus we'll go around the NFL is behind the Mike Brown and keep hanging out back\nOut please join us at the ... grams his annual successful aging expo and Saturday October thirtieth from nine AM to to be as a grandmother\nBeach day still victory activities in services including hill street fortieth visitors bingo demonstrations and more mcentire from back in time in the morning we'll be speaking in additional seminar topics and food for\nThis little cannabis non surgical options for relieving have Medicare options common age and condition six foot or in your life and much more efficient and parking or free more information so\nTo successful aging expo dot\nCom\nAre you prepared for the upcoming season get immune support you can really count on quantum nutrition lives has three key players for optimal immune support on special garlic complex with its high concentrated amounts of Allison\nImmune support the three ultra quality olive leaf extract into all natural source vitamin C. by bottles get the third one free\nCall eight eight eight five eight eight Seventy five Seventy eight that eight eighty five eight eight Seventy five Seventy eight or business online at ... dot com dot U.

[noise] looking\nBack behind the Mike on this Friday evening KABC radio Brad Dallas keeps jacks and take you to twelve midnight time here on seven Ninety am we were talking about the rams and sea hawks before the break and again I think it's gonna be a fairly close game but I'm going to seek the rams by seven Keith overall\nIn this one and\nI'm I'm pretty confident in saying that I I think Seattle will put up a little bit of a fight as they've been accustomed to doing in recent years but at the end of the day I think the rams went by seven what's your take uh I like\nThat I like that then number I'm gonna go as far as this I think it goes down to a field goal\nI think it comes down to the field goal I think the rams ended up eventually winning and winning by frugal but\nSeven points is good and that's another great number I'm I just think you know it's going to be a close game a very hostile environment um but I'm taking rounds winning\nBy feel go let's move on to the chargers they host the raiders on Sunday over its dub center this is a game that Oakland comes in one in three ... and finally gets the monkey off of his back last week they pick up their first victory of the season in a while one over the browns\nAnd the chargers are coming off of a good win against the niners a course ... but still it was a good one overall for the team gets in the five hundred at two in two\nBig one this week because you can bury Oakland at one in four if you can get the victory and you can obviously moved to over five hundred three into and put yourself in in in somewhat of a good spot and an NFC West division or excuse me and asked me why\nDivision that is a strong to say at least at this point with Kansas City getting out to this really hot start in twenty eight team led by Patrick ... homes and you figure that's going to set the tone here for the next couple of weeks\nAt some point the chiefs are going to lose the game and and that's why the chargers

of the NFL Sunday action coming up we talked about the Ramsey Seahawks earlier tonight we get a little chargers raiders before the break in time for some predictions now for this game he then\nOn the line right now is five and ... is one of those games again where a lot of people talk about the home field advantage or maybe like they're out for the chargers big difference though I'm twenty Seventeen twenty to I mean\n... not a lot more so far this year and although other fan bases have you taken over there or it's kind of an evenly distributed is this something that you have to deal with and to the new stadium has built and I think at least most of the guys including Phillip Rivers has somewhat embrace that\nSo obviously they're gonna get a little bit for being the home team here but some people feel kinda evens itself out this one\nI I think this is a look both teams are given up a ton of points right now both teams are given about like thirty points a game since leads me to believe that this will be tight\nAnd also that this could be a high scoring game especially if the raiders can figure things out an off and I think it's high scoring I'm going to go with the chargers though by I'll say if he'll go on this one now mining down now getting they've had their problems with kicking\nSo rare [laughter] I might not even want to look at points if this one comes down to a potential a game winning feel go try but I'm going to say they get it done by three\nOh well that's that's that's that's the closest I I actually I'm predicting a little bit different I I think the chargers are gonna\nPlay well their home it's just something about that crowd man at the stuff ... I actually wanted to go and actually experienced it because it's a smaller sending environment but it's it's loud in there I've I've\nHeard that's what I've heard too is ... and they whether I'm whether it's a football game they've actually hosted like some boxing that's in there as well and obviously you have the galaxy and soccer but yeah it you would think that um as more fans start to come over and get accustomed to the chargers playing ... and you think it's only going to become more of a whole sort of\nAnd yeah so you know and I think they have a look I think ... that\nWas going to be a split this is gonna be a split um stadium though because there's a lot of raiders fans out here in Los Angeles a lot of ... traveled from Oakland to LA that's only if a\nFour hour drive not worried about not too bad right and then you come out and you have you know the San Diego fans are probably we were still ride or die with their team they are only coming out for like an hour they probably still come out here all the time anyway so I'm ... I'm going to say this don't let let's say the chargers when Twenty one ten\n... that'd be really impressive yeah I I think they think the defense steps up there I think the ... at least a little bit but I think they step up here\nUm um but um I I think a key ... going to have a big game I'm and I'm looking\nFor Melvin Gordon and have a good game as well so the what I Love about this whole match up though is the battle of the rented backs Melvin Gordon Moore Sean Lynch\nEven though they are not on the feel the same time it's just the the way they run the ball those are two guys that really it takes the whole team to break 'em down in la and when we love to see that\nLet's keep it in the AFC West we move on to our head Kansas City hosting the Jacksonville Jaguars who this is again keep that in Jacksonville wants to be considered an elite or a top tier off ants or or at at the very least if they want to say that they're often can keep pace with their defense\nIn my opinion they need to go in there and then to to get a a big time victory and really handle the chiefs their first loss of the season\nI don't know if they can do it and I'm not a huge fan of the cheese defense at the moment I Know a lot of people aren't either they think they're a little shaky patrimony homes in the audience it's kind of been covered that up but\nI'm not sure I think the jaguars have enough offensively to be able to keep pace with what she can do we know the cheese are going to score a lot of points now they're going up against the Jacksonville defense so you figure this will be the biggest task\nBut I'm really going to take the chiefs in this game I think they have enough and we know our heads to one of the tough places to play in the NFL\nYeah well like I said this is gonna be a true test for Jacksonville to separate themselves from everyone else I still feel that they're probably the ... arguably the number of the best team in AFC right now um but\nThat's how I feel right now that are arguably they are the best team in the AFC but to be the best you gotta you gotta go down there and we'll be in a winning hostile environments and went in a in a in a in a great fashion right so\nFor this case um I think it's going to be a tough gang or Jacksonville defenses carry them to even since last year has carried this team to an AFC Championship hasn't gone over the super bowl it doesn't help Jay Lynn it doesn't help the situation that Jay Leno Ramsey is running his mouth continually\nOf [laughter] it's so weak yeah and I like I started out like the opposing off into ... this week it's tiring ... and I and I I'm ... and I said there's a fair to you and I'll say it again that he does he makes his team looked like the villain man and that's the way you know and he puts a lot of pressure on them but\nFor big time players to big time games that they say he's a big time player he's a lockdown corner and for me he he can\nSay those type of things because\nHe backed up and he has backed it up so far except for oh Dale back from I ... I think I'll go back and got the best of him even though jailer Ramsey want the game yeah they still one that gave him run back and went nuts however you know I'll I'll I'll just\nSay that this was going to be a tough game because I I look at it and you read the style that he plays you're going to see any re doing a lot of trick plays that type of thing um with this team has already read to getting a little more aggressive yeah on Fort down he is\nI feel that the Vikings are close and obviously the rams are just a step ahead of them based off of that matchup head to head\nBut I really feel the Vikings are close and I think they're very evenly matched with his eagles seem to be honest with you and it's an eagles team right now that's two and two and a very easily could be on for a now at the same type of ... very easily before no is well it's one of those things that they've been teetering on the fence and\nSo far I you know Carson what's coming back I\nI think he's looked OK there obviously somewhat easing him into it he's not going to go out there and I run around like crazy and do some of the things we saw him do last year before the injury but so far so good\nMy my biggest thing though with then is health and with the addition of al Sean Jeffries coming back this week from injury\nA lot of people can do get a big boost there in the office of game my concern the overall besides health is probably defensively and how they're not getting as much pressure as they have been up front that was the calling card for them last year\nWhen they lost a lot of ... ... people forget that they did lose some some key players on the defense they did I mean they still have Fletcher\nCox they do have Chris Long they have some guys they're up front and who have been able to get pressuring we saw that week one against Atlanta they've they've done it a little bit in spurts but not as consistently as we've seen them do it as we've become accustomed to seeing them do it dating back to last year so to me I think it's pivotal they get back to that\nBecause offensively I'm not sure how good they really are Keith compared to some other teams in the NFC whether or not bad but when you look around when you look at the rams even with the saints can do offensive way I don't know if the eagles or even in the same league as some of the sea\nWell they're hurting and receiving and you know um they don't have a foreign Jeffries is their best to you they just got back last week and he did a phenomenal job I'm On the field is as well as fantasy\nLeague you know so even though we even within the keys yeah but they're they're ... but they were you have no one to pass it to you know Carson which we we can't really blame it on Carson winch because he has no one's throw to they can't catch the ball you have\nYou know I'm ... hasn't really done much joined mad using to much you know you got guys that can't can't catch the ball or can't get any separation and get open and then therefore they're constantly being blitz he's constantly on the foot\nCarson is constantly on the ground ... last week a lease eleven times you know run and so and he gives out the pocket he's taking off running because of the ... you get no separation from those receivers invention of ... the problem is a big problem so they can\nHold on the line is not blocking as well and they can hold 'em and then on top of that you know ... you know these guys are hurt dares rose now these guys are questionable next gang hopefully they can come back you know Jay uh July is another another guy you know so you know hopefully they get some of these guys back and they can really\nStart going again but you know when you have people like ... or hamstring issues in Korea Colombia and with a ... as you like those are big injury and that's not that's hard to for a running back to the to get back in so\nThat they got ... I don't think he's like a hundred percent but eighty percent of al ... says is enough to get it done\nBut you need more production from your other receivers like Jordan Matthews um you know ... ... you need more production from those guys and you're not getting it and so therefore that's where the high carts of which is suffering for it and the theme of suffering so um\nThat's how I I I look at things in terms of what the eagles you know the ...\nI get on the other end of the Vikings [laughter] this is a guy is a must win for them let's just say call it what it is I think so especially when\nYou factor in how well the north is playing out for the most part with the bears being much improved the ride the Roger's factor stew there in Green Bay yeah they're one two and one and I can really afford to drop the one three\nNo they can't they can't afford it um especially with the high ... exactly what the highs are patients but they can't afford it and you don't want to go down when three in one you just don't like you know that's I think it's more pressure on the on the Vikings and then there's the eagles at this point are literally\nWashing and really what is the Vikings Tina we see the potential to me it it sky high but again words that consistency factor come into play or they are they as bad as the team who essentially got blown out by the bills yeah probably not are they as good as the team we saw the last Thursday over at the coliseum\nMm we'd like to think so because the talent is there but that's the thing I\nDon't they drop one of the middle of the road they know they drop once they know the rams they have the rams they had a chance to beat them die on the opposite trying to figure out what had against buffalo exactly right [laughter] but they have the opportunities\nAnd that's what I'm saying is you know this team is just like on the brink of like figuring it out so close and they're so close and then they ... they and then they just drop one but hopefully this week I think they will figure it out I think they're they're going to beat the eagles and I think why is because\nThe on the on the office of and for the eagles they're receiving corps has been proven that they can get the job done and only one receiver has that's I'll find Jeffries and the ... us only so much one receive we can do we can say that was even the patriots you know\nWhen they were doubling ground you know I'll be going to do do a novel in Germany so great he can he can make you know split double teams and things like that\nBut there's only so much you can do and so you need those other guys like ... like I said earlier to really step up to give them the opportunity and there was actually going to do this is going to spread the offices are more than I Would like to see that more I think\nYou know Doug Peterson does a lot of trick plays but he doesn't do a lot of trick plays with Carson which he only does that would make votes if you notice to point and so you know with that said I think you've got to make up a little bit I think you got a used car so what's in other ways because\nWhy he's coming off the injury number one number two he's getting sack almost eighty percent of the time during the game\nAnd you don't want that what your quarterback and you're on the and we were going in the week five you know you just don't want that so I think you've got to put them in in situation in a way where he can do a little bit more than what he's doing because he's doing everything he can man he needs help the spread\nIs three the eagles are getting three just because they're the home team here Vegas obviously is thinking this is going to be a tight game overall and again that's probably because the eagles defense collectively\nWill probably keep it close but I just wonder how many more times they are going to be able to do that while this off and says she's trying to trying to figure out a score and more points more in the vicinity of like thirty points instead of just twenty points on a daily basis so\nThis game I Will take Minnesota's well Keith because I Believe they are more closely the battle that's the number one play in the ... and I think that type of performance against the LA is more so uh what they are instead of the buffalo lost on what happened that that we ... bills by thing whatever it is\nI really think that the the whole coaching staff there's been able to kind of get this team beyond the Monday Night game Washington travels down to New Orleans to take on Drew Brees and saints the saints it very fortunate to be where they're at\nHonestly because they could have lost the browns\nAnd uh you know obviously we know they last week one to the Tampa Bay buccaneers when Tampa it was kind of high flying there the first couple of weeks in the season with magic and everything but I'm Still trying to figure out of New Orleans is an elite NFC team we don't have an elite hall of fame quarterback when do they have a really good head coach\nAnd they can do a lot of good things off instantly but defensively again I'm a little disappointed because I don't think they're as good as people thought they would be it seems like they've more so reverted back to what they were maybe two years ago you know this is an interesting game Monday Night I think new\nOrleans can kinda reestablish themselves as a prolific NFC team or\nMaybe Washington with Alex Smith kind of steps up on you know if Alex Smith can go into New Orleans and lead this Redskins teen to a veteran Monday Night arguably that's one of his best regular season when\nYeah but I tell you one thing there's one person is going to be very hyped about this game that's Adrian Peterson you remember he used to be with the same team you feel you've got a raw deal just didn't work out the way it should and now he's with the Redskins and he's starting and he's playing actually pretty well\nSo I think he has a lot to prove and his game and he's going to want to prove it\nAnd he's going to be very tough to stop you know the knowing that the same defense is suffering right now I'm so you know I think they're going to try to the Redskins are going to try to establish a running game immediately and explode tried to expose that\nBut at the end of the day man this is the same as saying we're at the bottom there at the bottom of the barrel at one point and now there's three in one I just think Drew Brees as always finds a way to get it done he's gonna and they're going to figure out how to get it done and I think he's going to they're going to take\nThis when so a war with the saints\nI liked the Redskins upset when a nine to\nSay they feel that nation baby hey that's there for this week another great one here on\nKABC radio behind them my were\nBehind the might furnished by Dahlia media\nKevin Irwin on track Olympic gold troubles and bought and after the Senate moves to judge confirmed judge Kavanaugh drug drug Brett Kavanaugh says the U.S Supreme Court correspondent when the Kenyan has the story\nAnd was the product of a democratic opposition research effort to defeat Trump yet failed to disclose that information to the size of court in October of twenty sixteen when the bureau applied for buys a warrant to surveilled the Trump campaign adviser Carter\nPage and knowledge Will Shortz told John Solomon this is a bombshell that unequivocal east shows\nReal collusion was between the FBI and Donald Trump's opposition the DNC Hillary and they Trump hating British Intelligence officer to hijack the election rather than some conspiracy between\nAnd Trump he says they knowledgeable source told him well I get from that that that would be knowledgeable source close to the Trump campaign because hijacked the election it's a term that uh his source used to be with him but\nThis is huge because this is the first this would be the first direct testimony with evidence to support it other evidence besides the testimony according to this article\nThat or a\nThe former FBI general counsel that someone extremely high up in the FBI\nMatt\nJust weeks before the twenty sixteen\nElection and it was just weeks it would be just weeks before even closer to right before the bureau secured a search warrant targeting Trump's campaign\nIt would mean the FBI met with the Democratic national committee's lawyer and Hillary's a or you know uh\nIt was the Democratic National Committee is private Laufer okay so you have that at the minimum but Hillary also her campaign paid money to ... we also which also went down the line so but we know without question the Democratic National Committee is private law firm and the FBI met\nWith at least one attorney from ...\nTo discuss the Donald Trump Russia collusion\nThere's no reason for a top FBI officials will be talking to anybody from any law firm that represents the DNC about Trump Russia collusion that's completely against any protocol of an investigation\nWould it not the I Would think so\n\nSo that's huge news about oil and and if that is the case if this is an FBI attorney but this is FBI council then is that information not a ... own essentially by the public\nNow or the hill and John Solomon was the first one that that actually went into the specifics of it the Fox news story former a top FBI lawyer James Baker gave explosive closed door testimony on Wednesday detailing the congressional\nInvestigators how the Russia probe was handled in an abnormal fashion reflecting political bias which would that exactly with what John Solomon's\nColumn said according to the Republican lawmakers president for the deposition\nSome of the things that were shared were explosive in nature representative mark metals told Fox News the witness confirmed that things were done in an abnormal fashion that's extremely troubling meadows claimed that the abnormal handling of the probe into alleged coordination between Russian officials\nAnd the Trump presidential campaign was a reflection of the inherent bias that seems to be evident in certain circles the FBI agent to open the Russian case Peter ... FBI alert a Lisa Page and others some politically charged tax\nAnd have since left the bureau Baker who had a close working relationship\nWith former FBI Director James Comey left the bureau earlier this year the lawmakers would not provide many specifics about the private trends ascribed interview citing a confidentiality agreement with Baker and his attorneys however they indicated\nIn broad terms of Baker was cooperative been forthcoming about the genesis of the Russian case in twenty sixteen and about the surveillance warrant application for the Trump campaign aide Carter Page in twenty sixteen during the time that the FBI was putting\nA big deal or the D. O. J. and FBI we're putting together the buys a surveillance worn during the time prior to that election there was another source giving information directly to the FBI which we found that source to be pretty explosive said representative Jim Jordan\nSo that's really interesting too but I just said that's the Fox story the story is that a Baker\nMet\nWith ... with at least one attorney just weeks before the twenty sixteen election and just before the bureau secured the warrant targeting Trump's campaign met with the dance seize private law firm\nWow well\nWhat do we have we also know that the spouse of a a top official\nWho was associate deputy attorney general at that time\nUh at the ... of the again in the in the Justice Department a ranking official in the Justice Department his wife worked at ... ...

A. B. C. [noise]\nUse the very early and get what you might\nFall on the radio\nAnd he's currently I'm Gary maximum are eight six six Ninety read I saw the process is now\nA by the way he's Eric I'm Gary uh so now the process or is that uh all the senators will get to look\nAt the actual background check report from the FBI\nOr there is only a single copy that will be provided that they must look at in their room they can look at it over the next uh a couple of days before the cloture vote or if they take notes in the room they cannot remove their notes\nUh with them none of their age are able to look at the actual a document and we'll see where that goes from there whether they'll actually be the call to a you know make public\nOr the report as you add talked about earlier Arab from doing research a this was passed by this rule that it's supposed to be kept\nUp private um was a rule that the Democrat majority Senate put into effect in two thousand nine this actually as a Democrat majority rule\nWell and by the way the nature of that rule and the process by which that\nCame about\nLikely had something to do with exactly this type of scenario so imagine that it got out that you know I mean it could have been any of them that someone claimed a soda my or did this while in college but it was just somebody claiming that\nKnowing the potential of a story like that going wide without being backed up\nCould do damage that's the whole idea you look at that and say okay but is there anything to it you mean like has has happened exactly that's my whole point is that\nIt likely has to do with this very kind of scenario where well the police went to his house after they were called by a neighbor or the or someone claimed that the she did something depending on who the nominee is\nBut there's nothing else to substantiate that\nWhich is exactly what we have here because you get that out into the media and it's a story really that doesn't\nIt it it should not be binding as everyone on on the right right now is is saying about Kavanaugh this shouldn't be binding if you can't back it up\nOr your biggest river background check check simply simply talks to people right somebody could say well ah yeah I heard he had a friend of mine told me that another friend told me that he hit a guy back or when he was in college right well that's double here say yep and so\nThat it would be in the report right because it would rise said during the process\nBut for a story to go on like that it could have the media can take that and they can they can run with it or any any other politician on Capitol Hill could take that and try and use that to their advantage in order to undermine the the integrity of the process which is exactly where we are today mhm\nAh so we'll see what happens today the cloture vote has been set for friday and a general vote could happen as early as a as Saturday as I said I Wish you and I could go home right now and just repeat the rest of the

ah procedurally\nBasically the petition or to invoke a for cloture or that has happened that happened Wednesday late Wednesday by Senate majority leader ah they basically Thursday is a just a kind of a blank day although it will be about reviewing the documents\nAnd friday they will move forward or to move with a cloture vote the enclosure for those that may not know is basically just ending the debate and discussion on it and and saying okay now it's ready for a vote so that vote would happen I'm assuming if\nAnd don't know the headcount there on the cloture vote will tell them\nYou know

unit management\nThat's terrific what about environmental you mentioned that oh you are these ... the bamboo and it struck me as being somewhat biodegradable\nThe uh the the streets\nOf what you have is we currently we have forty percent of our product is from Spain double biodegradable material\nYou gain and\nWe are eliminating the need for laundry which saves water with sexual actress today which saves pollutants of um phosphates us all fights being dumped in and when you take that side of it compare to manufacture where we are manufactured with recycled\nWater than where where carbon neutral carbon plus you know we are working though on technologies in the near future that allow us to be one hundred percent biodegradable\nI get really the ... part\nYes the polyester you need for the strain so we're looking to cast different laminate for waterproof and we found some that are actually ... saying what they're trying to call out to have substituted\nThe floor in my house is bamboo that strong bamboo extremely\nStrong um they make scaffolding from it in Asia related note that\nYeah you walk in Asia and you see buildings that has surrounded with scaffolds made out of bamboo\nGee that's a that's incredible and what about the uh the price to the hospital a jump into it\nBut basically what you're looking at a car it depend upon the which product but it's let's say it's three dollars per sheet or Pearl layer when you do the calculation on the amount of labor savings versus the laundry saving versus a\nTime span worth saving a hospital about four dollars and fifty cents to five dollars per ... per day\nThat's a lot of money got to remember something when the hospital has lent and a lot of them are thrown away or stolen or or um\nA a candidate for today but I kept going and once I get past that are sick slap actually want the most laps I've ever done was up to like thirty laps and oh my and I realize\nThat there's these barriers that we must put through our mind on ourselves\nAnd I was able to push through that I thought how many times have we let things on the table\nOr does having persevere through it to get to where you need to go I felt great when I was done I got a great or work or you know the Jacuzzi ... the interim sci fi that to look forward to but actually I just kept going on in the lab said and it felt great\n... kind of barrier in\nBusiness or personal life can you you give us a as an example the swimming one is terrific you'd only been doing twenty and you got up to thirty that's a great personal barrier break\nYeah and it's almost a you know I think about in business to when you think you can't do that job or maybe it's too much work or it's beyond what your capabilities are\nAnd you can stretch and you can take on that stuff so we've added new services are extended our business of the different areas and sometimes you have to change your mindset and how you\nApproach that and get through it and you really think about it look at the Olympics remember there was this barrier that no one could break for one of the running of that and you know that there were like whatever it was you know the hundred meter he just couldn't do any faster that acts\nAnd then one day somebody broke that I think it was definitely ...\nOr something right Alan hey they sailed past that and it and you know you really realize wow now it's like nothing everybody has to beat that today\nWell why aren't they doing it that you know there there's not that the body has changed or or things oil or why is it mental it knowing you can know somebody else already did it now that we put a person on the moon a man on yeah we're looking at Mars\nYou absolutely went down there that you know like okay we're going to skip the moon to go right to mark but I think you have to break one of those barriers first\nAnd in your personal barriers I Would think might be more difficult if you think about it to break rather than just saying okay I did twenty laps I'm going to do thirty\nYeah it's just it it it's convenient to to give up that that's a key it's very convenient to say I'm going to stop and get out right now and then other people I heard you know these two older gentleman talking later that evening about some guy that shredded water for an hour\nAnd he he was he was happy that he made ten minutes but now that he saw this guy he was telling the other guy\nYou know I think I'm going to be able to go ... when the ten minutes on kind of this other guy was in there for an hour\nWow what a good idea\nAnd your mindset that says look with bigger and bigger go bigger\nWhat a Segway back to a mindset it is a mindset do with your barriers I Can't do that job I'm not big enough I'm not good enough I can get that client I Can't get that woman or man to love me I'm not good enough those are personal barriers\nYeah and it's it's sheer self worth it to your uh what's your capable of um setting those higher goals is really the key is looking ahead you know once you cross that barrier and realize not only did I blow past that barrier that I\nHad in my mind but once I kept going I realize I I'm able to see just beyond my wildest dreams than just the most part it's I've ever done\nWow are you going to do uh what forty next time\n[laughter] well I think that's the case was brought up that a little bit higher than maybe not go quite that far he's forty but at the next time but that in my bigger zone yeah\nGotcha and those are Olympic sized pool or by the way of Robert Clinton seeing the coast of [noise] of

A. B. C. or hey is this an exciting new history here the key word and ... do not fighting one night or you weren't shot at one thousand dollars\nThe Los Angeles\nHigh court vote sanctuary city grandson Martin eckerd the votes lined up to confirmed Brett Kavanaugh to the U.S Supreme Court with the key votes Republican Jeff Flake and Susan Collins and Democrat Joe Manchin all deciding to approve the drugs used in\nI found very very few of them for example today seven hundred law professors signed a letter they asked me to sign it I refused I wrote a dissent\nSaying he now no longer has the judicial temperament well can you imagine if this were a liberal who had been appointed by liberal president who had been accused Norwood acted similarly I don't think a single one of those professors would have signed that letter they will fail the shoe on the other foot test\nSenator Booker why liking no is just dead wrong this is all about partisanship is the opposite\nWas happening and if it was the Democrats who are putting up candidate everybody would be having the opposite way and so it is partisanship\nAnd I think the premise of our constitution never intended the confirmation process to look anything like ...\nAnd I hope that the honesty to say so I mean we defended Al Franken on the show I I don't like personally and I hate his politics but I think he got\nChef of the same region and that and to yes he deserves me defend that you wrote a or you were quoted in a recent piece saying that and Julie sweating next lawyer may have a legal obligation to withdraw her previous statement for me\nI've done some research now on it and there are ethical and moral rules that say that when you should have been an affidavit even to Congress and you ... to learn that there are things in the affidavit that falls you have a continuing obligation to withdraw the affidavit you cannot allow\nAn affidavit to remain on the record right if you have information suggesting is false and any reasonable lawyer hearing her on TV says you can't any law\nYeah except what's in that affidavit she has to be investigated\nIndependently of the background check criminal investigators\nTo see if she deliberately and willfully with or without the eight of anybody else\nMade a decision just to frame somebody for something that he had nothing to do with the evidence seems to suggest they never knew each other that ... years apart they were operating in different circles it wouldn't surprise me if an FBI investigation prove they never met each other and if that turns out to me the fact she belongs in court of law\nBeing prosecuted with the presumption of innocence yeah it's the center but at the evidence shows that she committed perjury prison\nNo nope presumption of innocence\n[laughter] aren't going back on that on our show us [laughter] clearly guilty [laughter]\nBut he points out a couple of things here because you look at it as something we pointed out very briefly in after a you know the claim starts to walk back a little bit well that that becomes very different\nBecause of the way that it was presented by her attorney or sweating it and the fact that it was sworn you know it was a sworn statement that was presented officially\nYou must would draw that statement because items major items in that statement that the major claims in that statement we're now by her own admission in public\nDuring a broadcast walked back and changed so you can't let that sworn testimony or or sworn statement rather stand it cannot be a part of the official because that's where it is right now it's still there officially\nIts edge should be an obligation and I believe it it is there but that's what ... which was saying procedurally they're going to have to go back and they need to withdraw this\nBecause that's an official claim when you do that and it's submitted that's an official claim which she has now changed\n\nI I just I Wonder what Democrats are thinking of of an eddy now\n... well remember what happened to liar Lanny Davis that you know when he started talking about his client calling the former personal attorney of about Donald Trump\nBe having information that Mahler would be interested in and and you know basically implying that Cohen was going to bring down the entire\nTrump house of cards and it went on for a long time it went on well went on for a number of days\nBut I mean the media was really on this and the liberals were like oh here we go finally finally they have something this is going to be it because if he's got more and you're the first one to go I'm a hello children children if he had something for Mohler there would be no play\nYou would not and you know he'd be going home after a steak dinner provided by the prosecutors\nBut you know because of that that was the first tells you were like wait a minute but do you mean it's got something for more than something for Mohler they wouldn't be a deal it won't be no deal because he'd walk right but that wasn't enough until they got to the liar Lenny part\nAnd the whole you know thing with a with CNN and yeah I think right now with ... ... you know they're they're he's still fairly useful I don't think he is in the sweat Nick case\nBut they're hoping to bring back the porn star you know and make and maybe it's the porn stars slash stripper who can undo this president\nBut I I have to believe these days are limited number if not overall together with Democrats because of the fact that it's just it comes up short you're you're with the with the sweat next thing she changed her story so that so\nWith a you know Stormy Daniels well that's didn't seem to have the legs no pun intended in terms of wealth or\nI mean she claims she's out there now talking in and do an interview she was on one of the nightly show's the other day and you know talking about having sex with Trump but I'm ... I'm thinking\nIt's going nowhere it really is ... and and I know why the media does it because if you say porn actress before her name\nThey believe they are going to get ratings and maybe they do I don't know\nSo but beyond that the claims go nowhere you know what I think what the liberals don't realize\nIs this is not the not the nineties in terms of a certain things now certain we were the first to say that after the hash tag me too movement it might have been a different if if that had happened in twenty Fifteen twenty sixteen election season could have gone differently\nHowever in terms of people and a claim made about an affair not abused but an an affair that it's not the nineties any more people don't I don't think especially the younger generation is motivated\nLike a lot of the people in the media who believe that it could bring down a president or an affair is not really the big you know the big deal that it used to be [noise] have you actually with a man who's been married multiple times is a billionaire and was known you know I mean affectionately called a playboy for decades\nI I just I just wonder what's going to happen today what the Democrats are are going to use because you know with the whole evidently with a a a Julie sweating to that falling apart because of or television or interviewing her credibility\nA weakening drastically because of that that interview to the point where a ... a a [laughter] liberals civil rights lawyer\nA like a a ... which was saying you know from what we can see right now she doesn't change would go after her criminally right wow yeah uh then he's lost a lot of cloud and then he came up and then he came across with another unnamed accuser ... and an affidavit from another unnamed accuser\nUh who went to a Washington DC area school in the early\nEighties and claims that ah she knows a that Kavanaugh spiked drinks at parties yeah right and that came out you know yesterday morning and sort of die by the end of the day is that even the media saying okay got burned by a man that he wants right not and you know not really going to go there and so the Democrats\nYou know if you know that was yesterday and that died by the end of the day and and so here we are today\nThursday they've got one day to make another point to stop the cloture vote on friday mhm so were they were I Know they're going to go somewhere mhm I just don't know where they're going to go now right we I I\nI yes we predict they may say we don't have enough time we don't have enough time but that's not going to go anywhere we don't have enough time to look at the FBI background\nCheck we need to make the background check public we need to make it public but other than that that's really not going to do any where everybody is going to see the information inside of there where they can make you know their own decision\nI I don't know what's going to delay it any longer because because I think right now I think you have even the Trump Administration I think they probably agree with what Lindsey Graham said that we said before Lindsey Graham ... which was time to go have the vote and even if you get onto the feet you make it an election issue\nMake it a huge election issue you make it the only election issue as to fall far Democrats are going to go you've seen the resurgence we brought you the NPR poll the resurgence of just over the last couple of weeks\nThe a Republican excitement level to go out and vote you make it an election issue and when you take the Senate again maybe even with more members of the Senate you'd do it\nThat was the errand driver and the LA city council is okay to plan to fund the city's portion of a temporary homeless shelter to be located at the west LA VA campus slated to open early next year K.

weekend which would have been um according to well some analysis\nOf stopping could have been stopping point for the Mueller investigation so the team there at NBC News or meet the press or maybe it was just Chuck Todd by himself [laughter]\nCame to the conclusion that it was a very strong possibility that and this was set on a Thursday that tomorrow which being the friday before Labor Day it's very possible ... issue a report maybe hand down some more indictments or\nAnd it ended up that nothing happened because the the point would be that\nUh there would be respect for the uh election

new injuries you the key word and ... do not fighting wind or you weren't shot one thousand dollars on the\nCapitol we're on track\nOlympic gold winter troubles ... the Senate vote today to confirmed judge Kavanaugh to the U.S Supreme Court correspondent Linda Kenyan has the story\nAnd that's exactly what we're dealing with anyway but the differences is that the Democrats leaked it to the media\nKnowing that if the if the FBI had included this in one of the other previous background checks\nThat those senators would not be able to divulge it to the media and it's only a claim so we'd go nowhere there are no police reports or know anyone public official with any kind of\nKnowledge of this otherwise so it wouldn't have happened that's I'm convinced why Dianne Feinstein waited until after the other background check well we're\n... and someone over the last couple of days that we have found out how the whole background check works with the Senate because of course it's something that we've never focused on before I\nWhat I've been surprised that the Republicans you know they came out and said that you know they didn't follow the protocol but they didn't fully explain it because when you fully explain it as you just did Eric when you when people understand that look there was a process\nThat ... they that Dianne Feinstein could have followed yes that would have always kept because the claim from Dr Ford is well she just wanted to get a known and then you could do an investigation to find out if you find anything on it but I wanted to remain anonymous right\nWell she could have actually got what she claimed she won it is very important for I think everybody to understand that there was a process\nTo keep her name private\nAnd have the FBI do a background check to see if any of this was true\nWithout her name ever being known\nAnd Dianne Feinstein really said excuse my language to hell with that if we're going to use is a\nPolitically and knowing that linking it would make it public\nWhere she's still claims today she didn't want to come forward right she's still claims that ... that today so if that was the case and I don't know whether that was the case I'm just looking at the different scenarios ... but if that was the case it was the Democrats that be trade who they thought\nWas a victim of sexual abuse they betrayed her which is why we said they didn't care about her claim that they never cared about her claim because if they truly cared about her claim and her wanting to keep it secret to keep her anonymity\nIt could have followed the process that existed that they\nHelped create with the Democrat majority in two thousand nine left to have a process yet for somebody to come forward keep their you know keep it quiet and still have a part of the confirmation process and and a part of the judgment of\nWhy you would or would not want to confirm or the particular nominee\nBut Feinstein and the Democrats know that the only way to change those you know they were getting down to four or five votes that's what this is all about to change any of those votes as the political pressure and the political pressure is built in the media\nAnd so you can't do it officially finance or Dianne Feinstein knew there was no way of doing this officially\nBecause it would never get to the media because Senate rules prohibited from getting to the media now we know why Lindsey Graham was so livid last Thursday a week ago today\nThis is what he was talking about violating the process and the rule circumventing those rules and processes along the way this is what he was getting too\nBecause that now the puzzle comes together Feinstein new by submitting this to the FBI early on as soon as she got it\nAnd it being part of the background check\nIt wouldn't have seen the light of day Dr Ford's name would not be known to anyone butter friends colleagues and family because that claim\nWould not still would not be substantiated because they even with all of this they haven't substantiated anything except for the fact that she's making the claim\nAnd that means it wouldn't have left the Senate\nAh at all because it would have been apart as the rural states of that three oh to report and they cannot divulge any of the details from that report again keep in mind if there's a criminal case against a nominee well that's public\nThe people versus whoever that's public that would be no\nBut there but that's it's not the case when it's just a claim when someone's making a claim and there was no report or authorities involved in that claim it's a time so it's very clear why the Democrats chose this route\nNow and didn't didn't want to go forward on the thirtieth you wait until after the vetting process the background checks are complete\nAnd then you get to the media and let the media help you hopefully build that public pressure\nThat political pressure to drive that those four or five votes in the Senate that were on the fence\nAnd now uh like I said today is going to be an interesting day I I wanted to leave earlier I said uh just just do two hours the showing repeated the rest of the day so I go home and go to sleep and wake up at seven o'clock because I won't just because I I I I Am\nAbsolutely are as interested as you could possibly be in wondering how the Democrats are going to try to stalled is another week\n... what are they thinking does you know they are you know there are ... are they are we got to be able to solve this in some way and so we know that\nWe're going to hear the typical things like well we didn't have enough time to actually look at this report a twenty four hours a isn't a is isn't a enough enough time well we'll pay we believe that there's cause some cooperation here we disagree with the Republicans and we don't we believe further investigation is needed knowing that the Republicans\n\nAt this moment are not going to break the protocol and the rules that the Democrats created in two thousand nine up all the irony or and and so I you know I don't know where that will do but I'm sure the Republicans have already said\nThey've had to look at and say okay what different scenarios are out there when wants to release this I mean they know now the Democrats are going to the Democrats and Republicans\nBoth no you know what's in it and if the Republicans say look there's nothing here it's the same as it was last week we're going ahead with the vote I think that no matter what the Democrats say they should go on with the vote\nAnd even if he isn't confirmed then you make it an election issue delaying this another week is not going to change anything that we all know right now you you you did it once you go forward with it you have the votes Saturday if you don't have the votes than you make it an election issue\nInternally no doubt the pressure is going to be on those uh four or five people including mansion ah you know flake or who is shown you know clearly a weakness and uh what they were ... ... what what what they'll tell you on the left the ability to be thoughtful\nOr consider it but [laughter]\nAh I'm Sorry that was fun I Know I'm the but the but that's what will happen internally externally\nIt will be about building the political pressure still in that and this is the narrative this will be the narrative from here until ... we did not have enough time there was not enough time the FBI did an interview enough people there's no way that could possibly know because they didn't even\nInterview Kavanaugh or Ford well they have both\nOf them on record as a matter of public record as to their claims each of them so all of that is a you know is is the political part of it um but you're right Gary I think in terms of now going forward are you the the the motion to invoke\nCloture was made yesterday or the cloture vote will happen friday ah\nThan they will er and if if they've got the headcount then they're going to move forward with a vote which can happen as early as Saturday I suspect they will not want to waste one minute ah in in terms of getting in Saturday and getting that done if they believe they've got those votes\nEven at fifty because the veep can be fifty one the tie breaker then they're going to move on it\nThe the the majority leader will not waste any time and going forward and say what you will about Mitch McConnell and we've said plenty about 'em over the years\nBut he has done since Trump has been president I think a a very decent job I don't know what grade I would give him a but certainly I think he's done a decent job across the board and bringing the party together on a number of things to get them done\nLegislative ... this this rises above legislation because as we know those decisions made at the highest court\nHere's yeah this is this is going this this is a big effect this huge affects the direction of the country and ...\nRight now that the majority leader ah along with corn and\nUh and and a number of others right now oh well maybe not right now but last night and and just an hour or two we'll be whipping those votes together and to and and saying exactly what we just said this is too important to wait any longer\nTen free ways the earlier incident at police chasing a reckless driving suspect in the Baldwin hills Crenshaw area one

liberals to them ever say look I don't agree with cat now hate Trump\nBut I agree with you that due process is worth preserving other liberals who feel that way\nI found very very few of them for example today seven hundred law professors signed a letter and asked me to sign it I refused I wrote a dissent\nSaying he now no longer has the judicial temperament well can you imagine if this were a liberal who had been appointed by liberal president who had been accused Norwood acted similarly I don't think a single one of those professors would have signed that letter they will fail the shoe on the other foot test\nSenator Booker why I like it no it's just dead wrong this is all about partisanship defeat opposite\nWhat's happening and if it was the Democrats are opening up candidate everybody would behaving the opposite way and so it is partisanship and I think the premise of our constitution never intended the confirmation process to look anything like I agree\nAnd I hope that the honesty to say so I mean we defended Al Franken on the show I I don't like personally and I hate us politics but I think he got shot for the same right to send them to yes he deserves me defend it in you\nOr are you were quoted in a recent piece saying that and Julie sweating ethics lawyer may have a legal obligation to withdraw her previous statement for me I've done some research now on it and there are ethical and moral rules\nThat say that when you sort of an affidavit even to Congress and you need to learn that there are things in the affidavit that false\nYou have a continuing obligation to withdraw the affidavit you cannot allow an affidavit to remain on the record right if you have information suggesting is false and any reasonable lawyer hearing her on TV\nSays he can't any longer accept what's in that affidavit she has to be investigated\nIndependently of the background check criminal investigators\nTo see if she deliberately and will fully with or without the eight of anybody else made a decision just to frame somebody for something that he had nothing to do with the evidence seemed to suggest they never knew each other that we hear support\nThey were operating in different circles it wouldn't surprise me if an FBI investigation prove they never met each other and if that turns out to me the fact she belongs in court of law\nBeing prosecuted with the presumption of innocence yes center but at the evidence shows that she committed perjury prison\nYou know a pretty important there because the story changed I mean she changed the story herself and you have ... her attorney representing her that presented and filed officially\nSworn state ... well after that sworn statement she changes the story you have to withdraw that statement but you know what bothers me it's what the left has destroyed ... reality\nNo he ... he just said there any reasonable lawyer ... ... and it's like you pointed out was the the the prosecutor Mitchell right ah who said it who actually use the term any reasonable prosecutor right and I do I go right back to call me and I'm All right yeah he Troy that he's just for the rest of my life if anybody says\nReasonable attorney or reasonable prosecutor\nWhatever they say I just want to throw right off going on over there are quote unquote good call me and they're not but right 'cause they're just you're using the term but he's destroyed that term rabbits like\nThe uh the the whole uh Brian Regan does a as a comedian my favorite I think people know that if they listen for any amount of time does a bit about the
