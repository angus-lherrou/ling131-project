Monday against the DNC ... commission ...\nPage filed a lawsuit in federal court in Oklahoma against the DNC the ... and two of its partners mark alive and Michael Hoffmann that you'll never what happened to cut her page the accusation from the Republicans in the Carter page was a low level foreign policy aide for President Trump was\nBasically hamstrung by that yes he he was targeted for destruction by the DNC working hand in glove with law enforcement members of the FBI and the Obama administration\nThe gold being to get a buys a war against him and that would somehow damaged the Trump campaign that's basically the accusation\nTo to support that accusation there a couple of pieces of evidence one Carter Page still has not been arrested so maybe this was all set up point number two is that never had any ties between the the fusion GPS\nFrom that was hired by the DNC to do opposition research which included some Carter Page material and killed off yet and the DNC and the FBI\nThose ties have been revealed over time and they are bothersome now quite bothers and they're quite troubling\nPage in it he filed a lawsuit and Perkins coy is the from the higher fusion GPS the opposition researcher that investigated down from ... to Russia he lie as his one of the ... lawyers over Perkins quite was perfectly main contact you fusion GPS it was founded by three former Wall Street journal reporters\nAs part of the one million dollar project using GPS hired Christopher Steele to conduct investigation now what's fascinating about this lawsuit is that lawsuit sometimes are designed for victory and sometimes lawsuits are designed for discovery in other words\nIn the process of doing it lawsuit you can ask\nBunch a lot of questions to the person the are silly and they are forced to give up documents on this topic so Carter Page obviously wants to dig deep into what the DNC was doing what Perkins clay what they were doing the fusion yet it also opens him up to discovery as well so in response you couldn't see the DNC\nAsking for materials on her pages relationship with the Trump Administration in Russia for ... lost unless it's really ill founded suggests that Carter Page doesn't have a lot to hide but I think yes he does have a lot to high\nAgain Carter Page has been sort of the the main Lynch paying a lot of democratic effort to paint collusion between Donald Trump and the Russian government and twenty sixteen and so far no hard evidence has been brought out\nTo prove any of that stuff so that is a story that we do watch it unfold now in other news that I think is not as good the budget deficit is the highest that it's been in years we've heard for a lot of years that Republicans care about budget deficits we kept hearing\nThat Rocco Palmo is blowing out the debt when she was up to have what Twenty one trillion dollars now it's unsustainable and that's only the the debt that we\nKnow about basically there's a bunch of unfunded liability that put our\nActual total debt and many multiples towards he trillion dollars unfunded liabilities for which will have to raise taxes but the U.S budget deficit and expanding according to CNBC\nThe federal budget deficit rose and physical you're twenty Eighteen the highest level in six years that spending climb the Trump Administration said Monday the deficit jumped seven hundred Seventy nine billion a hundred and Thirteen million dollars or Seventeen percent higher\nThan the previous fiscal period according to a statement from treasury secretary Steve Mnuchin is larger than any year since twenty twelve when it top one trillion dollars the budget shortfall roast a three point nine percent of us gross domestic product that despite the fact we are now taking in more money than any time in American history from income tax\nAmericans liked the idea of spending less until you actually ask them what sorts of programs they wish to be caught\nAt which point they get quite skittish federal revenues rose slightly by fourteen billion dollars after Republicans ... tax rates for corporations\nAnd individuals outlays climbed by one hundred and twenty seven billion dollars including a spike in defense spending as well as increases Medicaid Social security and disaster relief so that is not exactly physical discipline we have no party in the United states stands for fiscal discipline\nThat needs to stop we need to get them to control if President Trump\nWants to win a second term I Would suggest that we started talking in serious fashion about those deft at some point that the the burning comes do we'll be back here tomorrow\nWith all of the latest I Can't imagine where the news cycle goes from here I was you know all I can say is I Hope\nTo venture out

requirements for citizenship and DNA test while they can be used to determine lineage such as paternity to an individual he said it's not evidence for tribal affiliations\nUsing a DNA test just doesn't do it and that wasn't enough\nA President Obama's former campaign manager Monday sharply criticized her for releasing the results of this test back hamper claims that she's has Native American ancestry he claimed she was thrown her party off message just weeks before November's critical midterm elections she did it wasn't a smart move\nHe said there's a quote from the Democrats argue the

they were crying and two thousand sixteen went from one\nBut it's like people are absolutely petrified also in American than Israel following politics in both countries very closely the left always the right let me put it this way the right always does three to six percent better than the prediction is\nNinety eight percent is not a hundred percent always like in in Israel that terrorists labor

I don't know their deep in it but they they definitely gonna try they definitely going to try to uh get if he gets closer to the base while they're definitely gonna try so\nAgain the fences been frustrating and watch the news I mean over the last two games obviously in a combined what are we talking about now like twenty two innings last night and today yeah one run run where\nIt is I live off of defensive game and uh it is a defense the game but you know I think it's more of the Dodgers had the opportunity to win this game and they still have the opportunity to win this game but they just are not making plays man everybody to the fence and he goes All right you got to base it\nSo first knock of the night from Machado he's on first with one out\nAnd yeah it it's again I I think we do have to give them a lot of credit here a niche and continues to to do very well uh but again the Dodgers have not them themselves any favors to try and get to creative talking about the small borrow Keith that you've been harping on over the last night or two\nAnd they just can't generate a runs with runners and squaring position that you're a big\n... and ... and you know where in the interesting thing is that when you look at this right now we're always going there all playing out there playing for the long ball\nThis is a good time to but just to get somebody in base keeping in field so hopefully that's the start that will go for\nWe're back after this\nHave Jillian I'm so glad to be talking about the home consignment center again it's one of my favorite places because I\nLove this place south of the square feet of just beautiful furniture and home to core I put furniture up for sale here it's gone within like a week and I thought a lot of furniture the home confinement center it's like a treasure hunt\nFor your home I Love to explore thousands and thousands of square footage of brand new pieces that people have hardly even use and a lot of it comes from upscale LA area homes are from model homes\nThat you staging for the realtors and then once they sell the house guess where the furniture goes to the home consignment center so it's easy to get inspired to change at the look of your home\nI the ... center prices yeah it's pretty amazing and by the way it whether you want a big piece of furniture or just accent pieces they've got it all and they also will coordinate pick up\nYou can find all of their local show room on line at the home confinement center dot com that's the hump consignment center dot com\nCan I tell you how we came up with the name ... euro plumbing hello I'm John Korean owner a router hero when I was a kid I grew up with Superman who stood for truth justice and the American way wow what a motto Superman was always on time and he never fails\nAnd so I thought if I'm going to start a plumbing company I Want to be like Superman\nI Want to be the one to see your day if I have a superpower is that I keep my word in fact all are rude or heroes have the superpower so if we tell you we're going to do something we're going to do it now here's or offer router hero will cable your dream for Seventy seven dollars period so called rude or here at\nThe six six drain Seventy seven I'm so confident that you'll be satisfied with their services\nPut my cell phone number on every business or eight six six drain Seventy seven that's eight six six string Seventy seven\nDays\n\nIf you or someone you know is struggling with addiction please call this toll free number right now eight hundred three nine zero nine five to eight\nThat eight hundred three nine zero nine five to eight by calling your addiction team you're taking the first steps to recovery to help you need to be one call away eight hundred three nine zero nine five to eight make the\nRecall now eight hundred three nine zero nine five to eight your addiction teams are third party advertiser for various treatment centers and play some networks individual results will bury visit your addiction team dot com forward slash turns for more information\nHe joined the Orange County Register's successful Eighteen next Saturday after twenty nine AM to two PM reaching the Orange County CDs\nField with pre activities in service including how reading even named ... informational ... will be held drunk again what topics\nCovered nonsensical mainly Medicare when one company meeting conditions and it's an average returns Mercer county cancer learned financial planning do much more admissions talking free for more information go to the aging dot\nCom you you you talk talk talk beautiful bowls\nJ.

innings the series is now\nTied up it to a monster game five coming up tomorrow once again at Dodger Stadium to three to the format here in the league championship series we talked about the red socks beating the Astros earlier this afternoon eight to Jackie Bradley junior with that huge grand slam that put him over the top\nAnd I mean that series of living up to the hype as well so we're we're getting good theatrics here again it's just more so the frustration that does Dodgers line of can't score more runs\nAnd they've just been incredibly inconsistent now Cody Ballenger good hit there he was a guy been talking about last couple of nights really needs to get it going at the ... maybe that will somewhat springboard him going forward we shall see\nOne eight hundred to two to five to two two how about the injury to geo Gonzales the starting pitcher tonight from Milwaukee\nAnd and the first inning and perhaps there was some talk maybe he'll be putting on the DL tomorrow by Milwaukee\nAnd see how that plays out that could be a factor as things move along in this series or not to mention the fact that\nGreat casual how to defend the bullpen which is very good but still they were work tonight for basically the entire game not the Mets and they got to pitch tomorrow right or it was really the worst case scenario because the fact that this game was extended so long and extra innings has to kill them as far as having guys rested and ready to go for tomorrow so that's\nDefinitely a storyline to watch it saw as far as the tea\nGoes for them well they're definitely we're going for the win today you can tell the way they were making their the brewers are making their their changes to the bullpen right away and so um you can tell they're definitely going forward and and it just didn't it didn't work out for them you know and that's something\nLook the challenges are starting to give them getting dramatic even though the the manager and the manager had a challenge ... uh for the brewers challenged uh\nTo um to play back to back in the eighth inning and there's really nothing the challenge there I think there was more of a like a strategy to so to say and it was just saying like look we're going to slow the game of because Dodgers did have the momentum at that time getting on base and things like that and then he boom\nI'm On a challenge that enemy challenge something else again in there and then Roberts came out and he was like what is very pretty much like what are we challenging you know so I think that's like another thing of strategy a moment momentum shifting that you know he was doing and so he knew his team was on on the heels right there\nAnd um you know they just think in fortunate they didn't get it done but you know tomorrow's another game and I think the Dodgers really got to let this one go by you learn from the mistakes you made\nThe it was a ... game but maybe that's the momentum shift in a way so we'll see you know they can get it done tomorrow\nAnd like I said I like my ... I like their chances are going and trying to get in one in Milwaukee but I think tomorrow is just just as much of his this was a crucial game tomorrow is going to be crucial is going to be even\nThe stakes even higher so hopefully they can get it done\nWe can continue to take your calls on this game I Do want to mix in some football stop and\nDo what a somewhat of like a recap on week six here the good and bad if you will and let's start with maybe some of the good stuff we saw last time we talk about the Monday Night game obviously a Green Bay the\nThe heroic silver San Francisco Rogers doing his thing are going back to Sunday we also talked last night about the rams very impressive once again on the road in Denver also the chargers a lot of people starting to think now there's this chargers team\nCould potentially be one of the top dogs release challenged some of the top dog AFC I say pump the brakes on this one I Am not willing key to trust his team yet in a big spy on two they prove that they can go out and they can win a big time game whether that be a big time regular season game\nPosted in game you name and I need to see this team when pressure is on the line or if they're down for example\nLate in the game can they come back in those situations winning on the road in Cleveland against the browns even though they're better this year\nTo me does not cut it and does not know the eyeball test to say that this team can now compete with the ... see I just don't see it quite yet\nDoes not make him top five quarterback in the league right now I'm Sorry it just doesn't you have to see a little bit more you you you I think people were our looking ahead and and you got to see what he can do\nThis is this is only want to have to see that it goes back to what I Would say even with with Jimmy ... below at the end of the season right they only certain\nCultures only there have tape on this guy yeah this is the first season coming in\nLet's see what he does the second half of the season before we start saying that when he started playing teams twice already this season or whatever the case may be when they started distributing tape around just starting to see his flaws and things like that\nLet's start to see that before we start handing this guy the keys and saying he's top five I don't believe that I think he's a great player\nUm I think he's possibly top ten right now I can give them I'll give them in the top ten right now um but I Can't give them five\nEven though we got too many great quarterbacks out there that Scott earned their stripes and has has done so much to the game\nYou know we put in front of no air Rogers I'm up here from Tom Brady I'm ... I'm not going to put them in front of Philip Rivers Russell Wilson um and and so forth I Can't I Can't put them in front of those guys those guys will just Super Bowls yeah Andrew around us that Drew Brees you know I Can't put them in front of those guys however I can say\nThis just to go back to your question or your statement which you said that can they ah you know they can get it done you\nKnow going through the super bowl I'm saying the patriots or can give it doesn't go to the super I'll just say this is New England patriots do get that number one see and they got to go to arrowhead and they play the way they've been playing this game maybe a different outcome\nVoice amazing how there's so many teams right now that that both the huge home field advantage yeah obviously these two teams are perfect examples of it that game would be totally different at our at yeah just like out this game it goes on the patriots terms it all these games especially knowing who makes the front of the class this year it's going to be because most likely it's on their terms\n... year in their backyard they they play the prototypical game or the defense is not called upon to do too much and obviously the authentic is performing at a high level figure out what you're seeing that Josh court and getting in the ... a little bit more than I\nAm I'm In Boise the straw that serves that drink they are not often it's amazing yeah\nAnd uh you have guys come up with big catches will be Chris Hogan and an Gronkowski as well although he's little banged up right now still comes up with the cats when he got up on that often once again is starting to get better it's almost like clockwork I mean they're they're in September they're trying to figure things out\nBy Tom October rolls around they're starting to formulate things you start to see the points come up by the time they're going into November December itself\nAs that continues to evolve so by no stretch has this off its peak that I think anyone who's watched Patriot's games the last couple of years can tell you that that they're going to continue to grow but the interesting thing is that the defense is what it is it's probably not going to improve too much at this point in time\nWell they're trying to make adjustments are trying to make changes\nAnd they've done that um you see our role is not out there right now a right way and rightfully so exactly but you you know and look Atari ... is a very hard to guard for anybody in this league he's like I mean tonia brown incredible in the ... died in ... my family I really\nYeah absolutely and maybe the most dynamic yeah inside\nAll you got to do is throw it up there and making and its attract me and he's going to go to get it then you know\nGood job to Andy Reid that he you utilizing\nHis talent to to his um to his strength\nAnd you know to the system and he you live in in the right way and that's what you're seeing there so you know it's gonna be there they're going to be definitely a tough out but you definitely want if you are the ...\nBecause you definitely want to try to get that once the because you don't want to go to arrowhead if you go to arrowhead and that's going to\nBe a long time a long long game and possibly a different outcome\nSo that some of the good from we saw Saturday or Sunday night of the worst thing that I saw on Sunday Cuba or not there was something worse in my opinion in Jacksonville and now he ... the Oakland Raiders pathetic performance in London against the Seattle Seahawks Seattle again there's just some talent there\nBut they are not this could have football team where they should be being changed by three or four scores and that's exactly what they did twenty seven to three Homer Oakland\nAgain I get it grew in ... as an even been there a full calendar year yet yeah but I didn't think they are going to be is\nYou know it's a shame watching to me I look at 'em like dang just grew didn't get it passed and\nWhether we think are going to be you yeah you\nGot to get a pass because I think they want to utilize and they want him to get to Vegas and ... at least of joggers and but man\nYou talk about a team that to me look I under I get this [noise] your new coach you got a new play book and he's like\nCalling the same position as what a chip Kelly ... is a CLA at the end the comparison and and so you got a new play but you got guys got to make that adjustment to what you do and some of 'em is taking longer than others\nBut you're pro athletes are not performing into pro ball type of play and I mean in like the more Cooper's of the world even the deer cars of the world you know you\nDon't see that I mean you're right you're not getting nothing out of ... those guys are running back he's not getting nothing\nAll around right I don't think you can even rely on march on Medicare on anymore yeah and he\nJust looked cheeky ... to me\nMarshall English is supposed to be a third down back he can get you the first down if you start in one third in you know but he can't be your main back at this moment in time I might take nothing away from ... beach mode in my book but you just not that type of power play right now it's just that's not what it is\nI it just really upsetting to see someone like a more Cooper who can really change the game he's supposed to be compared to like a up there with the Julio Jones's of the world and a Antonio browser the world and he's just not performance or part of our\n... already Nelson looks old now I could see why Green Bay let him go in the offseason he's not the same player is definitely lost a step and\nI really question if their car at this point keyed is gonna be the future franchise quarterback of this team yeah I just I at this point I just I'm very concerned because of how good he played before the prior injuries when he was putting up MBP caliber numbers a couple of seasons go\nThen obviously gets hurt we know about the back issues from last season that's been well documented\nI just wonder if he's going to be that same guy or if if\nAgain the injuries have piled up I don't know it's hard to get a sense that this to convince yourself this team is going in the right direction with the current personnel that's my biggest thing yeah I I again I\nThe jury is out on whether or not grooming can kinda go back to his old ways of how he was coaching with Tampa Bay ten years ago\nI I don't think we're going to know the answer to that maybe the next year or so\nBut the biggest thing is the personnel of this team what are they going to do going forward big big moves to make big decisions that size and\nYou're absolutely right and just before we go because I Know you've got two minutes left there was another one that was a horrible this week in the you know I'm getting a nature ... Nathan Peter me I mean God awful I mean\nI guess that just keeps on giving right there ed to opposing teams that is a maid\nAnd I'm going to say is Brett I'm Sorry to say it may I was I'm going off the talent wise\nYou cannot tell me that ... like I just I I I I don't understand it\nHow does a quarterback like that get ... I mean he's horrible\nBrat you throw cross patterns cross ... I don't even know I was drafted by I ... I don't either I'm really obvious scratching my head the whole time you throw cross the bill passes across your body and get picked six is all like that right there is just\nIs not a sight to see I'm Sorry every time he got the ball you could tell living on the sideline those guys are ... have in their eyes shut like please just just make a complete pass or just overthrow him or something but they don't let them intercepted again and it was horrible\nI tell you about this yesterday he actually has more yards that he's given up as far as intersection yard yeah there were ... uh the opposite team versus completion passing yards to his own receivers just let that one that just for a second\nHe needs to go to the CFL maybe go go just get your game right a little bit more you know I think he's not ready\nTo Jesse that Alan might be out a couple of weeks oh God so they just signed Derek Anderson who I Would imagine they're going to go to ... I definitely would I\nCertainly would definitely started their hearing and there's no way native ... and what types of field after\nDodgers two to one winters once again that series data to games that peace will be here tomorrow night to break down all of game five on to the end for Keith I'm Brad keep living the dream [noise]\nBehind them might burnish by values media\nHe used to talk of\nADC\nOrange County cumulus station [noise] promise to investigate\nCanada is legal I'm only a princess for tourists they buy from ... says Saudi Arabia have committed to conducting a complete investigation into the disappearance of journalist ... ... of course want a dramatic could run chase has\nThey want it oh you know we have to prosecute we have to impeach we have to do this well you know what she doesn't get a free pass on this I'm Sorry and I was really surprised to hear you say that um\nWell on the other one ... go ahead\nOkay yeah I was going to say I you after you talk I'm On your side it's not that I was so strong you know she deserves to be prosecuted can stay in the woman but I was just thinking you're ... yeah and I know what you're going to say I'm actually on your side they be riots in the street right there but we have that now and she does are already there yes you're already\nOutraged right while the Irish hot with the band aid off and get it done it over with you know we're teaching our children but if you have enough money and influence you can get away with murder literally you can get away with ... and how many\nTrees in his couch but you know will give her a free pass could we do what rights shouldn't street give me a break\nI agree with you because it depends when you talk to me you know when I'm On your side half the time I'm just looking at the other side thinking\nReally do we really want to make it worse is if you only get worse you know what I said I made an offer on national radio two months and years ago I actually was a couple of years ago I sit in a few times how about they just go away if they suffered so promising I never hear from them again bill Hillary and if you throw in Obama\nThat wouldn't that be worth something not using a ... bomber\nA pay for the plane ticket but you know I don't see that happening\nI I think they they're still trying to manipulate and a dominate and I think you know I'd love to share Ron I'd love to see Iran because I think Trump's got enough starch and his British could go after her and do it right this time\nOn the on another hand you're asking who I liked the she runs one of the things yeah ... ... talk about Trump and the way he speaks at all that\nWhen I go in for brain surgery I don't care what the guy speaks like I don't care if he tweets bleach whatever I just care that he's good with a knife\nAnd Trump is good at what he's doing\nHe is rocking the place I don't care what he says in the middle of the night I really don't I think it's great that you just end running the liberal fresh and beaten into the hearts and get his word out before they get a chance to twist it and I think that as long as she's good with the knife like a surgeon\nI don't care what his bedside manner like\nYou said you would agree with you\nYeah you said you've been listening to me and that's what I said I I just care what he does he's totally shocked me how good he is a I think he's been a great president I said that the other night\nI Love what he's done and I don't care what he says I Can't ... you said it for me like a pilot or you you might like the story so I'm On a plane one day and the pilot and says that it's the first day for the flight attendants so she comes down and people reading her and uploading her when she gets to me I said\nBetter you than the pilot you know it's just going to be somewhat yeah or stay better her so I I don't care so much what he says you're right but uh well he does in in that sense you're\nYou're totally right and I got to tell you that is a joke when people would yell lock her up I kinda like that who she deserved it well she\nGets rule of law we keep preaching rule of law ... it's about time that we stood up and you know maybe it's gonna hurt maybe it's going to cause a little pain for a while but your least standing with the degree of integrity or what you believe that and that's that's\nWhere I come from on that one was very it while I'm here\nIs you can I teach you a little bit first sure OK I'm sending ... given them your address\nShannon Shannon [laughter] health care or is it or we don't care what was your dikes ... county next\nTo the one that upset election we're Lackawanna county were right north of loser county that everybody blamed for getting Trump elected but that's okay um I can answer the border wall

I Can't remember the head of the CIA guy\nUm if we don't prosecute these people for the crimes that they did a weirdo were no better than a third world or the third world country we're letting these people get away with what was wrong illegal unconstitutional and it basically all those things make a make I'm an American\nAnd the if if we don't take the people who commit treason and prosecute him for that then they're going to keep their little following that they're going to walk around you got plenty of people out there that are saying that well you know ... evidently it was it that bad they did break the law they didn't do anything that was so evil and\nUm it it's [noise] I I just think that something needs to be done to show them and along with all that you know freezer assets because they're ill got games in the Clinton Foundation\nAnd I mean if we're going to go all out or go all lead on Kavanaugh for thirty five years ago I I'm sure we can find plenty of people and evidence for what Bill did back in the eighties\nSo I mean why can't we go that route\nYou can and although someone challenged me and said what about the civil war right he committed uh certainly uh illegal acts at the time and yet we were generous and you know we we didn't Lincoln didn't want to do that kind of stuff\nBut then this is a wartime\nThis isn't war time this is it people who actually are saying that the people who did who fought on the side of the confederacy [noise] we're finding that this is I have a different view on on the civil war than some people do I mean I I I understand that\nFor some it was about slavery but for most it was about a overreach of the federal government and civil disobedience and states' rights that's where that's where the bases\nThere were a lot of them were fighting that okay go ahead no no\nI'm just letting you finish gr\nOkay now but I mean that's so that that's where I mean to me the rebel flag that the rebel and actually it's not even really the rebel flag it was a a a battle flag from a particular state it took on a representation of states' rights to me that represents states' rights over\nSlavery and when I talked to people and I've actually talked to people who have flown that flag where I've had that symbol on their truck or whatever it is and I asked him I said okay now what does that represent to you and nine times out of ten it does have to do with you know states' rights and an overreach from the federal government\nAnd the people that uh take the other avenue as far as slavery and white supremacists and stuff like that then I just you know okay what makes you better than anybody else\nWhy why or why are you better than that person what gives you the right to enslave another human being so and I think this is also the difference between an old dovetail hear the difference between conservatives and liberals I won't go party wise here because parties are\nEvidently irrelevant at this point and that is we engage in conversation we engage in discourse\nDefend your defend your principles defend what your argument is they just want to shout down they want to call you names now that is not everybody in the

who's who's running [noise] yeah [noise] well you well I I Know that there is somebody who's actually discussed\nRunning or did you get used to be a rising star who uh no longer I think it is a viable candidate that'd be Jerry Brown I'd love to see him run\n'em really who actually is moon love I Love\nOh I'd love to see him run oh I don't think there is anybody out there that's going to be able to beat Trump\nI really don't and I think he's because he's got one a campaign under his belt for the presidency he he knows a lot more one thing you can say about him he learns and uh I I think he's learned a lot of valuable lessons and I don't think he's got to be he was a little\nDon't know if they saw but he wasn't he didn't play hardball the way other people do it and I think this time he would really\nTrying to be a little bit more aggressive and the way he would uh address anybody who comes against him on the left I'd love to see Cory Booker go up there because I think each I think he ... the same thing with Elizabeth Warren I think anybody from the left it gets out there he's going to pretty much ...\nI certainly agree with you he's gotten much more comfortable in the job he really has become much more presidential and I think that's what you're saying he's really grown into the job and I Oh absolutely\nAnd and he does is he's been doing really good on everybody's watching what the right hands doing\nActually I should say left him because he is science with those right everybody's watching what the left Dan's doing it with his right hand he's just signing stuff sided sign of mine he's getting a lot done why everybody's talking about the rhetoric and looking at the bombastic and and um\nMy my my fiance and I have been a friend it by several people that we went to school with and stuff because you can't talk politics with him\nIs er liberals they don't want to they can't defend their arguments they they don't want to talk about a policy it's just Trump pay ... it's like well we're where do you see that he hate ... well he just talks about\nMe examples because all the hate that ice is coming out of the left all the people that I talk about hey are over here on this side that are represented the Democratic party and when somebody on the white quote right or the Republican Party that comes out spewing hate the Republican Party shouts them
