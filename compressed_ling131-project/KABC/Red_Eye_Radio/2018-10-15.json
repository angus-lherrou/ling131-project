don't do this to me I mean I Know I Know when someone has made a point I Know when when OJ Simpson got up in the courtroom and try it on the gloves I knew that that was a major moment in the case\nUh but as far as determining what a jury is going to do you know as well as I Do that they are unpredictable and that we never know until the last moment when they come in with that verdict what they're really going to do I usually have a hint I usually have my own feeling okay\nDid you think ah OJ was going to be found not guilty and the criminal trial yes I did ah did you feel you're going to be found guilty in civil trial\n[noise] I'm not sure I ...

back again with more champions of Justice Thomas Iranian royal oaks\nOur special guest today is Associated Press special correspondent\nLinda Deutsch on the subject on the table today is the press and the judicial system\nYears ago I worked in news in San Francisco on the radio and was there for several breaking stories or when they happen to them when they came across the a P wire as a matter of fact uh one was the Jones town story the other was the damn white story a and a as a reporter\nYou have a mix of emotions and you just incredulous\nYou are absolutely excited and galvanized a you feel the weight on your shoulder of reporting this story correctly out for you the first big story that you covered was Robert Kennedy being assassinated what was that like for you\nIt was horrible um it was a unexpected I I was in the ... bureau that night my I was very young I was just starting out as the cubs and the bureau and uh my shift started at midnight hence the midnight and he was here and he was killed at twelve o five\nAnd it was very emotional it was you know everybody who came as we've been on the road with him are reporters had been traveling with them they were all coming in and tears I mean he was very much loved but the the priority for everybody\nWants to get the fact find out who this guy was that had shot him find out where everyone was at that moment\nGet all the details I mean our report about Thomas was incredible he was practically on top of this Kennedy might have happened if he'd been any closer he would have been shot and and they had the presence of mind to get to a phone and call in\nAnd that's the main thing you you put everything else aside and you just go\nI was a kid lawyer I was there that night uh you know I mean I I Would ask the ambassador and I remember them yelling out one of the reporters let's not have another Oswald they were running around and to me is\nI think of my wife of various moments of my life and when that you'll never forget I mean that that was definitely one of them without a doubt yeah that was an extraordinary and then to see\nYou know that family what had happened over the years I mean you\nLose your weight and oh it does\nIt said all of the stories that I've done in the past seemed to be coming back it's like everything all the new again um I mean I've been writing things on I wrote a story last summer on the four days anniversary of the Manson killings\nAnd I was up to the prison for the last parole hearing ... before she died I've been doing Polanski which is one of my old cases\nA Michael Jackson of course has come back with the events after his death\nUm it seems like the major cases that I've done in the past will never go away they're part of my DNA almost\nBut ah but they keep repeating not only those with similar ones right has a sense that young a young person to five years in jail the son of a major Hollywood person yesterday you know I mean\nIt's it's interesting yeah yeah ah and I don't know if the fame goes with the problems or\nWe just know about their problems or don't know about the other problems but it is\nYeah it was very sad that was cameras Douglas yeah right yeah\nAnd then he had spoken openly about anti drugs and so forth his father had yes they're they've had issues and so forth and [noise]\nBut it's a rip your heart out in the one thing is to be involved in something like that and then the next thing the thing is even worse because you see it all over the press\nRight right but you know I think that um the the public is interested in these things because they think that it could happen to them and it is instructive particularly a case like that for parents that have young young kids\nAnd you know how could someone who is the heir to such a wonderful Hollywood name and you know a fortune\nHow could he get involved in this\nOn the public when you were reporting on a case what is your thought of me I Am\nI Am thinking that I Am your eyes and ears in the courtroom I Am there to give you\nEvery detail to try to have ice in the back of my head so I can see what's going on in the courtroom as well as what's going on the witness stand and and then the front of the well the courtroom uh I'm there as an observer I'm there as a chronic color of\nHistory because I Am can convince that most of the trials I Do which are very big trials\nSituation for me and which I now couldn't walk down the street without somebody stopping made asking me about the case\nUm and it was the ultimate\nMurder trial people have said well if it wasn't for TV and if it wasn't for the press now wouldn't that it wouldn't have been covered that much and I I say in any era no matter when\nAt the beginning of the century or now this would have been a big trial because he was the most famous American ever charged with murder and that is a big case\nSuit has been compared to a Greek tragedy absolutely royal\nWe talked about OJ ... took over the national conversation Rodney King took over the conversation in Los Angeles huge huge deal if you were quoted as saying it really kind of shut your faith and the jury system for the cops to be acquitted in Simi Valley broke your heart\nTell us about that but also flash forward to the second cop trial in federal court and we talked about whether a jury can be fair\nCould a jury really be fair in hearing the case against those crops knowing in the back and then the front in the middle of their mind that if they voted not guilty again ... bad stuff might might\nBe another riot yeah that was considered um the idea of going to federal court of doing it a civil rights prosecution [noise]\nYou know it struck everybody is kind of double jeopardy ... although it's not legally and um and those jurors were questions backwards forwards and upside down about whether they could be fair and I think they were dedicated to being fair\n[noise] it was a very tough trial it had different some of the evidence was different or new uh it was tried according to federal regulations which says you know are quite different and uh they did get some guilty verdicts which was what they wanted\nBut the the first trial was just a disaster um and I think everybody's been remembering it this week because of the deaths of Daryl Gates\nAnd the and the fact that you know his behavior when the riots broke out but I was there and I remember sitting in that courtroom and as the verdicts were read the report is sitting next to me turn to me and she said I guess we're going to have to go cover riots now\nWow but as it turned out we couldn't because we were in semi valley and we could not even get back into the city or the case was tried up there which was the first mistake\nYou know what though um I've tried a lot of jury trials\nWonder if you lost a few I think they get it right most of the ... I really do\nMost of the time they do in that case it was pretty disastrous they didn't get it right and it was you know it was just monumental because it costs the city so many lives and so much money\nI think that particular case the public even the public was surprised I think the public believed the the it would be found in Rodney King right\nA William Kennedy Smith you covered that can um the lawyers who defended him to a black he was on the show\nOver a black with all the irate or he did a good job isn't great lawyer yeah it really is that he has a good way about him David either and I really liked him ... one of the\nThe most fun those shows we've had you know that he married one of the jurors from that case yes I Do I mean we didn't bring it up [laughter]\nAnd I suppose you know if if that's the way you got to win it that's the way to do that [laughter] I don't think that was I was out of a dryland amateur yeah that's after the\nShow you what it is I get it here you are\nGone all through these trials you've tried more cases and moved trial lawyers in California and do you think these judges or any good\nI think judges you know in general are just fine\nExcept for the ones that try to throw me out of the courtroom [laughter] I don't like them very wise they are they trying to actually out now and they're well I've had that experience\nWhere I've had to get a lawyer because adjust aside for God Knows what reason as to press should not be in there and I know\nFirst Amendment law which is very useful to know in my job and so I Will do a jazz and I'll say\nYou know you can't exclude me from the plume Eric hearing because there is the riverside press enterprise case that says I have to be in there\nAnd uh and often I'm able to convince them a those are the only judges that I have to ... a couple of taking your down though no you've always got in your way well I'm no we've lost things early on and then we've gone to the appeals court in one um\nI think that in the Michael Jackson case we lost more battles than we've lost in any case and it was very sad because among other things to judge prevented us from getting a copy of the indictment I mean the indictment is the basis of the whole case and to seal the indictment was unheard of\nAnd unfortunately because of the way things went down there we got almost all of the documents after the trial was over\nHe he may be releasing stuff to this day it just kept releasing it after it was over and uh and it was useless at that point because the case was over ... been acquitted we didn't need it then\nBut we did need it beforehand and it's interesting because in the in what we were talking about in the OJ case in Vegas we just won a judgment there from the appeals court from the Supreme Court in favor of the press because um we were\nAre not given copies of jury questionnaires\nAmong other things and the jury questionnaires would have revealed that the terrorists had these strong feelings against OJ and we didn't know it and had we reveal that it might have made a difference in the case I think it's unfair when we don't get the the information because the public has a right to know that\nI'm just going to ask the windows a crystal ball take on the Internet versus newspapers cause your name was on millions of times Associated Press all over the world in ten years people are predicting that will be any more newspapers the ... his name off of uh you you think we're just going all Internet\nI don't think so I don't think there will ever be a time when they were being known newspapers I think that the number is diminishing um people are willing to adapt to the Internet all those certain people are not I know an awful lot of people that say I have to have my daily newspaper in front of me with the coffee or it's not a good day\nAnd I'm afraid I'm In that category I have to read my paper on paper\nI have a hard time doing the crossword puzzle with my pin on my right very messy yeah so I think that there will always\nBe a print presence but I think that a lot of the newspapers are adapting and are offering their papers online and readers are adapting to they're they're starting to pay for it and that's where it it will come down to whether it becomes routine a and whether every won't be able to afford to\nKeep printing the news you know what I'm here referred to as the queen of journalism oh well thank you well you know that\nIn ... that's been written about use for a long time you have to feel pretty good don't you know here in this very competitive arena and in this arena where the press is frequently referred to as massively unfair and here you stand out\nAs the queen of journalism and even your comments today as we listen to you on did you take a side here who is right who was wrong I think you were genuine and those responses I'm just going to report it you know great\nWell I appreciate that guy if he had a great it's humbling in many ways and um\nIt's also you know I I also have to realize that I have a lot to live up to and uh and I hope that I'll be able to continue doing that\nOkay you're going to be back here in two years twenty four months what has happened during the past twenty four months\nBy then probably a lot of other people are going to be in trouble and I'm going to be covering them\nHow 'bout that they do you know pretty good stuff you've been listening to champions of justice with Tom Gerard even royal oaks are very special guests today Linda Deutsch Associated Press special correspondent our producer is Amanda ... and a couple of thoughts we uh earlier referred to the Pulitzer Prize\nWas Joseph Pulitzer who said our Republican to the press will rise or fall together\nThat coupled with the comment by Warren Buffett the smarter the journalists are the better off society is for to a degree people\nRead the press to inform themselves and the better the teacher [noise] better student body

the world Adam is Columbia University professor and ah he previously taught at Yale and at the University of Cambridge\nAnd a Adam is a prolific writer he has been a number of the other books she has written and I'm going to mention one in particular the wages of destruction making and breaking of the Nazi economy will ah topic will come up during our discussion\nAdam uh I Know you're in Berlin I Know you're burning the midnight oil so I Want to say thank you for being with us and thank you for staying up late for us\nI think you've having meal\nWell we're delighted to have you on and uh I have a copy of your book in my hands right here and uh it's quite a work I wanted to ask you what why did you write this book\nWhen I think I'm a as a historian it was really striking how as the crisis struck in two thousand tonight I kind of ... and histories of the crisis began to be created by ... by journalists by economists\nAnd I felt at some point that this was a really interesting kind of test case to show students are all sorts of different disciplined in fact how history is ... created and\nHaving set myself to kind of read and study all the other people who bought and writing these histories of the crisis it felt I needed to kind of political together and work like this\nOne of the things it's always fascinating fascinating to me about the financial crisis is the fact that um [noise]\nIn March of two thousand they you will know Bear Stearns ... a gotten a lot of trouble and a wound up being bailed out in the end I'm with the help the Federal Reserve and I'm\nWith the help of the major bank of one of the things has always struck me is that uh I mean that was a really big deal that was a real shock wave for a for Wall Street and for the Federal Reserve\nAnd uh and yet it really didn't serve the\nThe value of that warning shot across the bow so relatively soon in March of two thousand they didn't really\nUh accomplish what it should have accomplished because All right they bailed them out and things move forward and and then things still disintegrated within half a year ... what are your thoughts on that\nUp so that they made the best a bailout is on to this day at the most controversial elements really of the story because\nShowing at the cuts civil tonight as the bowl has a point of view I think actually argued that the willingness of the fed to step in that environment and to broker a sweetheart deal for Tracy Morgan to take that I've\nSaid the wrong message by the chief executive and so on a limb and\nKind of picky about a deal for themselves it it made them feel that they have time or to cut a deal that would really suit them so there was a real I think question mark about whether or not that a bailout as necessary as it seemed at the time because the risk was the bad would\nUm go bankrupt or be forced to engage in a foster child and then the huge losses would have to be recognized on other balance sheets\nThat bailout may have in some sense um in fact a heightened attention in the market because it's a loudly ready to take fall through law and occupy the Merrill Lynch as well thought through

were thrown out there the the Ben Bernanke excuse that well we didn't have the power to do anything which we threw out because so many decisions were made at that time on the\nOn the fly that uh you know no rules were being followed they were trying to save the system and yet when they came here when it came to leave and they made what I Do believe was a a crucial mistake I'm not suggesting we wouldn't have had a financial crisis but I Do think it made it worse what are your thoughts\nI agree I mean I Do think\nRetrospect it was a mistake I think if we look into the wreck or the statements

H. O. radio in Des Moines Dan you're on the line with Adam go ahead\nYeah so I'm completely been amazed for ... district with one of the year two thousand how powerful moderate communication\nContinually creates deflation or pressure on pricing by price discovery I see it all the time on television is the at all the crime on\nOn on social media Twitter Facebook Amazon these are all mechanisms that are driving the price that act like they're stuck in the twentieth century they act like they don't know the Internet really is when it comes to\nPrice perceptions election and are and how it the flights continuously while they can they scream inflation but no they're they're more are facing roof over his art\nGot life stretches from ... from their level so I I Can't believe nobody calls them out on it\n\nYeah I got this was a I got this was the topic at the Jackson Hole mating or this year the the the deflation repression from the Internet economy is obviously very real of this is the incredibly long upswing that we've had since two thousand nine the exaggerated will not far off on the many ways quite disappointing\nBut what's really remarkable about the how little inflation repression there is in the system you see that on the wage side as well so I agree with you to speed I call it the shift in the world economy or the last Twenty years\nInternet is part of that story which are emphasizing but I also think you have to factor in this of course he's in a connected with into that story the role of the Chinese economy is a great manufacturing hub which is the ... the pressed the cost of production down around the world\nSo this is not changing the game in terms of monetary policy\nAnd yet professor there is a an intrinsic irony here that we would even for a moment be be\nThinking gee I Wish there was more inflation\nYeah well that that's true ... on the other hand deflation is a very bad thing from the point of view of the credit driven economy and we have to look at Japan to see how to build a tightening that can be really sets into the system I will say from the points\nOf handling you know an ever expanding volume of government debt if you look back historically the Nineteen fifties the Nineteen sixties when economies lied to us in the u._k. with dealing with the debts accumulates during World War two they were paid back by very high levels of taxation they paid back by high levels of growth but\nA key element in the story was also inflation running somewhat ahead of interest rates\nAnd that a is a sense of the attacks on money values\nOr which helps to distribute the cost of paying for the war in that case paying for World War two across the top of that I shouldn't even though he's holding assets\nSay managing and economies with structurally love inflation in fact a tendency towards the ... is a really difficult thing to do and it's actually ... novel it's a new problem in Japan is not exactly a promising example of how things might go\nOur guest is Adam ... of\nColumbia University whose new book is crashed we talk on the program um\nWe talk on the program at all about the fact that you will know that\nAre in a credit driven economy inflation is your friend in the sense that you're giving back your principal and appreciating dollars you're paying back your interest and appreciating dollars\nYou know just ... just briefly could you help our listeners understand a y ... in credit driven economy is so painful in terms of what it does to Europe for example outstanding debt\nYeah I think the best way to look at this is the housing market I think that's where most of us understand this nice intimately\nAnd you take out a mortgage on the property at one of the basic questions you've got your aunts or in your head as do I expect the value of this real estate to go up and\nAlmost all property tales of done on the basis at least the ... the house will retain its value will probably appreciate to some moderate or perhaps great extent if you're buying in San Francisco well Manhattan or somewhere like that\nAnd the and taught basis of the deal this was ... for the subprime deals the full two thousand tonight is that you'll have real price appreciation and that you have the reverse is if you have a certain price poll just the prospect of the long run and sustain fold and prices\nThat hits you'll equity and of course it does absolutely nothing to the debt that you owe the mortgage doesn't adjust downloads so in an upswing the price increase\nProvides a huge benefit to leverage to investors to take it out to mortgage with a small amounts of equity they gain all the profits from the appreciation the reverse happens when you're going through the fresh in your situation\nI think insofar as the vast majority of people have most of the equity most of their assets most of their wealth in the real estate\nI don't miss the old and a very large part of that at least as leverage three mortgages to find yourself in a situation with process fooling is really a death now\nFor for households ...\nYeah and in a simple model one hundred thousand dollar property where you put twenty thousand dollars down that if that property declines in price may ten thousand you've lost half your equity\nAs an expression of the software will of the British people too well originally it was really a consultant

people disgust me I Can't watch or listen to them Kavanaugh was not even my first choice to get the nomination but it wouldn't have mattered\nThey could have picked for example the pope and he's a leftist but they would have been against him if President Trump had appointed him why in heck did they even\nNeed hearings or further FBI investigations when they announced how they were going to be voted with the very few exceptions answer to soccer and people like Jeff Flake\nTalking about it I'm sure people said I'm not the only one that's talking about being named directly by the way\nHe said he would vote for cabinet are having a he was all set to but it did you see this historical woman confronted him in the elevator\nAnd he admitted that was part of the reason he was for an additional FBI investigation\nJeff Flake is a fool this delayed did not unite the country as he suggested or placate the Democrats it further divided us this was all a show to delay the process so they can get in power Lindsey Graham how to just write\nThis is all about power and I can take more easily if they just said what they felt hey we just wanted to let you guys because we want to get in power and then you can't have the Supreme Court judge one I Wish they would it be honest about that\nBut there are a bunch of phony Hippocratic hypocritical leftists they discussed me\nTell me what you think an eight six six Ninety red eye but it's worse than that\nBecause we have now taken away one of our most basic rights the presumption of innocence you can charge anyone I said this before with any crime you want and you don't even need to have proper ending evidence it doesn't matter if they're innocent you can still ruin their lives and there are no consequences for the ... this is an important\nBecause you have to prove they did it with mouse if they didn't intentionally do it then they get away with this do you remember I don't know if you remember this Reagan sector labor I think it was secretary Donovan that's the name that comes to me\nHe was asked after it was found innocent after he was accused of I don't even remember what it was they said something like what are you going to do next and he said something like\nWhere do I go to get my reputation back\nAnd some like Feinstein senator funds have the nerve to question Kevin O's belligerence and demeanor at the hearings what was he supposed to do some Feinstein\nYou've helped destroy his life act ever so serene as you ruined his\nLife I wouldn't have I Would have let them it wears his bank account\nFor all the good work he's done for all these years later\nHow did Bill Clinton stay as president after what he did with the complicity of use Senator Feinstein and others in the Senate those hearings were not a good week for America and I wanted to know what you think because it relates to my whole point about civil war\nI Want to know what you think eight six six Ninety read I\nMatched with Christine for I'm getting a chance you guys hear me I was on another show a few weeks ago so I'm getting this off my chest a second time I'm very fortunate I Do I think she was attacked yes she appears credible in that regard\nTo judge Kavanaugh commit that attack I doubt very much\nEspecially since no one could corroborate her story I when I say I think she was in fact I don't know exactly what happened and whether some of this could have been in her imagination because there are a lot of inconsistencies\nIn her story she doesn't actually got there how she got home when it was exactly why she didn't tell others at the party or anyone else for decades after that\nSo now as I said we've reached the stage where all you need are allegations so what's to prevent hundreds of people from now on making accusations and stalling every nomination they don't want\nAnd ruining everybody's reputation in the process\nNow there's going to be no way to get off this merry go round just accused accused and accuse\nIt's a new Democrats strategy that has not worked\nThanks to Senator Flake and Murkowski flick at least voted for it [noise]\nBut Murkowski didn't I think she I think there's some movement to recall her and she needs to be recalled\nThe rest of bills fools who allow this process to take place looked by the way that sleazy lawyer what his client claimed about Kevin a\nFamed can be yours with a flick of your cell phone do the Democrats as I said last hour understand where all of this is going\nTo remember Harry Reid starting the nuclear option with judges and now we can just do a fifty fifty one\nAnd yet the reaction did you hear the reaction of the righteous\nSenator Feinstein as a quote it showed him to be aggressive in bowling here's what Joe Biden said he witnessed a degree of invective blind rage and Bruce partisanship that threatens not only the Senate and the Supreme Court it threatens the basic faith in fairness and justice that binds the country together\nIs he getting that's a Democrat play book and\nMitt Romney ... another genius I mean I was a delegate for them by the way I've got to make in full disclosure he announced the support the decision to wait a week another example of why he lost he doesn't know how to fight these people and that's a point do you have to know how to fight them\nGoing to ask you your least favorite person that you watch during that week and perhaps senator Mazie her on her own or however you say your name my top your list especially after comments that men should just shut up\nShe and she by the way a week or so ago she was asked if she was confident Democrats didn't strategically league Christine forms accusations against Canada just days before a committee vote\nI think it was here's a quote are you confident the Democrats didn't leak that letter and how to respond to senator Graham's charge that it was inappropriate for the Democrats to refer to a doctor for a referred to a lawyer hosts George Stephanopoulos asked her own on ABC's This week\nAnd what a chance of she spelled spotted all these things called do not focus on what we should be focusing which is the credibility of judge Kavanaugh she responded before calling Kavanaugh's claim some political conspiracy against them bizarre\nShe didn't answer and stuff like that to me and her and she goes on a by the way even as all of these accusations about this being politically motivated being tossed around everyone acknowledges including judge Kavanaugh that Dr Ford is not being politically motivated\nBy the way she her owner has suggested Kevin did not deserve did you catch this he did not deserve due process because of his outcomes driven conservative legal philosophy that is very clear again if you're on the right\nYou don't want to serve the process of being a a a proven guilty just the accusation is not\nSo she may not have been politically motivated forward but you you just heard you and your masters and deception used her\nThis is all just crazy and I I Love with Graham said he's going to get to the bottom of its suggesting that someone then find science officer wanna Ford's attorneys may have been responsible for strategically delaying the leak deploying to leak the harm Kavanaugh's chances\nAre it's just amazing as he said those extra Senator Hatch so this the goalpost moving never stops\nAnd here's my summation and then we'll take your calls the only force is the way you and your cronies conducted the circus\nAnd maybe the ... to cross the ACLU the American civil liberties union yeah

even even in the house huh\n\nI think there are a lot\nI I I think that way but what ... what do you what are you up\n\nI'll I'll give you my opinion I I I think you know I've been told by experts that we're going to lose the house because I mentioned his name before one of my friends are state the Republican committee men from California as a day in ... in trouble and he's never been in trouble he's in orange county a\nYou know typically the president's party loses the the part of the president empower loop they lose seats\nI think it'd be very close and maybe we'll get lucky and we won't lose the house but I'm really afraid of that happening does not like we're the poll showed that you know that a Trump was going to win any one it so it's it's possible but that's what I'm saying type a little bit of a lot of people going out\nAnd then they don't expect to go out because the Democrats are motivated they hate President Trump they hated capital they want no part of this or that they're coming out in droves I think\nAnd so we have to match that kind of a passion so I'm not really answering it depends on the day in the mood I I tend to be optimistic but\nUh let's see if he asked me to vote today I'll I'll do my optimism say we'll just barely hold on and that's what I'd like to see happen but you can let me know what you think and speaking what you think ...\nTo Morgan

Saudi Arabia has some experts\nA jury I get it and I I get a ... it's palpable your your frustration and I'm thinking as a ah somebody asked me earlier today I think we'll lose the house if enough people like you come out we will lose the house representatives and local errors in there I live in California is not much hope for a Republican here either\nBut if enough people were upset and I think they were by Kavanaugh hearings as an example I think they are going to come out in big numbers so I'm not sure there's going to be this incredible blue wave\nI I'm convinced by the way there's a a a strong statement of Israel when the Senate easily or not that that's a big statement for me because of most of the races that are up for grabs her reason that Trump won ... states that Trump won in a big fashion\nSo we're going to pick up seats in the Senate I have no doubt about that and that should make you feel better\nBut I think if people are as frustrated as jury appears to be it seems to be no reason to doubt it across the country I I don't think the Democrats realize what their reaction is going to be and they may have overplayed their hands in fact I think they did because even people maybe in the middle\nHad had to have some revulsion to see what was going on they just measure this guy they just told them apart and what you think Ford was credible or not credible\nHe wasn't treated well and then and then when it's all done I mean they have them he couldn't win for losing as they say when it's all done they said oh he was belligerent uh yeah I was supposed to just sit back and take\nThe all the stuff we're destroying his reputation for ruining his family life imagine what the his girls think of him now I mean maybe they haven't changed but imagine what they have to go through the gifts of security in the threats against him\nOr even afford had some she's going to go out of the limelight although I like the way they said that you had nothing to do all she had to do is was she was going to lose by coming out no she's not probably write a book come out on television or need to hell to do so badly so I'm not sure she lost so much\nBut if if Jerry is right and he represents the frustration that uh I think a lot of people feel out there\nThere may not be this blue may it may be much closer than people think\nAnd because the thought of the hundred and said this than I thought of the Democrats retaking the house\nAnd the hearings and the subpoenas and in the if you think the Kavanaugh hearings were disgusting and revolting wait till these people do it for two years to do everything possible to impeach Kevin out to impeach Trump\nThere are a lot of start you know how ... works in the house does at first and then he's tried in the Senate doesn't matter that they can't when\nThey didn't care that they couldn't win against Kevin Oh\nThis'll be showing this all the and their basis so angry yeah I I've never seen anything like this I remember I Want to be fair\nThey hated George W. Bush and you know they thought Al Gore had one in Florida which when they did the results I I think Nate newspaper editorial boards or whoever did it and only one even came out for Gore and even that was assuming the absolute best scenario for him\nThese people just say if it's possible they Donald Trump that much more\nAnd that's why you have the resistance that's why you had a soft coup in the U.S Justice Department\nAnd with the FBI at the top echelons where these guys were the lady and that page and so on their tax each other where they set up a Carter Page\nOr two for the ... you know that he was if you're watching that he was a spy with the Russians and he was in on the Trump campaign trying to you know uh make sure that the Hillary lost when it's all incredible what these people are up to\nThey literally were acting like a banana republic\nAnd try to take the election away from President Trump these people are angry but if you get out there and you vote\nThere's there's gives me a lot of hope and it should give you to Charlie in Nashville fraught with more\nYeah a good show are you comparing it to the civil war and that was the saying if you if you don't learn from history are doomed to repeat it\nAnd I think\nAt least waves where I went to school but they don't teach the real division of the country in the civil war ... one side won a slave outside it and like him so he wrote you know you get into the real civil war there's a lot of the vision a lot of different issues that were divided the nation\nAnd we're at that point now\nAnd mhm just saying that but there's a way the Republicans can win\nAnd if you look at the map if the Republicans can get eight nine percent of the black vote the country will be totally read for for the rest of this country's existence I mean if you look at\nFlorida if you look at those key states where there where the black vote really swings that to the Democratic side that's all we have to do is get that and the Democrats\nPlay they they go after the black vote by offering you know public housing all kinda entitlements and\nAnybody can see that it would be better to make eight hundred a week then to get eight hundred a month assistance and that's that's what we that's what Republicans need to breach in the poor neighborhoods and that's my comment and I'll listen to your results of their ...\nWell you said a very Well Charlie I appreciate it two things come to mind one that's why the Democrats so I was with a legal immigration 'cause they win usually in that category uh in fact that always bothered me when Karl Rove and George W. Bush the seven oh you know\nThey'll get forty percent they can get up to forty percent of the Hispanic vote and I thought oh forty percent you still lose every time but you're on to something really significant which is the black vote and President Trump they said Romney got six percent I think Trump got eight percent\nOr if we start to get more of the black vote on the Republican side the Democrats are in huge trouble because they've counted on that Ninety percent Ninety three Ninety Ninety five sometimes you know what I buy my God I think it was way up there they count on that\nIf ever they lose an interesting percentage and that even the Jewish population they they started to go the other way they the Republicans now started I think at twenty five thirty percent [noise]\nThey're in trouble ... big trouble as you suggest that\nIf they can't count on of those votes and they shouldn't shouldn't get those votes the Democrats have controlled every city just about every major city every major school district and think about the last thirty forty years how the schools have\nA function of how well they've been doing I'm saying that in the opposite direction they're not doing well or how well our cities are doing\nAnd you come to Hungary inclusion one of the Democrats done for the people living in the inner city\nThat's a real issue if ever the Democrats lose that vote there in huge trouble and Donald Trump as many\nYou choke I and I was just right away I knew right away this last year so far I age you just from outer space honestly in history and then they right away as like you know fifty seven\nYou know you get to help people and it's like I mean she was so full of you know what I just can't believe anybody could have believed or closer to ...\nWell a lot of people thought she was credible 'cause you you know she had that child like voice and she seems sympathetic and I can I be sure that none of this happened I'm I'm not even talking about ... now\nBut I was saying can I be sure that she was an attack by someone could chief fantasize that all that stuff maybe [noise]\nUm yeah it's suspicious but a lot of people don't want to talk about it for many years to come so\nIt's just unclear I who you know I I Can't be sure that you make of that stuff up\nMore well you know you you saw a picture of her ... year book and\nShe looked I looked like a ... a nice kid like an awesome young child young girl and you think of something or and a half and you say she would have been\nOn it like you know like the next day that night she would have probably told somebody [noise] um so I think it's just the but to me I mean just seem right away like a non starts\nYeah but you know it's hard to read someone's motivation and many people say been through that that you don't want to say anything to embarrass you feel guilty whatever I just try to be fair on this thing ah someone got me on the letter of the national show that I was on and said more look at you saying she was credible well [noise]\nI don't know I I just try to think of what the average person out there watching is thinking and\nUh she seems certainly sympathetic to write a site I if I just want to take the position that people on my side or you know always telling the truth and the other side is not you're going to get in trouble you got to look at it the way an

California Mike you're on with mark\nThanks for taking the call yeah thank you for taking the call you know\nI'm driving home and I I just got home and what I'm thinking is you know I'm not a lawyer but I think most people understand the statement I'm sure you do there is a letter of the law and then there's the spirit of the law and in both ... and what you have is what the law says\nAnd what's practice commonly in the course we all know and what\nThe law is supposed to create\nAds you know the way we look at the overall picture of any type of legal potential legal situation we basically it seems to me pretty simple you got to minors\nA fresh from what I read said she was sixteen and he was Seventeen every time my buddy growing up trouble or my those relative just thank God acted parents kept me in line didn't get in too much trouble\nBut you know they look at what miners do and they are still director or they they they they do what they call its budget they raise the\nBottom line is that a lot of that is\nThe sitter or by the judges or games out there with players ... ... this was this it on and then what did they end up doing with their lives so is so is there a chain there is a record of it she never claimed right there's no physical evidence\nAnd so there is no physical lined frost it brings in the law even as a minor so there was nothing committed as a minor that record\nAnd he's a lighter but yet they race things miners are serious you know that race what language do in the area a burglary robbery rats asked all types of things and she never explained anything you know other than what she said but to me\nThere isn't a and it's clear their thoughts miners ... wearing a Jew and accomplished in which al hard he worked in his life and he showed class he never got his friends or anybody to bring up her past\nSo you know maybe she's got a spot ejected that maybe she does it but he never talked about bringing anybody on board to talk about how she gave a high school or you know what\nI think you know it it's very obvious what's happening which ... and you know that's that's like climate minors there's not enough to anywhere in this uh they're minors deal with everybody else does and the court system and the only way to the federal courts\nWhen it's minors involved what ... what do you do with what they read and by the way he had no record so that's like that's what I call it\n... el ...\nSure Mike ... that's ... ... you brought up a lot of great points look there's a new program that Obama certainly encourage the law was passed where the Florida a shooter murder or a\nMan a program where they didn't want it to go on high school kids on the records of high school students even if they got in trouble which is one of the I think the thirty five thirty six incidents I don't even remember\nWhere they would have found that he had a problem but there's a program to make sure that people can live their lives and not let you know something here or something there get in a way of them being successful\nRight he had nothing\nEven this I suggested ... who knows what really happened even if he was part of it in some way these high school kids as you were talking about these were minors and what about us thirty some odd years where he is his bank account of all the good stuff he did well once in a house that if you just look as

Apologize to you [noise] um we have a lot of calls I Want to try to get to them I think it was more about power and money goes along with that of course I I'd be\nDisingenuous if I didn't admit that but there was even some talk that SARS pay some of the Georgetown was paid some of those demonstrators certainly at the cabinet hearings\nUm money yeah money's on the part of it much much more about power about which way this country is going to go is it gonna gonna let forward direction\nWe're going to be true to our founding\nA constitutional republic and a a government that tries to for the most part just do what's absolutely necessary to stay out of people's lives\nThat's what I think the real battle about and maybe in of course money's including look at the Clintons how can I denied that right they became rich with the Clinton Foundation selling a you know access for millions of dollars I don't think that the Clinton Foundation is making much money anymore so they know they're not they're low\nI I never got to it I'll do it tomorrow night um I'd love to see Hillary run again because I I think\nIt would be best them let's go to Amanda in del city Virginia you're on with mark\nMark and great to talk to you and I I really think that we're winning and I think it's I mean that's um and I think Steve ... is a good example of how we overcome horrible attacks and then\nThey're seen as hero because I I just think he is one of the bravest people I've ever seen and I also think President Trump and I'm Brett Kavanaugh are are very brave people\nAnd I was so upset by what happened to Brett Kavanaugh I decided you know what can I Do to fight back against us um and one of those things that I've decided to do is\nI Will take away the laughs ability to communicate in any way I can\nAnd I talk to people and I challenged them on their views I also um have removed guard signs in my neighborhood that I disagree with because if they're going to steal\nPeople's honor and trash people's reputation and I I I Can't allow them to\nAdvertise the main my neighborhood to promote themselves\nYeah but I don't think you want to take away the yard signs 'cause you can get personal trouble\nForget what the ramifications that I Know I've been saying that we got to fight the way they fight and so on but I don't want to see you give them any trouble as it is legal to do that and you're lucky to be you that's called taking down the yard signs so I I don't want to do that it's not the way to do with NATO heavy on your side\nAnd I understand what you're saying and I you know I I I take great precautions to make sure that I'm you know not seen but the the thing is is that I have seen Republicans ... run over and destroying\nRight in front of my audience and so is that there was a a gentleman who drove a cost him on right in front of the um we\nMaryland and a Republican office drove I say thirty feet across the grass and tried to run over a sign with his car\nAnd we were sitting there watching it happened\nAnd you know it it just blows my mind that you know that somebody could do something like that and then this driveway and no one does anything to him you know\nAnd I I yeah I live in California and I wouldn't put a Trump sign up on my car that'd be the end of my car that would keep the car there's no doubt about it since I wouldn't put enormous rely on that I mean\nYeah yeah I saw that guy with a black pickup trucks that had his car firebomb because he had a make America great bumper sticker on car you know they wrote after Trump on his car and spray paint and then broke the window and said interior on fire\nAnd I just I I just know where winning when they feel they have to do something like that\nYou know and he ... his Democrats and we see them sending things on fire so we know that they're desperate and\nI I just think they have nothing to offer except for outrage protest and you need more than that is a political party to be effective and\nIt's just ridiculous you know I've been listening to talk radio here for more than Twenty years I read books you know written by conservative people um like Rush Limbaugh and mark the van and and and I know more\nAbout politics than most people so when I can print a liberal about their belief I can I can combat them with facts that I have on my side and I think if we educate ourselves\nBy reading these books you know and and the only two um city towels Web sites you know licensed to lie dot com and and and reading her story about how these um states attorneys\nAnd I'm judges were breaking the law in order to um vilify and spy on Republicans and you know once people know these things and see the dirty trips to check that Democrats are up to\nAnd I I just can't see how anybody would vote for them and\nI think that they're terrified also that President Trump has become um attractive to the African American community and out and out of black Americans are having a more stable of viewing him um and I think it's you know it's over twenty five percent now and they need eighty five percent of the African American votes wins\nOn no they need like Ninety percent or a few percent here and make a huge difference\nUm yeah so there's a lot of hope it no you may not have been listening all night but there's a lot of frustration out there and I think the Democrats overplay their hand and the Kavanaugh hearings ... trying to destroy this guy even if they want some merit to her case that's not the point point they just want to be with us and\nPresumed innocent or we just had some interruption there go get your call if that's what it was but a great call uh I think I'm I'm getting more optimistic after doing the show tonight and I'll be we'd all we\nAre filling in for the guys are I I think they overplay their hand and Republicans are going to come out in huge numbers and maybe we will not lose the house let's go to Thomas in Knoxville, Tennessee you're on with
