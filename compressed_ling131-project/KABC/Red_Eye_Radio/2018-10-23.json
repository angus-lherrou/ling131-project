designed to protect men who believe they are women from deportations of everyday life nor is it meant to prevent\nPeople who were feminine the mail from being discriminated against if you want a law on that basis they'll pass a law on that basis but that's not what I don't mind that\nThe Trump administrator and simply says that out loud and suddenly leaped loses its mind this is what headline says okay quote from the education department no person in the United states\nShall on the basis of sex be excluded from her as a patient and be denied the benefit of or be subjected to discrimination under any education program or activity receiving federal financial assistance\nNow known as the war that has used there no person in the United states shell on the basis of sex not of gender now even if it said on the basis of gender in Nineteen Seventy two\nThat still would not have meant gender at the transgender lap wants to explain gender now in Nineteen Seventy two nobody was foolish enough to believe that a man who said he was a woman was actually a woman\nNobody okay there's not a thing and so to redefine so they're they're doing a twice what year it they they're doing a linguistic and legal twice which here but they're saying is number one that provision of title nine doesn't refer to sex or first gender\nAnd gender is just expressed feminine or masculine characteristic than they are saying that by gender we actually means sex so woman who say she has a man it's actually a man\nSo just to get this right I don't mind which was designed to protect women\nFrom mail discrimination now is designed to protect men who believe they are women\nFrom discrimination on the basis of discrimination against women there is nothing in the law that suggest any of that and for the left to go nuts over this person just transgender people are being to find out of a distance no but there's a saying that there needs to be an objective measure of male or female before we can determine whether someone is being discriminated against on the basis of their ...\nAs opposed to the basis of their behavior now you can still outlawed discrimination on the basis of behavior\nYou really think this is an important thing why don't you just try to pass a law this is ... ... well\nAnd actually do what they wanted it and the last actually did what they say they want to do what they would do is they would pass an antidiscrimination law that would say no school can fire any man who shows up dressed as a woman at work\nAnd this is it is what they would say no school and take any action against anyone based on perceived gender identity\nAnd they can actually do that but instead because the left wants to hijack the wild is what the Obama administration that they're forcibly rewriting regulations in order to carve the heart out of laws and interpret them in exactly the reverse of what they're meant to be if the let's get one elections they'll do it the regulation they did the same thing with regard to carbon emissions they tried to use the clean Air Act\nIn order to regulate carbon emissions there's nothing in the clean air ... Air Act that suggest carbon emissions can be regulated by the yet\nYou argue the stuff when an election and then pass legislation that you think the American people like and then we can answer as to whether we think you're right or wrong okay\nMeanwhile we've forgotten all the obvious things in our society obviously I mean that's basically what the today show's and about global warming is not ... other obvious thing you're going to be happier in your life if you have less sex partners before he got married and the Atlantic now has reported on a study over at the Institute for family studies\nNicholas will find her in a sociologist at the University of Utah he found that Americans have only ever slept with their spouses are the most likely to report being in a very happy marriage\nMeanwhile the lowest odds of Merrill happiness about Thirteen percentage point lower than a one woman partner wants women who've had six to ten sexual partners in their lives for men there is also a debt marital satisfaction that for one partner but it's never low as it gets for women\nThis is what the graph shows why because marriage is a very good institution and it turns out that when you reserve yourself for marriage\nAnd you make that special and connected to a level of emotional and spiritual intimacy are likely to lead happier life I speak as someone who has led this life\nAnd the promise of the sexual revolution that free sex all around it was going to make everyone happy or a bunch of crap it is not true it has never been ... is a false promise attached herself to one human being and recognize the fact is more than just getting a rocks off\nYou'll leave a lead a happy life and by the way your sex life will be happier to\nAll of this should have been obvious that we as a civilization and just cut and decided to discard the obvious in favor of the attractive and that of course in a huge mistake well we'll be back here tomorrow with all of the latest\nCrisis on the border continues and we'll bring you all of the news breaking on that much but I feel [laughter]\n[laughter] ... orange\n... should have\nA B. C. news is live and local at ten o'clock I'm Jeff ...\nAnd the police officers have entered a building on Ventura bar boulevard where at least one armed robbery suspect\nUh she's in the news why because the media is picked up on it now maybe the media is not in this case doing what you as a Democrat would like\nWhen it comes to what you think the media should be promoting or or what their role should be in a you know ... whether there should be parallel endorsements coming from the Democrats and your media [laughter]\nAt you know at at at the same time but the fact is the media has gone ... over okay so Cortez and the media has gone ... uh uh over a Robert Francis Beto O'Rourke\n... it is the media we played it yesterday on this week or this week is a new show and Stephanopoulos goes to the reporter out there in the reporter talks is talking to him as if he's a rock star by saying you're really a rock star oh no I'm not no no no you really really you really really are\nAnd you know that's not that's not reporting in any way a political reporter should never be in that type of discussion you know do you know to begin with but the fact is because the media is God's got over ... and Cortez they are the ones that have annoying to them as\nThe new leaders in the new\nBecause the new faces up to the media pays attention to especially the new young ones and you know they're looking for new young blood because they look at it and they say Hillary can't when we don't want Bernie remember a case of Cortez came out just over the weekend and went indoors Bernie Sanders who she endorsed back in in uh in in twenty sixteen\nSo a Hillary as we know everybody well I won't say everybody there are some Democrats would like her to come back but most Democrats don't want you know her to come\nBack into now you've got the you know the new you know a young guns\nThat are out there and ah you know a ... stadium I don't really care whether we get you know Obama's endorsement and I really don't need Obama's endorsement as if look you're the old news and then a case of protests coming out in St Bernie Sanders nine door summit twenty sixteen we'll wait to see what happens you know come uh twenty twenty\nWow yeah\nAnd and do you look at it and you say who will be the uh\nYou know who the person who will be the uh you know the nominee for the Democrats are in twenty twenty we got a great show I had coming up\nUh early voting I started yesterday in Texas has already been done in other states even before taxes that NBC story out there saying that the GOP assault doing the Democrats in the early voting in a bunch of different states will get to uh that\nUh the uh ... ... ... what else or\nThere was something else I had while you have to oh yeah yeah because I mentioned uh uh twenty twenty and the Democrats\nAre we told you so Cory bookers plan to give out more cash mhm we talked about this yesterday that what you're going to see from the Democrats is free everything for twenty twenty mhm\nFree everything but we don't believe in the constitution and we hate America that's the new that is the new narrative we don't believe in the constitution we don't\nBelieve in due process we don't believe in the first amendment we don't believe in the the the second amendment we don't believe that there should be a Senate we don't believe that there should be a a a a a\nA electoral college we don't believe in the constitution of the United states but we wish to give you everything they got up to six thousand dollars Camilla Harris now Cory Booker talking about fifty thousand dollars\n\nThat can be used or by the young poor in this country to buy a house or to get a college education so now they're up to fifty thousand dollars remember back in twenty sixteen to show you that Eric and I are on the cutting edge of where the left is going\nOh we dated look why don't you just come out we need somebody to come out to be the first one to say we're just going to give everybody a hundred thousand dollars well they're not up to a hundred thousand yet but two years after we said that and it was two years right about now mhm 'cause we told Hillary look\nIf you want to get it if you're looking for that last you know two weeks push hundred thousand everybody should just go all the way yeah Cory Booker not up to fifty thousand dollars ...\nThat's the other problem we discussed yesterday was Hillary\nYou know with a with everything you know the the big free and and and all the money you don't forget the free will also pay you were going to pay you now the government's going to pay you\nSo you'll get everything for free and we're going to give you money well if you're Hillary there's no way you can't be a moderate in your approach\nNo if she's thinking of running you better take some numbers down they're gonna have to be bigger than what's out there now\nWhen you well you know is is the six thousand really just got blown out of the water just out and ... ... ... men that in a couple of days I now we're up to fifty thousand\nRight and that's not enough\nYou can't buy a house for fifty grand art bunkers got fifty thousand who's got marking on I got a hundred thousand a hundred thousand ... got a hundred thousand\nWhy don't we just force the home builders to build somebody there ... everybody their dream home ah the grocery stores they can charge you anymore\nSlave healthcare is the right food must be a writer yeah free food as long as it made by the way why isn't anybody come up with this thing about that for years ... shouldn't that be before cash yeah why isn't somebody come out and said look very good for everybody should have been before health care\nYou don't go to the doctor every day but most people most people except for supermodels eat every day\nFood\nBy the way we don't condone just walking into a grocery store and leaving without paying\n[laughter] have that bond you [laughter] wait wait for it but that's\nThis is this is what you're gonna have to [laughter] it will be an auction they'll have an auctioneer during the primary for the left it'll just every every instead of debate it'll just be an option\nOf what a promise his campaign promise auction you've got\n... [laughter] [laughter]\nYou've got Democrats out there saying you know with this one point six billion dollar lottery yeah we've got to start up and the money that we're going to give people be looking at one point six billion\nHow about if we have a let's call it the lottery that everybody when that's right yes how about that is the right hand picked by the way somebody should be paying us for these ideas you know we we told the Democrats back in uh\nIn twenty sixteen you're not and you just start offering more money right we set a hundred thousand right Corey bookers up the fifties is that the fifty\nWhat that story coming up about the the the fifty\n... because it wouldn't go to everybody but they're up to fifty though that's the point it's up to fifty now because it will continue to expand but that's what I'd run on ... ... if I'm a Democrat but we wish to have is a lottery for everybody where everybody wins well it's funny because\nYou know they focus on in this case young poor people um that includes most young people\nMost young people are poor\nBecause ... and here's the law as we pointed out yesterday too you start promising things and and people realize well you're not going to be able to afford that for everybody and and they will draw a line it will be for some\nSo in a rising economy and people start making a little more money there thinking to themselves well wait a minute I might not get that that's going to go that free stuff's going to go to somebody else but not me see that's the world we live in the ... by the way that the world but the Democrats\nHelped to create ages ago this is where we are forget about you I'm Out for me I'm Out from mine\nIt's all about me so my neighbors gonna get fifty grand I'm not going to get fifty grand\nAnd meanwhile Eric and Gary have to pay for\nWe have to pay for it and they'll think you're you're you're building a welfare wall and making us pay for it\nAnd if you're a first my listeners because even under the Republican tax cut Eric\nAnd Eric's taxes in my taxes went up around\nThat's why I went to early voting today and voted straight ticket Democrat [laughter]\nI'm proud of fact I I Want my money do I\nI Want to know about ... [laughter] how old you out if it's all about\nBlaming the Democrats or have my vote [laughter] that's not true I didn't do that I haven't voted yet I Am going to get out this week though a spin or we have a nother beautiful day\nWe yeah we had a beautiful day and and I don't I just new to the first day of early voting is not the time to to uh to go out I didn't check the now the polling places you normally right around the corner from me and they're not it's not there anymore I've got to go like\nFive six miles to write for early voting right and so I just said nope and I'm thinking Wednesday because let the first two days go by and I'd given the advice to a friend of mine who lives in Arlington, Texas and that is you know very is a Republican town right where the stadium is ever people probably know that across the country\nAnd uh she told me she heard news reports because thank goodness I didn't go out I got reports over in our ways yeah for early voting yeah and well the NBC story now is this fake news ... it's an NBC stories saying that the GOP is out doing the Democrats in early voting\nRight it's NBC than be seats\nFake news or ... or or is it is a real news because they're worried and they want but wait a minute go out and vote\nAnd then the Anaheim man made a half court shot before the start of the fourth quarter of tonight's Lakers spurs game and he made thirty thousand dollars but the Lakers last one forty three one forty two and overtime to ABC's so Cal weather\nThe size of ice flows mid forties were around sixty sunny mild tomorrow highs and the seventies at the beaches eighty downtown mid eighties in the valleys and right now it's sixty fourth Santa Fe springs sixty four in Santa Ana sixty one and woodland hills you hear a lot of polls while the only poll that counts as on Tuesday November ... election day\nBe sure to be heard and vote I'm Jeff ...

Republicans out pacing Democrats in early voting in key states NBC News\nA fine ... ah the ah here's\nThe story this is from NBC News is the blue wave turning purple I'm reading from the story Republican affiliated voters about pay democratic affiliated voters and early voting in southern closely watched states according to data\nProvided by targets smart and independently analyzed by NBC News data analytics slap\nGOP affiliated voters hubs surpassed democratic affiliated ones in the early voting in Arizona Florida Georgia Indiana Montana Tennessee and Texas\nYou know you you and I have closely watched\nThe um the Bob\nMontana a Senate race where you have a Jon Tester going up against a Matt Rosendale mhm and we you know we've noticed that you know the our CPA average on that the real clear politics average by the way it's a great website to go to for anybody out there if you're never gone to a to look at you know all the latest polls across the board\nA and but you and I looked at that and Jon Tester the Democrats you know you've you've seen consistently over the last month is up by three well the latest poll that was done there was was September twenty second a dead end tester was up by four at that particular point in the margin of error was three point seven\nUh and you and I said you know how can you make a how can you look at that now are cp has it as a toss up\nRight they they\nIt's a toss up but when you see that you know because we've talked about what is what is the voter excitement level so you you when you see Montana in there that makes us look and wonder what would the latest poll say I'm the test or Rosendale race in Montana\nAnd and because there's a number of motivators but the ... the entire ah Kavanaugh's confirmation process\nAnd the hearings and then the ultimate confirmation a vote\nIs there anything in that particular race that was that was motivating for one side of the other\nAnd what what are the polls saying it's frustrating for me because I I actually ask you during the break or they did they just go on vacation when early voting started the pollsters invade don't no no\nBut polls were still go even if well the problem is is a major races you haven't had some in recent days you had some up until a I got to go back to the Ted Cruz a work thing but it's at least a week\nOh well that's why the Montana's ... over a month all well it is among I brought up is thirty two that's on my way or they will get right oh Texas thirty two is now what twenty nine days old in terms of that poll which is\nSomething it's a house seat but it's it's one that's been held by Pete Sessions for a long time and Pete Sessions is up by one but that was a month ago\nSo I I have no idea I don't know why the pollsters are not more active especially in this particular uh uh uh election season as\nAs I I thought I guess I thought they would be for any first term of a president their first midterm is crucial [noise]\nAh so GOP affiliated voter sub surpassed democratic affiliated ones in early voting in Arizona Florida Georgia Indiana Montana Tennessee and\nTexas only in Nevada have democratic affiliated voters exceeded Republican affiliated voter so far in early voting according to the data key Senate races are underway in seven of those eight states\nAnd we'll prove pivotal in determining which party controls the or the chamber the latest data suggest robust enthusiasm among early Republican voters that could put a dent in democratic hopes for a blue wave in next month's midterm election remember I'm reading verbatim from the NBC story\nA Republican or Republicans typically dominate a early voting by absentee ballots\nWhile Democrats tend to tell you the advantage with him in person early voting for example the entire early voting picture and Florida which has yet to be gone in person voting is incomplete\nOr in Arizona where two members of the house democratic a Christian\nA\nCinema and Republican Martha mix Sally ... our neck in neck in the contest to fill their retire Republican Jeff lakes a Senate seat forty four percent of early voters had a Republican affiliation\nFor

I think he was doing exceptionally well and I would have kept them in the whole time I would have to do that and just ... just kind of Russia's ... they did\nAnd I just thought that they would have you know for the rest ... right there but\nI'm not too bad about it for the simple fact that there were like look man all he got to ... to do is get what six more out there were three more outs and we're done right\nI think it was I think in a way it was a strategic move it may loose it made sense to me and it was like look I Need to put a guy in there I Want to give it to shore closes out a guard he's got a fresh are forcing night um let's see what he can do\nSo I'm not really a too mad about the decision may even the Dodgers had lost the game I don't even think that wouldn't have been the reason why because I think it was a really\nGood decision I think Roberts would have been criticized the cafe probably would have been criticized where a lot of people but you know what there's some people would like it it really if you look at it man when he goes around the ball the ...\nYou look at everything jokes and we did a great job and you know you pull them out and look it was a it was a it was a gamble but it was a gamble that work\nYeah it was a feast or famine type moment and obviously it worked out really well because he got 'em one two three and now some people are like well it's somewhat of a it's leading a prelude into this game one of the world series for car Sean I I think there's definitely something to take out at the fact that it was a clean one two three inning\nAnd boy did Milwaukee go down I mean without a fight I mean that was that was unbelievable how they just really had nothing left a once the weak homerun went over the fence there's I mean\nEverything went out of that whole stadium there Miller Park and you know what I mean and they just had nothing left seemingly Milwaukee and ah it was night and day that was my biggest takeaway to be honest keep it was so negative from game six I mean really\nLet me tell you what the biggest takeaway was ... like ... like ... ... about Chris Taylor is catching\nCenterfield yet that was big but could I just said this police home run really deflated though it really did it it's a ... you're talking about a huge jump the was tied game for you know you hit the homerun\nYeah will yell and got to go home or the solo and then\nHe hits the home run and jump some up and there was like man that\nI Know a good one nothing Milwaukee and you're like OK here we go area when you know that it's such a a thin margin of error because that pitching comes in and how thankful ... was it how things are you a Dodger saying that they were actually able to get a lead to the one before\nHater came into the game yeah because he was lights out in the middle of the things I mean totally untouchable which we've seen before and the fact that I think\nThat's what really killed Milwaukee's when they were actually down to the wind and they really couldn't utilize hater I think it's going to keep down the Dodgers bad so I'm the game seven when exactly how you wanted to go if your doctor said that he really did and again I think when you said the ... home run obviously put them over the top five to one but before that to me the Taylor\nDiving catch in center field towards the wall at the track to me it was a play the game because if he doesn't make that catch they score at least a run there and\nThe game is at least tied to believe it to at the moment and who knows the Dodgers maybe start to get a little more tense at that point coming back to bat\nAnd you know what I mean maybe don't they maybe they don't get the runs the are the guys on base and if you don't get the home run by queen you know what I mean it's such a game of inches that sometimes plays like back and really defined maybe the next couple of innings how things are going to go either on defense or at the place to meet\nThe Taylor catch play the game\nYeah unbelievable player and and that's that's why he's out there and how about the move another move by Roberts in game seven to take out Peterson the pinch it for him to put in Taylor obviously teller stays in the game who knows if Peterson is able to make that catch\nYeah who knows right is it was a big it was a big play they had some of the big place and crucial times\nBut you know when it comes down to it is the Dodgers game seven is about who makes ... a more ... than ... than the other team and they may more places to capitalize on more plays in with the Milwaukee Brewers did and that's why they're messy\nThat's it that's the game on tomorrow night in Boston Dodgers\nWere the national league guy team that uh is going to move on and I'm like I said\nI I give the Dodgers are a good chance in this World Series I I Do I think Boston is the favorite clearly as they probably should be but I think a lot of things have to go to the Dodgers way but

definitely definitely congratulations to Solomon once again [noise]\nSo let's get into some NFL news now because um we're both\nReally have a lot of thoughts on the raiders trading away and mark Cooper today to down to write a song and Oakland getting back in exchange for it a first round pack and twenty Nineteen which they've now compiled three of those and the draft picks are building up and this really just leads to I mean it looks like Oakland is\nTrying to rebuild in a sense of ... gonna be the head coach we know that at least through the moved to Vegas and twenty twenty\nHe wants to put his stamp on this team they've only won one game here they have there have been worse than I think I mean there are clearly worse than both you and I ... I mean I I did not think they'd be this that I thought they would struggle to compete in the division because I thought teams are better than them\nBut I just didn't think they'd be this bad so clearly they just want the bottom to fall I'm Keith at this point really I think they might just secret Libby hoping they get the number one pick that way they can take Herbert\nThe quarterback the young guy out of Washington because they're going to need to draft a quarterback in all likelihood car is we talked about some of the young quarterbacks off here in this league right now more homes\nJared golf that Prescott all those guys have one theme in common they're moving forward there are volunteering their teams might not be the best right now all three of them but those guys are definitely progressing\nI feel like with their car it's the opposite he's going the opposite direction\nYeah and he's only been to leave for or not he's not been he hasn't been Liam long time you know not that long right yeah you know so you would think he's a franchise quarterback who was fortunate for him but you know he has to be suspect you know it's coming\nYou know they're going to get somebody or to take his place but man you know this was a completely shocker for me because\nI felt on papers at the raiders should be competing with teams and they see and that's the beginning of the season I just felt they should um they love a downgrade of\nThe beginning rid of like the ... max I'm of the world are getting rid of value got Omari Cooper these are pro bowlers that you've gotten rid of\nJust really shows that you guys are really waving the white flag up this season and uh that you're just looking forward to the next season and also you know Vegas so I'm ... Mann I'll say this you really it really starts to show now\nWith the mark Cooper regard as their car was really the problem because look a mark Cooper hasn't really done anything so seated but it's a great pick up because\n[noise] you know how of a talent he is\nYou and you know what he can do and he's he's definitely\nWe'll see what happens is the second half of the season before you decide to make moves\nAnd I think for him he just more I think this is more of a frustration for package being part of the Peterson is a type of guy um that when he gets frustrated easiest goes off on the right kind of like it all away like a no deal back on TALK yeah and so I think that you do for him was like yo just gives us a shot let's see where he goes\n... working hard keep doing what you doing I'm unless you just see where it goes as we were testing the waters right now so\nI'm I think he's just at the age where he was like look I Want to win now which I think every athlete\nIn the NFL wants to win now but there's just doesn't work out that way he's with the French are they pay him a lot of money and you know my whole thing is look at it and see where the will just take a listen go through the process to see where it works so\nBad no don't change practice gene I agree with ownership don't don't train here right now there's so\nMany teams who could use him even outside of the ... absolutely you go to probably just about every division right now and there's a team who could use the services\nBecause really to think about it the top tier corners in league it's kind of shrinking the there's only like handful or less than ... Jones Ramsey ... caliber corners\nBut he is top three receipt a corners in Italy\nI doubt it's him is Ramzi\nRamsey talked to him as to be ... rarely ... Peterson is no more sermon there's no doubt or in a job in a a Richard Sherman but uh I was to say the next one\nWould be who um\n... it's hard to find really hard to find out about your corners it is it's definitely hard but man I don't know who they are taught that you would have to be the that has to be number one and number two to absolutely\nBy far that's number one and number two I don't know who will be the third one why don't you help us out here to be the third was she ... a corner in the league right now you know that's a hard thing for me so but I have to say that's number one and two for sure\nYeah I I'm with ya now and it it looked as no more draw reduces anymore ah there's no brand new ... and\nI I Can't put butler and there are\nLot about the outcome here at Harvard last year he's not been doing well this year I Can't put 'em see more and they're um [noise] I Can't I Can't put that guy there right now um and I can't put a yeah those are two I Can't put I Can't put those guys in there right now\nYeah if you have one of those two guys and your team obviously you're doing well at that corner position I think more teams have kind of\nHonestly they've tried to get a whole lot more pressure up front or more of a pass rush to try and make up for a lack of a topped your guiding the secondary so we'll see if Peterson gets moved or not at the moment it seems like it's a long shot but you don't know how this one\nWhat's what's more likely to happen Peterson get moved or bell gets moved before the deadline\nA bell\nOh really yeah I think that what you're saying I think\nBill gets a little before Peterson does um reason why because bill her as hurt the locker room and Peterson really hasn't you know Peter should just say that I wanted to get out you know I'll I'll run to move on but and he's already bought something you know he's brought a lot to the team\nBut bill a bill is\nReally hurt the Pittsburgh Steelers season he was a big intricate to what they're doing this year and was expected to come in doing some big things\nAnd that didn't happen so I'll have to say ...\nMm yeah I mean that's really tough uh at this point because I don't know if\nPittsburgh is going to buy edge because they've kind of stood vary from very your hat on that one and he used to not reported yet who knows trying to figure out at this point you know ... one it's like day to day is he going to report is not going to report what exactly is going to go down with hair\nSo that that that's a tough one I I actually I'm going to St Patrick Peterson is more likely to be treated yeah I think the both probably a long shot but I Will go with Dr Petersen at this point in time\nOne eight hundred to two to five to two to we've got Jay back on now from Hollywood let's go to him and Jay you're on behind the Mike how are things going tonight\nHey guys things are going great a pre she ate the show as usual hey what do you think of my prediction\nOr your prediction was great man you know you had a great producer but I'm going to tell you something to you J I got something to say to you man a number one we tried to\nCall a tap you into the show the first time you've called what were you doing your orders 'em over there what was\nGoing on I was getting a vote or something like that\nI got my two sons in here and uh we will go on in your food at home or\nOh okay okay okay All right up my okay but look you got a great\nPrediction man and I and I shot after shot out to you but I tell you something I did some a little investigation for he just said when Jay called and said that we had said\nAllegedly we it's sad that we were if he will be they go that we're gonna have to give him tickets I have to reach the producers or research that I said go back to all the health of Jay called J. they could not find that of a saying that how ever\nMan I just wanted to tell you Brad was sitting here talking to you know what I Do something for Jay man lately\nBecause you're one of one of our great cause you have so many listeners on this program now we're we're very grateful for it so I Want to do something for your special jak we're going to have that I give away we're gonna we're gonna send your way after you get off with us talking here\nLaurie is going to take down your information off the air and we're going to send you something real special uh give away on us\nOh that's sweet you guys are very first year that\nBut Jay come on give me look man I Know you're excited about the Boston Red Sox there they're going through the world series in ... and this is good for the city Los Angeles Boston like you said man you've got to give me your prediction now what what what what how is this how does this series though\nIt's great for LA vote same thing's going to happen as last time when we treat the Brooklyn Dodgers in Nineteen Eighteen one hundred years ago the thing's going to happen this time it's very unfortunate you bought my work on this they're going to get swept the Dodgers\nAll the way to\nGet outta here die and they're not getting swept out on a very good team but they're not getting slapped come on you know the getting swept knocking enrolled now coming into Dodger Stadium winning all three adopt now\nSay the day I got to say this right and you made a great prediction right but I got I got to go with this dog looking series if if the Dodgers I'll say this\nIs the Dodgers tried to play macho ball in swing for the fences they may get sweat but at the Dodgers low out there and they play the way they play a game seven and play baseball\nJust like the buddy the stills and this and that I think it could be a series you know am I going to say they're going to win it but I'm just saying I think it could be a series and I can say they they'll at least when at least the game or two\nBut or Meg do you never know where you never know whether the guest series man I'm not going to slap you never thought\nThat they get slapped I'll give you those are your thoughts that are under one\nWho hundreds of wine\nOr what do you think it is you think it's impossible for the red Sox\nI don't know I don't know I'm a I'm a I think it's I don't think it's I don't think it's not possible um that's just ...\nOut to be on like hitting why like they've been um continuously relentlessly this whole series and nothing that\nCan't do that but it it's going to be up to look the Dodgers I think they're going to get a split in Boston I think it's very possible making into split um [noise] no they're a great ball club\nThe Dodgers they got hitters but they haven't states pitchers like\nThough that is true that is true but it rained a lot of trouble and I love the Dodgers and my number two so I Can't lose\nYeah yeah but the but you got to also remember 'em that look it's very like I tell you that I mentioned on the show early it's very hard to get to the world series\nBack to back and you have to be a good team to do that\nAnd Israeli hay and then on the for the for the red Sox case the restaurants are used to winning big games there used to winning a championship because they've done numerous occasions in the past but I just think right now I think it will be very tough but look I think it'd be a hell of a series O. J. I think it will be I don't think it's going to be with people think\nThanks for the call Jay remember lawyer will take your information off the air that\nYou guys are great thank you\nTake care of Jay Production quick\nPredict says I'm going to say a Dodgers game\nSix [noise]\nI think the Dodgers and set it out of you out here we get into\nLakers rockets suspensions we'll talk about that tomorrow night yeah I was a wild weekend for back at it tomorrow night for Keith I'm Brad keep living the dream [noise]\nBehind them might furnished by Dahlia media\nOkay [noise] Los Angeles orange\nBeulah station\nCutting off aid one central judgment I'm Elliot foreign to us more than seven thousand Central American migrants have resumed a desperate journey toward the U.S border after arriving in southern Mexico Monday meanwhile President Trump is threatening to cut off aid to countries where many of the migrants lived drug orange reports\nIt's heartbreaking not gotten to the space and there was a young girl that collapses arms from heat exhaustion I only can post is from that humanity first as a human being and that's what everyone Israel is an immigrant somewhere\nWhat part of my problem with the wife and I think we all end and and I didn't write obviously yes through proper legal channeled my problem I Am going forward I think a lot of time in town halls across the country and let me tell you even going back to that have there was this rumor I mean\nThat I have an international superhighway immigrants that we're going to come through America up through a on a Canada and that was something that literally my father had to say that's not\nHappening it's not happening and so when you see these images then a conservative paper drain and I guess and they turn elections because this is exactly\nWhat conservative think people on the last one to have happened in this country I think Rapids either I'm not saying that legal immigration what what a lot of people on a lot to say no one on the table and they weren't open water and no consequences\nOf what I Wish I Wish that the then the people on the right what tell the truth about what's really happening and immigration because the largest number of undocumented his name not telling us you know the people on the right around here on the right but I'm not talking about you and I hear a lot of money and I don't think I Am\nMore on that issue then I think than I think people realize that come from a border said and I think when you hear stories like ... ... happened finally shot and killed by an immigrant who is in a I'm a ... in San Francisco which is one of the ... states where you can go there and now that\nAnd I said I shot and killed thanks or if I let me just say this and you had an cat forty one percent of undocumented immigrants are from Asia\nFrom Asia a large majority of the link to undocumented immigrants from ... from Canada they\n... and I we label on the right point that out of that always about brown and black\nProblem if by the way I don't I don't want to make this clear it's the left that keeps focusing on the brown\nThe color of the skin or the fact that it would be Central American refugees and it's the left that dust it the right doesn't know know the right looks at it and the rights has\nNo either you're here legally or you're here\nIllegally that's how the majority of people look at it but they have to use it\nThey have to you that that's more Raj of an opinion comes from the left well the right doesn't want illegal immigrants in the Asians or your you don't care about the Asians you're only care about no I don't know any I'd never met one conservative\nWhen it comes to illegal immigration that say well now let's let all the all the Asians in here illegally but not the people from Central America right over that\nNo my biggest concern is Canadian\n[laughter]\nWell I mean it's it's not but you only ... only argument that they have is race so that's the only argument that\nThey can use that can't defend it right and McCain got into sanctuary cities you see how quiet they got ... they got quite because they understand what the the one thing that I think even though the that people in the media understand is that\nThose in power in the Democratic party actually do believe in open borders that's what they want they want open they won't reject open borders\nAnd so since they want to open borders as we said whenever they talk about campaign when it should be whenever they talk about comprehensive immigration reform you and I asked well what would that be they never give you the specifics of what it would be because I Would think the comprehensive immigration reform to anybody out there\nWould be okay what we have to do is we get it would be to ... what do we do with the illegal immigrants that are here in this country that have been here for significant period of time right and you and I both often said\nShe if you make the offer just see what the response would be from the left if you said okay\nLet's give legal ... let's give ... permanent legal status but not citizens ship or voting rights to every illegal immigrants but his but in this country since\nYesterday yeah right\nAnd from now on anybody who comes into the country illegally\n\nA must be sent back ... that we will give you everybody who was in this country as of yesterday gets permanent legal status and what do you think the response from the Democrats would be\nWell they're ... they're not they can't accept that the reason they can't accept that is\nBecause now they're at the point of wanting open borders\nIt is not about that because\nEven they realized that the argument doesn't change Twenty years from now assume that we did get politically on Capitol Hill an agreement for that\nAmnesty and then\nStrong enforcement or the borders will Twenty years from now ten years from now five years from now we're still be people coming here illegally that will be here that will that will get here and stay here for five years ten years whatever it is\nAnd the argument doesn't change so they know well forget about that we just want the open borders we just don't want\nTo have the borders at all come in and stay as long as you want\n[noise] I I have a challenge to the Democratic party\nGet together with the coalition of Democrats and put forth a comprehensive immigration plan we always heard them say that but they never explain what it would be ... and they're still saying it\nI'd I'd forgot who just set a recently though I I burst out laughing but we need a comprehensive immigration reform that would include why tell me what it would include and\nBe very severely obese but be specific and tell me or at least different stages the major stages of it that would be effective the major affective stages\nOf your reform plan what would they be\nI I think that you probably could go to the Republicans and you could get a comprehensive immigration plan that you could go to specific\nA congressman and uh and and senators and state to them say what would what would you want in your comprehensive immigration plan and they couldn't tell you they just wouldn't say\nComprehensive immigration plan so we asked the question to the left why can't you tell us what's your comprehensive immigration plan would be is that a fair question right is that an outrageous question for us someone\nFor for for the two idiots overnight to ask right of any politician in Washington DC you keep saying comprehensive immigration reform tell us specifically what it would be give us the specifics and they won't do well why not\n\nBecause the leadership of the Democratic party wants open borders you prove us wrong\nProve us wrong come up with a comprehensive immigration plan show it to us and prove that we are wrong I Will be the first person to say okay I was wrong I Know I won't be wrong but I Am wrong because there is your plan and you're going to stick behind it\nWell tell me one Democrat or it recently who said and I mean anyone right now either running for office or that is in office that says and has been promoting\nWe here's what we here's what I think we should do and it would look like this we would have whatever it is\nAmnesty and then border control because we've been asking the question okay fine what measure what measure a border control do you support\nRight what would your ... now I I Want to correct is are there might be one senator among the Democrats' side there might be one senator that would give you a plant\nJoe Manchin yeah\nYeah maybe I ... I made I Want to be fair here and there might be one senator on the Democrats' side\nCould answer that would that would give you his even plant is even a Joe mansion saying anything right no no no\nBecause the question is what is it really I mean the party has to promote it you're going to have to have the rest of the party obviously um and you know you're trying to get your tried to take control of the Senate you think you're going to win the house you've got momentum in the house\nYou want to build momentum and the Senate races so how do you do that\nWhat's the plan what measure what level of enforcement do you support because really in my opinion if I were answer answering there is no half measure\nAnd the problem with amnesty is that you're going to do it again later on it's gonna happen you're just saying okay ah amnesty now and then it\nWill be also amnesty later because we'll have the same debate and we'll still have the exact same scenario or Twenty years from now\n... as they as a debate point yes that would be you bring that out as the debate point ... as a ... to find out what because the goal is to you're not to get legislation right the goal is to get out of Democrats what they truly think\nNo obligation offer you get more than a dealer trading prizes out the hassle of private parties sales car stand up comic selling used vehicle easy and they do all of the DMV paperwork and if you need to upgrade to a new car\nCar said that Tom can help you with that to my friend Eric ... he's the owner he's known as sledgehammer Derek because he will buy any car even if it's got dense in it\nHow much cash or you try and find out called eight hundred and eight seven ...

things you may be the you might be the most loyal Republican the most loyal Trump supporter a and supporting the Republican Party now\nSorry they don't care about the debt they don't care about the deficit and nobody does now it is gone\nCaring for the the the the deficit and that goes across whether you're a Trump supporter whether you're a Republican supporter whether you're never Trump conservative\n\nA few conservatives care about it but as you and I said Eric this this is how quickly this country has changed\nThat in twenty Fifteen the\nBiggest issue remember the establishment and the swamp were who where did that originally come from ...\nThat originally came from the fact that when Paul Ryan became speaker of the house he would not go back and change the budget that they had passed a painter had passed and there was a theory and the the the whole swamp was created\nOut of the Republican leadership including Paul Ryan that would not control spending that's ... you think about it that was one of the major points\nIn Trump setting himself apart from other Republicans\nThat he labeled them the swamp and said that's unacceptable we have to get spending out of control\nThat was three years ago\nWe had calls left and right we have to get the deficit under control that's why I'm going to vote for Trump that's not even a discussion anymore nope not nobody is having that discussion anymore it is\nGone as we said when you look at Congress right now\nYou might have is what do we say half a senator or do we take it would take to have some Senate yes three aids of us right [laughter] 'cause even even even Rand Paul showed he couldn't do that right when it came to the um\nMedicaid right when it came to Medicaid spending in his own state and and so uh it's a ... it it doesn't\nMatter anymore so if there was ever a time for Democrats to roll this out all the free stuff it's now when the Republican Party\nDoesn't even care about deficit anymore and doesn't even care about that anymore Republicans don't care or for Republicans don't care this has a much better chance over the next\nTwo years of the Democrats telling you weren't going to take care of you from first mhm 'cause that's what it is right here from birth a thousand dollars in your town as soon as you're born\nAnd if you're poor two thousand dollars each and every year until you're Eighteen fifty thousand dollars that you'll have by\nThe time that you become Eighteen years yet a savior parents report we know the baby a sport and then as soon as you become Eighteen uh-huh that's six thousand dollars which will be ten thousand dollars\nIn free income each and every year plus free condoms you want to have one of those empty thousand right on the house and forgot how he was a

house\nYou're oh man oh oh oh oh sorry I forgot where I ... I'm Sorry I forgot yeah ... right sorry I I Apologize Eric well because I because\nHere's the thing to look at the average cost of a home over the next let's say we start this in twenty or let's say we get it done and a twenty Twenty one in March or twenty Twenty one\nCory Booker wins or in in twenty twenty and she is inaugurated a and twenty Twenty one right so he starts his first term as president and they get this done in March and it takes effect it starts funding in twenty twenty two\nAt Eighteen years you're down to twenty forty what is the anticipated cost of the average new home in twenty forty [laughter] it's gonna be a lot more than fifty K. C. you didn't go big enough Mr Booker\n\nBecause of its education will no no no no no no no no but you're parties already offering you know the free college so they won't need it for that so what a retirement well we've already got Social Security\n\nSo and well they're not going to retire at Eighteen they won't be eligible you know they won't get that money until they're old so the retirement things not an appeal no it has to be to to buy a home not to put down on home\nTo buy a home he didn't go big enough\nAnd somewhere and there's some Democrats got to come across as we talked about earlier in the show and say\nWhat about praying oh right because the college\nThing is is the Democrats are saying to him well no no no well first of all you know college fifty thousand it just depends on which college you go to fifty thousand isn't going to get you there if you're talking about a four year degree at some of those major colleges fifty thousand is not going to pay for that right\nIt's not gonna pay for the whole home well that's because I Do have you can go big enough you have a college has already paid for a member that's the other that's that's that that's my point your your colleague Mr Booker already doing the whole free college right so see so you got fifty thousand dollars close to fifty thousand is what forty six thousand bucks for the poorest of kids\nSo it will be up to forty six thousand when they're Eighteen right the kids from poor\nFamilies well they already get free college so they can't use it for that a stocker bio so now they could\nPut it down on the home and living home until they you know ah you know I guess the falls I mean but they're still going to have they're gonna have payments that's not helping me I'm going to have payments\nSo then the ten thousand dollars six to ten thousand dollars and guaranteed income won't be enough to pay for oh no no no you have any you'll need another program in order to pay\nIt or not to say ten thousand dollars a month if not a week\n[laughter] ... say they're not gonna [laughter] see and it is and I think by the time we get to that point we're not going to be able to enjoy that

to their home countries from Lawrence reporting\nDuring early voting what about independence and and and uh and and such and and do they do they participate as much an early voting\n\nYou know so yeah ... ... ... when you look at the initial especially the first day of early voting in any given state or you're looking at these numbers because you're you're basically trying to determine okay who or what group was trying to ... was really\nExcited motivated chomping at the bit if you will\nTo vote to get out their vote right away and does that always translate into a win for that for one side one party or the other\nNight I found this from the hill but this was September Nineteen okay\nRepublican pollster Jim Hobart on Wednesday so the Democratic leaning independents have more enthusiasm then Republican leaning independents and heading into November's midterm elections and that again\nSeptember Nineteen yeah so it's ... it's ... capital yes\n\nYes so it is I I think it's it will be interesting to uh to watch those numbers are as the early voting continues and then we get down to election day two weeks from today\nAnd the Washington Post ABC News poll from early September ...\n... percent of self identified Democrats and democratic leaning independents said they're absolutely certain that they will vote well Seventy four percent of self identified Republicans and Republican leaning independents said the same okay so we're but you'd that isn't a poll on independence\nRight and that's just it right where\nAre the polls just on independence that would be interesting to look at because ah as you mentioned it that's where you know that's where the the a victory is\nSo um\nIt's likely we'll start seeing and and some of those Senate races especially\nWill see some more polls a more recent polls going back to the the Ted Cruz and O'Rourke a battle in Texas for that Senate seat over the last three polls Ted Cruz has been had by as much as nine\nPoints and he has reached a over fifty\nA in and at least a couple of those polls but the latest poll was over a week ago\nYou know only went through a the thirteenth so I Would look for an updated poll probably in the next day or two which is you mentioned earlier a would include the period that included that debate\nSo\nWe'll see where that goes I I don't see that as the neck and neck race\nOr you know the the toss up a\nRace that a lot of people are are still calling it\nA is there any of this article and Fox taught box not Fox talking about undecided voters are independent voters and they said you know they they roughly and this was from yesterday by ten percent of voters are undecided ... they said a lot of undecided voters probably won't even vote\nOkay I was I was actually going to ask\nThat or I was curious about that when we talked\nAbout it earlier how many of those aren't going because if you think about where midterms are right a there is a lot of excitement especially for the people who follow it\nBut how much of excitement how much excitement generally speaking is there about the midterms for the average American\n\nI I really wonder I I it's it's typically it's not the turnout that you're going to see at a at a major election year a presidential election year\nAnd so right now are we looking at the average so for the independence\nCould you see a number of them just staying home they're not moderated what what are the other or that there are just a you know populist version here ... they're they're upset with both parties are they're not excited by either party\nI you know and and when you you're talking about independence and undecided mhm ah again it yeah there could be a difference between an independent and an undecided but there's a lot of overlap in there\nWell because because I because the the difference really is the turnout\nAnd and as they they talk about here in this box story this year's undecided voters ... are more moderate and conservative\nOr\nThey talked to one pollsters said before the contentious fight over Brett Kavanaugh Supreme Court nomination the undecided voter had lean Republican the overly part is the nature of the Supreme Court battle help consolidate\nThe GOP support so it actually drain thin\nThe they they believe the undecided voter\nWho was leaning more Republican more undecided were leading more Republican\nAnd they believe helped to consolidate but said don't know if that will last you know the extra weeks all the way up till the election right so the undecided vote has had a GOP lean to it so it makes sense of cabin up produce some GOP consolidation whether it endures to election day or not is another issue\nYeah because when you the differences is when you look at the undecided or in a likely voter pole and that's different than a independence overall who are unaffiliated with one side of the other because they may not necessarily fit that likely voter category\nUpon this ah ah interesting ah they talks the two here in the box article Barbara a cabal of marriage university and uh I Believe part of the ... poll or send details on the voters said they could be persuaded\nThat they found in Wisconsin Minnesota in Nevada in general those voters were more likely to say they were independent and to identify idiot logically as moderate or conservative\n\nIn Wisconsin Fifteen Percent of voters say their Senate vote is persuadable Seventy one percent are independent while thirty nine percent say they are conservative and thirty six percent said that they are moderate but then again I to me what is moderate mean anymore are people willing to say they're liberal\nRight I Know a ton of people that say they're moderate and there are liberal\nThey're not in my area yeah so to me that term moderate versus people still have people who are liberal still have an aversion\nTo got enough they're liberally were moderate\nRight well and [laughter]\nYou know it's it's sometimes it also uh the independent while I lean Democrat I lean Republican and\nAnd how does that change between elections right we had how many of them in twenty sixteen that leaned Democrat but didn't vote Democrat or\nThe other point to make an undecided voters women are more likely to be undecided voters in twenty eight team which means in a way because they say a lot of undecided voters are are in the mid term are less likely to vote does that mean for the women vote would be hurt which traditionally would hurt Democrats\nMm\n[noise] yeah it's interesting that you can go through all these you know posters doing all their analytical data and it's still means nothing because who can figure out what the voters actually going to do when they go to the poll depending on us we've talked about all this week all the different variables\nThat encompass you know ... encompass this election and make this election and this midterm election completely and totally unique\nEven up to the point of something that will drive I Believe voters to the polls which is completely unusual for an election season like this which is the caravan coming through Mexico\nWhich has the potential of bringing immigration not the Kavanaugh vote but immigration back to the number one issue as it has been over the last year and a half which clearly favors the Republicans\n[noise] you know I'm again it it really is it it's always about turnout but right now it's also about motivation where was the does the Kavanaugh thing last it does last for conservatives\nIt doesn't last for Republicans does it lasts for Democrats the same way\nDoes it lasts for independence who lean republic\nBecause they're not lean consider because I don't know well because if you look at the numbers in the Senate races I mean most are calling it right now saying in the Senate looks like the Republicans will hold descent\nSo what would be what would be the the lasting effect on the ... as a Democrat\nBut it in that it it would be well we need to you know capture the Senate to block or you know Trump's nomination right we need to we need to do that\nBut if they believe looking at the polls well we're not going to get that anyway so I'm not motivated to go for the opposite of that we need to get the vote out but if they see this as an uphill battle that there is no way to get the majority that sent\nThe cabinet thing doesn't have an effect for somebody on the on the left\nTheoretically it just doesn't it just stuff because the\nThe point would be well we need to make sure that he doesn't get the seat another

based on things that right now are working toward the economy that the economists are saying\nYou know one of the reasons I was going through a lot of his his his speech because one of the things that we have talked about and and and I want to get back briefly the one we played a part of a President Trump and Ted Cruz and talked about the you know the the the power of the power base that they actually are\nUh in in the state of Texas said just a couple of years ago and there was a split\nYou know there were there were conservatives who like Trump\nThat became never Trump or ... yeah right it'd be kinda never Trump yes right well they thought it was just they it was unforgivable for for ... for them to see that Cruz had been marginalized inside the Republican Party and they blame Trump port\nYeah or whether it was and and and I I Would say that the\nUh the low point of that or could call it a high point for a low point depending on your point of view was when Ted Cruz was booed at the Republican National convention somebody like Ted Cruz\nAs probably one of the most conservative members\nOf Congress and the Republican Party was food yeah and you know you can go back to the whole you know the the Kennedy thing in his father being you know\nKeeping the conspiracy theory going about him being part of the Kennedy assassination you know the whole line Ted did you hear now he's called he called him a beautiful dead yeah it sounds beautiful that look this happens in politics all the time maybe to not to that to the degree of insult or\nAccusations of conspiracy theories
