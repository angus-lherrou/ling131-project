{"content": "GM I joined explains how you can help mending kids what Steve almost [laughter] showed download\nThe Barbary and see the words and ... on the okay LA pods has all the way we view reach [laughter] at ... dot com and on audio booths [noise]\nSeven Ninety ABC welcome back thanks for joining this weekend living the dream here in Southern California and that dream could become a reality for you\nWhy because of a new California law but now allows homeowners to have\nA guest house or converting their garage into a living space that you can rent out\nSo think about this folks let's say you live in a three thousand square foot house and you have enough room to put a guest house in your backyard\nImagined building in the ultimate dream guest house that you can rent out or possibly move into later in life and then rent out your existing larger home so in Studio today as our real estate moneymaker Sandy dunkley\nShe and her design team and construction team designed these guest houses also\nThanks to a new California law you could also do this converting your garage\nInto a one bedroom or studio apartment so standing a few minutes I'll give out our phone number for all the k._b._c. listeners to reach out to you but after they make this phone call and speak to directly then what happens\nYeah nice to meet the right to the I'm able to actually go online and do a lot of the diligence on the property I can pull the property profiling ... which is a site that a lot of design and he is and I can also go to Google us and look at the property the site pan\nAnd we can see you know what to a ball if it's the garage is the garage and then we'll know know what needs to go in that when we go out and meet with them to sign a can decide with a homeowner what they actually want to seem to the unit\nSo everything is kind of in place and I also let them know in Tempe that the rent you know what other comparable to ... have a\nA one bedroom is studio or we build a guest house in the back yard that could be a two bedroom two bath and it could be two stories he could have to live in space down staff and the bedrooms upstairs so I I look at the rents in the area and I let them know\nThat this is what the rents going for a few days\nBut this is what we can do and I can come out and sit with you and we can go over things in more detail\nBut when I go out we kinda see what design they want and the flaw pan and we'll let them know that this is a separate address it's you know self sustainable from the main house and you have your privacy and not going to have any encroachment with the neighbors we can put a call ... so they can feel more secure with the you know the aughts official tough\nAnd then you walk in the ... when we have to shake a cabinet so white cabinets we have the you know the granite countertops it could be the courts\nOpen plan we have the nice engineer with flaws that looked really pizza pulled they're very ... but also tankers water he says ... has a ... ... and everything it's soundproof\nAs a one hour firewall between the ... everything's energy efficient with title twenty four and like I said it has its own separate address\nAnd whatever they want like a terrorist saw him you know anything nice like some garages have a cathedral ceiling those are really nice when you walk in and see like open plan so we can keep those and the set the utilities all said that\nSo what about this person wants we can make it work for them\nWe measure up when we come out the design of comes out with me in some cases some cases I go out and and you know take pictures and\nYou know you know did all the measurements and then I get that information to the designer and then he knows what he's doing but\nHe'll actually do a lot that did they let you and says well before he goes out and then when everybody decides you know this is what we want to do want to move forward them well you know did the joints and everybody will approve the home and it was say at this is what I Want that can you move the window on this side maybe\nUm can you make that the\nBedroom over this side can you make that bought them on this side and then they kind of tweak it but it's a space that's brand new and every square footage utilizing so because John it's one of these brand new space say it's ... it's actually you know you can receive top dollars in rent I mean some people have received in twenty five hundred dollars a month\nSome people have it's even three thousand dollars a month depending on whether they are then this up\nSort of the ... and he was twelve hundred Fifteen hundred Seventeen hundred so all depends\nAnd not be able to tell you what you can obtain from Maine to not safe but like hell let's say every week it reminds me of the ... the ... because it faces brand new it's not like a steady forty year old built in that's you know have maybe like five or ten tenants it's brand new and it looks nice and you wouldn't mind moving in the south John\nAnd I think that's the key is to design the guest house the way you would like it or if you're going to convert your garage so now you have the option later life to move into\nThe smaller unit and then rent out the existing larger\nProperty for maybe three or four or five thousand dollars a month so imagine using your home as an income source as you get older and most people take a pay cut as they get older when they only collect Social Security but imagine living the dream life right here in Southern California and not leaving because you do this one time construction that could generate this passive\nMonthly income for the rest of your life so folks rents are skyrocketing especially here in Southern California so as the rents increase so could your monthly income and that's why I'm doing this now could really set you up financially\nFor the rest of your life to reach out to Sandy entered designing construction professionals to take a look into having a guest house on your property or converting that garage into a living space that you can rent out here than these number eight three three four dream life\nThat's a three three the number four dream life\nA three three for three seven\nThirty to sixty five and if you don't get through on the phone lines during the show Sandy will take your phone call after the show the number again a three three for three seven thirty to sixty five let's go to studio city and feet to Chris Chris you're next on seven Ninety KBC say hello to Sandy\nSaid thank you for taking my call no problem I had a\nQuestion of Kim Il ... got a garage and a total long skinny girl report to closing the but the one behind the other and I wanted to maybe can voted was to go through any value to a new bill will tell you about being it's kind of an odd should ... you\nKnow we can we've done this tent and garages before and we utilize every space and then we make it very you know economical way you feel like you know you're walking to the Taj Mahal maybe that's not that example but\nIt's one of those places that look nice so it doesn't matter that his hands and we can you know put the Boston wet makes cents and then we can put their living space in the Bakken up front could be the you know ... open pan in the kitchen ...\nSo it makes a lot of sense and also the value of your property will increase by doing this by the way\nBecause now you have more living space like for example if it's you know I use ... because if the garage is four hundred square feet wet the hands of law you know side by side to talk of Iraq but it's now and living space and the price of ... square footage in this area is four hundred dollars\nAnd four hundred square feet that increase your value to a hundred and sixty thousand dollars so you know it's definite need something that you can rent ... off the kid is gone\nAnd on and you can get that income and more so if you wanted to move out of your main home and you know make I don't know if you're alone or whatever the case says that he could move into that space you can make it nice when you south and ... the main house the costs more money and I can tell you what you can obtain from ... in the area that you're\nIn although you very much into oh no problem I look forward to meet you I mean we can get this done balcony quickly by the time you get it in place now in two thousand Nineteen you have that income coming in my top the top of the month\nAnd imagine that you do the new construction now and possibly have that new income source coming in in twenty Nineteen talk about a a great New Year's resolution of course they all in studio city so folks if you'd like to reach out to Sandy enter designing construction professionals take advantage of this new California law\nThat allows you to put a guest house on your property or convert your garage into a living space that you can rent out\nThis is an amazing opportunity for homeowners in California\nThere's no reason to leave California and moved to Phoenix Las Vegas nothing wrong with those\nAre one hundred degree temperature days there but imagine staying here living the dream life and having the income source because you did this one time construction that could provide you with a residual monthly income for the rest of your life so reach out to Sandy right now a three three the number four dream life a three three for three seven\nThirty to sixty five Sandy another fast show thanks for coming in today\n... thank you I'm looking forward to seeing him next week I have a great weekend [noise]\nAnd in this program is for entertainment [laughter] I don't want to say\nThis show British by sharing cross Capitol\nYou can grab a thousand dollars four times a day\nWhere do I grow your own so not\nThere for a day on some of the money starts falling from the sky at six and nine with ... with Dr grew in Lawrence with Jillian and John Kades\nBabies the ball ... ...\n... a huge in grave mistake as many western governments continue to reject the kingdom's explanation of what led to his death some reports from Riyadh\nAh well I'm doing the same thing you're doing time I'm continuing to to practice law and\nIt's a it is a passion and that is a love and uh so I Am continuing to do what I've done for a number of years now and in the most recent bang what's up with me is uh\nUh when we talk about corporate abuse and misuse and or a arrogance a I'm a I'm representing that family ah down in orange county a whose son was killed by executive of Hyundai Corporation\nAnd a Hyundai not only a new about a hit and run incident that involve one of their corporate executives their corporate culture produced it\nAnd to make it even more reprehensible they are\nFor three days left the family wondering who it was that it struck their son in a drunk driving incident and they spent those three days helping their executives get to the LA Airport put him on an airplane and sending back to er Korea outside the jurisdiction of the United states of America so\nUh that's kept me fairly busy and it's something that uh I feel passionate about and I know you\nFeel the same you know widely in amazes me as I go through my legal life of the stuff that goes on out there\nUh in the corporate world\nFrom the standpoint of what they do with their shareholders from the standpoint of a situation like you just had from the standpoint of uh doing a terrible lax and the one thing I think uh my mom taught me\nBecause I used to a whole bunch of terrible acts I used to throw my socks behind the door or I didn't clean up my room I didn't make my bed and there was a whole laundry list of things you need to go to confession I so well you know you try it you know but\nThe one thing that did take place is that my mom taught me how to say I did the wrong thing\nHow to apologize when you've been rude to somebody how to apologize when you whatever it was that was wrong and Jane Gerard he definitely have that down\n... already apparently is sorely missed in corporate America\nBecause as I go through these cases like some just like the ones who described you have fewer and fewer members of corporate America saying hey listen we did the wrong thing you know if if companies were to do that\nIf companies would say hey listen ah we put out the bad pet food maybe your pets have died I don't know what your legal rights are I Know if you can sue from wrongful death of a dog but I Know this is really harmed you\nWe want to do something for you we first of all we promise you will never happen again we would like to help you get a new dog or we will pay for that we will do those things\nThey would go they would come off as the greatest company in America without a doubt and probably wouldn't even cost him that much\nAnd it seems to me that as as I see the acts\nAnd maybe I'm John ... but I Want you to tell us it seems to me the corporate America squeezes more and more a lot of people that shouldn't be squeezed and once they're caught they have no ability to apologize\nWell you and I know that the most devastating thing they can have it in a courtroom and for good is when somebody walks into the courtroom and accept responsibility and says I'm Sorry\nUh but you and I can count on the fact unfortunately\nUh that that's not going to happen 'cause they don't accept that responsibility and the only way we can make them except that responsibility a is true the marvelous system we have in this country in the right to a civil jury trial and twelve members of our society\nA and I want to speak just for a moment about civil justice system and about the the right to trial by jury or oftentimes we hear criticism of it and oftentimes we fill why do we need a jury why why don't we just have a judge\nWell there's a couple of really disturbing things that have been happening as we know for instance when we go into the courtroom and gotten the common person who sits on juries\nTo stand up and speak out against this corporate abuse this corporate fraud this corporate arrogance we're now seeing an act of Supreme Court there that just this week we've seen a front page article in the Los Angeles times\nWhich analyzes the current United States Supreme Court and lists all of the major victories before that court the so called Roberts' court\nThat that's even more right of the Rehnquist Court and has been totally wiping out jury verdict and citing almost a hundred percent with corporate America\nSo if we ever need a lesson as to why the jury system is so important and why we need to keep the average citizen involved we see that exactly happening or with the Supreme Court\nWe also then look and see what kind of performance level we're getting out of the executive branch of the government or with a approval rating of less than thirty percent now we look at Congress and we see an approval rating of less than thirty percent\nSo I think that that our forefathers\nA with a simple bill of rights and they simple constitutional right of the seventh amendment to the right to trial by jury they had it right back in Seventeen Seventy six and shortly thereafter\nAnd they still have it right today and\nWe get vindicated that as we trial lawyers the civil justice system or when we see that that is the one institution that keeps us all honest keeps us all going straight a and makes such a major market because without them it would just be these institutions which are causing a great deal of difficulty for we're gonna balls\nWere just a moment as you listen to champions of justice with tons you're already in Amy Solomon our guest today is attorney widely it can\nUndo dino we'll be back with more than just a moment here as you listen to talk radio so I don't know\nCoal rich\nPlumbing it eight eight eight seven five seven rich no reader man here only full service professional plumbers\nGot a kitchen or bad

healthcare which means lower healthy for you to gather ... I mean I didn't healthcare makes saving on Medicare part D quick and easy\nTo bring your prescription your nearest Walgreen pharmacy and start saving today [noise]\n... ... you know why [noise]\nBut here's the story of Laura who always wants to play football is tearing supporters his love of the game sensitive to special caps\nPro scouts came to a bunch of games where Lawrence was playing\nI was never that good at football gave up every time I go to college but he also learned how to conceive them a lot of money on core interests so he switched is this your story has a happy ending after all\nWelcome back to the gym sins of justice was done through already and Amy Solomon our guest today is attorney Wiley a can\nOf thought there is a word\nForgotten word the word is integrity in our society particularly as you noted oftentimes very visible a human area of a corporate practice but it's missing whatever happened to the ability for someone to say yes I'm responsible and I'll make restitution\nWell I'm unfortunately a way of become a society that is dominated more by profit then integrity\nIt's unfortunately it's society to spend a great deal of time talking about the bottom line and how much money we made and what the profit report is going to be\nA when we hear all these great exciting stories about someone is willing to do an ounce their profit for the year we never hear about how they made that profit we never hear about what they did it right or whether they were fair everybody just wants to know the bottom line number\nSo to a certain extent we have to accept responsibility for the fact that we\nI haven't uh held them accountable and or at least as a as an entire society and that's what a trial lawyers of attempted to do is to bring back\nCrazy seniors I'm Ken Jeffries with this news updates\nFrom wonderfully say a ten year old boy was wounded in a drive by shooting it appears to be your gang related attack\nShooting happened it around two fifty PM

today's champions of justice are just as attorney ... a second\nAnd your hosts are ... and Amy Solomon\nTom okay um [noise] we have all this bad publicity about trial lawyers gifts in fact guys like you were so harsh doing this courageous stuff\nHelping the people who've been harm then why are they are all these bad jokes about trial lawyers why aren't there any bad jokes about corporate America\nScreen over the little guy blah blah and why did the politicians go after you instead of corporate America lay it on me why only a wealth\nIs that this is probably two different ... different towns a little bit ... eyes are into I never wanted to sound a little bit like a an economic question the reality is is we don't have the resources and we don't have the money that we're the we're taking on special interests were taken out and usually large corporations with huge amount of resources\nSo they have the ability to advertise and twist the facts and take out full page ads and\nAnd come up with all of these various ways of attacking and shooting the messenger\nSo there's no question that they had a very well orchestrated campaign to shoot the messenger\nThe other thing that we have to recognize that isn't what we were never meant to be popular so when someone says that the travelers are on popular that tells me something I think it's very important it tells me that we're doing a good job\nWhere we are to a ... here to afflict the comfortable and comfort the afflicted and nobody is necessarily going to be in favor of somebody who comes in and shakes up\nThe pot and shakes up society so as soon as we started becoming the loved and liked and as soon as we started being invited into all the right country clubs and as soon as we started getting invited all the right cocktail parties were just not doing our job\nSo to some degree I think we have to look at the criticism as a badge of honor\nBut it also has to be a recognition\nThat hopefully the public will get wise to the fact that they've decided if you want to stop civil justice system\nIf you want to stop the victims and consumers from having their rights protected then you've got to get the messenger and they've they figured it out and they've spent a lot of time and effort and money it's like I talked about corporate culture they've spent a great deal of Madison Avenue advertising dollars to create a culture\nIn which the criticism of the trial lawyers and the criticism of the attorneys is acceptable because that's exactly what they want it\nWe're talking about media culpa and you had a case where you represented a couple against Disneyland out at Disney handle it well\nAh the case of that that you're referring to is the case that involved the family that lost their son at the the the wrongful death case where the young twenty two year old boy was killed on the big thunder mountain right and and the gap in the process of investigating the case that clearly there were some people\nWho maintain that train a that\nCaused that trained to crash and cause that horrible death\nThere were people who are operating a train who could have\nPulled the train off the track even though they knew it was having a great deal of uh problems so again you would look at it and say okay well so\nDisneyland responsible because their maintenance people left it in an unsafe condition Disney's responsible because of the people who ran the train who could have made the decision to take it off the track chose not to do so uh but that's only half the story\nBut we discovered was that Disney had a process any program we're all of the people you interviewed who ran the ride said of course we didn't remove the the train off the track\nWe would get in trouble for that they got to turn these things over and we've got long lines we got to move these people on to the train and if we pull that train off the track and it was found out not to be\nUh uh seriously in trouble even though we had a strong strong suspicions that there was a problem with that particular trained than we would be criticized and we could lose our jobs so they were intimidated not to take the train off the track\nWhat happened with the people who are we're maintaining the train\nThese individuals were had been working\nAssigned to particular rides that's how Walt Disney\nOr when we brought this case we were on the side of Walt Disney we do we just weren't on the side of Michael Eisner the Walt Disney when he set up Disneyland had these workers each knowing each individual rights and assigned to work on that ride so to the event the problem of course along comes in efficiency genius\nWho says well let's just have a pool of maintenance people for the whole park\nThey don't know each individual ride they don't know it's it is secrecy and the maintenance people are not well trained and then of course that is going to cause a problem which resulted in death\nWhat happened in the Disney case\nWas not only did it take a long time and a lot of hard work to get the case resolved for this very very deserving family what the family wanted\nWas an apology and they want it does need to publicly apologized for the death of their son and we spent more time\nNegotiating a simple I'm Sorry than we did the amount of the settlement\nAnd that is what's wrong with our society when we play so much value on the dollar and the future dollars to be made all Disney could think of is what can we do not impact the money we hope to make in the future even though it's our fault\nIs is saying I'm Sorry going to somehow impact the bottom line down the road and that became the negotiating point even though they knew and the evidence was overwhelming in terms of their wrongful contact\nSo um why they we represented the little boys have got so badly hurt on the Roger Rabbit right um the ride was such that you didn't have guards and so little kids could get thrown out of it and so forth\nAnd with that family wanted this was after your case was more than anything they wanted some medical protection for the little boy\nBut they they wanted an apology\nAnd I'll tell you a great of a story little boys in the hospital you been in the hospital for many weeks and there was an interview by the uh Orange County paper and they asked him his favorite person and he said oh my favorite person is service Drew Sloan\nNow somehow this interview got back to Mr Stallone\nThe next thing we knew without any press conference without anything else Sylvester Stallone drives down to Orange County with a bunch of rocky memorabilia sees the little boy gifts in this stuff\nSigns a bunch of autographs for him wishes him to get well et cetera this to me was the greatest story of a Hollywood actor that I'd ever heard of and I didn't know Mr Stallone at all he didn't know anybody had he wasn't doing this for the press release\nLaw stands so comes up to me and he says I'm I've got this subpoena\nHe said uh how did you knew about it I said Jon I said I Can't tell you he said um I think we ought to try and settle the case [laughter] because you haul that we can have done a bunch of tests filmed with\nThe trailer just like our trailer and lo and behold as they went down to the test track they all flipped over so that was an extraordinary situation but what happened\nNot necessarily just because of that case but that put in motion stability in the jeep that put it in motion a bunch of other safeguards that these cars won't rule over nearly as quickly as a matter of fact in Casino Royale the latest James Bond movie\nThan an asteroid Martin them that they were going to flip\nThey shot it five times widely according to my house because they couldn't get the darn hard to flip over you know according and so they had to build a funny road with a drop off and so forth while people couldn't see so finally they could flip the vehicle and if you look at\nThe roof crash that at one time if a car went over on its side everybody was quadriplegic because the roof would crush him in ... in the Internet just collapse and so now all of a sudden you're in a two foot area instead of a forefront area\nIf you look at the seatbelt protection the three point belt versus the two point belt insisting on belts in every seat we tried to the case against Ford in\nWhich they had three point builds on everybody except the middle seat in the back of the little boy of course becomes a paraplegic because of that\nIt was a product effect case until we found a bunch of films by Ford that they had run tests showing that the little kid in the back would snap his spinal cord if he only had to slap bill and that was ten years earlier\nSo now then what do you have I think you have safe for vehicles\nI think even though we get these foods scares on various things I think manufacturers or be more responsive and concerned about seven knowing their food\nBecause now they know there's a downside to it and the terrible miserable rotten trial lawyers to get some a terrible a feeling among many people in the country are the people that are responsible for all that they've dino\nBut let's talk about how you really feel for just a moment okay there was a very famous printed out and I wish I wish this ad would be printed an updated every year that was put out by the trial Lawyers Association many many years ago showed a car and then it had all kinds of little arrows\nGo into various portions of the guard and the it indicated these were the the safety changes that had come about because of the efforts of trial lawyers this was a much safer garner pointed out all the various areas that we're safer because of your efforts\nThe a article you are the ads you referred to\nThat sounds to me like a a a\nTrial lawyer report or a and every year we should be able to put out a trial lawyer report card and say what are we done this year to make place this a better place for you to live\nYou know make the better products safer see that you get your ... your bills and medical bills paid see that you get your insurance benefits why haven't these titans of industry figured out\nThat there is profit and there is money and doing the right thing and that looked at work together as a team now that does sound Bali Amish but the reality is\nI just can't figure it out because I think on a dollars bottom line basis what we try to accomplish is to put ourselves out of business make cars safer have people not get injured and the first instant not suffer serious injury or death\nAnd in the process of doing so we get all this incredible resistance it's a\nIt's it's enough that I guess to make a passionate [laughter]\nYou know I'm all these toys the get recalled\nBecause of lead paint in the toys somebody just because the heads pop often the children suffocate forty five percent of those toys that have been recalled the sheer were manufactured in China\nSo now than a manufacture here by those obviously there are less expensive puts them out into the marketplace subjecting now\nChildren to some very serious risk of harm so the\nThe real a source here of product quality has to be with the person selling the product and unless there's a severe penalty in serving up a bad product I think it's a lot cheaper to sell the one from China when they hit bumps offered the lead results or whatever\nSo\nI think the trial lawyers do pretty good but widely\nTheir budget cases out there that are total baloney the lawyers should never brain dead or abroad and insurance companies have to defend that case corporations have to defend the case and the cases baloney truth me or not\nI I'm with you on that and I totally agree and we've seen it in our practice or for a long time but the problem is is that number one those are a those are a few of the case that they're they're very much lower percentage of cases as a whole\nWe are all in perfect human beings and an imperfect world that means that are going to be bad trial lawyers who bring bad cases\nBut you don't throw out the baby with the bath water and the reality is yes there are some abuses and we're alert to that I Know that Amy will be working on that in our leadership with the trial lawyers here to help eliminate those types of cases\nWe've ah I ... you know our biggest problem in terms of getting rid of bad cases are\nIt's not us as the bar association or the trial lawyers police in ourselves\nWe do that not as well as maybe we could but we do that\nI've had many conversations with insurance adjuster insurance claims people the people who had up the claims department and I say why do you pay those claims why aren't you engaging in the discovery and the fraud why aren't you say no and not paying these claims\nAnd they said why Ali we figured out it's cheaper to pay them than it is the fight them\nSo we just go ahead and pay them I said but by paying them you're you're part of the culture and part of the problem\nAnd they made an economic decision not as to what's right\nJust eliminate some of these bad claims eliminate some of these ... lawsuits but to allow them to continue because it's in their economic interests to do so\nYeah widely but guess what you can't blame the people who were brought into the case that don't belong in the case you can't blame them for that that's all there is\nNo no I'm not blaming them I'm saying that their claims that are the person who has the claim brought against them and the carrier knows it and decided it's easier to make a payment than it is to force those cases the trial because again it's short term thinking when they stand up to those cases those cases will start to go away\nThe short term solution for them is to make a simple payment and move on yes all um yes there are people who get brought in the law suits that don't belong there and they shouldn't be either I mean I Know it's difficult sometimes to say yes that I might have to pay ten thousand dollars\nTo the Vita five thousand dollar claims that I just pay five thousand dollars I've saved myself five thousand dollars but that short term thinking\nAnd they saw him what are you going to do about it well\nI think we can ... police are around I think it's a really small minority and I think it's really easy to say that a lot said his federalist until it's your own\nUntil it's your own and that is going to bring us to the end of our time together today and I got to tell you that the with our guests today we could probably do a month's worth of programs and still not scratched the surface\nChampions of justice with Tom ... and joining us in Studio ... today and we fish Solomon our guest attorney widely it can

report\nSo many other things that are keys we've talked about saving a minimum if you can afford to do so a minimum of ten percent of your income because that's the money that you're going to invest in your\nUh IRA or your four one K. or your for all three baby or tax privilege to count whatever it may be\nAnd that's the money that over time can compound and grow for you until you reach retirement age level now\nI liked the idea of putting more than ... percent frankly if you can afford to put Fifteen Percent or twenty percent more power to you\nBecause that will obviously accumulate better but at a minimum level if you can afford to do so I Would establish ten percent as that minimum\nNow another topic that we've talked about that so critical is paying those credit cards off on a monthly basis because you accomplished two things\nWhen you pay your credit cards off on a monthly basis number one you don't accumulate some massive usually high interest rate debt that you really don't want as part of your future financial picture you don't do that when you pay them all monthly\nBut the second thing that happens is it works as a discipline on\nAvoiding excessive spending\nBecause if you cannot afford to pay it off on a monthly basis that old you are doing is piling up debt something that I Know many of you may not want to do\nAnother thing that I think is important and you know when you listen to the money talks colors you hear that a lot of people have some work to do on this one and that is when you're approaching or in your retirement years you really want to think about a balanced\nInvestment portfolio now a balanced investment portfolio edits basic form as a fifty percent allegations of the stock market and the fifty percent allocation to income producing securities\nAnd the whole idea about using a balanced portfolio approaching or in your retirement years is to manage your risk\nYou don't want to be taking a lot of risk when you're at that point in the investment cycle\nAnd the way for you to modify the risk controlled at risk manage it if you will is by adopting a balanced investment portfolio that contains an equal amount or close to an equal amount in stock market investments highly diversified of course\nAnd in income producing security's so that's a thought that I think is that the core of investing which is the adoption of a balanced investment portfolio approach approaching or in your retirement years\nAnd these or or some of the key things that I think that you can do to make a difference\nI'm Bob Brinker

talk I think that\nThose who live in the high tech states are going to have to fess up to reality I'm not saying they're going to like it but I think reality is this is a got you moment this is a gotcha moment where the federal government has passed a law and they got you\nAnd if you have to duck shouldn't use on state and local taxes of all kinds of nexus of ten thousand dollars they got you\nI don't expect anybody in that position to like it but I Do expect them to do the obvious which is seriously look at relocation it doesn't have to be that way there were places all over the country some of which\nHave no have no state income taxes\nNow what is that going to do that's going to take away from the high earner population because those are the people that would have the um the motive\nTo make a change\nThere are so many places around the country where you can make a change\nI mean look at the situation between Oregon and Washington Oregon a high state income tax Washington zero Washington state uh there were other states places around the country where the same thing is true\nAnd look at look at the state like Texas surrounded by states with relatively high state income taxes are states like Oklahoma for example\nWell there you go Texas is not that far from Oklahoma and there are examples like this all over the country look at the difference between North Dakota and South Dakota I Know not many people were there but some of them are there and listen to money talk\nIn places like Fargo in Sioux Falls and others and I can tell you right now\nThere's a big difference in state income tax between North Dakota and South Dakota because South Dakota doesn't have any\nSo you have this situation all over the country Georgia and Florida very very good example high state income tax no state income tax this is the situation all over the country people are going to look at this now because this can be really big money for a high earner\nAnd so people can look at this and say\nJust makes a big difference so these are the kinds of considerations that people will continue to make and it's just watch it gets based\nLogic to expect people to ignore this would be to expect ... suspect people not to care about their money well people do care about their money\nClark is on the line in Baton Rouge shuttle clerk\nYeah hello thanks for taking my call itself\nA bit of retires since June of ah twenty eleven and a half kept the majority of by bond funds and a stable value on over that time frame it goes a low interest rates and it's worked out pretty good but it looks like me\nIt's time to be changed by strategy and start moving into your low duration income funds because\nI've been doing that with some of my money for a couple of years ago I noticed that I'm making about twice as much as a stable by you and a cat or the that that's going to improve over time going forward\nAnd so I just wanted to get a second opinion mute does it make sense maybe start ... now that\nIt's what are your stable normalize\nWhat is your stable value of thing you\nIt's paying me right at the last last year it was two percent and they're all a rated phones are contracts\nAnd you have no risk your principal at all\nVery very little yeah\n... ... it's a very tough it's a very tough question to answer and I'll tell you why ah\nIt's very difficult to know going forward what the rates of return are going to be because of the propensity of interest rates to reflect what's going on in the economy and thereby for the fed to reflect what's going on in the economy with reference to interest rate in monetary policy so it's a very very tough call\nTo make any for recall on what the income portfolio is going to earn and but it's very difficult to make that kind of a projection versus what you seem to be saying is a guaranteed two percent\n[noise] yeah and ... and ... it would it at the beginning of my retirement\nIt was much better than that it was around four in there but yeah as these contracts mature you know they lack the interest rates going down there so\nYou know the returns of slowly degraded it when that when they write stark normalizing go back up the same thing's going to happen and I got to go up very fast and point in time I got to figure out what I made a switch and\nWell maybe that maybe there will be a time clerk when you can you make that kind of a judgment but my response to your question right now is it's a very very tough comparison to make based on what we know right now and I do appreciate the call\nThis is money talk [noise]\nMoney Jong [noise]\n[noise] here's\nThe cold hard truth about hard water in our home nearly Ninety percent of America is affected by him hard water contains harsh mineral that

disparity and the local banks but then you also you see a lot as for\nMuch higher than that [noise]\nUh do you have any commentary on whether they are safe or where where to get CDs\nWell I think if you are dealing with a brokerage firm a a like a vanguard or Fidel itty or one of the large brokerage firms you um you might be able to get them to get you a offerings on CDs have you tried that\nI have talked to them about it it it seems like a lot of trouble to go\nHang them but ah okay well it is the other thing\nWould be to ah ah check out the CD rates that are offered by a major banks which

I\n... if you're a Trump supporter on trade when he was talking about when he ran for office and what he actually got were two totally different ballgames completely yeah and what he was talking about on the campaign compared to what he was what he actually got and promoted the good at what he got was completely different\nThan when he was running for his campaign and as we've said if his most loyal if the always Trump ... want to support it and go with it we're fine with that because all we care about\nIs the actual substance what did you actually get and doesn't promote more free trade to promote\nA more more good things but the ultimate thing that he promoted was actually a negative it raises the cost of cars in the United states Canada and Mexico and that's a bad thing mhm and\nNow I think the average person who understands economics who is in caught up in the political I dollar tree will admit\nThat's a bad part of the deal the always Trump or just ignore it ignored as if it doesn't exist were not just going to go there he got the deal he said he was going to redo NAFTA he did after what was the NAFTA I don't care don't want to know and that's fine\nThat's part of a demographic that's going to vote for every president that exists sure but that's not the only demographic that voted for Trump we broke it down to eight different demographics\nAbout six months after the election and there's a ton of people that in that eight demographics is more now more United and you can even at a ninth in there which are the never Trump hers which have now come aboard mhm so Trump for all of the good and the bad\nHas United with the help of Kavanaugh and the help of the Democrats and then speaking\nBluntly about what they want this country to become a have United around Trump and they do look at Trump he is that I think your head that isn't them right\nAnd and I think you look at the end and you said this earlier if you want to look at the ... the the real rock star look at the terms in terms of performance\nIn terms of getting things done Trump over ... come on I'm close because the one thing that that is going to always resonate with American people is a good economy\nIt's going to be a man I'm uh doing okay everybody in my family seems to be doing okay a job status doing OK and or getting better\nYou look at the unemployment numbers in any kittens where the liberal media can't argue any of those points anymore they can't break it down because you you just simply can't those numbers now\nThey can be manipulated but in breaking them down in terms of the performance as as long as we've used the same standard standard\nWith the same standard of approach basically on those numbers\nYou cannot have a debate about the unemployment or the GDP or anything else because\nThe last president was judged by the same exact standards all of this basically wraps up into one thing what is it that the other side wants to do and is that a threat to the\nExisting ... you know economy right now in other words or you know I'm really I'm I Am doing a little bit better you know my jobs doing better or making a little more whatever it might be I'm I'm taking home a little more taxes are lower\n[noise] not only that but I remember you know we said this and I don't know if anybody's ever used the exact same words that we used and I think we used to probably uh I think this was early in the primaries and we continue to say it all the way through the election\nAnd we and and the media has completely missed is totally mhm but it's not just that you'd be analysis that I was telling you that I read yesterday that Trump is the average ... average person the average person looks at them as the average person what does that entail the average person if you cause that to me doesn't describe\nThe the the substance at just that's labeling people I use an average person therefore he likes Trump's because Trump relates to the average person because they believe he's like the average person what does that mean\nAnd you and I actually use the L Word back way back in the in in the campaign I Believe that and and I believe this too but I Believe the Trump loves America ... and I believe he loves Americans and he loves Americans first\nUm\nBut he loves Americans and I think the people that support them I think part of the political I dollar tree which is different than Obama's political I dollar tree\nRight is that they look at him and they say here's a guy that truly loves America\nAnd he loves to me he cares about me yeah he's rude and yeah he screwed but when it gets down to with a law that comes from the anger that we believe that he shares with us that these other people don't love America\n... and we love America and how do we love it and now the left on the media would get insulted we love America no you don't you don't believe in due process yeah both Cuomo America's never been great right but ... exactly mhm you you really you really don't you don't really believe in the first amendment you don't really believe in the second amendment\nYou don't know believe in due process you don't believe in a

in Kansas Dave higher what Iranian welcome to the show Hi Dave\nOnly has a very good show thanks\n... shows on just as good as such a circle but last caller mentioned about ... you know he was trying to get you guys' opinion on that older than ... completely different ...\nIn this narrow it Kevin on that so just came up to my attention okay and then let's say was completely different show\nWhat group of conservatives or Republicans would be like ... like ... ... and ... or ... ... like\n... ... ... who will go on our side will be ... or doing\nThat nobody will know conservatives or you're if you're talking about the behavior of the the uh the uh interrupted disruptive kind of and we're getting\nAlso we'll let you go um if you're talking about the disruptive type of behavior or the after the the committee vote on Kavanaugh the Kamala Harris and and uh and others walking out that kind of behavior who on the right would do that\nI don't know of anybody that would do that our point was that it would have been a different scenario based on the media treatment of a set individual\nHad everything but that's really more about the media treat\n'em and what we do and we did go back and and talked about the working down of the um uh you know what how they have acted or behaved a as a judge during the confirmation process for Sotomayor\nOr for land a Kagan and what they might do in a in a certain scenario but that was based on their behavior as a judge\nYou still had Republicans vote for them and you still had and that was their treatment of them was based on again how they would be have as a judge that was part of a what Lindsey Graham and say\nYou know he voted for Elena Kagan and sort of my ... and so what's the behavior be you know\nI'm a a\nA ... well a Lindsey Graham getting up and walking out likely not no because I think what you saw and Lindsey Graham and\nUh his uh emotional or the you know statement\nThat day during that hearing when Kavanaugh was there was based on the ... the behavior of\nThose on the left and how they were treating this and essentially a shredding the process and and I think that's what that's what that was if it had\nYou know a liberal president and it was a a liberal justice or liberal judge a that had been appointed and during this process there was a conservative leaning or a you know a woman that using him\nOf doing something with the behavior be different by the media would have been treated the same\nLikely not no but it was kind of a you know with all due respect of well the answer I think we all know that any critical thinkers I don't expect they\nLindsey Graham or or another conservative on the committee or or Republican on the committed to get up and do what ... you know after the committee vote get up and storm out\nThat wasn't the point\nYou know ... and again you can't make the case he was trying to make the case that was the same and I'm like no it was unprecedented what happened right mhm and you you can look at Justice Thomas you know that goes back you know twenty five\nOr ... that goes back twenty five years ago and and uh you know he those hearings were held and then but then but then he was he was you know confirmed that I Believe some Democrats even cross the line and voted for him yes they did I Believe that yes they did well I Believe that was a Democrat said at the time [noise] [noise] yeah\nUh so yeah so you know they they ... but this was unprecedented nothing nothing we have ever seen\nA ... in our lifetime or in modern times\nHas has been like this so to even question that to me uh shows ignorance and that doesn't mean stupidity it means\nA lack of knowledge ah on on history and that's why we brought up so that didn't happen with sort of minor and that didn't happen with Kagan there were people that disagree with that because we we believe that sort of my or and Kagan many times not all the time\nEight talks about you know he lost his seat teachers' aides got to make sure they get a ... they're not going to teach to the test\nAnd I ... I mean he's talking about state issues which shows the ignorance you know what I mean the Democratic party place she\nYou know to the ignorance of feet prevail even teach civics down here anymore and it was stage I'm sixty five years so I I was a Democrat like everybody was in Texas until probably the mid eighties\nAh we're all ... conservative or moderate Democrats but he's taking it out as show I mean it's you know just the fact\n[laughter] I don't know it just amazes me I it's like I wasted\nThirty three years in the air [laughter] been treated\nAnd even you know that the constitution and video have writers get\nWell I I yeah I understand yeah I understand there's always been the ad on yeah there's always been that you've your service uh there there's always been the ebb and flow is I mean if you\nIf you were walking around the Nineteen thirties as an adult in this country you would have seen or you know the socialist mindset that really really really really existed at that time span or the anarchist movement that uh in in the first part of the twentieth century uh that that existed or in this country could get a just as wild at at times\nOne of the things is the the fact is do do as many people still hold as radical views\nAs you see maybe a little more right now I don't know how many Democrats rank and file actually hold the views of not believing and due process as\nThe mainstream of the Democrat leadership now ... what are the same I seem to see where is there a big just right now now we we know that on many of the issues the ... if you if you actually polled Democrats on all the major issues out there as to what they would want\nYou would see as we saw back in and we noted back in\nA twenty twelve especially when on the issues the majority of the public agreed with a Romney yeah it'll bomb Ryan yeah on the issues they read with ... and if you take a ton of the issues that rank and file Democrats believe\nThey disagree with what the people they vote for a does and I think to a much greater extent than any Republican\nVoting for a Republican president ... yeah yeah because you think about this if you think about the conservative never Trump per se\nThe vast majority of the issues that they disagree with Trump bond is his tone yes\nIs it similar to what they are a lot of the left criticizes him for his words in his town\nAnd it's not so much the job that he's done you know they may pick apart you know whatever it is the tariff babies [laughter] by the way we are the original ... babies um but but but they may pick a part of the things that the sort of that but ultimately if you got down and you were to\nAsk the never Trump or is it conservative never truckers\nUh well okay the corporate tax rate Twenty one percent did you think that was going to happen or do you apply that do you agree with that um the unemployment rate the GDP where we are right now uh do you think we're moving in a good direction and the president's done a good job on a number of items\nI don't know how you would do it out even as a never\nTrying and ... I I Believe the president should fight more when it comes to the debt he's taking little victories us I'm cutting the federal government this much but it's doing nothing to solve the budget problem that's right yeah he throws those he throws that out but\nThe fact is he knows he's not the legislative branch and yes he knows he the one about power yeah this isn't this isn't the president alone\nThat has you know created this deficit spending\nThese other Republicans in Congress including a significant portion of conservative or formerly conservative [laughter] ... who wants to identify conservative Republican congressional members that are also wanting to spend eight eight eight a ton of money well well how did\nThey get tax is done Roy Moore last yeah and they realized oh my gosh we got to get things done a because we may lose the Senate at some point we've got this slim you know victory here are slim margin now and it they didn't do the Republicans in the Senate\nDidn't get it done until after that lost the president had been working toward that but again this answer tight if they're not going to do anything right\nI think the president should still work harder and still talk about more which he does not ... you probably and and I I'm thinking that probably the White House says look we can't win this ... because our own party\nDoesn't care any more about the ... well you know what's what's really disappointing I guess the downside of this capital of the thing or what have may have motivated a lot of people\nOr whether it's a never Trump or his or or the the moderate Republicans a who now are standing up for conservative principles again it could be too little too late not not in the Senate but in the house\nAnd the president and the Republicans if the just imagine that that the Republicans maintain power in the house and the Senate\nThe motivation to get things left now work on getting things done right that's\nVery real but it can't happen if the houses in there\nIf you lose the house is going to be limited in what you can get done [noise]\n\n\n\nAs soon as ... radio on Westwood One\nListened to read I radio show wherever

set\nAnd the tone is set by who while the tone is set by the people that are put in place to have those departments in this case the department of justice sort of the state department\nSo that tone\nSet that we don't need I mean let's face it\nAt least one or the secretary of state's was thought it was okay allowed an above board to have her own email server outside the security server and we all know why that reason ... the the reason the real reason was\nThat it was to avoid the freedom of Information Act and she thought that that was well wasn't lawful but she was trying to tell people what was allowed and above board\nLook when you have that pattern of behavior expect that the rank and file in all these departments there's going to act accordingly whether they get a directive to or not right\nYou know we we wonder about our top secret so I read this oh man did when I was on vacation I Can't remember who wrote it but it just popped into my head down as you were talking about it that\nTalked about Hillary Clinton you know oh she removed herself ... uh you know from having top secret clearance you know she she removed herself and the point was made well she should have been removed a long time ago right\nIf if putting a server in your house if being so ...\nUh with at the minimum careless and then the maximum absolutely premeditated or a mindset of breaking espionage law them by allowing the top secrets of the country to go through your private server\nWhich now we're told foreign enemies were able to access it that doesn't get you to lose your security clearance what in the hell well right\nThere are no top secret if somebody can be so careless\nAnd not lose their top secret clearance just what does it especially think written mean if yeah and and I read that I said oh you know that's the point that came out of this is not\nWell shoot voluntarily admitted it wasn't but it was taken away from her that still pointed show have been taken away from it right\nWhere's the oversight but from the judge or I Want to read part of the transcript\nOr from a U.S district court judge Royce Lamberth the transparency group judicial watch initially sued the department of or the state department and twenty fourteen seeking information about the response to the Benghazi attack\nAfter the government did not respond to a freedom of Information Act request other parallel lawsuits by judicial watch are probing issues like Clinton server\nWhose existence was revealed during the the course of litigation the state department head of a mid ... uh moved to dismiss judicial watch his first lawsuit on the motion\nFor some re judgments sane and an affidavit that it it conducted a search of all potentially relevant emails and the possession and provided them the affidavit noted\nThat some more documents and emails could be forthcoming but Lambert denied the request to dismiss the lawsuit of the time\nAnd on friday he said he was happy he did charging the state department officials had intentionally misled him because other key documents including those on Clinton's email server\nHad in fact not Ben produced it was clear to me\nThat at the time that I ruled initially that false statements were made to me by career State Department officials and it became more clear it through discovery that the information that I was provided was clearly falls regarding the added the adequate see of the search and\nThis what we now know turned out to be the secretaries email system Lambert said on friday he continued\nI don't know the details of what kinds of IGA inquiry a there was into why these career officials at the state department would have filed false affidavits with me by the way that's perjury\nYes you do that yes you're telling the court somebody when you know to be something else\nI don't know the details of why the Justice Department lawyers did not know false affidavits were being filed with me but I was very relieved that I did not accept them and that I allowed limited discovery\nInto what had happened during the tense exchange with Justice Department lawyer Robert Prince Lambert pressing issue accusing prince\nOf using double speak and playing the same word games but Clinton play and\n\nThat was not true that's a quote the judge said referring to the state department's assurances in sworn declarations that it had searched all relevant documents quote it was a lie\nAnd I thought about this the culture 'cause we talked about the culture of the Obama administration the culture that existed in the IRS whereas we know they purposely we're trying to hold up\nThe uh the uh tax or a document what do you call it again the tax um of all I got my bike here are the um\nWhen I returned ... no no no the ... though they were trying to hold up these groups that wanted to get a a a\nTax exempt taxes yet right towards again status as they held them up by the way ... you you want to know why I'm against the income tax I'm against the income tax for that reason right there\nI'm against the income tax because the government should never have to review\nAny group as to their intentions as the federal government was able to do that's why I Believe there should be a sales tax mhm that's why I'm against an income tax write because the government has using income tax to get involved\nAnd to censor people and to do things that they have no business being involved in your life right\nNow and then by the way you're touching on something I referred to earlier you know that that whole process of and well it was a couple of rogue agents remember that yeah it was a couple of rogue agent yeah no it wasn't no it wasn't\nAnd we're not saying if it was a direct order from the White House down what we're saying was there was a tone a clear tone that was set we know we know that would be the behavior the pattern of behavior during that administration on many levels the question is\nHow far did that go and was the tone and the department of justice or the state department just that look will do anything we want to we don't we don't have to tell the truth even to the courts well\nAnd and when I when I look at when we look at the situation with the IRS which you look at all the rest this seems the Irish might be minor [laughter] compared compared to everything else when you when you when you look at for example here at the department of of\nOf a state where the judge is saying you lied to me yes you absolutely lied to meet you committed perjury\nYou light an affidavit says his accusation right or you know it to a ... to them you look at what went on so that we're looking at the FBI and the department of justice you're looking at after\nWhen the pies application was declassified and the other documents declassified but the president didn't release it but sent it to the inspector general\nOf the department of justice who looks at what\nLooks at corruption\nYou look at how they were so willing in the state department to lie on Benghazi yeah and and this is why the whole thing ah with the\nUm\nOh I just I got my like your and but on the air for a while [laughter] we've been on vacation I Do a lot [laughter] with the show he\nMhm was it the debt murder of of a a lister a jump off a show ... over in Turkey or wherever it happened where we've sold on all the information because nobody has been able to independently verify\nWith turkey has said I'm sure somebody in the CIA may know but the average person doesn't know and this is why the Democrats have no business on talking anything about this administration\nAnd how they handle it so far especially when there's a lack of clarity as to what actually happened in this particular case should be investigated absolutely should there be repercussions if what we believe might have happened happened ... absolutely there should have been but\nDieter hundred Conrad Reinhardt was also

here today in Texas I don't know when it starts across the nation for other uh states but just Fifteen days away from election day in so much talk about us we've been doing throughout the morning back you we go let's talk to Mike in Washington state Mike Hi you're on TALK radio Hi Mike\nThank you this whole meal or the thing is just like it's just so frustrating for the voters because it drags on and on these coming up with nothing it's false accusations and it's I think we're going to win the house because of it because people are sick and tired of it\n... it's interesting because there there was a report that was out last week my dad said a ... mall or a to issue his the core of his report\nAfter the midterm and I'm Wondering why after the midterm and and what's going on why is the media\nThey just a band in this story and I mean they've banned in this story completely there's really nothing going on like what you saw up until a I don't know what a couple of months ago maybe\nAnd then when the house I well I I don't know that we will but it's interesting Mike there what I don't\nBelieve was is this ah like the FiveThirtyEight thing saying that you know they an eighty five percent chance that the Democrats will take the house\nBecause you have to get into all the different polls and all these districts and I mean there's a ton of but then we can break it down much easier into those thirty one tossup states right that that right now according to our she'd be there are thirty one tossup seats there are things like a Texas thirty two\nUh Pete Sessions and his Democratic challenger is someone who was in the last poll which was twenty eight days ago\nToday\nUh was within a point now we know because we live here in in this area we know that that district is a north of Dallas County uh and so there has been a ... a demographic shift that's been going on\nThat shift has been happening really over the last uh probably\nA three to five years but really over the last few years especially because so much growth in this area brings individuals and for jobs right so there's a the the demographics change so that could be an accurate pope we don't know my question is why are we seeing those big pollsters in these\nA tossup districts and why we're seeing these new polls come out especially a couple of weeks out because if you're looking at the house you would think that there was some interest there by the media in order to hire these pollsters these major pollsters are to do a more in depth polls we maybe we'll see some starting this morning\nAnd into next week a and over the next couple of weeks as election day is one week from tomorrow but my question is\nReally not if five thirty eight or any of them are wrong or because um who was it that uh had the basically the it was like a fifty fifty on the house was that NPR a couple of weeks ago they said it was just go yeah\nYeah so and and it came out to eat yesterday that in what is it likely of voters or the Republicans are moving closer ... that came out just yesterday I think I have writers somewhere yeah\nThe the the story here but it's so much tougher to tell on those house seats I just I I Wonder if that if we're going to gain in the in the in the Senate mhm and so that's you know that's looking at a populations across the state and right here or that\nYou know I I just wonder how they extrapolate it out to so many of these races where if they're using the public polls out there there are so few of them\nSo few and far between those now if you're going to the internal polling polling which I'm sure is being done by the campaigns you would have the better you know a better guess at that right\nYeah ... again here it is a a a Dems midterm advantage narrows among registered voters yeah my new national poll a few weeks before the midterm election shows the chances of a blue wave are far from a slam dunk for the Democrats the NBC Wall Street Journal poll released a Sunday shows forty eight percent of registered voters\nWould prefer having Democrats in control of Congress compared to forty one percent supporting the GOP the seven point gap is narrowing

serious [laughter] kind of Syria I figured I don't know about there may not work say there is maybe a little bit [laughter]\nI don't know we were making a point earlier that the President's Day will

we don't know that we have made that's why in politics you need very short memories about the effort if you don't have\nInstead the primary have no friends it reminds me of the former governor of Texas Rick Perry and after the primary season to twenty sixteen and\nThen you know he went on and and ultimately a well what's worked for President Trump when President Trump became President Trump but someone someone on the I think it was the NBC or something or you know asking Rick Perry on a TV interview well so what you're saying is a president or what you're saying was Donald Trump wasn't your first row so he goes\nOh no I was my [laughter] best and forever just to point out the stupidity behind the question [noise]\nUm but when you when you when you look at you know the polls and everything that that that are going on and and you kind of break down the numbers with you know what's what's gonna happen over the next couple of weeks\nAs people try and break it down we've we've said look the pollsters need to get into pre qualifying people okay Kenyan name the three branches of government okay good you're at\nUm you know because this is we were talking about the house full specifically that there aren't a great deal of them certainly the internal polls with the campaigns yes but we don't we're not going to see that\nAh so you know go back to you know a number of them were they haven't had a recent poll in Texas started to Pete Sessions you know trying to keep his seat there are in Texas or there hasn't been a poll in in well twenty eight days ago\nAs of this morning and I'm like why is that why wouldn't there be one so you you look at that and and you\nDo wonder about that you know methodology but then beyond the methodology it's\nThe qualifications of the respondents because I think we have to start asking those questions because if we're if we're getting I told you during the break the top of the hour a mid showed towards the almost middle or and show meeting I said to you you know\nI'm quickly becoming the old man that screaming the world's is going crazy but here's the thing I'm right I'll be in the history of old men I'll be the first one to be correct completely\nUm and also better um but the but the [laughter] the whole\nUh you know qualification of respondents in polls\nSeriously but this is why I I really do look at the house falls and I don't know\nI don't know five thirty eight is right and there are metal ... everything look I I just don't trust anything\nRight after Nineteen Ninety four and nobody really saw that coming right right right but he was able to to uh you know a project that coming so I don't know it as as I said the only thing I can do is look at it and say\nA President Trump and his numbers are the highest that they've been the NBC wash or the wall Street Journal poll that\nThat have that have come out even higher than Obama's was in in in twenty ten and now the Democrats got hit heavy and twenty ten ... uh and there was a price to pay for a Obamacare [laughter] yeah but but ah you know they they got hit heavy what you have here is\nYou have a president that his his approval numbers are higher now than when he started wasn't the case for Obama you have a his approval numbers are going up you have\nA United Republican Party which you didn't even have a month and a half ago you did not have ... you're not a Republican Party before the the Kavanaugh hearings for the most part\nAre you have a United Republican Party\nAnd it's not because they love Trump or the Republican Party so much especially the never Trump hers what they have seen is they have seen the Democrats and they have finally come to the realization that\nOh\nThey're really bad yeah yeah you know don't apparently they don't believe in\nIn in in due process you know and things like that so you you've got that going on right now but you also a very strong economy and you have an economy that's pulling extremely well in in a in some cases\nA better than in recent any recent time uh people extremely optimistic about the the uh the the the economy we send back in twenty sixteen when somebody called up and said you guys are going to be surprised\nWhen Trump wins and we said actually know he should win just because of the economy alone based on elections of of of the past and ah so you you have that and\nThen want to call it the Trump Card and\nYou have this and I don't know how this is going to affect the election but you couldn't pick of the worst time you and I were talking about\nThe conspiracy theories we heard about the care of and coming in from Central America and you know ... or you know a crossing and and crushing the southern border of Mexico to come in\nGetting by all the police the hundreds of police that were set up to block the caravan which now some reports yesterday say it's ten thousand illegal immigrants heading to crash into the U.S border\nIn the next couple of weeks and we hear his sister sorrow cirrhosis funding as the Democrats are funding this they're doing this in order to destroy Trump in the mid term election\nI wouldn't really um\nI think the effect might be the opposite of that they have to look at who who's going to get the benefit if there's anything that can put the funding back on the table in terms of a real discussion a politically for the wall then it's something like that but but but even before we get there we talk about the motivator\nWe look at the national polls on illegal immigration the people by and large stand with the president on them they may not it it starts to break down a little bit more when when you talk about wall but illegal immigration a and sanctuary cities and everything else\nThe people by and large stand with the president not only that but I've heard that\nThe Democrats are jumping on the I mean there there are the Democrats are jumping on the caravan and thinking it's to their advantage right and and also they're jumping on the the whole voter id thing right voter suppression by having voter id will the vast majority of Americans agree with that so Democrats were actually looking at this some Democrats are looking at the caravan and\nThe you know the the voter id as this is something that can push him over the finish line in two weeks and I'm sitting here thinking to myself this is bizarre\nAs Elizabeth Warren coming out with her fractions [laughter] with her ethnic fractions last week [laughter] oh by the way in in in other news we want to make sure that we cover everything yeah\nA Elizabeth Warren said she changed her mind and took a DNA test proving her heritage\nBecause Americans trust in government is at an all time low and she wants to rebuild it yeah\nShe said she changed her mind and the incumbent\nA spoke at her second debate against Republican state a representative a jet deal in the U.S Senate race she was asked by the moderator why she had said in March that no DNA tests was needed to prove that she had some Native American heritage\nShe said she ultimately took the test reporting the result late last week that showed\nA relative six to ten generations ago was Native American huh ultimately she said she took the DNA test because she believes one way to rebuild trust in government\nIs too is by posting her full family history on line so anybody can take a look yeah deal shot back that the issue is not about whether senators Warren ancestry it's about the integrity\nIn my mind and I don't care whether you think you benefited or not from that claim it's the fact that you tried to benefit from that claim\nAnd I think it bothers a lot of other people and it's something you haven't been able to put to rest since the twenty twelve campaign when she first mentioned having Native American heritage that led president Donald Trump to start start mocking her he had it I don't care what percentage she claims to be Native American\nI just care that I'm One hundred percent for Massachusetts and will be working for the people of that state and but still it was bizarre that she decided to do that you and I were on vacation but I really sat there and went\nReally really\nI mean and it was it was southern proactive and deliver it and then the result she thought beyond that just ...\nIt's not just checking it out but then taking the results and\nThe
