it's great to be able to do it right before the election we'll see what you know what what comes we'll we'll we'll find out we'll find out ... says\nWhat do you do when you have a tour my problem as an American Jew typical not feel threatened by the growing anti Semitism coming from the extreme liberal left and of course a reference to Louis Farrakhan calling for the extermination of Jews and saying that that he's not an anti Semite he's anti termite which is weird because every time I tried to fumigate my house for termites\nWhat they do is they then proceed to build happy inventions in

the world is being cheered on stage by openly ... lend us our store where do you see descending answer is nowhere to go ahead because\nI mean let's look at history and ever and all that well for the ... the different as this time number one America I Do believe they different country I Do believe that in America steeped in Judeo Christian values\nThat believes in the need to have local truth\nOf the of the Jewish mission and the Christian mission is very friendly to use an historically been up and there is a state of Israel and the state of Israel does have the capacity to defend itself and that changes the very nature of the history of which we live\nCharles says you're about what a large city seemed to always voted Democrat and more rural areas Republican answer is because in rural areas you tend to be a lot more self reliant and there's a lot less conflict with the people who live around if you have a big lead parts face you have a big piece of land\nYour neighbor even bother you that much so you don't feel the necessity to regulate your neighbor all that much 'cause there are no extra ... your neighbors doing when you live in a city extra now these are everywhere you when you live in a city the guy next door is playing his music loud\nIt bothers you and that means the regulation about how much noises allowed into particular residential building if the guy next door to decide to keep a messy apartment and\nThe smells emanating from our problem we need regulations if the streets are not clean and we all share the same street well then that requires regulation to an all this requires tax dollars spillover effect and highly populated areas more significant this is the reason why cities tend to be more highly regulated\nAnd more top down and read it now does that mean that's how they shouldn't be run economically speaking no and I mean that's how they should be run in terms of regulatory policy no but that's the reason why you get a lot of people together in a very small area it does generally drive people toward the idea that we have to\nHeavily lockdown how we live in a way they wouldn't have you're out in the middle of nowhere where you're not bothering anybody nobody is bothering you rate that have been much like you I was ... middle school and high school I feel like a stronger person for it but I also avoid thinking about those times have you been able to forgive the belief from your you have yes how so well\nI think forgiveness requires in Judaism forgiveness requires somebody to ask for forgiveness um I think one of the guys who did this ask for forgiveness at one point I even it wasn't actually one of the guy just one of the guys who was there and didn't do anything he asked for forgiveness that I had no problem getting if somebody can ask for forgiveness and now I think I Would do it just because [noise]\nWe're all kids were young and people act like a U.S when they're young that terribly when they go\nOn but I don't think you have to forgive to move beyond\nIt as long as you're not spending your your entire life focusing on how you were wrong and letting it in your brain then you can just move on with your life and sure when I see those guys is there a pang of like God that I was just the worst absolutely but\nIs that something that I spend an awful lot of time thinking about no and I think that made me stronger yeah I Do I think that\nWhen you go through in person and you come out the other side determined that said I think that does make you stronger\nGun has been learning given the Democrats have moved there are still

two hundred Fifteen million dollar class action settlement\nWith the hundreds of women who claim they were sexually abused by former campus gynecologist George Kendall attorney Brian Clay pool says universities proposed settlement serves to purposes\nSo they are much better at defining the terms and using the language to their benefit here here's another one pro choice now how could a concern would be against you having choices so the other side had a you know came up with pro life\nBut there's the battle right because you look pretty bad if you say you're from women having choices and then you say no they can have a choice\nOf course it helps in all of us have the media on your side perpetuating these faucets I recognize that and that's huge and one of the other callers pointed that out and mark you can't leave out the media\nSo those on our side or off and on the defensive even though they are explaining the obvious by the way one of the other things I mentioned last night\nThe left is very good at slogans right so hoping change right Obama had hope and change how could you argue with hope and change\nYou have to it's much more complex to explain our position wait a second or you always for change and I'll ask my students or you know where you're happy when you're younger and your parents are decided they were moving and they didn't ask you how about that change or how about a change you know the taken away your car\nNot every change is good but hope and change sounds fantastic\nSo those on our side or off and on the defensive even though as I said they're finding the obvious the most recent case being parents with children trying to get asylum and you know why I'm mentioning 'cause it's happening now but I'll get to the minute\nSeeking asylum and President Trump and Republicans accused of ripping children of course there's the help of the media ripping children from their mother's arms and putting these children in cages\nNever mind that this was started under the Obama administration\nPresident Trump and Republicans are on the defensive never mind that if the parents of these children this is crucial but Yardley ever heard of the parents of these children didn't come to the border and the first place there would be no issue no one force them to come here\nThey made a voluntary choice\nAnd we have a right to our sovereignty and to protect our borders and to decide who is welcome to enter just like we do with our homes this is so obvious it's incredible that we have to explain our position but again\nThere's a simple right how can you you know you're ripping away from the parents how could you do that and we're on the other side having to explain things like what are coming here legally means why that's not acceptable\nBut the left and the Democrats and the media likely do not believe in having us you know our sovereignty but rather they believe in open borders\nBut they don't like to admit that because they know they would lose the argument\nWhich is why they would rather talk about tearing children out of their mother's arms is really bad they get to set the debate and the terms of the debate when the media's on their side because no one's questioning them with comments like I'm throwing out there now you would\nNever mind that when anyone does something illegal and they're hauled off to jail their children do not go with them to a gym boys that a big one\nThat is a huge one you'll never see it when you know in the in the last time this happened and it's going to happen again with these hunters ah Honduras refugees coming you know seeking asylum that's going to happen very shortly whenever they get here\nYou never get to stay with your kid who hid you could use the same phrase oh she was found guilty of robbery first degree robbery and put our child was ripped out of her arm you never hear the media say that but that's what happens in effect\nThere also and so to speak torn away from them why isn't it said and as a just in case the latest reincarnation of this conflict is is a news hundreds of Hondurans are heading for the U.S border in a mass migration to seek asylum\nSo again President Trump and the Republicans will be on the defensive just because they want to defend our borders and the media will again show crime children and distraught mothers you know what's gonna happen\nBut no one is forcing them to come here and we have a right to decide who gets to enter our house and under what circumstances\nAmong other things we have a right this is pretty obvious to it seems to me to protect the American people from harm weather from terrorism or disease we don't know the terrorists aren't coming through our\nOpen border or disease or we checking for diseases like we used to know or ... well you can't say come here and Russian or even five matter this was important people don't talk about this\nTo make sure that people who come here share our values\nAnd just about every country does this including our neighbor immediately to the south of Mexico good try the same thing down there\nSome of us think this is also obvious but there have been huge forces arrayed against this common sense\nThe Democrats want more votes they will tell you that they they know illegal immigrants vote for them in huge numbers and the country club Republicans for lack of better name they want cheap labor so you have a newspapers like the wall Street Journal I I stopped subscribing to it when they would have their editorials and it would\nAbout immigration in the title and then I mean they say illegal immigration the title and somewhere in the middle they would just sit switched immigration oh immigration has been great for America over the years how could you you're in Iowa list right how could you oppose this this is insane\nBut they would switch on us even though they pretend to talk about illegal immigration in the title\nOf course the Republicans are also the stupid party that's my party than McDonalds during that so you have people like George W. Bush and Karl Rove saying things like boy we can get this vote George W. Bush got up to forty percent of the Hispanic vote in Texas\nWonderful I'm not a math major but that seems like a formula for defeat\n... Lawson politics by the way in politics in particular a loss of sixty percent to forty percent is huge and that is based on an optimistic assumption most illegal immigrants come here for jobs but they also take advantage of government hand that says we know that the rest of us paying for\nAnd by the way the Republican Party can never out do the Democrats in offering benefits\nI uh I think I use this phrase years ago when I ever voters given a choice between Democrats and Democrats meaning larger Democrats they choose the original ones they don't need us\nSo who these people don't vote for it's not that hard to figure out and if left unchecked the Republicans will never win a national election again\nSo even on a purely selfish basis it is clear that we need to control the border not to mention fairness what do you say to the people around the world who have been waiting many years I've heard of people waiting a decade to get here but it has to undergo long waits and incessant paperwork to even have a hope of getting here\nSo they have to follow the rules but those who dash across the border do not\nWhich is why a border wall makes sense among other tools is not the only thing but it's one of the tools so one color of this week and if you didn't hear him suggests that border walls don't work in the long run\nAnd I said but even if that were true I bet they worked in the short run while we try to clean this mess up and have an orderly procedure coming to our country\nIf to me it's the same ridiculous logic that the defenders of illegals murdering innocent America's like Americans like hates finally use\nAnd I you know I pointed Geraldo Rivera because I watch them do a time and time again saying oh illegals commit crimes percentage wise in lower numbers the Native Americans as if\nThat matters who cares even if that's true if an American is killed or harmed by an illegal immigrant that person would not have been hurt if that illegal had been denied entry no matter what the percentage is in that obvious and that wall by the way in Israel preventing Hamas from hurting Israel's Israelis is working there are a\nLot of these arguments is baffling to me unless you realize they have no real argument unless you change the words and the terms\nI more to say but I Know we have to go to the break Shirley let me give you the numbers and I'll go on a little bit more and six six Ninety red eye and that's the same as eight six six nine o seven three three three nine\nSo example how can you ever justify sanctuary cities were criminal illegals or given safe harbor if you come up with phony arguments like illegals will not you've heard that they won't cooperate with the authorities if they know they can be apprehended or sent home so that's why it's important that you know we have sanctuary for them\nBut how 'bout they not be allowed to come or in the first place and we wouldn't need to cooperate with authorities isn't that obvious how can you ever justify harboring criminals who commit crimes that native born Americans have no asylum from\nYou change the debate watch this to the evil police officers at ice who have the audacity to arrest people commit crimes that said these guys are really clever on the left\nSo the rest of us live with long lines at hospitals you're eating schools and intolerable traffic while the elites often live behind walls and their gated communities so what's my solution\nYou take away the benefits like free health care and free schools you enforce strict penalties against businesses that hire illegals even sending some CEO to jail you say in the first CEO to jail for hiring and illegal immigrant and they'll never happen again\nAnd you'd be amazed at how many illegal immigrants would return home\nRun the actually had a right to use the wrong language self deport there we go again with language right we're not good at that self deport we keep losing the language war to the left\nBut I Would then say that those who remained right everybody would leave it there are no bad if I take 'em back not everybody a lot would leave and that's what's happened during the recession a lot we leave there are no benefits no government handouts and they couldn't get jobs legally\nHey yeah I Love it or sometime on one of ... you know well why don't we start looking for a dog or\nAnd with all the aid of\nThe money but we normally would throw him out of town but we don't do it anyway it was\nSo why I like your idea by the way it's an interesting idea why do you use the phrase and document\nWell at that point it do you call it whatever you want it all up illegal what that's what I've lately but if you want to call it my dog that's fine you get ill or any I'm not only that when we set them up or whatever on the\nBus lane whatever we look for that as well and or any children that are separated for an audience\nIn some ways you're harder than me but it it does yeah get them out on the amount of aid\nThat's assuming you're giving it to every one of those countries which is the case for the most part of our writing\nOn state aid or stolen but oh well mania quite truly they don't give\nYou you don't mean in the United states you mean in this hemisphere\nOut of the world I mean the world do we have eight\nYeah well we don't give a to the Soviet Union I mean you might say now Russia there are certain countries you know you might say we get paid like the China you might say we give them aid because they take an unfair advantage of\nUs but there are a lot of countries where are we going to have a ... actually the\nActually the Russians are helping us more with the satellites right now than we may be helping them financially but that's not her point your point is it is a good one which is we ought to charge the country's um for their illegals coming here I I kinda like that idea\nYeah even though oh no no it's a it's an idea\nOr the amount of people you\nKnow and as you as you're kind of indicating this and they they love to send us their porn right a lot of especially Mexico right to send us send us the poor and his ... not our problem right now is your problem\nBut I

six nine of seven\nThirty three thirty nine and let's go to Jay in Lansing, Michigan hey you're on with mark\nHow're you doing mark [noise] um I just wanted\nTo say that um maybe these um immigrants that are coming over to the U. S. um might want to be a little bit smarter and think about other places to possibly go that may be easier to get into\n'em if they have farming skills I mean South Africa or they're kicking people out of there and taking their farm so\nAh maybe put together a band of you and\nSome of your uh guys that are I think you have the the Gulf to go over there and maybe protect some of those people get paid some money or or use your farming skills and go over and help out South Africa because uh they're digging themselves into over right now so\nI hear your sarcasm delusion [laughter] ... yeah I I Do hear by the way you bring up a new story I don't know if it a lot of people know about South Africa's expert breeding the land of a lot of the citizens right and that's going to be a real struggling and a lot of them are going to resist right with the force\nAbsolutely absolutely yeah\nWe well it was you know when I recall when we meddle in other countries I don't mean coming to their aid in defense but like we did so you got to be careful what you get\nI have all this talk of makes me think Egypt right we we helped them over and throw a what's his name Mubarak and I asked the time I was doing national radio and I said wait a second that what they called the springs something what was the term anybody out there can tell me I've forgotten or for a second I'm\n... now and Brian was helping me and not their spring there was some something was spring but anyway uh the fact is we got where she got to ask that question what's what's after this so you got rid of Mubarak and you've got the Brotherhood the Muslim Brotherhood which was to radical and certainly not on our side\nAnd then eventually ... took it over there we were saying maybe it was the Arab Spring I may you may be right Brian I think you are now that I think I'm producer Brian so you know I'm mentioning the fact is that you you can't just do this by what we did that in South Africa right you overthrow what you have and then you don't\nAnd I ask what's next is going to be attorney right open the best example might be Iran we were so thrilled with Jimmy Carter to overthrow the shah yeah but they didn't ask well was next\nAre you happy looking back and seeing what you've gotten instead of the shah\nI ... the biggest enemy maybe or at least our enemy that you might say Russia China but certainly there the ... biggest immediate threat in terms of what they're doing to our citizens so it's very important that you not just act emotionally I'm thinking Gadhafi in Libya\nRight Hillary was for that Obama was for that what is your place Libya with weren't didn't they killed Americans right [laughter]\nIn Benghazi is you just can't operate let me get myself in trouble with somebody you now\nIn Saudi Arabia we got a real problem there what they did was horrendous in my opinion needed stone assassinate people like that and go inside and drop 'em up and some people picked on me for that is that it's none of our business but the other side of President Trump's got a huge problem now is\nThey're our biggest supporters in ... you know besides Israeli and trying to work against Iran cause Iran's their threat to\nThis world is very complicated and their offer no easy solutions or maybe you don't notice historically we had a war there was a war or not we between Iran and Iraq\nAnd you know you've got to choose sides sometimes they may both be terrible we worked with the Soviet Union during the more I think about this we work with the Soviet Union during World War two because we had a bigger enemy and Hitler\nSo a lot of left us and liberal say well you work with these people what how do you respond to lead well life is not easy you're faced with difficult choices\nAnd you got to figure out what makes the most sense\nThis stuff is not easy\nAnd that in St Louis illegal immigrants coming in right now it's not it's a tough challenge [noise] let me know what you think

o'clock I'm jumped little the brewers defeated the Dodgers\nSeven to two tonight the forest game seven of the ... the U.S tomorrow afternoon in Milwaukee and tomorrow's winter will face the red Sox and the world series starting on Tuesday no tickets sold in California ... six numbers in tonight's one billion dollar mega millions dry\nSome holes man in there and there are all the absolute and and\nAnd they're starting to show more than ever in the series\nSo that's what I'm saying is like you know those other teams that we you mentioned you were asked shows last year in ... they they were great team or the ... be ... will be no the ... dominated the whole season throughout the eastern conference you know\nDodgers Dodgers bullpen this year\nHas been horrendous throughout the whole entire season we've all known that there was moments in times the Dodgers were in last place in the car I ride a bike up the first place and drop off again in a situation where there are basically balance to get either the uh divisional route or a wild card\nSo one of them were I'm getting at is they have a lot of holes in their in their on their team this year than they would they had last year and so it's been a patch of pat ... now you're getting to the game this upcoming game is a catching up\nAnd no matter how and winning those ... is last week for the victors because that's not going to get it done\nBecause they're just not that if you notice they're just not that type of team man like they're trying to be that type of thing where they can hit home runs I was ... I guess that's what got them there but when you into the playoffs as a whole different mindset a guinea got many games are back to back up for the tomorrow like they have to put this game away\nDon't even think about it and just focus on the next game that's how they have to do this gay and because they don't have their turnaround time in terms of the tea in ... that's a very fast so\nYou know uh they got to I think they have to do it at a different approach tomorrow I'm definitely a need to jump out on the team and not play from behind\nBut you know take innings a winning at a time and hopefully they can win those first three you know the first thing you know after he that's where I Want to be really focus in on a tomorrow and why would I watch them play tomorrow\nI agree I agree or we're going to see well you know just like I said uh you know I expect you to your show to pitch a Gemini did I'm expecting that for Walker fuel or if your pitches a gym and the open holds up the way they happen because they have the pitching very very well in this series I think\nIt's been much more in the evenings\nLike two runs or something they they they pretty much lights up so if you can get that ditching and get the timely hidden like you were say stop go to the boom or bust just get your you know get your get your picture some runs and and let them do their job and you should win\nYeah it's all about taking advantage of the very small opportunities you happen to play it in the postseason but as you go further as you're seeing we see it every year there's only so many opportunities

while and a lot of callers having rooting for that if not a publicly secretly I thank God definitely they want to see a somewhat of a the the east coast powerhouse of a great sports town and and the west coast are awesome great sports town\nKinda go up against each other so we'll see how everything shakes out one of mixing some college football talk how we can continue to talk baseball the one call and once again one eight hundred to two to\nFive to two to mixing in college now though this\nWeek and there's a couple of games on the schedule in the Big Ten right off the bat\nMichigan takes on Michigan State and all of a sudden the Spartans our team that back in the top twenty five and they seem to be playing better football although I'm not convinced how good they are to me the ... the bigger stories Michigan and how they're six and now potentially by\nThe end of this week a nickel maybe move up into the top five the way they've been playing and I look at a lot of people really saw this coming right after the Notre Dame loss of beginning of the season they thought that Michigan could work their way right back into the discussion one of the top teams in the country\nI was not one of those people I just didn't think I didn't see a quarterback I just seem as not had a a good quarterback they can rely on for the past couple of seasons but shape Patterson is really develops insane Keith and I know you've always been Ohio Michigan this year and here they are now with the chance to\nReally ah get a good are ranked opponent victory on their schedule\nYeah I mean you know what I saw them and they play Notre Dame earlier season I looked at the mice and men they can Notre Dame to me is the top five team in in in in in college football and as we know now they're right in the reward um but\nAnd when did you see the thing that initially the fact that they kept to close against Notre Dame\nYes is the fact that they kept a closer gives Notre Dame but also\nThey had chances to win that game and they're competing with the elite team and I knew that you you saw flashes of like a top tier team at ... at some points in ... and the gang and so I knew I said look\nThat team's going to be a tough team to be I think Michigan will be a you know a a great team they're going to compete\nUh and they compete with the talk to you and they can play with the best and that's what they did and that's what they're doing right now I mean they're dominating right now but they also they got enough players on their team or the guy that they they they perform well together so um that's why I knew as soon as\nThey can play with the best but look this is going to be a tough game as a rivalry here in Michigan Michigan State there's gangs and go anyway I think oh you know Michigan\nState drink number ... for um [noise] and it's at Michigan State I Believe in them but I really don't\nThink that matters from Michigan I don't know\nEither at Michigan State such a hard to predict I mean look at the last hours on his state or early in the season I thought they were going to get smoke last week by Penn State they wound up pulling off one of the big upsets of the season so who knows how they're going to come out to ... the only thing we really know about them is they're well coached\nAntonio is proven he's a good college football coach yeah other than that do we really don't know what to expect\nYeah you're absolutely right we really don't know what to expect but I think they can get it done man I think Michigan has been going through a hostile environment and vacant I'm thinking you know put a whim together so I'm I'm goal of Michigan\nThe ACC North Carolina state and Clemson ... it's a game I've been looking forward to for a while now because I I think this is the best chance for anybody in the ACC this year to knock off the tigers I think it would be the NC State team who is undefeated us to a whole bunch of teams undefeated in the top twenty five overall\nAnd out look we're going to find out how good Clemson is an ... Lawrence specifically of course Kelly Bryant the quarterback from a year ago beginning of the season to not start this season but opted to transfer recently he's gone to travel aren't as the guy's been battling a couple of injuries here over the last couple of weeks but\nI Will find out how good he is on the general consensus is that BCC is kind of down this year\nOutside of these two teams which I think there's a lot of truth to that and I look at Clemson is able to ... North Carolina state tomorrow there you can pet swimming in the college football playoff as far as I'm concerned they're not going to lose anyone else the rest of the season or do crews that ACC schedule and double back in the playoffs and this was really an opportunity\nThe in my opinion for someone to knock off clumps and out of that taught for ... because otherwise in my opinion there pencil then and they take up one of those four slots\nBan\nClassic rock favors to go\nLegendary singer ... American San book icon\nPaul like Mali performing all these girls very old sugar ray hands [noise]\nEven make Nancy Wilson of or can you choose your music and ... times you away at the canyon integrated Santa Clarita discipline in Beverly Hills Rosen Pasadena a boom in Ohio and coming soon to Montclair\nKenyan contradictory were completely stupid enchanted with music meets the sole dot com [noise]\n\nAnd\nSaw this guy should there still Eighteen lap four\nAnd watch seven after tomorrow because again Clemson plays North Carolina state\nBut still the point is that it just continues to get more of an argument as to why the college football playoff should be expanded 'cause you've got so many teams right now it's really just crazy about how you're going to have teams more than likely we're going to get left out of the play offs and\nIt just it's a travesty and I can't say that enough because we see in all sports you have an opportunity to at least play\nFor a championship in a playoff type of bracket scenario a college football the only one who doesn't have that right now it's really unbelievable uh but\nObviously a lot of drama stew to play out set coming up tomorrow looking forward to some of those games like I said the Big Ten match up to look forward to is Michigan Michigan State and then the one I just mentioned there in the ACC and the state and Clemson moving on to the NFL now\nA couple of games coming up on top of this week and we want to get into um [noise] let's start first with the rams up in San Francisco to take on the niners and look if you are ram stand right now you're just looking to see this train keep on rolling and why not for what they've been able to do Todd girlie\nAgain he had his critics beginning of the season\nWe may be leading me to write I just did not think that by sending them out the entire pre season in addition to a bunch of the starters\nThat were really a bode well for them going forward but it's worked wonders and here they are right now with the most productive back in football and they had the most well balanced team I think in the NFL in my opinion on both sides and obviously\nThere's a last undefeated team with Kansas City losing last week and uh you just wonder look they're going to lose at some point it's kind of yeah but it's not going to be this week I can say [laughter] forty niners that 'cause I think San Fran kind of had the Superbowl and Monday Night in Green Bay\nAnd they gave everything they had against the Packers came up short obviously but I just don't think they're going to be able to to duplicate that type of performance on CJ bat thirties is not the guy I quarterback who's going to give you that performance weekend and we got to look for the random different I think to really probably dominate on Sunday\nYeah they should dominate a on Sunday or but you know\nI think first goes going to give him a run for their money man I like their quarterback gathered and I think I'm honestly I think he's\nHad a conversation with someone earlier as parents we can and they were debating me on this but I I said that shooting just lose good just to drop below the beginning you know except for a little bit more seasoned however you know he's been the leading a little bit longer but for the most or he looks good man\nAnd um and so I think it's gonna be it's a game for them coming up um but uh I think first go a has an opportunity to get it done and so um I look\nI'm pulling for the rams I think the rails are definitely a great team and they can they're definitely you should wear your favorite to win but I'm just saying among looking parents 'frisco are the first was going to be a tough a tough out for\nLet's go to the chargers over its pub center against Tennessee Titans are such a hard teen to figure out Keith and ... they are when they beat the jaguars earlier in the season to me that was the thing that you're when especially for rape all beginning of his tenure there the first year head coach idol that's exactly what they needed to get on somewhat of a role\nBut they just go up and down up and down\nAnd are the chargers now they're a team who can you would think OK big one over Cleveland I Want to talk about the chargers now they're foreign to they have an opportunity to really maybe start to separate themselves from some team now has a chance to to really go into digger feet in the ground and get a win on Sunday but\nI I don't know who did picking this game because I don't know what to expect from other team you know what I mean yeah I think it could be a total coin flip this game\nThis game is according to I mean look at the division first off I mean there are three\nAnd three huge who's three and three Jacksonville is three and three you know they don't have anyone in the AFC South right\nNow you can't you can't you just don't know you know what teams are going to show up but I'm going to go with the\nConsistent team or are these two teams play in the world I mean on Sunday I think the Los Angeles chargers will get it done for the simple fact that\nLook the defense is not great onto the season the receiver core is is gonna be America's a problem for them um and so I'm going to go ahead and pick the that charge is going to take care of and see\nNew England is in Chicago to take on the bears a lot of talk this week about ... Mac some comparisons I Can't even believe I heard questions posed by the media asking to build dollar check so how does Mac compare to Lawrence Taylor what\nYeah they're really Lawrence Taylor ... he's the greatest defensive player in the history of football or we'll have ... I Would be insulted looks like he's one of the best players in league right now I'm like well he's no large Taylor no\nNo he's not in the last thing that was hilarious and there's no way no way that he's\nBetter than a Lawrence Taylor or even compared you're\nDriving in the same category as emergency or Riley lots of that matter\nThat fair as well yeah you know way and no way at all but um regardless he's playing a good level right now and despair defense um the team overall they ... out and they could arguably be undefeated they really could if not for the heroics of Rodgers and opening night and for Miami somehow finding a way to win last week with\n... filling in for tannahill they could be undefeated I'm so they're playing well defensively forbid skinny often seems like you're a star\n... says slowly but surely get some kind of rhythm going there um but I just don't know if it's going to be enough right now because of the emergence of the re emergence of adult men and the patriots off and what do you can do for them off and simply it's really hard to slow\nDown at this point man that often says is pope man for the New England patriots just call it what it is\nYou know they're going to get better and better each week\nA ... nursing an injury early on do right now\nUm but it's all about luck Josh Gore And Julian Edelman in in Tom Brady man in when James why those guys they step up at the right time um I Will we would like to see their deepest gets a little better you know because they're keeping a lot of people in games but\nFor the most part man this is going to be you should be a cakewalk\nFor them they definitely have to use uh they're they're running back like that\nJames why incentive to go ahead and in in ...\nUm and help out a help\nOut there in with a clue Mac because he definitely going to try and get to the quarterback and he did it get in there\nSo uh I think that's really going to be the toughest task but for the most part they should dominate\nCarolina is in Philadelphia this is a game that uh the eagles play usually really well at home and and the Panthers had been also one of those teams to trying to find themselves early in his twenty Eighteen season\nCam Newton I think we're all waiting for him that kind of get back to what he was as far as a not a dominating quarterback both on the ground and also through the air maybe it's a week for him to kind of re establish that\nYes yeah it is I think he I think a real established that I'm I'm definitely gonna say that look Carolina is going to be a tough game that's gonna be a tough game and I don't care what did you say ... Caroline is going to be a a really tough game against Philadelphia and I'm expecting Caroline and when that\nQuickly the Monday Night game the giants in Atlanta to take on the falcons or the giants gonna start one sex\n[laughter]\nYeah yeah yeah Atlanta's not very good but at least during the dome right yes at least ... man ... Jones baby hey Austin week by everyone here at behind the Mike we're back at it next week better than ever for Keith I'm Brad keep living the dream will talk to you next time\n\nFurnished by Sally is media [noise]\n[noise]\nLos Angeles orange\nMueller station\nSaudi journalist Jeff and L.

memory getting together and and I teach government among other things\nSo I wasn't on that side I just I mean we we do have a continent by the way it's not called America's called North America I don't mean to be picky there but uh that's what Kennedy's and that's what makes you is we're on the ...\nSouth America as part of a greater America [laughter]\nI don't I don't know I don't see that one I don't buy from you I I think to the I\nLove the term America America the beautiful is a great song um and so that's all but of course you're absolutely right we came together as a of a people of states and we didn't want a strong federal government\nAnd the founders were very much opposed to them and that's what made us part of the reason we're so special you were very articulate you were very good so I I don't want you on the\nBack of my first time but I I I really I\nI really think that if I really think that if we understood more of the concept of looking at is at us as a

concepts that we as conservatives as as constitutional is again whatever label you want to use are trying to get people to understand them further\nNo absolutely I agree with everything you're saying

while ago is talking about a century city in century state and about the people voting for them\nAnd I just wanted to say I I live here where we can vote on that\nCertainly not governor brand name and the whole state of sanctuary state which I don't I don't know how many of the city's pay attention to them I Know some of them have actually voted against a following his directions but I don't recall ever hearing any load about sanctuary cities out here and\nYou know the ones that I think as we\nKnow there wasn't so they were on it it's just that the Democrats in office a very liberal\nExtremely leftist a Democrat is in office and he just decided that's a good idea does it and I from what I understand San Francisco's kind of a dump now just partly\nWhat it is\nWhen I was there a few months ago and I'm using it was amazing when I was walking the streets with\nMy kids are so many other just now look at this hand this hand as a weapon\nAnd then another time something ... someone says something about a night that doesn't count how dirty it is now I didn't see this but they were needles all over certain sections I think they said market street and of course the problem with the trash and the and the homelessness is a problem but that's true yes you know everywhere in California right\nYes uh-huh but I think uh\nI I live in San Francisco in a long time I don't really go up there that much I mean it's quite far from San Diego and I've I've just never been into their way of thinking so\nUm yeah but it's it's it's ... it's the only thing we vote on and I wanted to ask you one other thing I didn't mention is to fellow I spoke with first but but you have you heard the thing about the the um birth tourism\nIt it was on earth I mentioned this just mentioned is just a few people and they have not heard of it and it actually was on television some some time ago on twenty twenty or dateline or one of those where\nThey fly on these Chinese women that are pregnant uh-huh and they and they have a place all set up and they go there and they have the babies get their little American citizenship for the baby and leave\nAnd then leave yeah no I actually I did hear that pregnant women going into hospitals yep they've gotta figure to look people will take advantage of the weaknesses in anything right especially your loss horse we of course we call that anchor babies right to so they come here and they have a baby in there and they\nHave all the right that is wrong and of course is wrong and an awful\nLot of people have not heard about that because I've I've told that you either keep politicians here and they well I mean there are people that work for them and they hadn't heard of that so I'm I'm Glad to get to say it on national radio so people can know what's going on it's we're very close to the border here so it's I mean people come over here and dumped the baby's all the time I say dumped them I mean they have them\nAnd I and I just I don't think it's right I don't think a lot of the country and the other countries in the world do that\n... somebody had a ... in Italy I said to the baby have dual citizenship and they said no that he was born in an air force us air force base so I don't know why we're handing out citizenship like like candy you know it's it's it's a paradigm\nThey're actually says yeah glad\nThe actual do Sylvia there was a reason for it which is a there with the with the slavery issue we want to make sure that they weren't taking advantage of it any way but of course if you pass a law every every law by the way there's a phrase I've heard was a one time a solution every problem was the one time a solution to something else\nSo you you mean well and you pass something and then people figure out how to take advantage oh I Would do the same thing when I Lived in Asia and the thing I could get my kids have American citizenship if they're just born here well I'm going to time my trip so that I have the baby yeah of course they could go wrong if the baby's late I guess very late\nWhat did they figure out how to take advantage of you are dumb laws\nThat that happens a lot let's go to a\nJeremiah Wright

being having a human experiences were so much more than our experiences\nAnd for me personally I hit bottom so many times has so many tragedies and challenges happened that I really started as opposed to wanting to take myself out are becoming an alcoholic or whatever I decided to you know pursue a spiritual path because I knew there was something greater within me\nUm and I was here for a greater

just saw him with\nThe beautiful co host of the minds of recent show Lisa Winston about her upcoming events in Austin, Texas\nOn the stage and now we're going to speak with the Robert not that he's not a beautiful host as well or we're going to talk about imagination Robert do you have a a a thought on imagination porous\nI Do I'm imagining your possibilities if it ... your tree\nAnd when you remove all of your limitations that she'd been posed upon yourself you're free to become everything you are and everything that you're meant to be and I really was thinking about how powerful the imagination is because it really create\nAnything be anywhere and become whatever you're supposed to be and this is Matt imagination and when you're using your mind that way you're creating and you can really create what you're meant to be where you're about to go what you're meant to do\nI remember as a kid you know watching Superman and then having a dream about flying and then at some point ... realizing that\nPeople can't fly at least in the physical world\nBut we can fly in our imaginary world and create what we want it in my far off on that\nYeah I mean there was a great documentary recently on a Steven Spielberg and it was talking about um really how the creative things and when it changed when they got a CGI when they got computer graphics\nThey're able to really do things and create\nWhat spending his mind what he wanted to Iraq with the yeah the creativity one out ten noxious because they can literally now have everything at their fingertips whatever they want they can put dinosaurs Jurassic Park and have them interact with the with the actors\nAnd they can actually create the actors so on and some of the ... Star Wars where you know Peter Cushing passed away years ago and yet he's in the movie right it's only going to improve in that way but that again is is through the imagination of people creating\nUm their own reality and really when you apply that to your own life you can create your own reality in that way too\nI Would imagine then that imagine then that it would also work in reverse in other words whom I got my life is in the in the in the toilet\nYeah and that's an important distinction because a few few yourself as glass you will become what you imagine your mind controls everything else including how your outlook um just in general the chemicals that are released in your brain\nAre based on on your own thoughts and how that all work I mean obviously there's physical components but you can control some of those components just by\nHaving a positive thought imagining things in a better way\nA few weeks ago I think you and I talked to and we were talking about you know somebody wants to be an athlete and you know they're not physically gifted or they're not home enough to be on a basketball team\nBut they could still participate they can be in the marketing and that basketball team that can be a broadcaster for the team or Eighteen or there's so many different ways of being ex brushing your love of sport and using your imagination to achieve that we talked\nAbout it and somebody had you know there was like that wall that no one could break you know the the mile in under X number minutes or whatever it was and now it if you can't do that you're not even close to being on the Olympic team or anything but\nFor years people had this imaginary well that was it\nDo most people put up a wall against life to protect themselves it's\nSomething that you know I I don't think that you have per se a wall against flight it's just that you hack protective area and in and sometimes that can become a barrier\nUm I just go beyond that and your imagination can run away with you and that's the other danger so you want to make sure that you keep things and check it that you're not imagining\nHorrible things happening but there's actually less than\nA a you we mentioned thought and I've talked to a number of people and maybe even knew and I talk about this I don't know I thought your things there there's solid\n\nYeah you can create your own reality it's it's a you know the word I'm Dr phil Hi Talia is great stuff on on on how to use the secret and in that it's manifesting and he has accelerated math stations and in the sense of\nImagined that you already have it and what that feels like bring that into yourself and when you do that\nYou are creating your own reality but in essence it if you believe in a matter of physical part you're putting that out in the universe to and you're you're showing universe what you want and isn't that goal setting that as gold because if you can imagine yourself or do you there\nAnd sitting in that seat and doing whatever it is let's say you want to John talk show or you want it to be a pilot you imagine yourself in the plane flying the plane you're actually going to get your pilot license and you're eventually going to be in that plane\nAnd sitting there and I've had to do that a few times where I'm On pinching myself because I'm like I Am actually in that moment that I imagine myself being it and that's the beauty of it\nIn the secret there's a a a guy and he's on a green screen\nAnd the voice over as saying imagine yourself in a sports car you remember that scene and he builds sports car all around him okay and he's in and then they go to a live shots of him driving\nIn that sports car of his dreams thoughts are real bunch\nAre are powerful connections how can we use clutch to maintain health\n[noise] yeah and that that's what I was talking about are alluding to earlier that when you have a positive outcome in there and be able to drive you forward and it is something that can create healing energy\nAround you that you know I I saw it firsthand with\nMy mother and I know I've talked about this before when she was diagnosed with cancer\nIt was literally taking a toll on her help and her life not just from the cancer from her own thoughts about it and then the silver lining she she had been diagnosed with dementia and lost their short term memory well guess what was diagnosed than their short term memory was her cancer and she didn't realize\nShe had it anymore and the reason a blessing or she was just smiling\nThat I feel great and had no we didn't tell her like even if you did it would be gone because it was short term and the long term memory had no recollection of cancer and see what it's for two years beyond what the prediction was that her lifespan should have ...\n... is it just goes to show you that the power of the of the brain right yeah\nAnd and I think people our age and yes I'm including you in our age a robbery or is it you know I one of our fears is waking up and sing who am I I'm not Robert I I don't know who I Am\nThings like Disneyland to Disney World and\nAll the movies and all the all the stuff I mean there's a new movie ... the nutcracker I think\nIs coming out and yeah right and the trailers look amazing I mean that's\nWhat I said with the computer graphics now they can really create and put on film what's in their mind and they've gone back and fix some of the older movies you know whether there seems that they could do originally that we're supposed to be in the movie they just couldn't conceive of how to do it so it got cut and\nNow they're able to put things back cannery master them re release\nYou know I'm Still a purist I like the rich self um yeah I Do to\nSome of the some of the thoughts of 'em yeah especially like in the star wars or Star Wars I think it was ... three they add 'em in the new hope um they brought in that scene with Hans solo outside of the cantina that never made it in the first movie [laughter]\nWell the and ... but even watching things like beauty and the beast which I watch not too long ago um is even though it's not three D. their imagination is taking this story and brought it to life\nAnd and so taking your imagination you can bring your imagination to life is what you're saying\nYeah and when I was talking about the young men and the previous segment I'm you know about the barriers and overcoming that well you know we had to walk about four city blocks to volunteer and I looked at you know his group and it was the one nominated it go and I asked this bad I said they are\nAble to to to make this journey and he said it might be a little slower um but we'll get there and and the group of kids all circled around and said that the time on the low and stitch came out\nIn the middle hotter no one gets left behind and they made it to this um this elderly home\nAnd he volunteered and gave out cards that they made and all these things but how inspiring yeah that that you know with a serious health issues that he had he still ... and knew what he was here for him and he's a path I mean he's crossed over\nUm he was young and the other person on the planet that has introduced Derek Jeter at a Yankee game\n[laughter] wow\nYeah like the official announcer got it got it was at home but it's amazing it really is\nA ... why do people not use their imagination do you think\nAre we taught and are we talking or what what hold you back from from doing that it's more that you got to release more of it every you know you have an imagination there it's how you utilize it harness it and then you have to exercise or just like\nAnything and the more that you do the more that you can create a more of that you can conceive of the more you can use your wise for yourself for your family for your company for your office for whatever you're doing that's really the key and the goal\nYou know when you were you know I should say that Robert ... is a techno geek okay and where the capital G.\nThat's what he does during the day and using your imagination and technology just like the imagine ears at Disneyland you can create so\nWhere did anything that is a limitation so I'm constantly wanting to learn it's like you just take on life like a sponge\nAnd applying that and how you you know you can use that same enthusiasm for whatever you're doing

I'll tell you a quick story I'm Out walking around my house and my uh kids friends best friends or one of her best friend's father\nI thought it was just going to say a lot of he runs after me I'm just taking my walk\nAnd he says I saw you on radio and you you guys are crazy and he I thought I was going to hit me one point I'm just trying to do my walk and he'd never done this before but it the anger was so strong\nAh yeah I Know you're you know what you you and the Fox and the rest of those people thinking on their you know you're a radio guy and all this ... he was so angry me yet we ... civil discussions you know at the end of the parties that he put on his house or whatever and the kids were best friends you know it was amazing it was I I really thought he was going to get violent\nIt it's it's gotten really bad so I I don't look forward to seeing you saying asking them to be civil I we've pass those days we've really pass those are\nPretty pretty discouraging aim we I'll speak for myself I Know people who think like I on my side we think they're misguided and if they got the wrong ideas and they think ... one of the other things I threw out\nWas they have such hatred for President Trump and they have no idea that a lot of us have been President Obama at the same way but there was no resistance we just waited patiently until his term was up I Want them to become the first time I thought he was a disaster maybe the worst president in our history\nWhile we wait until it happened and we did everything politically we could\nAnd they picked on us because ... a Senator McConnell said Mitch McConnell said you know you want to do when we can to get rid of my forget how we phrased that that's about the most we saying\nThese guys this whole are saying you know I don't agree with Michelle Obama when they go low we we kick him or whatever they he said I Can't remember the other on your rights saying we're not going to be civil until we get back in power\nWell that makes sense in her case because you can never take not being in power right there for sale anyway the fun this this is not good\nA man hang in there the okay I have a gym you live in Portland I'm just looking at it again your mayor doesn't even want to please do anything right\n... ... yeah if I recall that real close but that's my understanding it or or if he would uh I I thought I heard one anecdote most of my news I I don't read the newspaper so much I get it on the radio and word of mouth and it's like a a thought the uh the uh ...\nRecording ... one word of mouth straight they were the victims are not a lot of people trying to do their daily lives you know what I'm thinking what's what hit you know I mean it's a it's it's appalling it you know to frankly I'm a little ashamed of I'm not having the guts\nTo uh uh you know a ... not having the guts to ah ah have everybody obey the same laws\nNo ... ... you're such a nice guy I don't want to disagree but it's not a matter of cuts that's what he believes he's a leftist he believes are probably supports in ... and that's it's not 'cause he doesn't have courage and that's who he is probably probably supports them and it's worse than you say it's worse than you think\nYou know he campaigned on a different uh you know with the different personality or different persona that the it's like what we got is what we're calling us\nWell that's always the case I said the left doesn't want to admit that they want to impeach the president is going to be chaos in this country if they'd retake the house they don't want to tell you when it's time to raise taxes that they want to raise taxes I rushed it but Michael Dukakis if you remember\nHis campaign was destroyed when he announced that he was in favor of higher tax actually I think it was Monday I don't he had a problem with that tank but Mondale announced against Reagan that he's for higher taxes with kiss of death but they're so they don't want to do that they're learning the lesson\nYou don't tell who you really are if you're on the left\nBecause they know most of the American people would never support them\nJim I appreciate your call very

to asylum because they're in independent countries in ... out\nOf their\nUm desperate situation as far as yeah it might it it it becomes an economic situation at that point but if they want to seek asylum they should be seeking it in in Mexico and then going through our embassy\nTo get proper immigration to the United states\nYeah but you know and I know that Mexico is not going to give them anything\nThat's that's relevant\nAll relative to the fact that they're in that country and they the proper way for the empty immigrate to the United states would be good for him to see and apply for

that country not ours\n... that's a pretty good take I I like that it's an interesting take it's not going to work there was going to ignore that idea but you're right they left the country so they

president Americans for tax reform and if you have any questions about the tax code or anything related to that age six six Ninety red eye\nAnd I have a question for him and uh you know I think you have a feeling it's going to know my friend my friend is Bruce ... years ago even before you rent for the Senate he proposed that we should do our taxes we should be able to do it on a postcard and yeah I think you find them of course English was flat tax\nHow do you feel about that just one flat tax and you do it on a postcard\nWell before\nI moved to the United states I Lived in Massachusetts and that's where I grew up we have in Massachusetts a flat rate income tax but five and a quarter percent\nUh it's in the constitution a number of states have flat rate Illinois that's a nice state has a flat ribs Iraq\nAnd uh what we find is if you are at a flat rate people think it's fair and they don't want to move away from it I I was always told as a kid everybody agrees whichever progressive graduated income tax\nPeople pay ten percent of the two percent you know state taxes a federal taxes you know go for Fifteen to\nAlmost forty percent or if you tax everyone at the same way it keeps the tax rate low for everybody in Massachusetts five times the Democrats liberals have said let's go to a graduated tax and\nYou know divide people into five or ten groups in touch with different lights and there's a very sophisticated discussion that went on on TALK radio because it was a ... year one they'll raise taxes on the candidate gets\nNearer to the outcome for me at the Kennedy kids without your on your own soccer because I've already had my rights\nRaised and now it's your turn and they would overtime McGee is one of the time and everyone's rights would end up higher and I think that\nIs exactly what has happened in in American history and other countries show the best way to keep taxes low step one single rate spot and then when the government says I've got a great idea and you're all going to pay for it\nAnd people said you know what now were all listening tell us about this great idea where he's both a Obama President Obama and President Clinton got elected promising I Will never raise your taxes now I'm only going to raise taxes on down the top one to two percent said a\nBunch of one percent said Obama of course within the first year they raise gasoline taxes on everyone [noise] uh so the promises that somebody else is going to pay the taxes doesn't really last show the safest thing to do is to have a single rate to Texas people one time that one right\nIt is the toughest tax to raise [noise]\nI was thinking of another one of his ideas he ... he said that if this idea that they take it out slowly prevents revolution someone how to write a check for five thousand dollars at the end of the year or whatever it is I really knew what they are paying you to be an up or do you agree with that assessment\nI not only agree with that I wrote that in the paper in my freshman year at Harvard and they like foreign to me that they said you know this does come from a conversation I had with the IRS I called my phone\nAnd said if they did if you didn't withhold taxes out of their paycheck every two\nWeeks but instead once a month we said send the check like the electric bill and Fonda or on April fifteenth said send the check the whole year and the ... is the IRS person I was talking to I interviewed for the the paper ours right he\nSaid there'd be a revolution it's\nA you know there were I think if someone had to write you know check my little one ten twenty whatever there would be you'd have a new Tea Party right or any of these days with\nVery yeah\nIt make it clear that he's like hey yeah let's go I promised a car to
