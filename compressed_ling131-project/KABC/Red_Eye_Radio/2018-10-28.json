can be heated in the microwave towel should be hot yet tolerable for children so you want it as hot as possible where it doesn't burn the skin but very hot places small section selling the child first

so you know one getting chilled or things like that after five minutes you remove the hot towels replace with uh the single thickness of a thing\nOh there's been run or the cold water and then run out what\nMy wife does she kind of likes torturing me she actually puts him in the freezer\nAnd so I'll tell you after you do the hotels five minutes and then you ...\nIt's kind of like oh my gosh it's really by what it does is it causes your limb in your body to circulate effectively and it's very effective so then you do you do the cold towel for ten minutes so then uh so again you put some other

funny and I'll send you something funny and I said you know what what do you think about that this was a tweet that kind of sets the Internet on fire [noise] as her name is Alyssa Alyssa and I I don't want to miss quote her\nBecause there are some lakes in there that I don't want them to be missed adds context or maybe it's just the Generation Z and me but how do people burn CDs like how do you get a blank CD and just put songs\nOn it and the Internet went crazy like how did that ever where did the blank CDs come from first of all I'm very impressed that she tweeted the lake she didn't take it out she put like like how do you do like\nSo that she is a a generation Z or which they were born from the mid nineties to them in two thousand Ninety seven is the the starting point for crow is it what is it is a two thousand five two thousand seven then ah and tell where an end to thousands OK rise\nSo generated millennials or eighty one in Ninety six set and the millennials were the ones that were responding to this thing in mind that old then generation already has moved past\nAll of my technology when one person responded with a tree ...

it may it got me thinking about other things that millennials and\nGuaranteed generations ears are not going to understand or ever use correct one of the first things that I think would be is is interesting and my son is experiencing this right now\nIs television commercials my son watches everything on YouTube right he doesn't know what cable television is it's all YouTube but then we hook up the antenna and we're going to watch Sunday Night Football and he goes to a commercial and he's like what's going on here which is ...\nCan we pass for this you know what that's the problem\nI mean I mean you 'cause you're you're absolutely right because in in you know where he has never really had that\nThe a commercial or if he does see a commercial that only Fifteen seconds yes there is what I have many cars there is a skipped right once he watches five seconds of it right\nI'm referring to when I was at my sister's on this past week and I was watching TV my mom I'm like and I'm sitting there on\nHow do you fast forward [laughter] when she's my father's which she goes they don't have that here they don't have a WPN and you can skip the commercial I'm like oh my gosh how are they living what is going on\nBut stay with us it was just a convenience that's nice let's let's let's DVR something and skip the commercials for the younger generations it's a given\nAnother thing I don't understand about my son is she'll say I want to watch a movie and you'll run and get his eye that we have a sixty five inch television in our living I'm not bragging it's huge he doesn't want to watch it he wants to in his lap and his hand on a small little life path\nSo interesting to me and you know what\nThough that it is fascinating and and as he gets older you'll see different technologies and how they're using it versus how you might use\nI'm a bigger I'm going to have a huge TV and I see those eighty five inches but they have a ... from drew in over\nThe now in generation okay they're they're not really watching YouTube anymore or do you do yeah uh how are they getting their entertainment that videos on Instagram Snapchat\nBut you're not going to find out what was your program there\nAre they you know what they he watch all those friends are watching some boxing match on YouTube okay so if it's an event do go to YouTube yes\nBut if it's you know no longer they sharing viral videos and I think we talked about this for like each channel having its own app and so with my ... my my ... my inlaws have cable so they'd given my son their password so he can look at the Disney

thanks for the call and enjoy the rest of the early on I was going to do that how far thank you Amy All right\nThank you Dave Shapiro and by the way let me uh would they've David ... who's an advocate for men with family law but he said something fascinating the green room ... would you share with us that the women that you represent\nSure you know primarily are marketing is facing men because of the way they they approached family law and they're under served as a as a market but frequently we have women that come to us who are the primary breadwinners\nAnd dads are usually the stay at home dad so the women are coming to me saying I'm the man in the relationship I Need help wild to protect me and take care of me and asked them and the women and usually I represent that's amazing that's been an interesting development over the last probably Fifteen Years the way society has changed\nSo a woman how\nOkay let's let's we're going to back all the way up but how does a woman finds you you know you're a men's advocate\n[noise] oh really how really he's hell if they start looking for things like how do I not pay child support ... lower my spouse will support I learned that when they find my whether they all had I knew I knew\nRight you're the guy that's real estimate and ... and David Shapiro handles all types of a well trust litigation which shows us I mean we live in a very litigious world\nAnd the fact that that is your focus and specialty they've Shapiro please expand a little bit on your practice\nSo my practice is trust in the state litigation so you've got will contest trust contests you have ... for ah determine\nUm your tissues determine in interest to in the state like a beneficial interest in the state or a trust and you have breach of do share duties and it used to be that that was a small area practice\nBut in the last\nTwenty five thirty years they had to use\nTrust meals that produce a luminous amount of trust and everyone started having trust and as time goes on you have litigation over that and some of the claims are a frivolous but majority of these claims there's usually some kind of grounds to bring it uh and you know with the epidemic\nAn elder abuse going on oh my goodness yeah it's a amazing how people get taken advantage of it as they get older and you have maybe a um a gardener or a a a\nSome kind of caregiver steps in and takes mom and dad to a an estate planner or even you know a document prepare\nOr or even tried to do with themselves and they just they make a mess of things and it's you know it turns out to be a really awful situation with the whole family wow amazing ah\nBut again it's fascinating and you know you mentioned elder abuse\nAnd that's why people now all of a sudden many attorneys like yourself are really focusing on an elder abuse my mother was not physically and she wasn't taken for any money\nBut I Would come in some time on announced that a key to her place of course and the gal was not particularly nice to my mom has very upsetting now cannot be well who you're going to who ... who do you sue anyway if you have like\nYou know ... um well not poverty stricken but you have a poor person many times that as a caregiver\nNow well it sounds like it could also be negligence um I guess the question is who is the caregiver with a if she's with an agency or if she's with the hospital or she's with us facility right uh that's out much outside of what I don't know really handle\nMaybe I have young people today Lindsey Missouri please October as domestic violence awareness month an elder beast is part of that whole domestic violence awareness\nAnd one of the big factors that we run into when we're dealing with the elder abuse is this sort of caregiver who is abusing or negligent in some cases with the with the uh the patient and the way in which we deal with that is there's actually restraining orders\nThat separate the caregiver uh-huh from the patient and that's a fairly easy process you can go down to the courthouse and fill out the forms where you can hire an attorney to\nHelp you with that those cases can get really litigious\nBut they're really important when you've got somebody who is\nNot as capable as they used to be and then there's a real uh abuse going on and manipulation that's happening\nYou know that's interesting David you bring that up because a lot of times what ends up happening is that the elder doesn't even realize they're being abused and they believe this caregiver who is treating them\nAwful just really taken advantage of them

suggests the re siblings three sisters Jane is that what do you have\nOkay Dave I Would like\nTo ask your question legal to expedite this and how do I go out\nAnd your sister the executor\nOkay so it sounds to me you've got a trust each got a trustee that is reaching her producer duties from what I hear or not or putting a property for sale I don't know if she's living in the property or if she's just not up to us selling the property but uh what you need it went to do perhaps is to\nEncourage her first by you know or maybe a letter from the attorney telling them telling your sister about what your rights are as a beneficiary and if that letter doesn't seem to work sometimes you might have to go to court and bring a claim for ... reduce your duty and seek to remove your sister as trust\nSo ... can you hear me write this down or it's easy to remember\nDavid Shapiro log dot com S.

I Can't help you it's just an ethical for me to continue to take money from you because you don't have any real\nCause here for what you're asking for and the situation I often get out of the guys that say I want fifty percent custody of my child okay that's great happy to do it for you problem is you live in riverside moms and long being that's not going to work\nYear being unreasonable you need to take a look at what's really happening here so so I have to have come to Jesus call with them and try and bring them back to a sense of reality okay that's one of the biggest things we do is family law attorneys it bring people back to a sense of reality and say\nGo process your emotions with a therapist there are a lot cheaper than we are yeah does it five hundred bucks an hour you don't want to be talking about their problems\nYou know what I've used attorneys in business situations and it's hard to to remember your you know this is our attorney's work there's no attorneys make a living they charge you know usually an hourly rate so\nAnd I let me ask David Shapiro's well and they've served as well\n... your clients many times want you to be their shrink\nWell all all the time totally all the time they cry on your shoulder\nInterests in their defense yeah oh you're going through a difficult time of day and I do do my best to listen to their problems and find out what's really going on sometimes uh they just need to they need to express what's going on and when they know that their attorney understand what's bothering them in with a with the emotional\nA man how\nSubstantial the issue is uh sometimes the clients is just overwhelmed and they just want to express their ... attorney just how overwhelming this whole situation is for them and generally when you listen to them on it's able they're able to move forward yeah\nAnd I don't know if their practice but in my practice I hear all most all the dirty laundry they come into your hand you know I I Am one of those like really easy people to talk to him before I Know it they're crying and they're telling me their stories and their ... and all of their weird things that they don't share with anybody their best friend doesn't know\nI Know I Know what their lifestyle and all that good stuff and that's a really important service for them because they're burdening themselves through this very emotional process I have a divorce\nYou know and they and they need comfort and\nThat's not really your job but it becomes your job and it might be a hero said yeah it actually is hard of my job because once I can get them to vent their emotion then I can get them back to a sense of reality what's really going nice okay got it\nOkay we were we only have two minutes left this is the part of the show where we have some fun I don't usually do this but we should pure they've bizarre I think it's going to work out OK Our question\nFor each of you gentlemen um what is the most ... what's the best advice you've ever been given David Shapiro first please\nBest advice okay are you thinking about what kind of got about us one David facade best advice oh I've got a ... and I I have a pie and and I log off every time how ... how do you find your if I meant family all our podcast on iTunes and we've got videos on YouTube also under men's family law\nBut my tagline is this ... hold on men's family law dot com get that down okay please I always end with this and remember guys a cheeseburger at a chocolate shake\nWill get you to just about everything [laughter] I Love it [laughter] okay and uh Dave superior any thoughts\nYou know I guess the one thing that I've been told the most important thing is actually listen to people and find out what they have to say uh but uh I Would say that um yeah I Would say that's probably the okay I'm Sorry\nI Can't believe that this hour has little literally flown by and let me go let me just say the stay with the sorrow he's a men's family law advocate he does take on women clients as well and he is very simply men's family\nLost dot com men's family law dot com and David Shapiro trust litigator David Shapiro log dot com David Shapiro law dot com S.

facing charges following\nA shooting rampage of that's going to God that left ... dead and six wounded correspond a jury boat lateral Port Authority they're trying to find out all they can about this us back\nNow the costs associated with the purchase a pharmaceutical drugs continues to rise everybody knows that and many people are going bankrupt as a result of people cannot afford necessary and important pharmaceutical drugs they need\nAnd it is one of the major rises in bankruptcy as relates to people having\nTo deal with the costs associated with their health and our government is even trying to rein in the escalating\nCost of drugs because you find the same drugs in\nOther countries they don't it don't cost as much there are a lot less money\nAnd there's been resistance in the area of bringing generic drugs the marketplace\n[noise] excuse me\nSo why is this why is it that we\nTo endure those who need pharmaceutical drugs to endure the price gouging the seemingly goes on here in America\nAnd you asked the pharmaceutical companies because they've been asked why is it that you charge so much and they immediately point the finger at rising costs in pharmaceuticals related to the high cost of research and development\nAnd if you look into that if you delve into that you find out that is just absolutely a ball face why it's not true\nThe primary cos driving escalating fees with pharmaceutical drugs\nTo a lesser extent is related to research and development to a greater risk that stance and in large part it's mostly related to the advertising of these drugs\nThat's where the costs are those costs are being passed on to use a consumer so if you if you believe the big pharmaceutical lie that's dished out you may have already suffered brain damage from water more of their toxic products\nAnd so and you don't how President Trump has\nTo decrease the costs of pharmaceutical drugs and I believe he absolutely means it however are the statistics do not bear out that it's working\nYet but we'll see how that pans out in any of it if you believe\nOr thought that you are seeing more drug commercials over the last few years you would be right it's at nausea him\nAnd do we as a nation show any\nImprovement in health as a result of it in other words more drugs equates to better health no it's just\nThe opposite of that more drugs\nAnd we continue to statistically be the laughing stock of the world looking at mortality and morbidity rates and the uh it's just it's just a mess so this is the call to action the take away has to do with what can you do\nAnd what part of it is your responsibility and taking charge of your health and doing the things that we all know we should do more of and if we do this consequences of that lack of action\nThat Malaysia that we think that okay well we can be sort of like at Christmas when you were a child we can be bad boys and bad girls but Santa Claus will still be there in the end to take care of us even if we\nUh do things we shouldn't do\nAnd in the case of health care\nWe think okay so I don't need to exercise I don't need to be well I can smoke cigarettes I can do all these are unhealthy lifestyle and my doctor will take care of me once I break down that sort of the belief system we have and when it comes to chronic diseases\nA that's a big role of the dice and it's always going to come up you lose in the end\nSo

use in just a little bit but I Want to have you talked to the audience about touch points how it reduces stress and how it works\n[noise] yeah so what I was treating\nPTA the I realized it we should be able to prevent this\nI'm like a vaccine you have to inject people with things so that their immunity can build up over them but I don't need to inject anybody with stress people are going in and out of state the stress all the time what we need to do is restore the body's natural natural\nBalance after ...\nEr during a stressful situation and bring them out of it as quickly as possible and there's a network in the brain that if you add a gentle vibration\nThat are not invasive and the touch points it will make a different decision about strength that actually divert the stress response and it does so very quickly so we're getting about Seventy percent reduction and stress and about thirty seconds and this is very important for people not only who want to feel calmer\nBut in performance situation we just did a study in athletes in Brazil and found that they were able to stay in there during a performance and their cortisone levels\nOr actually a lot lower when they were receiving touch points versus a placebo that is very exciting research that we're going to be publishing soon but that's really important for people\nWho want to not burn themselves out when they're performing at work or if they're athletes or even if they're going about their day if we're stabilizing cortisol the body is not an inflamed state and people can be healthier and better\nI remember ah when going through both psychiatry and psychology in college\nHow you're really bringing up old stuff that uh I I recall and it reminds me of that you know the components that some people in a stressful situation will either run and get away from it and others will just drop envy consume\nSome people would do a radio show like this and they you know they faint or their blood pressure will go through the roof and other people would\nLook forward to it they've sort of condition themselves so it's all about our response distress were not taught how to deal with that or growing up we just overreact to it mostly and then wonder how to get out of it\nAnd a lot of people that just sharing let's face it use everything from alcohol to cigarettes to marijuana illicit listen drugs to de stress or on the line\nSo described to the audience looking after the device the touch points device what it looks like and what they would expect should they attempt to reduce their stress by Seventy percent and who wouldn't want that in thirty seconds everybody has stress", "show_name": "Red Eye Radio", "station": "KABC", "day": "28", "state": "CA", "year": "2018", "month": "10", "city": "Los
