evidence I was looking for a a way to interest students in the subject matter without just talking about principles or appellate court cases are looking for a way to have a variety of materials that we can talk about in the classroom\nBecause I think whatever you do you get bored if you keep doing the same thing every day so I I started looking for\nA clips from courtroom movies uh that we can analyze a with the students just as though they were actual lawyers doing actual things because you know I Believe it or not Tom sometimes\nOr judges in actual cases don't make the correct decision sometimes lawyers asking proper questions witnesses given proper answers so regardless of the truth of the uh\nTestimony depicted in a clip or the students they'll have to think about what what would you do with that actually happened in a courtroom and your lawyer involved in that case\nYou know I'm going to tell you something I did a little research on you not only from your legal background and you're teaching background in your movie background but um I have a couple of plants over there at that school ah\nAnd I asked them what do you think of the professor is one young woman said to me this is a true story is the only clash you'd never skip\nOut that fall or I'd like to hear that I've ever FX why is it that a nice thing to say it is lovely to hear I you know I think\nThat as a law school a teacher it it goes back to what you were talking about time a for a courtroom lawyer or maybe just about anyone if you\nYou have to demonstrate passion and I always feel that if I don't demonstrate why I'm interested in what we're talking about in class why should the students be interested in it so I Try to teach in a way that suggests my passion and interest in the subject matter\nYou remind me a lot of demand McClintock a partner and our from\nWho's the only artistic person in the firm or without a doubt at least the only artistic lawyer Amanda professor at the movie ...\nOh I think they do quite a bit I think for most people\nMost of what they know about the law lawyers the legal system or comes from movies and TV shows uh you know not long ago it was a you've heard of the television judge judge Judy or the California\nJudicial commission gets more complaints about judge Judy than any actual judge people watch that on television and I think that she's an actual judge and are are they object to her rulings are manner or so yes I think people say you know when a judge or a lawyer and a movie or TV show says\nThis is a rule I think uh people uh accept that as that must be the ruler they wouldn't sad\nWhen a when a TV series a legal TV series are popular and they sort of come and go or movies legal movies become popular and they come and go when they're popular isn't it true that we normally then see a a boost in applications to a law schools\nYes about that well I guess over Twenty years ago now LA law is one of the best things that ever happened to law school or a enrollments because uh that glamorize the work of lawyers they seem to be having a a wonderful time while earning huge salaries and\nThat motivated people go to law school a\nOh roughly Twenty years before that when I was a applying to law school I think we had more social justice oriented films like inherit the when to kill a mocking bird and and people saw that and saw the legal profession as a way to have a positive impact on society\nProfessor Saturday Night seven o'clock ...

amend the McClintock our guest is\nProfessor Paul Berkman he is a professor of law at UCLA he's also the co author of real justice the courtroom goes to the movies on a scale of one to ten just looking at movies overall that deal with the legal profession how accurate are they\nWell I have to say they're wildly inaccurate on a scale of one to ten they're probably somewhere around two and the two most that comes from the trappings of the courtroom\nAnd they uh you know the fact that there are questions being asked and they're being answered and judges are are giving\nRulings a blind eye accuracy is not an honest with truthfulness I think er movies and and TV shows can be truthful to the spirit of what goes on in the courtroom the uh the passion of the lawyers\nThe search to get the right answer by the fact that there's a jury sitting there so\nI think there's a lot more truth than there is accuracy\nHey you know what though I think the law\nDoes the right thing most of the time you know and I'm telling you somebody who's one cases and lost cases and nicely uh we've had more wins and losses but even in those cases that\nI've not been successful not that minute but a couple of weeks later you see yourself you know that jury probably did the right thing in that case I think for the most part and maybe Amanda disagrees with me but I think from the most part\nUm jurors get it right do you have a favorite\nFilm the deals with the legal profession one that you would like to hold up and say okay this is at least close to how it's supposed to be\nSome days uh especially when things work out well in a courtroom how's your driving back to the office you say holy Toledo you know can you imagine getting paid to do this this is so much money on other days Paul you know it's

I think the portrayal of the lawyer there are portrayed by Katherine Hepburn or who really uh uh takes on a a a client who's accused of trying to kill her\nA husband because these are carrying on an affair [noise] uh and she said this is really an early feminist movie where\nAre you know she asked the or as she talks about how the unwritten law would protect the man in a situation that it doesn't protect women are that are all she's asking more as the justice that a man would get in this situation to be\nMade it out for a woman and she's probably the strongest image of a female lawyer and the most positive image or that we have are still even though that movie\nWas made to around Nineteen fifty and here we are about a a more than sixty years later and still waiting for another positive image\nIn a lot of the current films that at the featured a female lawyers a few good men was one of them are Demi Moore her character was not a portrayed a very nicely\nNot at all she supposedly in the film the lawyer that has all the experience uh yet uh I Believe his name is lieutenant Kathy played by Tom Cruise a although he's never tried a case in his life uh spends most of his time playing a softball\nAll of a sudden he takes over and tells her how we're going to do things and and she just kind of fades away into the woodwork that is really an embarrassing\nPortrayal there's an interesting uh sort of a hybrid between these two and that is from the movie legally blond oh yeah ... one of their do scene you know the ugly blond yeah take a listen to this and it kind of touches on okay here's how you cross examine but also here's how you do your research here's how you know what you're talking about\n... ... what have you done it earlier that\nDay I got up got a lot say went to the gym that a parent and came home\nYou've gotten ...\nKnow there was that movie made out of the novel by adding ... billion see and he wrote a novel about ... ... but also a little perhaps less famous line called on the the one town and there's a\nCross examination and that novel and not real life case that my evidence professor used and it always fascinated me about how they use the real life example to show the point\nThey've you know I mean that's why Amanda McClintock is so good you know just listening to her now her soft way of talking and so forth\nNo one has ever not thought that she's telling that the way it is baby that's all there is to it and so that's another attitude a persuasive miss your own credibility how your thought of as a person how you look like you're telling the truth how your guiding them in the right fashion that's what I see so good okay and\nSo I have a question for all of you if a movie and ... who should be the fact\nOf the dumb\nAmanda tell us all about real justice [laughter] well\nI think that you can think about your favorite movies and then you can look at this book and get an idea of just how accurate they are so there's a great deal set something is that as well as entertainment value\nThank you Amanda for your kind words or there was an effort to\nUh you know try to uh you know someone who used the movie the kinds of questions that they might have as to how accurate it is\nOn the other hand you know I think we know that a part of what is important about movies is is not necessarily a you know how well they jibe with exactly what the law is but what kind of message they send about\nOr judges or the legal system you know what is the image that the uh viewers are left with and so we try to talk a little bit about that what is this film what is its message about justice what is its message about how uh lawyers are because I think both of those aspects of film a are important\nFry lawyers do a very important job\nYou know if you are a company and you're putting out a product and you're not testing properly you're not warning properly and so forth\nIs very hard for a good company to compete with you you're cutting these corners\nAnd the only thing that's going to keep the balance is the trial lawyer and says hey listen you put out this drug and caused all these problems of Andy cause heart attack and stroke you knew about it you have a memo that says this will never see the light of day\nAnd unless the trial lawyers bring that to the surface um this other company that's doing the right thing has no ability to compete\nAnd I think that you know the justice system although it you know it has a a few flaws here and there but by and large I think it's a pretty good idea and I think the jury system I think jurors get it right I think jurors understand if a company out there is\nCutting corners and not doing the right thing that they want to make things right so I I have a great respect in regard for how it works\nKnow a few years ago I was doing some law teaching in France at a French a legal University in English luckily\nAnd uh we're actually talking about this said now in in France say the civil country civilized countries generally\nUh the uh portrayal of the lawyer that you were just talking about Tom as someone who's\nA service that social purpose by holding companies and the government accountable or for a mistakes for not doing things the right way that's not really the role of the lawyer and France and or in the course of by a teaching their I happen to go to Barcelona for the weekend\nPulled up at a hotel and was guided at the park around the side of the hotel on a little deserted street even though the front entrance of the history of the hotel was on a busy main road a park there are and was held up\nBecause of the street people know where uh people are gonna go park on this little quiet street while they go to register that's where they hang out and they hold up the people who stopped there uh well when I came back and resume that teaching in a in front of these French law students\nI said well who might be held accountable for this horrible thing that happened to me\nAnd it took them a long time\nTo for me to uh they\nThey were aghast really at the notion I think an American lawyer would see the hotel as partly responsible for that because\nThey themselves were guiding people to go around to this quiet street where they provided no security and on the other hand in front of the hotel in this busy road there is a dorm and there's the kind of security you would expect to find\nAnd I think they appreciated the sense of a lawyer as kind of the protector of the little guy or in the American system in a way they never would have appreciated without that story\nYou know what I'm it's a great job being a lawyer\nThat's all there is to it I'm a little surprised that you with this artistic ability with you know looking at all these films and the effect of the films and how lawyers are portrayed in the law and so forth I don't know why you're not a joining or ferman try these cases I mean\nSome I have a question for you because we've been talking about the movies we've been talking about how lawyers are are portrayed in the movies and of course in or almost all legal uh movies we wait for that one big climactic moment in the courtroom what was your most exciting moment in\nA courtroom well Dave dino the jury is told when you have a verdict was three times in state court\nAnd\nWhen that you're standing around maybe for a day or two and then\nPretty soon to sweep ... state plays and they've ... I don't care if the cases over twenty five brand or twenty five billion okay this is exciting stuff you're about to get your report card baby and incomes that jury\nAnd the judge says that the court attempted may pick up the verdict so every quarter tend to knows how to take a quick look at it\nYou may handed to the clerk clerk then looks at it the thing is about three sentences okay now the clerk looks at it like she's reading war and peace and then she hands it to the judge the judge now not knowing he was going to need his glasses\nFinds his glasses you're sitting there and they do and your heart man I don't care your heart is is moving\nYou finally find says classes he looks at it then he hands it to the clerk to do may read the bird [laughter] clerk title of court all call that\nLos Angeles superior case number such as we've been there for three weeks we always the case then but we do the case there we find in favor of holy Toledo Dave do you know it's very exciting stuff\nWell I Want to end a today because we've talked about lawyers and we talked about them in a lot of different ways\nOne of the talk about what a lawyer is from one more movie and it's a very moving scene from the movie Philadelphia\nBefore we listen to this I Will simply say you've been listening to champions of justice with Tom dirty and demanded McClintock\nAnd are very special guest today professor Paul Bergman professor of law at UCLA co author of real justice the courtroom goes to the movies it's available at Barnes and noble and Amazon and all the normal outlets and it is a great read so I encourage you\nTo pick it up this is how we want to end today are you a good lawyer and an excellent lawyer [noise]\nI excel practice\nOf what I Love the most about the long [noise]\nThat every now and again not\nYou get to be a part of\nReally is\nAnd thank you for joining us today here on champions of justice joined us again next [noise]\n\nThe show furnished by Gerard ...

S. trade during the day\nBut of course they share that trait in common with the other category closed and mutual funds closed and mutual funds are generally listed on an exchange and trade during the day so some people mistakenly think that the only types of\nFarms that trade during the day or exchange traded mutual funds frequently referred to as ... not true\nAnother entire class of mutual funds the closed end mutual funds also trade during the day the only class of mutual funds that is priced to trends Zach only on the clothes\nThat would be the open and mutual funds now as we mentioned within the context of the open and mutual funds you have two categories you have the know load open and mutual funds\nAnd then you have the loaded open and mutual funds\nNow if you're a money talk regular you already know\nI have always concentrated on the no load open ended mutual funds because you don't pay a sales commission\nTo purchase or redeem the shares why should you there's no reason when there are thousands upon thousands of no load open and mutual funds no reason at all\nTo pay a commission to buy or redeem shares in a mutual fund so that's the opening category in the know load area and then you have the load area which can charge you\nFive six percent or more just to buy the shares or just to redeem the shares hey that's your money going down to dream\nI don't recommend that of course of action ever\nThen of course we have the closed and mutual funds the thing you want to be aware of with the closed and mutual funds which can trade at a discount or a premium to the net as a value\nYou want to remember that if you're looking at an initial public offering there's usually about five percent commission\nPrice into the offering price now what does that mean that means that if you buy a closed and mutual fund on the initial public offering at twenty five dollars a share there's probably about a dollar twenty five and commission\nIn that price what does that mean to you that means that you get the shaft\nBecause the twenty five dollars that you paid for that initial public offering closed and share actually has a net assets value on day one\nOf just twenty three dollars and Seventy five cents if it has a five percent embedded commission which is very common place and the closed and marketplace\nThat's why there's really no reason as a general rule to be buying a closed and mutual fund on an I. P. O. Y. so that you get the privilege of paying a five percent or so commission\nWell that's no prevalence at all some people would look upon that more as a rip off so with a closed in funds once you get that that has said value at a at the same price as the share price then you have parity\nFrequently you'll see discounts in a closed and mutual fund because the price of the shares is completely dependent on supply and demand in the marketplace cause they trade like a stock\nAnd so it's quite common for a close and mutual fund to trade at a discount sometimes they'll trade at a premium in either case then that acid value is what it is underlying shares\nAnd that brings us back to that third category which is the more recent a category and that's the exchange traded mutual fund so anytime you your E. T. F. always remember this because very few people will tell you this but I Will\nWhenever you hear that acronym ATF\nThe true accurate the true accurate it would be E. T. M. F. exchange traded mutual\nFun now exchange traded funds trade during the day and that is the big difference between the exchange traded mutual fund and the open and mutual fund the open and mutual fund is priced on the clothes every business day\nAnd can be trends acted purchased or redeemed on that price every day whereas the exchange traded mutual fund the ATF\nThat's trading all during the trip a trading day depending on which exchanges listed on so these are the fine points the key points to know\nWhen you're talking about mutual funds open ended mutual funds which are priced to trends act at the clothes each day based on the net assets value of the securities within the front\nAnd they can be no low which means you don't pay a commission to buy a redeem or they can be low which means you get hit over the head with the commission either to buy or to redeem and I see no reason to go down that road\nThen the second category the closed and mutual funds that we talked about in detail and then the third category which is the relatively newer category the exchange traded mutual funds\nAnd that's the agency on mutual funds I bought breaker [noise]\nMoney Chong [noise]\nHey

worried that probably\n... million\n[noise] well I might suggest that you take fifty four thousand dollars of that money and start that the minimum level of three thousand dollars for an overload fund in a personal account in a I'm In an account that would be a personal account for the thirty year old or a uniform gift\nTo minors act accounted for those are under the age of of in some cases Twenty one in some cases Eighteen\nBut the single fund that I Would suggest taking a look at\nIs the phone that I have used for this purpose and that is the uh then guard total stock market index the vanguard\nThanks for your own a\nGun you know the name of the fund I don't have to spell it out I'm Glad to hear that so that particular\nPatient\nYou thank you so that took yeah\nThank you that particular fund is the fund that I have used for that purpose I recommend your consideration of that fund for your purposes that you've mentioned or you're going to get extremely low expenses you're going to get a very high level of diversification\nYou're also going to get the simplicity of investing in One Fund\nAnd you're also going to get tax efficiency with that fun because it is an index fund\nThe vanguard total stock market index would be my answer to your question blood is a great question by the way when I asked myself many many moons ago and decided on the very same pond and I could not possibly be happier with my selection\nJohn is on the line in Venice, Florida John welcome\nI've I've I've high with you again thank you uh\nI'm sensing a lot of complacency regarding that stock market prices I'm Robert Shiller and talk about this long term turn and consumer confidence and uses the term complacency\nLet me just say something about Robert Shiller a couple of things number one I think Robert Shiller is a really smart guy I think Robert Shiller is a highly intelligent individual\nHaving said that I think his ten year um trailing earnings model is deeply flawed\nDeeply flawed because it includes in it a periods of deep drop in earnings periods like especially two thousand two thousand nine\nAnd what happens is when you include when you normalize periods like that by putting them into a ten year timeframe\nThan what I think happens is you get a distorted you get a distorted answer\nI've always felt this way about the ah the Robert Shiller work and about his valuation work and I have to say and I'm not trying to I'm not trying to be negative on Robert Shiller and I'll tell you why because it's not in my nature\nTo be negative on somebody else in the business but I have to tell you this\nHis work in terms of its valuation work on the market it's been completely wrong it's been totally wrong\nThat's pretty interesting oh look at an hour a look at his ten year look at his tenure earnings number look at the valuation work that's come out of that ten year timeframe and look at what the market has done and you will see that that valuation work has been completely misleading\nAnd that if you had actually followed that valuation work\nIt would have been impossible for you to be fully invested as we had been in the market timer investment letter\nYeah\nSo I mean that's that's why it's a big deal because you know why it's a big deal John this is why because there are only a handful of times\nAnother time was Ninety nine which was the end of an incredible five year run in the uh total market where you had the gains of over twenty percent five consecutive years which ended at the end of Nineteen Ninety nine\nAnd we know what followed that well it's very very important and we were fully invested back then too\nSo it's very very important to take full advantage of such times as these because here's why because they're extremely rare extremely rare\nI mean if you wanted to call this a stock market melt up\nIt would be hard to criticize you if you if you said something like that it would be really hard to criticize you so I mean we have seen an historic run in stock market prices therefore it's just three really important\nYes yeah I think because you have such a high base rate on that uh and you said that this isn't a tax privilege to count which means you're not even paying taxes at this time\nI think I Would hold on I think I in that particular case remember you have something with a high base rate that is not currently available I think I Would hold on to them\nMoney talks come your way each and every weekend talking about subjects financial let's get down to the mighty WLS Chicago John it's your turn welcome\nHi, Bob I really appreciate taking my call I'll make up so fast that I can cause I Know your time is precious [noise]\nUm my IRA is fully funded want are perfect and the vanguard twenty twenty target date fund\nAnd so is my wife and her and her work her four oh one K. is funded and what they call the vanguard twenty twenty trust fund\nWhich is exactly the same product as the ah twenty twenty target date fund and our IRAs the only difference is\nThe twenty twenty target date fund in our air IRAs is about thirty two bucks a share and in her four oh one K. find it's about fifty five dollars a share\nSo I was wondering um does that make sense for her to do a service roll over to hurt a higher rate in order to get more bang for buck or almost double the amount of shares\nJohn I'm really glad you called but I I really have to ask you what in the world\nAre we talking about let's think this through now you just pointed out in your comments that these two funds although they have a different share price they are identical in terms of what they own is that correct that is correct\nOr will therefore tell me if I'm wrong\nIf the assets in that particular uh holding go up a hundred percent\nThe way I see it the thirty two dollars shares will be sixty four which is a double and the fifty five dollars shares will be one hundred ten which is a double you tell me if you think I'm wrong\nNo I don't think you're on well\nThen there is no difference between them in terms of which one you own because either way you're going to make the exact same percentage which is the only thing that matters\nOkay I was just thinking that if you're if you're investing a hundred thousand dollars into the thirty two dollar per share side of it and and fifty five dollars per share your you're able to buy double the amount of shares it might it might thinking incorrect here\nIn my opinion a yes or you're all caught off you're caught off base and tagged out for all in the stadium to see and I'll tell you why I say that I had as you make your way as you make your way back to the dugout [noise]\nI'll tell you why I say that because if you put one and you tell me if you think I'm wrong\n[noise] um if you put one hundred thousand dollars into the thirty two dollars shares and the holdings in those shares double the securities and represented by those shares double than that one hundred thousand will be worth too\nThere were thousands and at the same time and the other fund which is invested identically those that by those shares at fifty five will have one hundred ten dollar shares which means they're one hundred thousand dollars will also have doubled the two hundred thousand dollars\nWe're talking apples and Apple's\nOkay I I really appreciate that\nCan I ask you one follow up question\nSure we recently moved all the fun all this money and her four oh one K. money from a very diversified a plan in to the target date funds because we want to retire in three years\nSo we wanted to reduce her risk in the market and get a bigger exposure to bonds\nAnd the the ratio shares are about fifty five percent stock forty five percent bonds\nAnd we figured we do that for the next three years until I retire and then maybe evaluate our situation at that point maybe going to manage payout fund or something different or do you have any problem with that new allocation\nGoing to a fifty five forty five allocation anticipating a retirement situation as early as three years from\nNow is not something that would cause me a problem and John I Do appreciate the call always great to hear from our listeners in the windy city and throughout the mid west on the mighty ducks you will last radio\n\nAnd for those of you that are just tuning in for the first

deservedly big gold do breathing in the book and Eric early radio and he's currently I'm hearing McNamara eight six six Ninety red\nEyes were talking about the political divide in this country we go to willy in Little Rock Arkansas Willie you're on Radio Welcome to the show\nOh thank you for having me Gehring Eric\n... go ahead you're on the air\nOh sure um thank you very much for me I just want to say that um\nI Want to tell you that uh everyone on the left is not crazy um where your friendly neighborhood Democrats I personally don't want open borders no one does no one on the left wants open borders no one does\nAnd I think everything is getting so politicized dope artist and\nThings like Pittsburgh is happening and things like bombs\nBeing mailed all over the country the Democratic candidate in the outer banks now I I knew you know I really need that rhetoric willing in well leading to Willie ... we've\nHad crazy people in our society deranged an evil people in our society for quite some time\nIt does so saying that it's getting to this point and that's the cause of what happened in Pittsburgh that's the cause of the person mailing the the devices through\nYour email you just said we're becoming hyper partisan you're against it and you become hyper partisan\n[laughter] I don't mean to be hyper partisan and I don't mean was viola I'm Down in LA we're we're not all ... on on the left and we're very reads about what were your brother I Want to your nails All right I Want to address\nOne thing that you said that nobody wants to open borders I Would disagree with that tell me one Democrat\nWhat their policy is in ... in any\nOf that illegal immigration plan to secure the border tell me any of them that have said\nThat this is our plan and we need to have border enforcement and we need a because you'll hear a lot of we need comprehensive immigration reform but they'll never get into the specifics of what should be included in that comprehensive immigration reform when it comes to border control\nWhat you had earlier when you you what you have a right now you think about this Trump is being blamed for the caravan\nLoved you can play it and be blamed because they are not being blamed for the game is being blamed that he doesn't care and the and the and the point is because he said we're going to stop and that the border and Democrats are saying no they all should be able to get through because they're only looking for the American dream and that's what's fair\nWell then at that point is nice rare but if you believe that as the mainstream now of the Democrat Party believes you may be a liberal and you may say you disagree with it but it's what your party now endorses\nThey may not you know they may not use the term open border but that's what they mean go ahead I'm Sorry go ahead [laughter]\nIt it is it is unfortunate that that\nPerception of the Democratic party has now proliferated but I I Would I Would venture to tell you that no president in the past three or four administrations has deported more illegal immigrants than ...\nHe deported more immigrants than any President Trump Bush Clinton\nReagan none of them okay and look I don't know I Love to know what I hear leaning Democrat okay wants open borders okay England here's here's we're here are very we want safety here here's a point I Want\nI mean we we can debate the numbers some other time but let's say that's absolutely true and nobody deported more than President Obama then why is Trump being demonized for believing the same thing that Iraq Obama believed it things are hyper ... has\nA little bit less than ... than Obama did when it comes to his ...\nAnd the way he talked about the way he talks about it not what if you not what he wants to do nothing subtle people are against what he wants to do is that what you're trying to say\nOh I'm trying to say is that the seems to me or as someone who is your brother is your fellow American citizen and I love you and I have a ton of conservative friends Republican friends we're all brothers we're all brothers what I'm saying is that\nIt seems to me that Trump and the way he characterizes\nPeople who are in need and if you were in their position if you were in the same position you want the best for your family you want you would want the best for your friends you would you would want the best for yourself you want the best life it seems to me the\nThat was news of people have used it to have a portion of their credit card debt forgiven calling them for free information and their

we\nAh you know ... after your call and I'm sure we'll get more people saying this because they do every time both sides are responsible for creating the type of rhetoric that causes these shootings I Would disagree with that but are they ... what happens after we have a shooting and and I go back\nTo O. wild when I first became a talk show host in the nineties there were a lot of the shootings that that happened I I Will say this that\nThe ... from my experience sitting in my chair and I'm not going to states dumb argument to get in well both sides do it well you know you'll be able to find both sides to do it you're going to ... when you have\nTens of millions of people in each political party yeah somebody from both sides are going to try to make political hay out of something but what\nDoes the media what does the mainstream media\nAnd when you get to more official politicians off of social media what happens when there's a shooting almost immediately the left comes out and starts talking about gun control\n... it happens I mean it's it's right away they don't even enjoy it instead he's not one day or two days it's the same it's at press conferences from local officials\nBefore we even know\nWhat happened in any incident\nIt is immediately politicized um\nAnd then you will have\nFrom what I normally seen it could be exceptions to the rule but what I normally seen afterwards is then when the white\nInvolved and starts talking about the second amendment ... and then that debate goes on ah to sit and discuss what rhetoric may dry but a mass\nShooter to do what they want it's I guess on your part it would be a gas on my part none of us know you don't know what sets off people and so to say we need to tamp did\nYou need to temper the rhetoric across the board or ... I think we should uh as conservatives because I think we can win every issue without doing so I understand why the left and I understand why some people on the right do it\nI disagree with that but I understand why they do it the leftist nothing else to go on the last caller I like I said it was really interesting he was talking about how you need to get rid of the hyper partisanship and\nThen he went into hyper partisanship\n\nWell and and and saying that he doesn't know anybody that's for open borders I don't know anybody that well the fact of the matter is is that\nThere are there are people out there that are calling for open borders I think we sort of convince ... here's the thing I I Would ask you to ask those that you cite with and I mean the people running for office or that are holding office right now\nAsk them what level of enforcement on the border\nDo they believe it it's a very simple question uh\nBut we live in a nation with free speech we're not going to get rid of free speech the second amendment isn't going away free speech is going to stay\nA there is a party that was just to get rid of it ours is not that party\nAnd they're very they're working very hard right now to to do that and and if you think to the last ... I don't think that doesn't exist then go to talk to the people of California by the way you're using the wrong pronoun there is a penalty of up to a year in jail and that law for a reason\nWhen I say ours I mean conservative mhm I said party I meant conservative because Republicans as you remember McCain was a Republican assigned McCain or that or a spouse or McCain fined gold and Bush signed saying that he knew parts of it were unconstitutional but hold up the courts deal with it and you and I were furious when he did that so so there\nYou know if if you if you think that you know you you're the the colored in describing well where your brothers were you know we we are trying to paint every one is as someone who thinks is him\nOn the left that's not the case\nTell me it's not extreme in New York when they say if you use the wrong pronoun we can find you up to the point that it would shut your business down\nIn California [noise]\nIt's in the law [noise] they can put you in jail for using the wrong pronouns [noise]\nNow tell me that's not a threat [noise]\n\n\nAs soon as ... radio on Westwood One\nMisses show live anywhere at any time on demand to catch up on Eric and Gary's topics of the day that it red eye radio show dot com and click on demand that red eye radio show dot com\nIf you're forming today you know all about taking risk well here's one risk you don't have to take any more risk of ID id internal diesel injected deposits because now cynics ruby field messed improving diesel fuel has an advance injection stabilize or to prevent id ID so you don't have to risk and check your\nFailure clogged filters in downtime more cynics ruby field masters even backed by a ten year ten thousand our one for even less risk peace of mind towering will do a synergism ran to the age\nOver electronics is practicing for the fight against breast cancer by partnering with bright pink travel centers of America and Petro stopping center to bring you the twenty nine LCD bright pink CB radio this limited edition right did CB\nRadio is helping to save lives from breast and ovarian cancer by empowering women to liberal activists for every radios Noam ... makes me donation if I think in the fight against answer the right to the radio is available for a limited time ... travel centers of America and Petro stopping centers\nI tend to an owner operators have you tired and chasing empty promises are I think he is looking for you to join their team offering a dollar Seventy\nFive per mile for solo drivers or two dollars per month for teams RSVP he's all miles that hadn't back home or not in their vocabulary they're no treatment rentals need and I know hidden secret how our I think the today at eight RSVP three six five that's eight eight RSVP three six five\nFour apply online an RSP P.

the same thing so uh there's where are where we are right now in in Brazil in other news want to make sure we get this ah too because we had this happen after friday US Economy grew\nAt three point five percent pace and the third quarter about what was expected a little bit over the three point four percent that was being talked\nAbout the department said the uh price index the PC price index a key measure of inflation increase by one point six percent last quarter much less than a to point two percent increase expected by economists so that's ... that's good news yeah yeah there's\nA consumer's expending which accounts for more than two thirds of us economic activity grew by four percent in the third quarter\nOf the strongest says the fourth quarter of twenty fourteen\nYeah um that's ah again encouraging news or we want to we we hope to keep that going but certainly good ... going into the the midterm a week from tomorrow\n\nUh the ... while stronger than expected the overall expansion was slower pace and the growth in the in the previous quarter gross domestic product grew by four point two percent\nAnd the second quarter member they up that one tenth right yeah I was ready for for ... percent of that to a four point to look nobody thought I'd look even even if the tariffs didn't go into place a ...\nAnd the majority of terrorists have not taken place yet uh I I and they went in what September twenty eight so really wasn't included in in in that quarter but\nStill a about what I Would expect it look if you can get anything close to just three percent growth\nSince April twenty Seventeen and we brought this up before you have to point nine percent growth yes\nHalf of that increase in growth was because of government spending but half of that was also because of what the economy was doing right what the private sector economy was was doing so all in all ah\nAnd maybe it's because I have lived so long under\n[noise]\nMore socialist thinking presidents [laughter] ... yeah [laughter] I Am a I Am\nContent [laughter] ... it and write and I'd like you I Hope that it continues to go there it's encouraging yes it's encouraging\nIt's ... it's not any time despite the ball but uh basically to do to to rally the troops and try and see if you go\n[laughter]\nThat was some interesting rally the troops yeah no I think it's yet I because I we've we've called on the Republicans how many times to point out the good war now it's a good point out the positive and that's how you do that uh that's that's one those are the these are the numbers you use\n\nA Hillary I'd like to be president doesn't plan on running but would still like\nTo be president she doesn't want to ... what she's saying is if we didn't have all that you know election stuff we had to go through then yeah I mean you know if you guys just want to make president [laughter]\nIt's my time again\nYet a third time again right\nUh\nYeah it's hurt time no seriously no no no no no no ... that we don't yet know but but seriously that's going to be the sign\n\nA Texas representative Beto O'Rourke says he would he wouldn't concede being down in the polls even though the latest survey show him falling further behind Senator Ted Cruz Republican and companies trying to unseat\nOthers from the Washington Examiner he was asked about his poll numbers point blank during an interview Sunday with W F a a local or ABC affiliate here in Dallas closing in the final days public polls have you down how do you make that up now he was asked I don't know I wouldn't concede that were down\n... but we're just pointed out that you are now if that were Ted Cruz saying that if he were if Ted Cruz were down well item concede that were down\n... I mean that's the answer you always ...\nMhm so well you don't ... here's the thing you don't ignore the polls that's just all out ignoring the polls or would you do you say look we're don't count us out until\nElection all kinds of salt and you know what the polls who believes the polls [laughter] and you know why you say that because everybody on your side will agree with you yes whenever you're down in the polls\nOn your side agrees that the polls were wrong\nWell what about election night well you can see me because I got out crews wins you're going back to the Trump question\nWill if cruise wins will the wind be legitimate exactly we believe\nThat Russians and or Canadians and or the or anyone else might have interfered with the election\nWhat against it and they got it on our lives yeah uh the the I think the I\n... it will be interesting to see the I guess the the number of seats that that they gain if they gain seats in the Senate\nAnd we're the house shapes up because you do see some movement right now and some of those polls\nAnd by the way the Republicans picked up one over the weekend according to our sci fi yeah they he okay a couple of things they had lost one on friday so they went back down to one Ninety nine and then they gain to back over the weekend\nSo that leaves the essentially the tops up somewhere around what\nTwenty nine right so you you know you look back at the you know the the pollsters aren't as active and house races that just aren't there some that you can find polls on but others you have to go back we\nPre Kavanaugh pre caravan pre well pre heart of the election season\nAnd you can't find and there's nothing and\nSo you you have to wonder what is because the sentiment does change we talked about this or a number of times on the program how you can say well that was so yesterday and I'm and we literally mean yesterday not like years ago\nBut in ...\nIn in terms of the public sentiment it it changes drastically can change can change drastically very quickly\nAnd that's why I think the polls are important they are a number of things that could impact the race in any given house seat or a house race and I think that's what you have to wonder is if any of this is impacting some of those toss ups a cabin on the caravan or or anything else\nOr looking at the Missouri Senate race or from the twenty fourth and twenty fifth the Missouri scout Holly apply for I don't know if that's you know a been impacted by the crazy Democrat ad\nYeah right\nOh I'm Sorry I still can't get over that and still do that yeah it's you\n[laughter] [laughter] I I Wonder\nIf that's unprecedented for US Senate race it might not be for a house race\n\nBut I Wonder yeah you can find\nIn case you don't know we're talking about a Claire McCaskill the Democrat in ... put together an ad we played friday a bunch of different times were she didn't practice civility at all with her own party ... where in in the education to mend talking back and forth and they said ... and one of those crazy Democrats\nAnd you know that's her saying it was her at it wasn't a pack at it was her at ... she put it together was it an outside group she approved of it so what she stayed in is I'm not one of those crazy Democrats and we were over the weekend fact had a couple of conversations with a couple of people political people that I Know and I said\nDo you know of any other case Senate race where anybody actually said that about their own party nobody could remember one\nWe didn't want to try the house because well again we we did know there's so many house races for the whole you know every every single or every couple of years and so we we just said maybe in a house race there could have been one time because there's so many house races All right yeah\nWell and I have heard the word crazy rate was ... yes because it certainly positioning of of of of any ... well\nI'm more of a moderate I'd I'm not far right or I'm not far left or whatever but\nThat's not what that was that was crazy Democrat that was for a reason it was a very clear and direct physician and I think too it was a ...\n[noise] I I don't know if it was a Hail Mary I Would love to you know be a fly on the wall but certainly it was one of those uh attempts that was going to be direct and was going to be blunt\nAnd we're talking about just weeks before the election this ad is out there and it was heading for a reason\nAnd that raises extremely tight but there had to be a connection with people essentially that were saying that likely in the
