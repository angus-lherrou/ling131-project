worst transportation crush 'em all us since two thousand nine after twenty people on their way to a birthday celebration were killed him a limerick in upstate New York to cast and bomb reporter\n[noise] I I think when it that they very important and critical aspects that you in ... case they're starting to happen is a perception of change\nThat those he thought that we all encounter daily who we perceive as homeless so often it's easy for us to say\nOh they they don't take care of themselves they want to be on the street they don't want help we're not going to be able to help them and we basically turn our backs sign an intern to turn a blind eye because they're the cause of their problem\nBut what I had seen inner city jail in an instrument or late tree you add inning leadership and what Greg brains is this perceptual change that no no no\nBy and large majority of the people who has found themselves on the streets are people just like us who very recently had a job and at home or apartment\nAnd they were able to put food on the cable and because of an economic\nCute economic problems they've had the carpet ripped out from under them and they and they land on that skate and they just need a little help to regroup isn't that true that the majority of people on the streets are as that second category\nYeah when you think about who is homeless in a place like Los Angeles or most places the country I I make a distinction the folks who are experiencing chronic homelessness and shorter term homelessness and in LA it's around a third of the people we're almost at any given night who are chronically homeless and there's a technical definition but basically it's people have been homeless for a long period of time are struggling with serious issues\nBut the other two thirds are much more who you're talking about and short term homelessness the statistic that really brings that to light to me is that between two thousand and two thousand Thirteen and the county of Los Angeles the median rent went up by twenty seven percent and the media and rent or income went down by seven percent\nDo you have an enormous number of families who are really precariously perched just one thing going wrong away from homelessness one last job\nOne domestic violence incident won a illness and the family one thing going wrong and they're over that hump and they're into homelessness and it's just devastating to see the number of families and individuals who are perch just that one step away\nAnd there's a lot that we can do from a policy standpoint within a public stand point to intervene and help families who are facing those challenges and keep them from becoming almost\nAdam of you done any good have you do have some people that were homeless and because of the inner cities and next thing you know they're they're back\nYou know Thomas ... which probably the most rewarding thing about being an inner city last centers that literally every day there are families who stay in their homes who get into homes who get access to public benefits\nWho get paid money from the slum lord to have been running their buildings from a whole host of different in a whole host of different ways we literally every day see families whose lives have changed because of the work of the people in our state Law Center\nAnd it makes it incredibly rewarding to do this work in an environment that generally is pretty challenging and what we see but\nThe fact that we're able to make such a difference in our clients lives is really what motivates us and keeps us going\nDoes anybody ever come back and say hey inner city thank you\nAll the time we have clients who come back and and thanks for the work and we have clients come back even was very meager means who come and donate to the organization numb and volunteer with the organization um I mean it it's people who are facing really serious struggles in their lives and very often doing everything they can\nUm but they need assistance and and very often they're very appreciative\nOf what we're able to do and I should add here Tom it's not just the staff of inner city Law Center who are amazing\nBut it's also we have a whole network of of lawyer volunteers and paralegal volunteers folks from your from who've come in and help and others and it's really an important way that we leverage additional resources so will the staff of inner city Law Center is incredible and amazing we could not do what we do on the scale we do if it weren't for all the volunteers will come and help us\nYou are listening to champions of justice with ... and maybe Solomon and our guest today you've been hearing from Adam Murray the executive director of the inner city Law Center in Los Angeles

Marie\nThe executive director of the inner city Law Center in Los Angeles and Greg Spiegel the director of strategic initiatives at icy Elsie and we're talking about the issue of homelessness and me\n[noise] so training kid grab one of the things that is and hurt quite often when you talk to to find anything folks or the homeless paddling is solvable\nAnd we need to use that money that is being talked about quite edit things that are potentially solvable\n... talk to us at ... solution to this devastating problem\nWas is you know we haven't already always had this problem in Los Angeles in this extreme away the homelessness boomed in the eighties and it\nDidn't come out of nowhere although we acted as if it did\nSuddenly thousands of people on the street of Los Angeles that weren't there before and our response was okay well we need to get the meals and we need to get him a bed for the night as if this was a a temporary situation they were and we've had thirty five years of that experience and what we've learned is that there were underlying\nPolicy and permanent infrastructure decisions that created this homelessness crisis and we weren't going to get out of it with temporary solutions we need\nPermanent policy changes that would address the underlying issue so things like\nI'm cutting mental health care funding I'm closing mental health institutions without replacing them with anything that is funded\nI'm going from in Nineteen sixty the city of Los Angeles had a a general planet contemplated ten million people in fifty years since then we slowly\nThrough individual policy decisions that we make has said no we don't want people living here we don't want this many people living here and what we've now got as a general planet only contemplates for a million people that has resulted in us having less housing being built and we are reaping the\nProblems of that now where we don't have enough housing for the people that we have so\nAnd we've had you know manufacturing jobs in union jobs that were working class jobs it allowed people to own a home those have gone away and sells like south of light which had a lot of industry that's gone so you have a lot of people without those jobs without that income to pay for housing\nSo all these things have kind of come together to get us to the situation where we are source solutions need to address that\nBottom line what we need is more affordable house\nAnd those for the people who are currently homeless but also the people who currently homeless or just the tip of the iceberg there's all these there's hundreds of thousands of families in Los Angeles county who are paying more than fifty percent of their monthly income on housing they are one\nWe have ... behind the

on TALK radio seven Ninety KABC [noise]\nWe're back with more of champions of justice would sound you're already in any solve\nOur guest today at Emory the executive director of\nThe inner city Law Center in Los Angeles and Greg Spiegel the director of strata and Greg Spiegel the director of strategic initiatives and even though we are talking about the issue on a Los Angeles forum\nAnd even though we are talking about the issue as it relates to Los Angeles what we're talking about today is being seen and mirrored in every major city across our nation the problems are the same and the solutions can also be the same\nUm you're talking about\nGetting people off of homelessness getting them off the street and yet somebody listening to this might be thinking okay but how do you move them from dependence upon\nVarious services to self sufficiency and Adam I kind of make this akin to when I was a child I had a very serious illness\nAnd I literally on learned walking off because of the illness I could not walk right afterwards I have to really learn to walk many of the people who are homeless walked couldn't walk\nWe have to train them to walk again we have to be able to an enabled them to walk again as an analogy\nHow do we do that\nSo Dave I think it's a there's a different answer that depending on who you're talking about interacting with I think one of the things that's very important ... said is that there are many pathways into homelessness and there are many pathway out of homelessness\nAnd you really have to figure out where that individual is the individual person individual family and what they need to transition out of homelessness and that's a different depending on on why they're homeless you know how they got there and what they're struggling with now um\nBut we we see a lot of\nFamilies in particular who become homeless recently for economic reasons who are either to get back into a working environment to get back to a job to get back to a staple living environment and they really just need a short term assistance to do so\nUm so they need they've had something that's pushed him over the edge into homelessness they lost a job that had an illness and the family and they just need when I was saying that about six to twelve months a cushion to get back on their feet and get back where where they where they want to be and why they're eager to be\nWe see other folks who need more intensive helping out who need job training services or health services or something else to get there and so that's more akin to what you're talking about I think it's important for us to just be honest about the fact that there's also a number of folks\nWho need assistance or going to need assistance for the rest of their lives you know there there we emptied our mental institutions onto the streets decades ago\nThat I really that's really an issue in other words are you from the police department standpoint so much of the crime or these people with mental issues that should be being\nServed in that fashion and they're just all out in the street\nThat's right and the police are called out again and again to be the front lines of interacting with folks which is not a the healthiest way to do it in the most productive way to do it but there's a subset of the folks who are chronically homeless who need permanent supportive housing or like they need that support for the rest of their lives\nUm that's the main thing to do I know if someone in my family was living on the streets with a serious mental health issue and needed help for the rest of their life I Would want us to provide that\nAnd everybody who's out there was somebody son or somebody's daughter somebody's family member so I think we just have to own that but that's not the bulk of who's on the streets on but it is important that we recognize some\nBulk truly are people that have this problem and then they get out and get back and so forth yes and the statistics are overwhelming on that I mean it okay if I Want to know does cause that's really important\nYeah so so you're looking at about almost forty seven thousand people who are homeless every night\nAbout Thirteen thousand or thereabouts are chronically homeless and that's the subset where there are serious mental health issues and long term assistance is needed the balance of the other folks are mostly going to transition with the right support services back into jobs and apartments and lives as we think about them for\nReally so about thirty thousand plus you think are going to get back and so forth\nIt's even more than that because that's the nightly count right so that's forty seven thousand every night but over the course of the year it's probably a little bit more than three times that that are experiencing homelessness\nAnd almost all of the difference between the two hundred thousand over the course of the year and the forty seven thousand on on each night are folks who are short term homelessness\nThat's like putting all those people into Dodger Stadium and you fill it up\nYet and Norman's number of people and it's a ... I think about that at every single one of them as as a human being was literally sleeping in a shelter sleeping on the streets you know\nYeah and I was going to add Adam was saying I often I hear people say well the homeless person I Know they don't they don't want\nHouse they don't want to be off the street they want to live on the streets and\nWhat we know is that I'm most homeless people don't want to be in a shelter or our traditional shelters have\nBeen something you have to line up in the afternoon to get in with all your stuff and there's a crowd and you you line up and people pushing shove and then you get new maybe sleep on the floor or a bad but it's it's not your ideal situation some people don't feel safe it's not on many shelters have limitations about who they take into that don't take\nSome if you um have an addiction problem you're not welcome others have religious or service requirements that they don't want to do so people with mental illnesses serious issues that's not an attractive situation so there are many many people who don't want shelter\nBut there are very few people who will turn down housing and that's why that's the solution is permanent housing\nAlmost everyone will come off the street if you have permanent housing that fits what they need the other thing I Want to say is that\nFor those people that need that it permanently need help and we need to accept that and its services it's actually cheaper to house them and serve them than it is to leave them on the street how so on the street these are people who are not functioning so they are\nHad serious mental illness or perhaps drug addiction or both um and they are passing out unconscious and they get picked up by an ambulance and they're taking to the emergency room and there's a police an ambulance crew involved in this tons of labor it's thousands of dollars the estimates for the the most acute\nTop ten percent of homeless people cost the county of Los Angeles about eight thousand dollars a month if we ... them and provide them services it's like three thousand dollars a month we actually save money by doing the right thing if you talk about\nThey don't want to be homeless and I've mentioned this picture before but it has a different perspective and when I used to ride the train into Los Angeles\nOr along the Los Angeles river underneath the freeways you would see on occasion a little towns suddenly being built we would call them you know shanty towns\nBut what occurs to me is this as I watch those towns develop those people were building their own homes they wanted a place to live it wasn't just attempt\nThese were scraps of would they were able to scrounge and they were building their own homes and their own community they wanted a sense of home of community of belonging to a group of people\nAnd then about every three months of you know enforcement would come in and just literally bulldozed the entire area and those people were gone but it occurs to me that that is a demonstration that people really do want a home\nThat is so well said Dave exactly and so they don't have the home out there that can afford or that is addressing the needs of they have and they recreate it and they're improvising and as you say it's not just one lean to on its own people start living in community they're replacing\nSo um we can't afford or not to solve this problem\nOkay here's the story we've had a lot of people on and we never put ads on the show for political people or anything like that [noise] but I take it a lot of your existence relies upon the generosity of others to help right\nThat's absolutely right both lawyer volunteers and we're writing checks to support our work\nAnd the lawyer volunteers and you'll these homeless people or various legal problems and so forth that they try to assist with\nThat right so it's all housing and homelessness focus your firms you will know Tom helped us with a slum housing case last year we represent a lot of tenants who are struggling with their landlords around slum housing conditions but\nWe also help homeless veterans apply for benefits we help families are facing eviction stay in their homes or to have a soft landing someplace else if they're going to have to leave and all of those things are greatly benefitted by having lawyers help people navigate those processes how many lawyers are healthy we have twenty two attorneys on staff\nAnd we have a last year um over thirty thousand hours of volunteer pro bono attorney times I'll get it over fourteen million dollars and volunteer lawyer time on top of what our staffers\nAnd then if a some lawyers out there that says gee I'd like to maybe help out a little bit on something like this I don't want to be full time I Want to give a little bit how do they go about that\nSo they should call her office ah and look up online and send us an email and we would be happy to talk to them about a specific needs in specific programs at the moment some of the areas we provide training depending on you know what their background is and and what their help with an other areas depending on the background we just plug people and have them go with\n[noise] and uh how about somebody who isn't a lawyer but we'd like to help out what would they do\nSo for supporting inner city Law Center where they could do is write a check to support our staff work um but I think it's an important point to make that ... the hopefulness that exist right now around homelessness in the midst of all this horror\nIs that many more people are carrying about this issue they're focusing on this issue they're volunteering with various organizations that work on these issues and more people are insisting that our elected officials address these issues so the reason why we're seeing leadership\nI built the city and county level is in large part because as Greg said we know what the solutions are and the public is insisting that our elected officials act\nAnd so even just calling your local city council man or woman or your local board of supervisors representative and saying\nYou know what are you doing to help address homelessness keeping that pressure on and that attention on this issue\nIs something that anyone can do and for non lawyers but we don't have a lot of volunteer opportunities in inner city Law Center there were great organizations are in town I'll just mentioned a couple of people interested that they can Google One is a group called ah oh PCC LAMP Community\nThat does great work that people can look up there's homeless healthcare which is on Skid Row there's path ventures um there's a lot of different organizations in South LA there's a group called ... lots of wonderful organizations doing great work day in and day out on where's your non lawyers can volunteer as well but\nWhat is your Web address for people who are local and want to get involved or people listening listening nationally and saying I Want to see some of their solutions what is your Web address\nIts inner city law dot or I. N. N. E. R. M. C. I. T. Y. L. A. W. dot ORG inner city law dot or jog or gee\nMaybe [noise] you know just as a plane of preference here that pro bono hours that many layers on are giving to the senator I can say first hand on\nHaving some of our young lawyers participate in the homeless veterans project and these were young layers and they just got out of logical about really wanted to be an advocate and\nAnd they hooked gap where you're amazing staff\nAnd were trained how to help homeless veterans they focused on winning\nAnd it was so delightful to see these young lawyers come back I had my first client I had my first advocate siege and we wind and it really just what fetch a win win situation for everyone and you see that time and time again\nYou know if there's a prejudice against homeless hey you're homeless because us around you took whatever [noise]\nYou can't be prejudiced against homeless vets the reason that they're there and they were out protecting us they were getting hurt they were getting those mental issues because of us and then they come back and now they're unable to get work and so forth these people didn't choose this route\nAnd boy if there's ever been in an area that\nYou know we have to help or those people that did everything for us and now they're in a terrible way\nI think that's right time and I think he just to add to that there's a on the way people can help if you're a landlord\nOr right now because of the influx of resources to help folks who are homeless and veterans who are homeless in particular there are quite a number of families and a veterans who have vouchers that will pay for rent who are having trouble finding apartment because of our little vacancy rates\nAnd so if your landlord is renting an apartment and you were willing to accept one of these vouchers and went to a veteran or to a low income family it was either a danger of homelessness was become homeless\nA that's a way that you could be helpful as well\nOkay here's the story both of you are coming back next year Amy is going to be here I'm going to be here David ... going to be here okay let's just start with you Adam I'm what have you done the past year\nHopefully we have a much less homelessness and the county of Los Angeles due to the new investments and perhaps more importantly we have a genocide a source of revenue and funding so that we can be implementing the planet's going to take time\nTo dramatically decrease our homelessness in Los Angeles and I would love to see\nThat because we have been successful at that we've been able to shift more of our efforts to preventing people from becoming homeless right now a lot of our efforts are focused on people who are homeless how do we get them back in their housing how do we get them back on their feet and I would like to see us get past that problems that we could focus on stopping families from becoming homeless in the first place\n[noise] Greg [noise] uh in addition to that I'm hopeful that in communities throughout Los Angeles that will be permanent supportive housing projects in development and people in the neighborhoods would understand and support that\nHomelessness is a regional problem and it's been require all of us each in our communities helping to provide the shelter in the housing and I'm welcoming it instead of resisting and\nYou know Greg it helps if you're let's suppose you or you have a restaurant and then you have a bunch of homeless people out in front\nThat's gonna that's going to negate your businessman just right on the other hand if there's some place where they can be reasonably put up and do well themselves and you don't have that problem and I understood from the some of the ways you're getting money\nFunding of new projects that are being built

that plays out but uh the federal\nOpen market committee is expected to raise rates again at the September meeting on Thursday we will get jobless claims now these are new unemployment claims compiled each week and they showed the number of persons who filed for\nSure it's for the first time and um\nFor example if you have an increasing trend in this data\nThan that suggest a deterioration in the labor market we have not had that\nWe have had a very healthy trend of a flat lining at a very low level data series now the consensus for this Thursday is two hundred Fifteen thousand last week it was twelve thousand the poor week moving average\nWhich smoothed out the weekly volatility right now stands at two hundred and Fifteen thousand five hundred these are very low levels\nWe're talking about levels here that compare to levels as far back as\nAlmost fifty years ago that's how they were and now they've been low for several years the last three years have been incredibly low but they've stayed low\nUh one of the things going on out there is we have a tight labor market right now we've seen the increase in people leaving their job to find another job\nAnd that's because people feel confident that they can get a better job\nAnd all of that is happening as a result of a very strong labor market out there very strong so strong that we now have more job openings than qualified applicants we have plenty of job openings we don't have the qualified applicants to build them\nSo that's going on out there as well\nAlso on Thursday we'll get the federal housing Finance Agency the S H if a house price index and that will update for us the year over year rate of change\nIn housing prices and I'm right now it stands at six point for\nHouse prices right now are on average six point four percent higher than they were twelve months ago so I'm not a lot of change by the way not a lot of changes expected in that six point for figure on a year over year\nBasis as a result of this a report\nAlso on Thursday we will get the new home sales figure new home sales for the month of July and these are measured by counting the number of newly constructed homes with a committed

up Thursday a system aided at six hundred and forty eight thousand prior month was six hundred thirty one thousand\nAnd um I think the market would like to see a better number on a new home sales because recently it's been sluggish some sluggish missing these figures\nBut that number will come out on Thursday and also what's going on of course is\nThe annual Jackson Hole\nEconomic symposium

obsolete and freelancing is the future of the you mentioned the the ratings are that are becoming more and more prevalent than all various disciplines and of course as you know\nUh the colleges and universities in particular that rating systems for the most part in place for years hasn't worked out the other they use them and or did they even look at them\nI talking specifically about things like SATs\nWell I'm Talking now about the the ... the teacher ratings service oh ... online\nSure and and you know even as an instructor at a University of California Irvine I get rented every single every single time that I teach and what's interesting about those ratings as they're done on a particular skill and um\nThe scale itself basically anything other than five star doesn't fail\nRight and that's true I think when we look at places to stay to like when we look at an air being here we look at some of these other rating system\nWe start to see that we tend to either go toward the extremes on one enter the extremes on the other hand we're looking more towards those you know four and a half star type of experience is\nSo the ratings systems themselves aren't necessarily new I think what's new is the breath and the depths of them you know when I learned that these five guys burgers and fries managers were getting reviewed by their temporary help\nI mean that's a game changer when have you ever heard that\nYou've done a good thing it can be it can be it may lead to manage certain types of managers treating people make a little bit better because now there are also under the microscope\nYou know but it also has the other parts of it too you know there are certain reviews are known for being quite fraudulent you know I'm Talking about wide scale it is and you know you talked to any small business owner and I'll tell you about how Yelp is not the most reliable and yet\nWe all choose that way so what does that say about us\nWhen we're in a new place we're looking for somewhere to eat\nA winner things you're always thinking about when you're checking those kinds of ratings on restaurant or a place to stay is you're always wondering uh how much of that is legitimate honest in\nAnd some of the perhaps a remote but this was going to open their ...\nRight right and I think there is a certain degree of that as well and it's hard for us to know sometimes as the consumer except for when we start to see patterns right like if we're we're looking at an Amazon review\nAnd we go to the person that reviewed and we noticed that they only write reviews for one particular company and that's all they've ever written we start to be a little bit wary\nA lot of these uh systems in place like certain Google reviews and even Yelp for that matter you know they they do try to keep their reviews as honest as possible to try to\nKind of a head off all of the fraudulent ones that can come through so they do put in systems there how good they are you know that's

thought was a guy walked by and he said you want to talk of knowing all of a sudden you're the guy go make America great again [laughter]\n\nYou know and and it's it's just because you look at this look these we know that these protests are organized to a great deal it was happening during the Trump rallies in twenty sixteen\nWe know that there was a great organization than money to a certain extent going behind a that was behind and driving a lot of these protests are we know that uh the left with very good at that\nBut that's that's why you can't find for a lot of them you really can't it it's hard to I identify with them\nAnd and for most Americans that is you know again the idea of a peaceful protest and standing up for what you believe\nPeople are quick to you know speak out and that if there is a pollster that calls whether it's kneeling in the NFL or any other as you know I Believe people should you know have the right to be heard\nBut how many people actually do it are active in protest most people are not the overwhelming majority or not\nAnd in fact if you didn't have a you know a Soros organization or any or the organization or that I mean we can go back to Ferguson Ferguson vein authorities they they told they were equipped to tell you look we've got people that aren't even from the state that have come here from a long ways away\nAnd that was clearly organized so when it comes down to\nHow many people are actually willing to get out there to the extent that are driven and motivated to the extent that they would get out there if not part of some kind of organization\nI'm well we're we're the Facebook crowd opposed recalls oh yeah yeah we'll answer the poll a Facebook\nPost there a one click the like button we might share it we might read tweeted\nBut the fact of the matter is is what is it I guess the question is what is it that really drives most Americans it's the everyday things in our lives and when we go back to the polls that you brought up earlier and we we talked about last week\nThat the majority of Americans it was somewhere around sixty percent that said well if there was nothing to cooperate the claims from this additional background check on cabinet we that sixty percent saying he should be confirmed\nWell that's a big deal now it's not eighty percent not Ninety percent of sixty percent will win you a fuel elections\nAnd the point being is that we stepped back from the insanity and display the show that's being put on by the left here and the behavior by the left I mean I'm not saying it's not real I'm not saying\nPeople aren't going to react to it or you know cirrhosis can can back whatever he wants to and people can act the way they want to and even on the Senate Judiciary committee they can say the most insane things if they believe it's going to get them political points well it just might\nIn your state of Hawaii or California\nBut if you believe it's going to win the argument with the people of America you're flat out wrong\nAnd and that's why I think ... and and again this is a not a ... analysis of facts like this is just\nMy my gut feeling from\nWhat I what I've seen what I've heard the personal response that I just\nGenerally talk to people over the last uh a couple of weeks were more independent or non political who have paid attention to this and even though they do sympathize and because this is one of the things would just really\nTicked off a ton of people including a ton of women that I Know and that are that are more ... a more conservative was\nIf you didn't believe her\nThan your for rape ...\nIf you don't believe in the rape if you don't believe in the rape allegation alone without cooperating evidence if you don't absolutely believe the allegation\nThen you're as much a rapist yourself because you're enabling rape and our society right well that ticked off a ton of women that I Know who just went wait a minute and I and I gave you the example two of my my buddy independent Bob\nWho said what what what is this something that you always believe the woman you don't believe anything but evidence\nAnd to me that's where the Democrats jump the shark is\nMost of most Americans which is why you see the sixty percent and I bet you that sixty percent\nBet you that other forty percent that said we don't want to confirm Kavanaugh had nothing to do was just the fact that they'd rather have a more liberal judge or Trump pick somebody they don't want him but I guarantee you that the majority of Americans looked at that process and said\nNo you don't always believe the woman you have to have evidence you don't believe always believe the man you don't always believe a woman you don't always lead anybody gets the evidence that you make the judgment on and yeah these senators are accusing him of being a rapist without the evidence without the evidence and in fact they're ... and being a gang rape is\nWithout

only way that you can do it in America and I do believe that ... Americans\nUnderstand that they understand basic fairness and when they see I'm not just the radicals but the mainstream of the Democratic party the mainstream of the party that are arguably has more people supporting it\nMhm\nNot by much but maybe more people supporting it then the Republicans mhm just looking at the last election on the popular vote out the electoral college vote or when they see that they say\nI don't really wish to be a part of that that's just that's crossing the line that that's no type of and and and when you find out that you know the the fact is they're the ones that burned Dr Ford\nIt was a Dianne Feinstein she burn ... the victim Chinese the one that wouldn't keep\nThe anonymity of the victim right it was the Democrat who leaked it it was the Democrats right it was the fines of Feinstein's office or one of her staffers or it was the the the congresswoman mhm\nRight was it was ... or her staff that said it had to be one of those two right\nAnd so when you look at it you all you see is from the Democrats is manipulation across the board character assassination across the board not the no belief and the presumption of innocence the stereotyping the\nBigotry all women all need to be believed a white man white\nMen are white men can't and people look at that stage and it's just like stomp it well I think\nYou two we have to keep in mind the and this isn't a ... this was recent history we don't have to go back and so the Democrats in\nThe sixties recent history you have in it because again the same side that said we're going to stand up for women\nCalled the women who voted for Trump self massages yep they in fact the candidate herself after she lost said well the problem is is that women listening to their husbands the husbands tell them how to vote [laughter] stupid\nBecause your husband has to tell you how to vote your son even your boss tells you how to vote your stupid and can't make a decision for yourself well which is it Democrats\nThere to be believed\nOr not if they vote with their hearts and minds and the twenty sixteen election against Hillary no theirself massage units which first they will tell you for whatever reason they hate women\nLiterally just re headlines right here or San Francisco chronicle activists blame white women after Susan Collins says she'll vote for Kavanaugh right ah [laughter] ah critics blame white women the rap after Susan Collins a a a cabin up of a speech\nYeah because we're amber was women women were worthy of press women were the victims\nIn general until they lost and now it's that women of color are the victims\nThey blame white women well I don't know Dr forged genetic makeup or her\nHer ethnicity background but she appears to be and a white woman and\nAnd what it comes across as is you just will do anything to get a win right you won't show compassion to a victim\nYou will slander people you will defame people you will say that the presumption of innocence should not be part of the the the the process you say at one point that all women should be believed than you demonize other women\nAre there is no consistency to the mindset except we will do anything to get a win and I do believe that's why you had the reaction of many independents who say there is a complete total lack of any type of fairness\nThat's compared to just half a million twenty five to sixty four year old into miniscule twenty five hundred more people under twenty five the aging population will likely strained California's already fragile network of skilled nursing facilities and other long term services and support programs Joe Myers to ABC News\nAnd upper limit hearing that has been set for Thursday if they'd Torrance courthouse where the veteran LAPD officer who's charge were sexually assaulting his friends Thirteen year old daughter prosecutors say fifty one year old can of Congress doing it to a friend's house in Torrance last April result of the girl in the middle of the night in sports you had the rams\nOn the sea hawks thirty three and a thirty one sunny and Seventy eight for high today it's sixty two and ... it's sixty six and seal beach and sixty four downtown or mark Mayfield seven Ninety ...

to conduct a revenge ah inquisition All right you know don't don't try to impeached\nIt's not going to it's not going to work out for you if you attempt to do that and he said probably unconstitutional to try to impeach him for something that he did when he was not an office right you know that he did as a teenager that is that the point you're going to try to bring\nYou know bring up I mean there is no I mean they're going to try that you're going to try to make the perjury claim but uh again where there's no evidence of perjury uh you know whatsoever and uh and and so uh it's like really you're going to bring that up\nAnd he used to just and they do not and he made it known he said look I don't want to Brett Kavanaugh on them mhm 'cause I don't want it goes but if the Democrats want to pick a Supreme Court justices win the presidency\nRight that is what you have to do and and that would be you know going forward\nA your best bet in fact if you're on the left and we you and I talked about this off the air last week to play would be look OK Kavanaugh said it but we can't let this happen again we can't have a third justice seeded by the current president I mean that would be the argument from the left or I guess the\nA proposition or concern issue to the rank and file 'em but the left doesn't operate that way the failure with all due respect that Mr Dershowitz and his appeal to the left\nI'm really is to is to not recognize what the left is all about they don't care about the process they don't care about whether or not there's a case there or not they don't care about anything else just keeps screaming whining crying\nOr you know foul and that's what they'll do now that's what we want them to do because it's working it's actually working

did but it only heard it ... ... both the ... and there were mirrors\nHerded because it was the same thing if you get one case and that person has no cooperation you simply have that one case in your judging that one case one of the second one comes out and uh\nThird one comes out and it mirrors exactly\nWhat the other cases which is\nI selectively remember yes there is no cooperating witness now the stories maybe a little bit different\nBut that's what you got with all three cases well you're done yes you're done in the corner popular opinion because it does it so yeah I did the ... case make the forward did did remembers case heard it and then the ... case heard it even more yes\nBut it all starts with the fact that the first case was not credible\nYes\nSo if we're mirrors would have come out first that might have been the first one and an orange would have been viewed as not credible because she couldn't remember the majority of the incident from that night except that was one hundred percent Brett Kavanaugh well and and\nI think that's you you look at that uh like the the and again and the court of public opinion when when we're forming opinions but it is often foreign through information that as\nA given to us by the media and and the people that represent\nAnyone making the claims but if you look at the\nWine steam cases right mhm what did we we started everything started to be corroborated through through uh the well not just the number of people coming forward and others who said that they were aware of this kind of activity pretend ultimately his own from\nThat essentially had to pay schedule find schedule based on this kind of behavior if he were to be caught\nAnd and so there were things where again if if if Ford made the claims and couldn't get anything to substantiate those planes that were nothing there and then Ramirez came forward and their war and then the third accuser came forward and she had things to back up her client\nThat case would have been hard for the president or capital now to deny those cases collectively as one big situation that Kavanaugh would have been face\nBut that didn't happen\n... ... were we and the only ones that the only reason the Ford came out just because it was late yes\n... and so that it would not it on all likelihood would have never come out if it had gone through the proper a judiciary a of way if it ... advice I Would have taken it immediately and taken into Grassley then they would have gone to the FBI to do a background check but everything would have been anonymous\nAnd what and what the what you just heard too was the failure to recognize how Ford's story changed you know and and they talk about how the remarry story change how the sweat story changed\nBut look at how the Ford story change but but the point was on the political picture of being believable\nThe scenario that was that was their\nStarted with a he said or she said he said\nWell then are we developing a pattern with the second and third no they fell apart and then we look back at the first one and realized it also changed and was falling apart what they what they were trying to point out here was she could have been the victim the one person to centrally if she were to give him a Dr Ford\nOr to have given her testimony and nothing else happened she could have been the one and it could have been at least plate or spend with out\nThe evidence to back it up in a way that might have influenced votes but because of the behavior and they mentioned\nCollins making the uh the you know talking about having these role in her speech\nBut it does\nThat happen all of that happened because of what because of the left and made it happen because the people sitting on this panel helped make it happen\nWhile you're in you think about it too because of the narrative that every woman must be believed mhm and after Ford and again her story was like ... the story itself is incredible yet right being told that was your major talking point you've got to believe\nThat the the alleged victim the alleged victim as a woman alleged victim must be believe we've seen the science we know it\nMust be ... and then you get a second and third\nThat also are not credible then you start destroying that narrative at that point for it and I believe that's what they're probably saying even though they're the ones that claim you need to believe all the women all the time and they help even not air they're they're yeah they're ... you know even Chuck Todd is making the point well that really isn't true yeah well ... is the\nThis is the version of a right after the twenty sixteen election or we need to go to the heartland and listen to their voices huh that's basically what you see except for the fact\nThat it had greater substance and ... and relevance to it I mean they ... they were right by the way in in in November twenty sixteen when they said that but there was no expectation that we're going to do just that in this case they're looking back on it and and recognizing\nAnd again they were part of carrying that narrative\nHelping to form those narratives along the way and then saying yeah well we shouldn't have played it that way it shouldn't have been played that way\nYou when when you look at well I have an empty a stormy Daniels' case that\nAnd no one absolutely no one is shocked that a playboy billionaire had an affair\nNo and\nAgain not shocked not surprised and also not politically motivated either way by it\nBut the left creates these narratives they give out and out of the\nThe the ability to introduce the credibility if you will from their perspective not ours to introduce the sweating to claim it must be because he's got a legitimate claim and legal claim against Trump now there must be something that he's got was sweating it must be legit\nIt's if it's against Trump Trump so it has to come out because there there must be some legitimacy to it even if there is that like I said the the only other point that I'd like to make is because this is what I Wonder and again this is a completely totally unfounded allegation without anything to back it up whatsoever but everybody will understand my point\nWhat does Joe Manchin have on Schumer [laughter]\nI'm fine dining and what does he ever had a Democrat leadership nobody's calling for a primary challenger to him in the next election nobody has criticizing Joe Manchin from the left at All right he's a Democrat wire their screams that he should be kicked out of the party where is that\nRight exactly how come all the Republicans are taking the flack from the ... the left but the one Democrat who voted for Kavanaugh not same\nNothing nothing like that or go back to West Virginia just yeah I mean because because the reality of it I mean you know they they I I saw somebody liberals on on a social media late a while as late friday and also into you know Saturday continue\nOn Collins we need to find somebody who as Susan Rice spoke up who will challenge her next election Susan Robin Kelly's riled up and lays runs Susan Rice so it's a woman who\nGot on TV and lie and my wrist attack American please that's kind of credibility of the Democrats made and\nAnd then and then I thought to myself well wait a minute how many of these liberals on social media would vote for Susan Collins had she voted no on Kavanaugh zero you know it's this disingenuous well now we're going to challenge or like you weren't any way right\nNow we're going to vote in election that's right now we're gonna have to

the left one uh what is it because you could make the argument that if\nHe were not confirm what the left feel more empowered\nI think that's the argument or I Would make there's a a good arguments

factors that really on motivate\nThose young people because keep in mind this is the same group that we've been talking about since twenty six team that they don't care who you are you could have been on their side yesterday but today your there'll pressure or your the people that don't work for them that don't that are no longer useful I knew them\nYou know we we ... we saw this all over the last couple of weeks which first off it was you know women are to believe be believed\nThen it became will only some women are to be bullied conservative women are to be believed and then as you and I were talking about some of the stories that came out and some of the blame now being thrown at white women white women are the reason that you know a a cabin up a was a was confirmed\nAnd it gets back to what my friend a independent Bob called me and\nYou know over the years now he has moved more during the Obama years he became more a ... he became more moderate Republican\nI Would say and in some cases even conservative I Am in a state of that well maybe we shouldn't call I'm independent Bob anymore but he still proclaims all the time that he's an independent\nRight and when he called me be called me yesterday and and\nThis said hey you could just he was so intense he said how could I ever vote for democratic get so how can I vote for any\nParty that tells me women are always right and white men are always wrong ... right he said white men aren't always right\n[laughter] and women\nAre not are going to be white men are always a wrong white men are always right ... women aren't always wrong women aren't only write your aren't always right you've\nGot to take it on a case by case basis you said I Know that he said everybody knows it and he's but he told me he said but I couldn't change\nAnybody's mind on this because he was involved in a ton of social media debates\nAnd he was you know talking about his friends on the left that would stick to some of the new ... point that wouldn't even matter and I told him I said well look the point I'm looking at is not trying to convince them 'cause you're never going to convince them which are trying to do is convince the the middle trying to convince people like you\nAnd I told him I said I remember you twelve Thirteen Years ago your look right now is completely\nCompletely different\nOr another family member of mine who was who was always more conservative but always said well it's good to have the Democrats are it's good to have the Democrats are it's good to have the Democrats there are within a conversation with them over the weekend\nAnd I explained I said well\nYou know what the Democrats did here as soon as I said that they just started going\nOff and just said I Can't believe that I Can't believe they've gone to this\nTo this point and it's the mainstream of the Democrats nice summer I went in and and he told me he said you know I always I always like it that you know I agree mostly with the Republicans but it's always good to have an opposition party there but he said what good is that opposition party is it gives you know the Republicans don't always do the right thing\nHe said and sometimes they need to be kept in check he sort of who keeps them and check the Democrats ... ... the mainstream of the Democrats have gone crazy and I think that is the key\nHere so when I looked at a couple of weeks from now for weeks from now\nAnd and the election or I look at history and history shows the vast majority of times when you get to this point and you've got a Republican president you've got a Republican House you've got a Republican Senate\nIn all likelihood the Republicans should Lucy yeah\nAh that's what history shows it's almost the same as when people call this up and and uh the one general number forget you remember the call to about a month before the election of ... he said you guys are going to be surprised when Trump wins and said no we're not because history shows he should win based on the economy\nBecause the economy actually has been so bad and people have felt it and they view that there's a need for change\nSo you look at history and you think yeah now the Democrats should take now should they take enough seats to actually take over the house\nI don't know but then you see the big huge unknown and that is the Kavanaugh nomination I have I I still can't come up in my mind when the Republicans have been\nSo United the only thing that comes to my mind is Nineteen Ninety four\nUh I'd only been in talk radio for five years\nAnd I remember Ninety four caught everybody off guard except for ... members oddly had her death threats as a result we became a poster yeah he ... he he came closest to to catching what was actually happening now that was a United GOP at that point [laughter] just nobody knew that they were United [laughter]\nRight off to all go out go out and vote and were motivated at that point\nI have not seen a Republican Party that was as fractured as is Republican Party has bent\nAnd was in a period of two weeks is a completely United party not because they love the leader or necessarily of the the party who would be the president not because they all of them a majority do\nBut\nIt it it it's because they had seen what the other party is and they look at the guy that they hate it just a little while ago and said\n[noise] you know something he's not that bad I I I Wish he would say this I Wish you wouldn't tweet this but these people when you see what they actually want you know they called Trump a fascist and at times I didn't like it ... times I I'm a speaking premium speaking for never Trump hers\nYou know never Trump per se but you know he he talks with the ... even if he isn't and sometimes he sounds intolerant even if even if he isn't well then you see what the Democrats do when you say well actually this is what they mean right there's no new launched nuanced\nOpinions here to what they mean they don't believe in due process they don't believe in a presumption\nOf innocence they stereotype they say it was you know and they stereotype\nTo fit their particular narrative at the moment and we'll\nChange a day later\nYeah it it's ... if you look at the I I think um\nWhere the Republicans have come together over two weeks over the last couple of weeks it's not even just the Kavanaugh nomination ended up itself or\nProtecting the process during the Supreme Court nomination even\nIt's not just Lindsey Graham and no and and and the things he said I mean part of it uh it it it's all of those and more it is but the bigger picture is including by the way ... you know and and her speech which got a lot of praise on on friday\nBut it really is you know the\nFact that I it it seems as if the party are saying yeah it's time to build a wall\nTo wall\nAround the party and what it really and four and a wall around the constitution to protect it each time that the party joined hands here and not that everybody has to agree on everything but there there has to be\nA greater respect and I think campaigning to go out and show what the and demonstrate clearly over and over again what the what the other side is doing and saying look we can all have our discussions on those issues within our house\nBut on the outside you need to know where the danger lies to you every single day and it is from this kind of behavior\nYou know the interesting thing is for all the accusations of being a fascist an authoritarian that have been leveled at Trump\nThen maybe some never Trump ... bought into ... and a majority Republican is ridiculous because he wasn't if you see if you see what he's about if you see the things that he loves if you see the legislation that he's put into effect if you see his executive orders and what comes out of the White House about separation of powers in what they believe\nYou know that's not true but I think that what and I think you're right on here this wasn't just about the nomination it was the belief\nThat the Democrats truly are and it really hit when he realized it was the main stream\nIt was those in the Senate Judiciary committee it is what is viewed as the leadership of the Democratic party that the mindset of authoritarianism and fascism that mindset that they were throwing at Trump\nActually belongs to their parties and they don't get shredded officially here and I and I I think it is I think it has scared\nSome Republicans who didn't want to be a part of you know the uh of supporting the Republican Party I think it scared them strays right I really do I really I I usually when I went whoa we ... never thought they'd do this and\nYou know the last motivator that we could even come close to it I guess
