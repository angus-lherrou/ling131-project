Shapiro shows the Democrats are always going to make a last ditch effort to stop having all this effort on Wednesday night was pretty weak saw\nSenator Dick Durbin Dianne Feinstein Pat Leahy Sheldon Whitehouse Richard Blumenthal Mazie Hirono Cory Booker Kamala Harris wrote a letter suggesting that the confidential background investigation of judge Kavanaugh from the FBI prior to hearing not the new one show there was information related in some way to inappropriate sexual behavior or alcohol abuse\nThere weren't a vague letter saying that there was some information um inappropriate sexual behavior or alcohol abuse in his prior FBI background check and only one problem he wasn't a single question at his original confirmation hearing about inappropriate sexual behavior or alcohol abuse\nAnd by using the phrase by phrasing it such that the Democrats were saying that in the past FBI background check there was evidence of quote inappropriate sexual behavior or alcohol abuse that somehow the Democrats knew something they weren't telling them well it turns out they didn't know any which is completely an surprising because that's where we are at this point\nIn time no wonder the Republicans are United on that Lindsey Graham\nWho has turned into something kind of awesome like Lindsey Graham to point out it's so much better than Lindsey Graham one point now it's not it's not even close like a new software update in just fantastic so Lindsey Graham the senator from South Carolina\nWritten into Dianne Feinstein for for reading in the cab not as opposed to the anger on Fox News you're Lindsey Graham\nAlike then fine China I don't think she leads to divorce named in the media but somebody around her man if you saw this man is yelling I saw a man who was offended to score defended his good name [noise] took it to the people who are trying to destroy his family\nWhat would you do if you're in that situation do not let these people\nDo what they've done to judge Kavanaugh and reward them by saying he's no longer fit because he's in the world's worst position of defending himself against a bunch of garbage from people who don't care about fairness\nOkay and that's exactly right Senator Graham was even better when he did it or some sort of public about what the Atlantic he said that have not been treated like a ball and the audience started building and he went directly after the audience which was just ...\nI don't live with the president said last night on the first person to say I want to hear from Dr Ford I thought she was handled respectfully ... Kavanaugh was treated like crap\nYeah although yourself\nGood for him and Lindsey Graham is dropping the hammer gotta love of that sort of stopped and then the hypocrisy of many members like on the phone number ... ... members left on this is just astonishing people were saying oh it's just a job interview really didn't sound like you got interview I Know when I interview somebody for a job the first thing I Do is throw uncorroborated allegations of sexual assault in them\nAt the first thing that I Do when we interviewed Senate she came in here and I was like well you know I heard you write the chicken\nAnd then we just started from there and then she got mad I was like sorry we can't have you here I'm Sorry that the ... we were very run people for the gauntlet around here in our job interview\nI Would say the same about about math math is first came in here I was like the map that you were kept in your backyard that was our opening question\nUh and it's and and he handled himself well and you know that's why he's been able to rise to the company the Democrat hypocrisy on this stuff is really astonishing from a lot of ... and not say every Democrat is being dishonest and some certainly are one is clearly a let's mulatto who says that she is filled with great at the GOP here she was on ... thing\nI just I don't know like she's on charm and now she's a thing\nOkay well here she was on MSNBC explaining how much she hates at the G opiates suddenly tolerant of supposing sexual assault\nI mean I'm not sure if you were to have a real conversation with any American whether they the Democrat or Republican that they would that they wouldn't side which is kind of behavior where where we ... we reached lower were actually mocking\nPeople on and and their stories of of of of of pain who are we who do we want to be as a country what are we trying to project to the young people in this world to the area to learn\nAbout all this self doubt about that jumped at the back and twenty twelve she wrote this on Twitter ... on Twitter Bill Clinton I Love you so much\nLike crazy amount of law clearly these are people who take very seriously allegations of sexual assault so yeah I'm I'm a ... there's no ... politic well here at all none\nBe back here tomorrow with olive latest\nI'm sure as always will be a lot of recognition will be here to shut it off Ventura show [laughter]\nTalk\n\nTo real estate [noise]\nABC News live at a local at ten o'clock I'm Jeff whittle former rap mogul should night with sons today to twenty eight\nYears in prison after pleading guilty to voluntary manslaughter for the hit and run death of Terry Carter income to the twenty Fifteen afterward Carter's relatives were asked if night was has shown any remorse for the murder\nYou know that you know a a a believe the you know what to believe the accuser\nYeah right oh that is a line that we all know that's a line of BS from the less you know you\nBelieve the liberal accuser you don't leave\nThe Republican accuser Republican woman accusing you don't believe it it's only\nIn the cases\nThat are important to them where you believe the accuser we all know it\nRight\nWell otherwise you consider Bill Clinton a criminal or a number of times over right\nNow can I ask another question you know I just we just mentioned Amy Schumer because of you know people know who she is but the ... model thing\nWhy does that you buddy give her eye on the right ability I I Know this probably maybe we mentioned her just once or twice passing\nJoking but why does anybody give her any type of credibility whatsoever I've always well then again if you're talking about the left I say you should give somebody credibility by the substance of their argument well that's the case you'd never hear from anybody on the left so I I forget about what I said there well\nI don't know why she's relevant is she in the current show\nI don't know I actually don't know I don't know why she's relevant otherwise\nI saw what does who's the boss to runs all the time [laughter] you know I'm just me and she was in the the one with the ... which is\nYeah yeah yeah so she was a witch right yeah yeah yeah\nOh I don't know I have no idea if she's in a TV show right now but I don't know I think that she was in something last year I don't I really I mean she she's relevant to the situation because she claims you know that she was sexually assaulted so\nNo I don't know that okay this is I mean I Know I Know that see I didn't part of it yeah so far that I Do okay yeah yeah I didn't know that she said she was sexually assaulted that's what I didn't know okay that makes that would that would be a connection that you could use ... you know right up into this topic because that's what it's about right okay\nBut I I but pop culture wise I don't know she still is or not I actually don't well as I said you know we because we hear people coming forward you know the you know saying look I've also been I was sexually assaulted two ... and I stand with her well as we said before whether you\nWere sexually assaulted or not still does not give you any more credibility when a charge is filed or you know when the charges filed against someone I don't mean legally but in this case a ... in um in his nomination to the Supreme\nCourt that the allegation itself has to be backed up by evidence your case for no matter how Amos an evil it might have been if you were sexually assaulted has nothing to do with this case right\nAbsolutely nothing because you were sexually assaulted does not give you a better insight as to whether Kavanaugh is guilty or not right none zero right\nAnd that is portrayed\nYou know it's one of the one false that's portrayed well then you well okay then you were late here in ... ... because you are sexually assaulted then or what you think about cabinet\nCarries more weight no it doesn't that's ridiculous I it's ridiculous statement to make or to be promoting it has promoted constantly in this the only thing that matters is the evidence and every Seattle case in you and I talked about this how long have we talked about this\nWhen you know whether it was Trayvon Martin where people were taking sides left and right and we just said look here's the problem ... you've got that was at the two or three or four minutes span there ... where he was running away and then next thing you know uh he was on top of the government that's the only thing that people saw at that point\nAnd because of that huge blank space in there that no witnesses are there nobody can say what happened so\nBy the physical evidence which was the life the uh the the injuries to Zimmerman's head but exactly we've said and even a juror or a jury member said\nIt's possible that he got away with murder it's just that with the evidence we couldn't prove because he claims that you know he felt says his life was an imminent danger\nAnd and we rejected at that point mhm the ... people uh who would call this show and with certainty say they knew the guilt or innocence right and we had people bringing up yeah the Trayvon Martin was an angel doesn't matter whether he\nWas or was not an angel right or at any other time of his life it doesn't matter what Zimmerman had said at any time in his life right all the matter is he said I'm\nGoing to give us your what I write Trayvon Martin right now we have been obviously right would have been which of course they didn't\nSay ... but people were definitive in their belief of guilt or innocence and based on a lack of evidence and what they think possibly happen we have rejected that we will always reject that as Americans\nAs far as I'm concerned you're obligated to reject that type of yes mindset I'm so you go by the evidence the evidence is what dictates everything\nThe motion is what carries the ah the the cause and and and such protests and and certainly for the families who suffer are the the loss of a loved one whether it's a Trayvon Martin's family or or Michael Brown family\nYou can feel for their loss but also no this is this is possible but many people find it impossible to feel for the last of the family but also believe and see by the evidence the what the evidence shows\nThat the evidence points to that person also being responsible now it didn't necessarily in in the in the Trayvon Martin case you had you know what the physical evidence was was ... and then that's what the jury found and we we don't have\nWe don't have a everything the jury saw no no yeah but in the Michael Brown situation with officer will Wilson on the same um you know the the family or was the first to commissioned an autopsy\nAnd that autopsies the one that show the hands up don't shoot\nNever heritage was a lot it's still being used today yes\nAs a rallying cry that never happened or that is unacceptable in America right you know we we talk about the Democrats are always talking about\nThe fascist on the right well if you listen to what we believe mhm and what we believe about the presumption of innocence whether it's a criminal trial a civil trial or just public opinion in general or a political trial\nStill it's the same thing you judge these cases you judge cases and you'd and and you judge the guilt or innocence based on the evidence that exist not just an allegation alone\nAnd and the thing is I'm saying this with passion\nBut I really don't have to because every single Democrat listening right now every single liberal and democratic protesting\nYesterday and they all know it but they are willing to throw it overboard mhm you know how they do it because of the first ones many of those who are in a you know who ah were arrested yesterday\nA will would demand due process under you know due process under the law ... but the fact is they know it but they will reject it when it comes to their personal politics\nFascism leads the mindset of fascism leads in them when it's what they want\nWhen it comes to how they're going to be treated no you must follow the constitution completely but treating somebody else a constitution be damned the spirit of the constitution be damned the mindset of the presumption of innocence and that evidence is the only thing that leads and\nShould lead is thrown out the window because we want what we want\nYou know when it comes down to I was following a case here in Texas where a man had been wrongly found guilty of murder and all that and you have a Nineteen years in prison and got out and twenty six team they want him to be fully exonerated was working to that end\nAnd finally it happened it was full exonerated so that's a total of Twenty one years where he was either behind bars are having as you know his name essentially associated with\nA murder that happened if he was not responsible for so I was doing some research just to try and refresh my memory on other cases and there was a man who was accused of rape\nAnd spent decades behind bars um it was rape and assault and something else or I think a aggravated assault and rape or in a third charge that I Can't remember but he was\nBehind bars for thirty one years before he was proved it was proven that he was not the person responsible now mistakes happen in the justice system or we don't have we have the DNA technology now\nOr that can prove that it wasn't a you know or their DNA at the scene or whatever it is\nBut you think about you know the\nLabel that goes with being falsely accused\nRape and other charges anyone who may have been victimized by him is a urge to call the LAPD he also worked as an overdrive are by the way\nAnd Senate Republicans say the FBI supplemental investigation of Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh did not cooperate

our economy and I'm Gary McNamara\nA chick six Ninety or a road I think what is the last caller is referring to the letter a Chuck Grassley Sunday a letter to the lawyers of a doctor for did said I'm\nA I'm writing in response to it to your letter dated October second you said Dr for just as yesterday said you said Dr Ford is going to turn over her and a documents\nTo the FBI but my request to view was not for the documents to be turned over to the FBI actually to provide the documents to the Senate Judiciary committee response on behalf of the client is an onset with her the constitution charges the Senate with the ... and the president and his nomination\nSenators have a constitutional obligation to investigate and evaluate independently the president's nominees are obligation as unrelated to anything the FBI does\nThat's why we just don't vote on nominees after the president loans us or the FBI background investigation we have to make our own assessment the U.S Senate does not control the FBI if you have an objection of how the FBI conducted investigations take it up with director rate\nBut don't raise that objection is a reason not to respond to this committee's demand for relevant evidence yet the eyes investigative decisions aren't our concern\nEven at the FBI never interviewed Dr ... interviews or ten times this committee as a constitutional obligation to investigate Dr Ford's allegations and that's what we've been doing since we became aware of or allegations\nIt's not even clear to me what purpose tornado do over those materials to the FBI would accomplish the FBI would simply turn that over ... over\nTo watch as we just said that we we stopped that's the only purpose the FBI search that's always an outsider probably stop the last caller says\nWell their ... their political will\nThis is not an investigation by political ... the ... the the FBI only facilitates the interviews they conduct the interviews because they they have the resources and the training and that's it's that simple\nRight and and so it doesn't make it again this this is where her lawyers are bringing up something that isn't even relevant\nTo the investigation to begin with because for the million time there is no FBI investigation the only investigation that's been going on is the Senate Judiciary investigation because it it just shows you how\nAre the\nThe lawyers for Dr Ford or either\nCompletely clueless or they didn't want those notes to come out because have they been given to the FBI\nAgain assume the FBI decided to respond to them and take those notes those therapists notes they would have been part of the report\nThey wouldn't they wouldn't have seen the light of day beyond the eyes of a hundred people\nA it's not even and by the way emerges from my phone so I just happen to go on Twitter industry that Mollie Hemingway was on it it's not even clear what purpose turning those materials over to the FBI would accomplish the FBI would simply turn that evidence over to the Senate\nThat is precisely the outcome that I think with this request is to get the information right you have claimed repeatedly that the evidence I've requested supports Dr Ford's allegations against judge Kavanaugh\nShe even provided some of the evidence to\nGive me a second here as I have to go to a to a a national media\nIndeed if the evidence or supported your clients allegation you surely would produce it as quickly as you could but you have repeatedly refused to produce this evidence to the Senate in doing so you are preventing the Senate from considering the evidence most crucial to Dr Ford's allegation\nI don't know what other imprint we should draw from your refusal but that the withheld evidence does not support Dr Ford's allegation and quite the way you will claimed ooh that's a challenge is not right I urge you once again now for the third time in writing\nTo turn over the therapy notes polygraph materials and communications with the ah with the Washington Post that Dr Ford\nHas relied upon as evidence in addition to the evidence I requested in my Tobar second letter in light of recently

Thursday night that although he will walk his daughter down the aisle at her wedding Saturday his plans will not affect Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh's confirmation vote\nScheduled for the same day ... speaking to Shannon brain which means just had to be late last night right a and a Fox News ... said he personally called cabin up Thursday evening and told him I'm going to be there to vote for you as needed so that isn't going to delay anything it was funny because you said\nWell you know it wears his daughter getting married and in Montana it legit you inside right I don't think he wants anybody you know\nProbably doesn't want anyone to know and because and that really spells out how crazy this thing is a and has become the left believes going direct especially after confronting a Jeff Flake that it's working\nThat they're you know the the the tactic is not only working but acceptable\nAnd we'll shame you out of a restaurant will uh will confront you on the elevator will anywhere and everywhere\nAs directed or I guess encourage further encouraged by Maxine Waters anywhere and everywhere it doesn't matter where you are getting their face well that becomes dangerous or because it's impossible for somebody to be able to\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYeah that that's that's all all you can really help for this point in time but ah yeah it it is amazing how they really can elevate third game when their backs are against the war when they absolutely have to have it and they've been very consistent in that aspect of it and\nAh this I liked this lineup where they're at now Jack Peterson in the lead off all you have turned her head and ... months he has just been on fire I mean can we talk about is\nUm ability to really kind of do what ever asked of him by David Roberts and he just has been swinging such a hot bath here lately and it's a big reason why they were able to\nPush themselves over the top two when the national league west um or because of his play in part\nSo they're getting great contributions from guys up and down the line up obviously and um yeah I mean again if they can follow this blueprint that they laid out tonight that is the key ingredient for them to be able to have success here in the postseason sell\n... ... it's interesting too because when you think about Iraq we always said what are the Dodgers in terms of what is their formula what is there for me\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAnd some of the season here I've been insane if you take a look at some of the stats for him he is hitting I mean he's got like two three hits and just about each of those last ten games\nAnd he's putting a number I mean his own base percentages insane\nAnd the ... not to enter crazy in it and again if you compare this back to maybe Barry Bonds not so much when you're sitting crazy home runs nearly two thousands maybe a little earlier in his career back in the nineties when you're sitting in a lot of extra base it's getting on base in general on a consistent amount of time\nI probably his next really good postseason start will be his first really good both seasons dark so we've had a hard time Hargrove it as far as that goes and\nUm you look at the Yankees and they've had an injury problems in the past with to knock and there's some question marks there they can rely on some of those guys so it again I think the red Sox are better team but you can do draw a lot of parallels between these two teams\nSo it's going to be a fun serious kicking off tomorrow again both teams have won each other's ballpark so the end of the day I'm not sure a home field advantage really matters too much in the series absolutely not so we got to go into more obviously Cleveland a Houston game one starts today Nike cap Atlanta against the Dodgers\nComing up we'll get into Thursday Night Football little recap from New England Patriots taking care of the Colts will get into Nick

September goes and they're not great but once that count\nReturns to October they tend to improve mightily\nOr after the quarter pull the season on that side of the football and uh they got a lot of weapons and Sony Michel you gotta love the rookie they're out of Georgia doing some things I mean this guy could be a big fine for them a ... I mean already he's had a couple of impressive starts to begin the season\nAnd I mean what was the last time the teachers had a really solid running back in the back of it's been a long time\nYeah he's coming into his own so um but the pages look good looks start our fourteenth zero it immediately um even the difference was getting after um you know Andrew Luck in the beginning but then\nThat started contrary that phrase it I thought it was going to get absolutely annihilated I mean I wasn't sure he was going to survive halftime yeah and he came into\nHis own and he used to he does with Andrew Luck does but yeah the the the patriots look good you know you had a great game from James White I mean I thought ... let me tell you something I thought that when\n... when John Gordon got on and then Julian Julian Edelman was a back then there was no more no more cardio Peterson no more Chris Hogan no more ... or set\nI just thought that those guys wouldn't get enough time but McDaniel he did a great job of using utilizing everyone on that team that kind of looked like you know that looked like it looked like\nThe way to care for coaches ... you know 'cause everybody knows Pete Carroll uses his whole fifty fifty three man roster everybody plays probably except for the backup quarterback right there but everybody plays\nAnd that's what you saw in the patriots office today I mean he Brady spread the ball around and James ... Edelman Josh Gordon like you say went out and gotta catch\nAnd you know 'cause Hogan got one a Sony Michel Phillip or sick ordeal Peters Paterson I mean they all look great and let me tell you something\nThere they ... looked like the best officers in the lead it's amazing down here that\nHas them they're the best off instantly you could not stop them they had ... answers to everything to do and it's like how do you prepare for somebody like that when you have all those ... look man they got at least three or four pro bowlers on his office\nYeah and the crazy thing is Gronkowski is clearly he was limited with the ankle and he wasn't even a hundred percent and you had an impact one way or another on the game just wait till he does get a hundred percent\nThere there's no answer like Julian Edelman ... is really the stairs at straws that drink I mean that that's the bottom line and\nUm it's amazing how good they were last year when they didn't have him and obviously I guys like Danny ... really help to fill that void you don't have them this year and and that's why it was such a struggle in September without annulment in there\nBut your point Keith about\nMake Daniels able to incorporate the other guys on the off instill it works now because they don't have to be the focal point at all\nExactly they're not the focal point what you saw this time is what Gronkowski\nWas very hard to be double team he had some long balls today as well why because we use to Josh going out there in element how can you doubled you can't double right they have to respect their guys and you have to probably players only against that you know so I was crazy\nBrady is going to break the record writer or capture him not probably next season I or not this season um but it is definitely going to happen\nShoes you'll probably you'll probably breaking this season maybe it'll be close\nThere'll be close if they do the ... and he'll probably breaking through season I'm shooting for it I think he will he definitely pretty surprising far Russia you know that but he's going to get close to getting up to ... for short and you'll probably break it and you know Brady wants to break into the season\nOf course now the thing is though is is you know breezes right behind him like four Ninety six oh yeah I have two of them kind of going back and forth and um I I just wonder how for some reason do we think that that breed is going to outlast Drew Brees playing ...\nWell ... it depends um Brady definitely said he wants to go with another two forty five to forty five ... that's ... you know I don't know you know there was some there was something that came out you know earlier this year that said that\nHe has some doubt that he wasn't even play this year you know you look you waited to me it was on Oprah interview the Oprah interviewing and so um yeah some I think it's really all defending now when he at this point in time\nI think it's all based on family you know that's what I think it's based on like man\nYou want to see your kids grow up you want to see them you want to spend more time with them look this right now he can't spend a lot of time with them because why he's so occupied with football and you start seeing your kids start to grow up to you want to be around in where I was growing up and you want to you know and so I can see\nI can see it really based or family at this moment in time I don't know I don't think ... you would go to forty five\nBut I think ... is gonna come down to every season it could be it's like a Gronkowski situation in a way to me you're a year year by year I definitely think his year by year and um\nI think they're both leave at the same\nTime I think so too but I think also I think it also comes down to is do they win the Superbowl they were they were super altogether there I think after that he may hang it up\nHe may um that's how I go back and forth now and became part of me says yeah you would take you would have to but I ... for example if they wanted this year I don't know I think he might want to come by and keep keep playing\nIt it's crazy ... you could probably include ballot checking their that trio bell check cronk and bring wall probably the same\nI'll say this is the reason why McDaniel didn't\nDidn't uh go to ... why because he knows that went belly shake leaves and this is just me I'm not saying I heard something I'm saying this is me just looking at in outside looking in the heat I can see him being the next day it goes with any new patriot oh of\nCourse I I think that had to have been written in to a whatever persuaded him to come back knowing that of course he was somewhat at the very least unofficially guaranteed that he'd be the successor\nYeah for sure so that's what I'm looking at right there but hey you know I think we've got to get a year to year basis with Brady and including ... because ... was to do a lot of other things and um you know injuries come into play with him and Hindus Asians so we'll see what happens\nIn other news or on the college circuit right now Nick Saban has made some headlines within the last day or so you probably saw this he's sounding off on the Alabama students section and their lack of attendance\nAt some of the the prior Alabama home games here recently and look he probably saw the white out at Ohio State S. versus a ...\nWe are going to college and and he ... he was disappointed that they don't have that in Tuscaloosa yeah\nThat's exactly what he saw come on saving\nReally I'm really really really brat ...\nReally all he ... you're you're really going to go there with\nThe students section and everything you just need to focus on your team being number ... ... to win games and that's it it's so funny that when you look at things this is so funny about saving saving is always a type of guy when you're in a press conference in interviews\nThat he's like always about his team and what we're focused on the next game where we're moving on to this gang or move on to the game but you start to start attacking your student body because they're not ... you don't have enough people at the game\nTo get out of here with that man like really really\nI Try to even\nMaybe indirectly sometimes I think he tries to stir the pot yeah 'cause he does get\nBored of the same questions day after day I go to our use more because of that born schedule he has on his stuff on there [laughter] oh is that\nThey could be part of it you know you get bored when you play in Arkansas and you know a raging Cajun rage engage adults I you know when you start planting like that you know what was the other team they're playing a really ... loses other thing they're playing ...\nA citadel down yeah their their annual a picnic or ... or send it out on that they want to be tested in November or they'll look LSU going to that will be attached and the iron bowl Wal Mart you attach Auburn\nYeah those would be a test LSU right they're moving up into and I'm right now rank number five there back I'm Texan and you know but come on man that's why he's bored and that's why he's attacking the student body it's ridiculous man you don't do that like I'm Sorry\nReally is just like just focus on your team and those type of things are just student body needs will you know what to do something you know what to do about don't put them on blast why don't you have a rally makes saving go have a rally I mean those those will bring students outright\nThat you know students probably I'm sure they go to the gangs for free right now I Believe so I mean most students go for the games are free they don't like Tony Eighteen really\nWait hold on hold or\nYour luggage UCLA you know student ID you getting those get yes you do usa news to use it you see that you got to go I Know that I'm sure they do they definitely do not\nYou know UCLA or did it just a couple of years ago they will have you had a student ID you is getting in the game for\nFree that's news to me you know then I ... I remember I remember that I remember when they play they were they got a good deal going on over there what to talk with you about that maybe next week at first I heard about that one\nYeah but come on you can't well if that's the case in lower the prices were they didn't go to the games and you know so you know there's a lot of things that you don't have a\nCouple of players took to Twitter Alabama players are Thomas Fletcher the long snapper for the tidy took Twitter after the white out game last week in happy valley and said you know must be nice to have people come to your home game so possibly that ignited a the or the firestorm if you will\nFor his his name and really for our spoiled brats man that's what they're becoming right now spoiled brats you know then you know what to tell your friends your buddies are coming to a game and pass it on a long ... it just doesn't make any sense to me right like\nWell they don't play a lot of night games either down there yeah they play a lot of ... you don't see too many prime time Alabama home football games at least outta against that I talk to your opponent and the regular season what\nWhat I'm saying is they're worried or concerned about what they need to be worried about is there a poet they're playing not the students or who's in the stance\nThat doesn't make any sense to me that's it goes down from the top to bottom you know what I was going to be funny because that was going to end up by the Alabama wind Rights Watch\nThey'll end up doing to possibly losing the game they may lose a game I don't know it may be gives LSU maybe something you know why because they're concerned about the student body not\nBeing that it may may lose again this year but I don't actually think it will be because of this because I look if saving us talking about something like this because he is one hundred percent comfortable in doing so what was the last time he's ever talked about several yeah talk about or he thought Iraq detriment\nTo get it right on the money one hundred percent comfortable why because you're playing teams like Arkansas state\nYou know the guy yeah we're good we're good will chalk up that victory number one team in the country playing our to your state and they still see me whenever one third of army to kind of go in conjunction with this report came out today that said when he again tops the annual pay less\nJust over eight point at a point three million dollars for twenty teens urban Meyer second by the way at seven point six million oh wow\nTwo guys right there at a forty three million a year you're upset because students are not coming to the gang [laughter] you're making a point three million\nAnd you think they'll come out now because if you set off ... absolutely\nNo I'm not comments [laughter]\nHey that's going to do it for Tonight Show go Dodgers that we'll for another big victory in game two tomorrow from Dodger Stadium we're back at it tomorrow night fame play same time to them for Keith I'm Brad keep living the dream will talk to you tomorrow [noise]\nBehind the mind furnished by values media [noise]\nLos Angeles orange\nMueller station [noise]\nBut not the process so the effect of the process but they can't stop in and say you have any more than they can say this judge can't have a hearing the Senate can't say well there's judge can't have a hearing the executive branch this judge can't have a hearing know while they they get the process\nAnd then after the process the result of that process is what you're going to challenge in court there is no standing here well there there's no standing\nBecause because the Senate is moving ahead by the will of the Senate because the majority rules\nYeah in the Senate and what I'm saying is no the president doesn't given us all the information will know the majority in the Senate which called the shots mhm believe that the executive branch\nHas fulfilled all of their request ... they have stated that publicly that's why there's going to be a vote there is no fight\nAnd there is nothing that the executive branch is doing to hinder what the legislative branch is doing everything going on and the legislative branch which is the Senate is being controlled by the majority in the Senate which is how the constitution has dictated it right I mean there's just so sick\nOf it does not set the vote or the timeline of the vote no he does not a set the uh the the the Senate majority leader schedule\nFor when when McConnell on Wednesday or gave notice for cloture that the president doesn't have anything to do with what's a federal judge is going\nTo do an injunction and they go yeah right [laughter] and and then and then they go ahead with the vote like she going to take McConnell and put 'em in put him in contempt of court yeah somebody got an arrest McConnell\nYeah because uh a ... a ... from what I understand the story Merkley had had gone to the courts before this and what are you how what are you trying to do is get this that's why they've scheduled a hearing on Wednesday buddy that was I think a move\nWhere they filed either last week or early earlier this week\nAnd then when it looked inevitable and it did of course it was inevitable on as a Wednesday afternoon or that there was going to be a vote a this weekend that's when Merkley said well no no no no no because we haven't had you know our our day in court with the Trump Administration the Trump\nAdministration the executive branch does not\nSet when the Senate is going to vote this is really weak I mean is this is the Hail Mary I mean that this is what you just do but here's the thing\nYou're not gonna want to miss work tomorrow [laughter]\nAnd I well well I mean unless you put it this way [laughter] it's friday you might want to miss a little sleep during the day or at least when you get up turn every device that you own on and make sure it's connected because\nIt's only going to ramp up between now and the final vote on Saturday or early Sunday when whenever it happens\nThis is ... because you're right a couple of things here again the legislative branch doesn't have the power to stop\nI I'm Sorry the judicial branch doesn't have the power to stop the legislative branch\nProcess right they don't get to say you know what their schedule is\nNow if they go through and again enact a law signed a law a bill into a a ... the president signs it into law they can come in and then challenged the effect of the process but then outside of that as you point out Gary it's two separate branches that are working here\nYou're suit your lawsuit should be against the Senate it's not it's against the executive branch who has no say so over the timeline of the vote on the Senate well I've\nBought but he ... he wouldn't have there he knows there's no chance that he could go to the court and said let's stop the process because I disagree with the majority right because that that's not going to go anywhere so what he's trying to make\nIs that there's a debate going on between the executive branch and the Senate mhm and because in the executive branch has interfering with the Senate where you can't make that point because the Senate which is the leadership of the Senate which is the Republicans have said\nWe've got everything we want from the executive branch and the FBI we're moving forward and he's trying to say that the executive branch is holding things up and not giving them the information well you don't get to make that call it's a minority member you don't get to go to the courts to try to override the majority in the Senate I really you know this is like\nThis is like if it's like I decided to get\nIt in the ring with a an event or Holyfield right and realize quickly that I'm greatly overpowered so I called and Mike Tyson to do my fight for me I mean this is the uh this this is like because it's basically you have a Democrat who's not getting his way\nAnd his only claim is that they're not getting documents the Senate's not getting the documents the Judiciary Committee chairman\nIs the one who rules that part of it in any vetting process and you know that this is the process but since you are not getting your way\nYou're trying to call mommy and daddy and to stop me no Trump or the amino Republicans because you disagree with it it's not going to change your vote it's going to delay the process\nBut it it won't even do that now as well because it's it's it's not going to happen yeah uh but but I ... and I first saw it I had was anybody who wonder stands separation of power\nOh wait a minute that's very few people are very few people understand the separation of powers yeah never mind yeah or if you want to get in we do have a line up and we'd love to hear for you up from you the cloture vote scheduled a sometime after ten thirty then thirty hours of debate and the vote sometime Saturday Night maybe early Sunday
