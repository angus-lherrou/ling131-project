Disneyland shorts in law she loves bell was all of them but apparently there are certain princesses off limits according to certain actresses in Hollywood here nightly says that she is not going to allow her daughter to watch the Little Mermaid or Cinderella\nWhich makes perfect sense because\nShe played in pirates of the Caribbean a woman who had to be saved by a man but here she is in here she is talking about she's not going to let her kids watch Disney movies I Love hip hop show they're covered the care nightly under strict parents and ruled that Disney movie and the reason is spot on and what is her reason let's hear it from care nightly\nAnd she's banned from seeing certain a children's movies right yeah what are they Cinderella mhm and ah it because you know she ... she writes around for a rich guy track record I out of essay right [laughter]\nAnnoyed about the case I really like the found but a little that I mean that sounds great but do not to give your voice for [laughter]\nOkay to lure made is immoral but for other reasons the Little Mermaid is about a girl who decides to disobey her father leave her culture\nAnd go gallop dancing around even though she knows that her father is going to be turned into like an ... so she said that that that Little Mermaid had system some serious problems with it but Cinderella really the message of Cinderella is wait around me hey by now first of all as you seen the modern version moderation is great\nBecause you have you guys you know modern version has been real like Justin ... the the the one directed by kind of brought up it's terrific terrific terrific film it's really good and if you think that Cinderella is supposed to be some sort of shrinking violet having watched the original Cinderella the originals and Roger kind of ethics and he'd go back and you watch it it actually ... but\nThis idea yet women can be saved by men women save yourself all\nWomen should be independent women should save themselves also there are situations in which women ... it's called\nAll of human history and there are situations in which many with it also called all of human history but need each other in different ways one of the great annoyances that I have with some of the modern Disney film is it every single Disney film is now concern with this idea\nThat women are deeply independent and they do not need a ban is one of the reasons why frozen is much more popular with critics entangled was even though table is by far the superior mostly because tangled is is about yes an independent ... but also about the guy she falls in love with who have to actually perform her real estate in order to help her\nThat's okay that's good for a boy and guess what I mean that girls can always count ties to save them but when evil is a foot in the world and ... men who are going out there to meet the evil with a sword or a done\n... let's let's not pretend that all gender roles or the say now I'm going to say something deeply controversial men and women are different I Know very controversial and very tail end to embed these ideas that men and women are different that women\nAre largely composed by evolution to help build and men are largely built by evolution to help protect and defend\nOr this is this is the difference between men and women men are built to destroy things they can build things too but only when they are doing so for the purpose of cultivating a family or called civilization which is where women come it by women helped build civilization by helping to pay men and also by basically\nChanging their destructive tendencies toward toward growth\nReinforcing those things is not terrible thing and then Christian bell came out and she said something very similar Christian ... said that that Snow White and to the wrong message she says it Snow White sense kid a bad life lesson she says every time\nShe says every time we closed in a way I look at my girls and that's the only thing it's weird it's like in the old witch why she needed to eat the apple Russian ... I Would say I would never take less ranger when you my kids are like no and I'm like okay I'm doing something right well you don't actually have to teach your kids at the sort of the theme of the story is this noise an idiot\nRight the theme of historians Snow White shouldn't be taking apples from strangers and then she also said don't you think it's weird the prince catches Snow White without her permission because you cannot kiss someone if they're sleeping the whole point of that very tail and putting beauty is that\nThe it only works because it's true loves cats that she's not the prince before and he and the idea is that what overcome even death that is the actual theme of the fairy tales but I guess we're gonna rip all this stuff away in favor of surface messages about me too and women's empowerment really really dumb stuff will be back here tomorrow with all the latest plus\nThe mail that visit then share of [laughter]\n\n\nHere's this fear to the next ... to June Russia

orange\nMueller station\n... news live and local at ten o'clock I'm Geoff Wardle twenty alleged victims of a former USC gynecologist want California's attorney general to conduct its own investigation into the university's administrators\nUh or at least take away money from these countries which I think actually a caller suggested is nothing like being strong as president\nUnlike a that when we had before him or when people realize you you say things you and you're going to back up and you meet people act they move\nAnd as a side them by the way more than one caller was suspicious you guys were good of who was paying for this journey right they need a place to sleep they need a place to eat and they need food they you know how are they are they walk in the whole business of maybe they are I Know I think I saw them on trucks and stuff\nUm bought the that was that was interesting you guys you know we're asking the right questions I suggested maybe it was George Soros paying for all this one way or another and sure enough people are talking about that today so I may have been right about that\nBut I certainly become more cynical about what is going on and this one seems clear to me I think they're timing it so that their arrival at our border is time to hurt President Trump and Republicans in the upcoming elections whoever's paying for it\nUh doesn't matter I think that's what they're up to so I think they don't ask me of course to consult with them but I think the Democrats once again I'm misreading things as they didn't earrings with the judge Kevin or\nWere they clearly overplay their hand and showed you know the even the independent voters remember most people don't follow the news like are those who are listening to talk\nDo you guys are active and involved and you know what's going on most average people don't even know what's going on but they showed their mission to ruin a judge Kavanaugh his reputation in his life and I think most people\nCould see that whether or not her evidence shed away when it's whether her testimony was credible or not even if they felt sorry for her I think they thought\nThe Democrats were going overboard and I think that's going to hurt\nThem in the election so I think most Americans saw through their surfers and now\nThey want the American people to seek crying children right so here's the children and distraught mothers at the border with a willing press reporting how heartless Republicans are to allow such suffering to take place they just you ever notice it's always the children's ... rather 'cause people fears feel sorry\nFor children it doesn't matter if they're manipulated by the way you know if it's as someone's kid a tan or eight or whatever that when they spouse certain points of view you know they've been indoctrinated by the parents even if they are precocious as some of the things that come out with you know the parents are just using their own kids\nBy the way not unlike the Democrats use you know a fork and they're\nAnd they're all the usual spin I owe this line drives me crazy that this is not who we are as people are not who we are as Americans as if we are not allowed to defend our sovereignty and our values that we are in effect basically what they're saying we're stupid people\nThat would let all kinds of people come through our border on their word alone now I Want asylum whatever you don't know if they're terrorists or you don't have contagious diseases which is happening more and more\nPeople have not been vetted in any way that that we are not those kinds of people either that can't we be smart enough to have some you know the rules and procedures about how people come into this country so when they say it just drives me crazy oh this is not who\nWe are as people Hillary's that everybody said it you know it just seems like that on the left the we're we're not we're so compassionate we take everybody you know you guys just full of it you want them here for the votes and you didn't care about basically for whatever her name is because of the final analysis you leak that when she didn't want the stuffed leek\nAnd Dianne Feinstein the rest of your time this so do maximum damage you didn't really care about her\nBy a there's a bigger topic for tonight just like I Believe the Democrats don't really care about minorities that just using them they know they take their votes for granted and whether they help\nOr not that it's is it relevant they are using them for them to get power\nSo I Want you to comment to continue to comment on any of those stories that I reviewed tonight at eight six six Ninety red eye and and let me know what you're thinking and I go with where you want to go there is a hot topic uh after our topic I'll go to that pretty quickly\nEight six six or seven thirty three thirty nine is is the same number a digitally\nBut colors also mentioned the reaction of some of their friends this kind of always comes out a little bit some of their friends and family members to or if their political beliefs are on the conservative or you know you call them on the right I guess\nAnd a friend of mine Scott who used to live in California now lives in Colorado I'll leave that his last name because I didn't get permission to use his last name\nSo this is what he posted on Facebook yesterday he was the friend did just because of his political beliefs and he thought I thought he wrote a thoughtful commentary which I Am going to just read from is pretty quick\nA and from what I remember by the way he's a moderate Republican not even a conservative like me here's this quote we continue to learn life set lessons in many ways today I had a friend who I've known since high school an friend me\nShe was always ... a nice person in fact I helped her out in school and gave her job to provide her additional Lincoln\nNothing has changed as far as who I Am but today she in front of me not because I was nasty to her or because I was mean to anyone she knew about the cause I posted a political post that she disagreed with\nKeep in mind that she posts political commentary that I disagree with and some I find very offensive she asked me to never let the other stuff and yet she comments on mine\nBut sadly there's a way of our politics we can do people for years even all of our lives yet they have no tolerance for a different political view than their own it's so angers them that you have a different opinion that then there's that they will not talk to you anymore\nPersonally I find that beyond said today I've only an friend than one person mainly because they're not just an intellectually dishonest\nAs most no I guess people know and I will debate anyone on any issue and I've changed my mind than issues\nAnd vote had others change their mind you I appreciate that too when colors of done that in the past and you'll see me say sometimes you know that's a good point I didn't consider that but today it just seems that we're starting to forget the whole of a person is not just measure by their political views and if you had if you've had a lifetime of friendship\nThat it should be more important than a different view on one area\nHe should have said in one area of your life\nI think I'm more saddened by the fact that my experience today is more symptomatic of what our society's becoming than about losing a Facebook friends if we can find a way to be more civil to each other and then we're in for a bumpy road ahead I actually I think he's under doing it\nUh and by the same thing happened to me a couple of years ago so I used to doing a show in Los Angeles with two Democrats two Republicans discussing the issues in the news whatever came up that we can\nThe audience and the guests loved it some of the gifts I they greet each other and a future show and I said how do you know ... oh we became good friends because of your show mark up and I I was really that touched me a despite their differing views they become friends socially and otherwise and kept in touch\nI'd love to reprise that show at some point if I was given the opportunity because of the audience loved it I loved it it it was just a lot of fun we didn't have very professional way you know\nBut one of the guests moved to Tennessee and posted on Facebook I Want to be able to get some more if you see what he did he posted in on Facebook after Trump won that he was the ... anyone who\nIs evil enough to vote for President Trump your host included obviously well he wouldn't friendly you know he did in all of his appearances on my show he was one of the milder very friendly and plus I guess on the other side any chair he shares vice with me when I was dumb enough to run for office in California which\nYou can imagine for Republican as a waste of time so I was pretty surprised when he poses letter saying goodbye to all of us now evil human beings I'm not sure you said the word evil but that's what he was implying\nForget his past interactions with me or others he thought were his friends they thought he was there for his friend so I Want to know from you what has been your experience when people find out your views if you're a Republican or a conservative or maybe you keep your politics quiet as I Do with my teaching job\nOne of the reasons I'm getting lower now I'm probably still teaching is the left just about never listens to the other side\nSo they have no idea and I'm a talk show host if they knew that might be the end of me but here it's a several anecdote you might appreciate on election day when President Trump was running it was the first day of new class of my school ... takes a lot to see the election results\nAnd I remember I I tears roll down my eyes when he a Trump won Pennsylvania which was always a Republican fool's gold always stay we might win but when it counted like with Romney we always came up short so when he won Pennsylvania real is he was like you going to be president\nIt was unbelievable even though I predict that morning I predict on Facebook that I thought he was going to win so what did some students do and these are adults students they went to the system principle to complain that I was texting a lot\nSo she called the inter office at the end of the night and she said you know mark I defended you to the students because all of us were so upset with the results that it was not surprising that will slut text and going on [noise] it didn't even cross or my for second that I could be on the other side\nAnd another time there was a teacher's meeting and the ... teacher trainer who was running the meeting said you know we have some time why don't we go around the room to all your teachers and you could tell us something that would be interesting that we don't know about you\nDo you think for a second I Would tell them about my other career life I Would have been the end of me and a final anecdote was when Justice Scalia die another teacher said mark let's play knock knock joke so I played a ...\nAnd his answer to who was there was just a Justice Scalia just died and he said that was funny

is that soldiers will happen in the Dodgers do make it is that they just got to take it a game at a time and that's it you know I think the series will be a completely different series yes\nUh you know the Boston Red Sox or who if even if it was used to they would have been the favorite but series are are completely different from games\nYou know a series is different so you know ... is we'll see what happens but I don't I don't think a weather or anything that is really gonna change or\nThe outcome of the game yeah baseball actually started to season a week earlier this year and\nA lot of people think it was because they wanted to finish correct series in October which they will have to go seven ... seven game will be on Halloween but that's not really the reason is because baseball players association actually made more money off of it but these are minor details yeah [laughter] it was like I yeah I don't have a problem with with weather obviously I mean if there's a snowstorm and things like that\nAnything can happen obviously we don't we haven't seen that in history actually in\nIt's an issue we see more snow in April we have an October so go figure but no I don't think that what is the big thing now what I Would like to see\nIs maybe a day game in the world series Mm that would be intriguing that'd be something different versus the prime time start eight o'clock on the east coast traditionally five o'clock out here in LA time um I'd like to maybe see that kind of mix it up that but outside of that I don't think weather is a is really going to play a factor where ... ...\n... whether side so I Want to put up bring up two things do about ... in Boston favor because right now they're hot and they know that I hate that that ban books I mean that's also that is a weird weird stadium in Boston knows it better than LA\nYeah ... they're ... and here's the thing if you're the Dodgers if it is the Dodgers\nYou gotta hit you got to bring your bats in a big way and that's going to be a challenge for them because it's been top obviously in this and I'll see asked to score a lot of runs they've had spurts here and there are but it's gonna be really tough at this point ties especially when\nThat line up is is just rock solid for Boston and the pitching has come around liquid David priced it tonight they now have guys who have confidence that rotation so there's no doubt that Robertson company are going to have their hands full not impossible but definitely had their hands full but it starts with the ... she got to bring your bats in the series if if they are able to advance\n[noise] well yeah if they're able to advance I'm I'm hoping that God I Need it would it would have to be a major collapse would not do for them not to get one of the next\nGame psyche words and stuff and I think all Dodger fan should be confident this point in time I again I really feel like a lot of wind went out of the sales the other day yesterday one walkie last game five I just I thought they came back down to earth a little bit not to mention that both and ask them worked so much combination with the Thirteen innings the other night and then yesterday\nCouncil polling Miley after just four pitches to start the game I to me there are a little bit worn out yeah they'll they'll somewhat feed off of that home crowd there in Milwaukee tomorrow night but I don't think so I don't think it's enough at this point I think that\nThe Dodgers have they're not that much better the Milwaukee but they're they're they're good enough to get past them and I I think tomorrow they they get it done\nYeah they they I like their chances are the ... if if Milwaukee out one that last game\nThat I uh I thought it would be over give us a different story but right now I like their chances are the Dodgers chances however I mean anything can happen you know so it's just a matter of them going in there and I think the most important thing is going to be the first three innings and the last three innings and\nSo we'll see we'll see Solomon will call you got to you guys thanks one\nEight hundred to two to five to two two yeah I Would really like to see like a day game in the world series yeah kind of mix it up and weather hasn't played a factor in the world series since probably two thousand and eight when you have the Phillies and raised in there you had that suspended game\nIn game five there in Philadelphia where they actually they had some would have like a torrential downpour in combination with like some sleet nice it was it was crazy dad to spend again pick it up like a day or two later that was weird but you don't you don't hardly see that\nFor the most part like I said we've seen snow and more winter ask conditions in April in recent years and we have in October\nYeah yeah you know look is this is the the playoffs and this is the world series coming up you know it doesn't matter how cold hot or whatever it is the\nUrine you got nine innings in somebody's them make plays and and it was going to be a winner at the end of the day right so you're going into battle\nAnd you just gotta you gotta give you got to get through it I mean these guys are professionals they play with her ... over a hundred games yeah throughout the day there used to a little bit of whether a little bit of code or whatever the case may be a bill is

center dot com [noise]\nWe\n\nFive great to have you with it [noise] because you wrote us for getting into\nA whole bunch of different things tonight we talk some baseball beforehand about the red Sox bunch in their ticket to the world series first time since twenty Thirteen Dodgers in ... getting set for game six tomorrow Lakers dropped the season opener on the road one twenty eight one Nineteen that the trailblazers the\nBrawn his debut twenty six points uh you know Keith I'm just some good things will be talking about the dunks earlier on in the\nGame and it's almost like he's obviously getting a feel for this young team and it's going to be somewhat of filling out process you would think for maybe the first I mean at least the first handful of games are so maybe the first ten games\nTen Fifteen games with the season just to see where everyone that how it's going to work I Would imagine Luke Walton is going to experiment with their starting five we talked before about how you can make the case for coups ... starting over Caldwell pope\nAnd I look I I think Brandon ... got a long way to go we talked about that off the air\nOr you saw tonight John nice pass from the Bronx to him earlier on in the game to get some would have like a like a back door past their kind of right underneath the basket I thought that was kind of get him going but still you know every so often you he's inconsistent he used to growing um developed muggy we really loved him he's just a a picture perfect fit\nIn this starting by Michael be usually came off the bench tonight and ... ah not didn't only played a couple of minutes but I'm your guy who you would think of the student goes along\nYou want to play a bigger role coming up then for the ...\nI think he needs to I mean two minutes and not enough time to come in to do something you know I'm like I said like Ingram was he had sixteen points and I I was seven for Fifteen from the field but over for from the three\nAnd this is where their Achilles' heel is Jay Jay a judge heart house three for fire from the three point line you know he had twenty points coming off the bench who's with Fifteen off the bench with twenty nine minutes um so\nYou know you look at this team and you're like okay\nThey're gonna they're gonna be All right I I just think that they need to make some adjustments uh I I Would like to see a little bit more Beasley a little bit more of um [noise] I'm Linda Stevenson and again a little bit more so I think those guys are going to be in the game in certain points but\nIt's about ... ... ... ... knowing ties where to put those guys in and I think that's just comes with time in in in more games\nSo [noise] uh yes I think they're going to start off with vi but I think eventually the two weakest link like I said and they're starting lineup is vi and cut out and kind of poke so\nUm if they can they'll probably you know in ... insert coups there uh possibly uh Josh hard I Would like to probably see there as well\nUm and you can go small a small bomb or something like that so we'll see\nUm I I like I like what they did today or if you when you play this game that they play today you played in the ... you play in quarters and the quarter they end up losing the game on um the corridor that they end up losing the game on is a is actually\nI'm Sorry about that it was the fourth quarter that's when they lost the game they lost the game before\nInto their stretch they cut it to I think seven was the closest towards the end\nThere or they lost that thirty five to twenty eight and the fourth quarter so yeah you know that's that's the quarter they lost in ... other than that\nIt was a solidly game I I don't really have anything bad to say about the team I think they did I like what I saw today and I think Laker fan should be happy with what they saw him today um you know\nA good deal of you for this twenty Eighteen twenty Nineteen versions Lakers not great but it can grow into something that's a lot better than what we're seeing now chances are it is going to be a lot better if they're only gonna grow where they are now compared to where they're going to be in one month\nTo yes Ali I Want to improve I Would definitely like you you're starting to Z like Alonzo play Nineteen Minutes and they used to for some\nFor the feel of one for for from the three you have several points today but\nI think he's still trying to find his way in this off into what he's doing\nAnd ... and a and hopefully he can but to me it feels like more Josh heart\nUm has found his way and found his niche and when he went to his role is on the team so uh I don't know I I I'll look he's he can be laws are can be a great backup point guard to raise 'em but\nHe's clearly you can tell rage on his clearly more advanced hadn't shown head and shoulders he knows what he's doing he's a coach on the floor\nAnd he gets in your face and what\nI that's what I loved the most about him rat was at the free throw line he will go out on the ground the brown will listen he goes to the next person they were listening and it'll go back and forth telling people what they're what they're supposed to be doing the next play that's what I like to see from a point guard that's the point guard\nQuickly skipping out on college after this one season of both to the NBA eliminates the whole thing because let's face it\nNot every person is cut out to go to college that's fine not at first I got up to go to college and it doesn't make any sense in my opinion\nFor guys to just to literally have no intention to go to college 'cause all they want to do is playing the MBA that's their goal he doesn't make any sense for them to go ahead and to say OK coach gay or headache pay coach Cal Perry I'll come and play for you\nBy the way I'm only going to be one and done whether or not they're always honest or not with them is probably a whole another story but yet by the way I'm the I'm going to be one and done here I'm going to be gone and one year\nI mean it just it kind of waste everyone's time anyhow and and I get it coaches have adapted those two examples of coach ...\nThey've they've adapted really well I mean a coach can actually is probably recruiting better now than he ever has with getting a different place but still it creates more tougher environment for everybody across the board there obviously that's the top one percent right their coaches able to kind of um you know adjust\nTo the situation here in twenty eight teams with that but this to me is awesome and I think it's really a win for everyone across the board well\nYou know until we\nReally start to get into it and I was really thinking about it and thinking about even now when you're talking about it it does make the league more competitive or so to speak you know the junior league makes them more competitive and will make you know I'm ... also given the players and opportunity\nUh to to go professional is it just gives you a way it's how I or struggle\nIn the rookie season mightily when yeah like they you know they're not developed physically yet they could do you know a whole lot more to better themselves a year prior uh what do they really tend to still be in college\nBut I'll say this I'll say this man I Am really does disappoints me that\nI think colleges important I think it's important for these players because look man for myself personally like me going to college and playing ball and college that experience to have the ... you you\nYou can take that away from me that's something I experience um and it's also caught me in a crucial time in terms of how to become a man and you know and that's what you learn in terms of the growth and stuff in college you learn that you learn about options\nThese guys are coming into the league coming in right now they're all ... all these kids right to this day right now everybody wants to go to I Want to be in the NBA\nBut they never they don't know what type of action and some of these guys will get really close and then self destruct ... because when they get hurt or whatever the case may be they don't have options they do know that because all they're all they were talking about her life has gotten an MBA you know what I'm saying\nWhen I went to college it was the same thing when I first started I wanted to go to the NBA but reality set in and said hey\nAnd there's another plan for you but I wouldn't have done I wouldn't have known that if I didn't go to college and so I I think that is very important for kids\nOr to go to college not just go straight to like just jumping up and go to the NBA because you've got another kid like prime example the mellow ball yeah the ball kids\nThose are kids that want to go that we're talking about going to go to the NBA or it can get it right they can't get in a you know what they're doing right now they're playing overseas just trying to make money in ... because they refuse\nTo go get an education and all this other outlets they can they can get you know how the capital here not college material I think that's quite all the well whether look they could be a you know what you we don't know that you know why because you have a parrot\nWho's living the dream do their cable that's part of the ... out and so that's all we we just don't know that but I'll just say that it does make the league and everything more competitive but I Would like to see a rule in there where they're saying you know what\nYeah you can come into the lead but you have to leave take two years of\nOf something college or some education to find out where you want to go to any college all I can just before the end the league like the G League will the NBA or should be doing something where they are giving these guys\nOpportunity to do other things outside of basketball and stuff like that taking some type of class or course or whatever it is there's other occupied as you can have\nPeople will get there but I think ... like this is a bridge to that we've got to take steps yeah we got along and take\nThe latest says all these kids see right now is dollars size a hundred and twenty five thousand dollars the four season there are there's talk show did you ever collies remember\nThe brawn James Comey writes the world the guy's Anthony Davis you know all the big stars yeah game or the stars who are you guys were just on the outside on the cusp of coming stars that's to the top one or two percent\nGuys who would maybe play one year the G League maybe that's the highest ever going to get to so why not and it's also kind of gets in the whole should called ask college athletes get paid was here about a lot before\nIt that could be their final level to do so in their life before maybe they venture into something else outside of ...\nBut also college helps you in terms of preparing you for the NBA and for the professional prime example ...\n... ... it was a four year die play throughout the the whole ah his whole career in college got to the NBA season and ready\nTo me is a fat is a proven fact except for the guys like deliberate Jay's except for those LeBron James and Kobe though the world but it's to me to brew in fact that these guys who come due for three to four years and in college\nThey advance to do better in the league when they get to a professional they're\nThey're right there on top of the study at age ... house but it's not a perfect science law ... law that all you got to like the option\n... he's a war that's been struggling right mark hill faults another one who's been struggling a who struggled ... one and done any look year out the whole year because he forgot to shoot\nYou know what I'm saying so yes the Julie gives them the opportunity to come in and say hey you you were going to give give you a hundred and twenty five thousand a year to play to see them we can teach you those things\nTotally with that but I'm saying\nWhat mark ... fold mark ... focus was on the verge of his career probably being done and what's next for you and a lot of these kids are like well what do I do now\nA lot I Know a lot of players like that right now to this day even professors who are professional athletes who are the everybody here knows and they don't know what to do they'll know what to do because they were a one and done guy are coming out of college\nHurt and I don't know what to do now\nIt's a start more to come hopefully we just got word we got some audio here from LeBron James post game tonight let's play that now\nOr were you know so it's not there for quite a while\nFor the commercials and gets you\nClose your eyes and knowing that we're ... [noise]\nWhat else we're going we're supposed to not only the ... of for\nInstance a whole meal I rarely come up with this stuff ... that is great yeah instant oatmeal [laughter]\nYeah well he he's right though there's teams are is legal it'd be\nYeah right and rage and you'd have to be really naive a Lakers fan to really come into this campaign thing that all their helmets we're going to be care it's going to take time that's just it Mm\nYeah absolutely it's going to take time but Laker fans or be happy with what you saw today I I Know I Am and um is going to be more to come I think they're going to do a great great to have a great season still to me top three they will be at the end of the day\nQuickly on the Thursday Night Football match up yes there was a football game tonight besides baseball and basketball forty five to ten Denver all all over Arizona\nI think that uh von Miller pretty much punches ticket to Canton tonight I'm there I mean a five turnovers basically forced by his Denver defense Arizona looked like the worst team in the late tonight and that's saying something 'cause we saw some bad football this past week but\nTonight takes the cake and die David Johnson by the way is is is done for all intents and purposes of being any type of stand out back and just as far as I'm concerned\nYeah he is I'm also that defense who's just impressive man that environmental and those guys they look really impressive um enemy Mayo Sanders I said is leaving on our fantasy manufacturers and Mary is Thomas\nHad big games today you saw that the defense did well and you know Josh Rosen he just is going to take them some time you know one thing I didn't like though\nI don't like the fact that Bradley because he's not play he's active and everything in any way because he ... a backup that he doesn't he's not re you'll have his gear on he he's in a street clothes when he was\nAn active for tonight's game yes everybody that I'm an actor for tonight and I we talked about this before but OK coming into the season Arizona you're winning anything anyhow in my opinion\nDoesn't hurt to start Rosen just to get put the you know get a seat wet let him go through all this come back next year maybe you can build on well he went through it tonight\nTo find the bike we're back at it tomorrow night keep living the dream [noise]\nFurnish by values media\nLos Angeles orange\n... station\nGrowing evidence sweeping fro I'm only apprentice slippers state Mike Pompeo advised President Trump Thursday the give Saudi Arabia a few more days to investigate the disappearance of a Washington based journalist before deciding what action to take correspondent Melissa rainy has more\nOr even in your friendship no one's perfect you get a combination of things but it's much more important I Would think you would agree with me not so much on how they say or how they come off and Trump by ... it gets himself in trouble with those tweets and the things he says\nBut I look at what kind of job but I'm a behavior is what kind of job you're doing how well you're doing to the country is president the United states and that's why you comparing apples to oranges\nWith Obama yeah he was a great speaker but I ask what kind of job is he doing when you start and say seven days before your election that you're going to fundamentally transform in my opinion the greatest country in the history of the world\nYou know I'm not going to have you much use for you I don't care that you speak well that's not what's important to me what's much more important is what you're\nSo these are so I think you're comparing apples to oranges there between Trump and Obama we didn't like him because of his policies not because of his race not because of the way he sounded muffled because of what he did\nYeah I'm not saying that Republicans are going to vote both Republicans regardless of course being a traitor if you had a Democrat or Republican is going to vote Republican and Democrat\nGoing to do is let me let me say what I think a clarified for you the base you're right about that both sides have a base that would never in a million years Republican vote for Democrats nor Democrats voted for Republicans but I Know I have a couple of times voted for the Democratic or Republican are so bad or as an example\nI couldn't stand Arnold Schwarzenegger so I didn't vote for him I figured out who he was what a phony he was and he was in it for himself\nSo there have been times that I have not voted\nFor the Republican candidate but you write in general that's what you choose your party 'cause you agree with them for the most part I don't blame people for that what I Do blame is for the incredible hatred for Donald Trump and the fact of tonight's topic which is you disown someone because you disagree with their politics\nThat doesn't make sense to me that's over the tide\nAnd you're right because like I don't go to bed you look at\nThe Korea issue North Korea is the first time in history to the my act the act we got him debate and um\nThe the employment rate is doing a really good job of what the reason people don't like the way you speak if he was more ... it probably was way more ... way but\nI think he is but I think he is becoming more presidential I get a question for you are you going to vote for next time [laughter]\nI don't know it's so frustrated with politics like I said I didn't vote for him the first time I was I was never going to vote for Hillary but I I\nI like what you're doing and let me tell you that I worked for the government so you know a real happy at what he's doing you know I'm a government\nSo you're a good man Anthony I appreciate you\nAnd uh hang in there and I I just got to save your way to live longer and you say he's on good stuff and you ought to vote for him in a twenty twenty thanks for the call appreciate it very much and let's go to um yeah Teresa in fair play Missouri three so you're on with mark\nIt gaining martyr good morning and I wanted to say that and I was raised their crap I mean my whole family with Democrat Latino families steal it Democrats and looks to my my dad changed parties and during the Reagan Era and\nKind of took all those kids with ... you know because he had he had\nLehman Brothers and sisters\nAnd and\nRecently Lee and me and my cousin has gotten kinds of ... in Facebook and\nOne and then just completely everything was in Haiti everything with a negative that Trump or you know they put up there and and it and I would make snide remarks and that you know on his ... and then my other cousin came out and speak spoke but one night\nMy\nOne cousin came down and then apologized to me he goes family more important than politics and I thought that was really really big I mean I think so much more lean him coming out and we talk\nOn you know on messenger for quite a long time now my other cousin I I had to delete him because everything he had was this negative negative negative now\nEverything he put it on faith up the Blake political [noise] that and\nI my question is is you know I Can't\nVote for something that I Am morally you know against the now whether it's more ... or you know all these people coming up here it's not the nominee against integration that they be legal and\nI just can't I think a lot of the red great comes from the news because they are so negative adding\nNew agreed with me because I I I think it changes a lot of people's mind\nYou're absolutely right you make a great point thinking Theresa ... the media has changed the name of the game and used to be that there there was a lot of honest journalism and you didn't even know where a lot of them stood now they've become advocates\nFor their point of view and that's maybe they learn than journalism school but that's not what they're supposed to do that just spoke to present the news and what's going on and we get to make our own decision\nBut that's totally change and they influenced people especially young people who don't listen to that much and I'm not picking the young people that's true of older people too and I think of it you know watch the nightly news or whatever they watch and they get a little glimpse of it and half the time they don't even know you know what's really happening\nSo I agree the media has a big play in this and it's a pretty discouraging to see what influence they do have\nAnd you have to go out and interview people you is very discouraging to see how little Leno right they can't name the vice

everybody's having problems with their family members that nobody can figure out why people are going crazy\nYou know you bring up Trump or whatever and it's just like it's like a trick word that a a\nMind programming like they did the old shows they had back in the seventies whatever you know they so they costs will be on the phone and say a special worded they'll go kill somebody I'm not advocating anything like that what I'm saying is when\nAbout six seven years ago my daughter wanted me to go with her to the Huntington said her which is a big arena and said Ohio and it was about to interview for a job now the new dance club that was opening up in Toledo and so I took her and they'll pretty much still\nTwo thirds the arena where filled up with families kids and parents editor for was a panel of um people probably six people they each have their little ... to talk about this new dance club that was coming into the going all around the country opened it up these clubs and\nThe thing that struck by interests first of all was it the kids didn't get paid by the hour they got paid by how many other kids they brought in\nNow there are five hundred families with this arena there was no way a little club is going to hire all these people but what they were doing was trying to bring the kids in and as I listen to this feel I\nThey told on their cells by saying\nThey'll be music playing and food and then at throughout the night there'll be certain times when the musical stop it will have announcements\nAnd it was or political announcements so these people in your family especially you know what you're thinking about Twenty years old twenty two year olds watch why these people and people and and people that are out there in the streets blocking the streets these kids have been a doctor related almost like it's all a cult and\nYou know if there was a ... who's got the money to rent the Huntington center\nFor this club now\nI tried to get in there to find out more about it I told him I play drums which I Do and uh I like to get in and sometimes the kids like the answer to the extra beat suicide for ... years ago they had that and so I could get inside the walls to find out exactly what was happening but I never heard back from them but this\nThese people that your family members do\nEven though you see that have come out in the heart do hate that it's not their fault I mean if you had a family member that was ... or ... and they're not only programs that's basically what it is I mean if I like blue and you like read we can discuss it and there's not a problem\nOr whatever it gets into the area of control manipulation of the population then\nYou see the anger come out that's because I I really believe there are programs by son is thirty one right now but she was a gym in junior high back was a Gore and Bush was bad without Florida he said dad who you voted for and back then I just you know I didn't care about politics I almost I didn't vote for nobody 'cause they're all crooks\nHe was a well we had a mock election at school and Gore won by a landslide them thinking wow I don't know a whole lot but pretty sure that guy's really it\nSo I started listening AM radio and I don't know what a Democrat is or a conservative or a Democrat or anything I mean I don't know anything about anything\nSo I'm given everything an open mind as it didn't take me long to figure out that I was a conservative and even back then the hatred was prominent in the discussion on the talk shows that were more of a a liberal I'm democratic side and what I what I've just seen\nAs just as I feel sorry my heart goes out to everybody you know I was driving a truck with my brother\nYears ago and started talking politics and he you know I bring up a point of fact and he didn't have a ... he got mad started calling me a warmonger\nI'm like is that all you got is just name calling was basically that's all they've got they have no choice that makes sense you know how can you not understand it's better\nTo have people working to have the economy's doing better that law and employment I mean all these things are common sense but\nThey just you can't get through to them there's a mental problem there is there is a programming problem I Believe my heart\nSo I Can't say that I wanted to let you know\nWell he did a good job Charlie I think it's more emotionally although you ... I never thought of that so the Democratic party as a cult cult of a motors because that's what they do most of the people there I'm not saying that Brian I'm not saying that a nice a lot of them they are they're so sure about that\nAnd there's many you know nice Republicans I assume it's Democrats and vice versa\nBut the fact is that a lot of it's based on emotion like you're saying he always a liar oh he's a racist way what about the economy what about foreign policy what about the\nCountries in really good shape in terms of things people care about they often vote their pocketbooks no he's he's just how could you like him he's he's just a small you know this was to have a person I've ever met\nAnd if you and if you do like um I'm not going to date you I'm not going to talk to I'm going
