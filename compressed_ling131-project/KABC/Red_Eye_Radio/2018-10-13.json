have been through one of your yellow America's donation speeches the guy came up and ask you about your position on abortion and says the same logic shifting costs become vegan or vegetarian would you please explain this to me in a religious man I Believe ... animals on earth for a nurse meant but I'm definitely interested to hear your take on this well first of all\nAbortion and\nKilling of animals not the same thing because human beings animals not the\nRight as a ... I'm a believer that human beings have capacities and rational capacities and in a religious and sold that animals do not have so\nI don't feel the same way about killing of animals for food and I knew about killing of human for any reason so that is is not the equipment the quibbling in the first line as far as the argument in favor of animal rights\nThe fact is that a lot of animals are relatively sentiment I mean they're they're pretty with it and for the same reason they wouldn't tell your dog and eat it\nThere's not terrible our nation until accounting now doing it can you do it because human beings require animal protein to survive I think for survival reasons and thriving reason\nThere is a good arguments we made you should be able to eat meat and biblical speaking\nWhen people called genesis nine three which is the part where it says that anything on the earth you can basically eat when that does that Noah\nWhich is actually in this week's Bible portion and the Jewish community it's important to recognize that this was after the expulsion from eight and an eight in the typical Jewish philosophy that you couldn't eat animal that everybody was sort of vegetarian and in eating which doesn't sound that decorate honestly encounters are delicious but um\nI I said before that in a hundred years people may look back and say how could people eat so many animals\nAnd I think that that may be\nTrue that said we'd have to come up with some pretty good substitutes for animal protein better than the ones that we have now for widespread\nVegetarianism are beginning to take place for for human rights rather for animal rights reasons we says there Mr Shapiro recently I've gotten in discussions about the rich paying their fair share of taxes some of my family who are Democrats are pretty wealthy and they feel they're not ... compared to everyone else well\nThen they can find a chance to go for it and tell you ... I Know you get sick and had in my pocket and you feel you're not getting enough I have a favorite charity the argument they use in discussion or the loopholes for the rich and then the trickle down effect doesn't work either Arnold loopholes for the rich all the tax breaks exists\nEveryone is just the only get to exercise certain tax break in certain areas there are people who get the earned income tax credit\nI Do not receive the earned income tax credit because I make much money most people in the United states make much money they receive significant amount of money back for the earned income tax credit\nThat loophole for people who are not as wealthy and so it's not a loophole that just when Pakistan destruction when people say loophole they act like well if I pay my lawyer a little more than he can find a loophole in the law that's not how our that's our ...\nAnd I don't believe in tax loopholes I Believe we should play pay everybody should have fat or a flat tax rate or we can have a national sales tax but\nThere is no such thing as a quote unquote loophole that only applies to rich people it's just there are different types of income like capital gain versus traditional income we can just got one of those are the ... your bad policy but the language of loophole naturally how about the trickle down effect doesn't work well the trickle down effect\nIs a term that it's going by left that economists no one on the right has ever suggested that there is something called trickle down where you give money to rich people and rich people suddenly make everybody else wealthy the idea it's supply side economics meaning that people who develop new and better ... drive the economy\nAnd nobody knew there was a demand for cars until cars were mass produced and suddenly everyone knew there was a demand for cars they talked about that a little bit earlier this week the lie that\nWage stagnation in Nineteen Seventy nine means that the quality of living and say who's having the United stagnant is ... idiotic and ... we live far better than we did in Nineteen Seventy nine without any doubt whatsoever Ronald Reagan supply side economics\nTheory led to the greatest peace time growth in the history of the nation a jolt as\nIs the Democratic party in the recovery due to embrace it socialism and rockets behavior can be able to throw the dams and the waste that have history with the way the party well I mean are they currently to ensure I Would prefer a Democratic Party that was not insane\nPressing actual solution that maybe I disagree with us so we can have an honest debate about issues I think that a two party healthy system is worthwhile and I think the right now\nWe have a ... party and the Republican Party and dying party and the Democratic party\nAt least in terms of ideology and the problem is that there are a lot of people who believe in that ideology or we will be here on Monday\nWith more on the news but if you are around on Sunday and make sure the check out the final episode of the ... election cycle and Fox airing it should be if you're not going to want to hear that click\nOn TALK\n\nLord of the few realization

developing the leaders of tomorrow we'll soon in studios now seeking educators teaching leadership and students support roles for amazing new campuses hoping in both twenty Nineteen in Washington DC and change in China in the faculty\nA presumption of innocence and so we saw that sixty percent of people at that point said OK confirm you get to sixty percent that means the vast majority you convince the vast majority of independence and\nThat's what you want to do and in this case it's absolutely clear and they should start they should do it on a consistent basis and promote the fact\nThat we want you know educate people educate people on on the you know not on the left that's impossible but in the great middle because it makes sense to them clearly independence understand\nThe presumption of innocence\nClearly they understand due process under the law the polls have shown that\nDemocrats may they just wish to ignored because what they want now is more important than anything it is about their day to day politics\nAnd so I think it's just important just a little nit picking their and then I'll move on food goes ... ... you never happy with anything no men were maybe ... maybe we're a little bit more content but we understand because we've been doing this for such a long time is just one battle and it's not over the next battles in a couple of weeks\nWell it's a couple of things the um the the whole idea of of this there are two parts of this the political part of it and the question is is a greater motivator a greater motivator for the right or greater motivator for the left or a greater motivator for the center\nYou know the left a you know says there are since Saturday evening while we're more motor ... motivated now well that's what the press will have you believe we'll see about that\nUm will look at early voter turnout as we always do\nBut really even with the right I Know I Know the motivation on the right is there we know that so that's not going to go away\nOr the motivation in the middle that's the question that's where you win the election and so you look at the undecideds and how many of the key races right now are undecided\nOr have a great number of undecideds are certainly to the extent that they can throw that election one way or the other that group going one way or the other end turnout\nIs is is the key\nSo beyond that the win at the highest\nCourt remains to be seen\nBecause we have to go back to chief justice Roberts twice ... rewriting Obamacare for the from the bench it is a victory and that the left did not get their way and their attempt to destroy the process I'm certainly\nThey they\nThe process will see what happens to it next time there is a a an opening on the high court and if this president is still president or how that goes but ultimately\nNow you're going to have to wait and see what what Kavanaugh's does on the bench what effect the ultimately has and that won't be seeing for years and so the when there is that\nIt's an odds game as we've been saying for for many years going back to Andrew Breitbart and and his comments to us during the twenty twelve race and\nTalking about how important the Supreme Court was when we asked the question why should we support or should conservative support a moderate like Romney at the time\nFor for president and his answer was SCOTUS Andrew Breitbart the answer was very clear and it is an odds game because you can support a John Roberts Neil Gorsuch\nOr Brett Kavanaugh Ben through all of it you still may not get those decisions you think you're going to get its always intriguing but sometimes it's disappointing and how they decide\nAnd we'll again we won't be able to see that effect or if that's going to happen uh for many years ultimately on the court there there will be cases where his decision will be key in those cases but we'll see how he decides them and and what his thinking is in those opinions as they come across\nRight I mean if what what it's about ... if you look at his judicial history I Would say that\nAre most likely I'll agree with eighty percent of what he may be eighty five to Ninety I don't know ... between eighty and Ninety percent all agree I'm a ... with him you know we we talk about a true construction as some and by the way when we talked about remember what was that the or was it the location\nDevice was at the location of ice on the cars\nAre about ... what was the case that everybody thought it was the ... was the ... are you there for everybody where everybody said we're we're especially the never Trump first came out and said see oh you did you see he sided with all the liberals [noise] excuse me you didn't get your judge mhm and then we had to point out as\nMany other people did no uh actually on that particular case it was the liberals on the court or and and the Gorsuch that actually use the Scalia ruling\nA you know Scalia was probably the true with the the most construction as judge of my lifetime paying attention to what the Supreme Court\nHas a has a has has done\nClarence Thomas always is not always the construction it right\nClarence Thomas will a judge based on at times based on what he views as a conservative win for the day right that's not what I'm looking for I'm never looked for that I Want that's up to the legislature to decide to me there's these are all constitutional issues I Want judges look at the constitution said does it say that\nNo well that's not up to me to put that in\nDon't bend the constitution or straight from the constitution in order to fit your political agenda right so I'd say ... I'd say if I look at a a a a Clarence Thomas he's probably got a a a Scalia was almost Ninety nine probably Ninety nine percent just doing it off the top of my head Clarence Thomas probably somewhere between Ninety\nAnd Ninety five percent ... depending on depending on the year [laughter] yeah and and what I'm hoping is that you have a\nA you know you have a cabin on that ah would get to the Ninety percent level at least a for me on on the on on the important cases I'll be very pleased if it's greater than that but again nobody expected\nRoberts to rewrite Obamacare right do you ... and then you look at some of his other cases you're like Oh absolutely right absolutely right absolutely right absolutely right so I'm\nA again this to me was about the greatest thing that came out of this besides getting a ... Supreme Court justice that isn't\nA a roof gator ... Ruth Bader Ginsburg is the fact that you and I talked about that the left has made it very clear what they want\nA but I don't think that the Republican Party a\nI think a lot of conservatives knew this was this was a a part of who they were I don't think a lot of the moderates in the Republican Party fought they they were a and I will say some of the moderates that were never Trump or some of the conservatives that were never Trump hers\nBut to see it in action and to see them look to see the debate\nPoints that they were bringing up to see what they want it done to see that they rejected the mindset of due process the mindset of\nA a presumption of innocence this stereotyping but at the convenience all women are to believe unless you're there was those type of woman over there and by the way to one of the stories I saw is that now Democrats were starting to blame white women for cabinet are being put in well wait a minute I've thought women were always right\nRight and then I then they started a blaming ...\nAnd the case if he well wait a minute thought the woman was women were always right right yeah yeah but that case had too many holes well that's the whole point that the\n... so now we're just in a comparison of holes in a case right you are stating that and so they're all over the place and when it comes down to is they're just trying to fit in argument to fit their narrative at the moment in order to get the judge in that\nWill fulfill their liberal desires and the jobs that will legislate for them they're all over the place on their opinions\nYes\nTheir opinions don't if their opinions on their goal post move all over the place right\nSo to me it was the fact that you were able to see\nThe left and the and not just the far left what you saw because we normally get calls where people will say well that's not the mainstream of the Democratic party what you saw over the last two weeks was the mainstream of the Democratic party\nIn Washington DC the leadership of the Democratic party that reject due process under the law reject a presumption of innocence and we'll slander and defame somebody's character\nWithout evidence to do so yeah\nAnd the brewers beat the Dodgers six five tonight game one of the national league championship series game to tomorrow one PM in Milwaukee K.

[noise]\nTo ABC News live and local level eleven o'clock I'm Jeff will and a six year old girl was critically wounded tonight in a shooting at a gas station in South Los Angeles the gunfire happened about eight Fifteen damn near Figaro\nA street engage avenue that girl was undergoing surgery at a local hospital according to the LAPD police looking for to mail suspects who fled in a silver forward or car the thunderstorms rolled through Southern California tonight\nThird in here you know carry on our way out there it was the shortest outing of his postseason career yeah it it would that's definitely a concerning point\nIt's not the end of the world again that they will not is down on this loss as I think some people might be I I just I think it's look it it wasn't in your home stadium obviously it was a way obviously of course would have been great if they would have been able to come out on top tonight\nBut again I think they did some things that you can take away that they can they're going to fix the un force there they're going to fix that idea like I said every night y'all Turner is not going to be over for for five every single night\nThey're gonna get more hits out of him um but the crucial adding is definitely concerning overall\nAnd that's why it's so great that you have a new ways at least in the making here in walk or ... or you can turn to he'll go in game three young ... gets the ball tomorrow in game two\n... but again the bigger story is that they that they got into a whole ah because ... and ... you can't do it in the series especially against the ... that is so good because you just figure that they're not going to give up are the ones that they did two nights later on in the game so\nAs far as the point of living by the long ball dying by the long ball it's a fine line right we saw what happened to the Yankees last round they lived by the long ball way too much and and they want ice cold at the end of the day and they couldn't play they really couldn't do any small ball or nothing like that\nI agree that can mix a little bit more smaller into but we know they're a team who's gonna hit home runs they are going to come up with big extra ... said that how they're going to win games the obviously the prompt tonight was starting rotation\nThey're gonna have to get long ... industry they can't dip it in the bullpen too much or because it's just going to wear them down and and uh obviously it's kind of all hands on deck when you get to the league championship series and beyond\nBut still you need your started to go deeper into the games and I think that'll turn around them are I have confidence in ... you got some great starts here recently and I think he will keep that up and again you come out tomorrow you got a victory you come back home game three yeah\nWalk a bill or on the mound I think you're in a good spot\nYeah also you're going to have your stars so are many channels going to show up and we had a home run tonight well yeah he he did have a home run tonight but I think you you need more you need more from him that's what my my my whole thing\nIs that you need more from your your starters and and your super stars that you brought in there you need you need more of an understanding gave them a home run but I I you need all those guys those are the type of guys that gets you over the ...\nYou know so you know I I I see I think that you need is the more from those type of guys I ... you know Turner is well you know like we said he was like non existent today but I mean that's a very uncharacteristic of him you'll you I think you'll bounce back tomorrow um but I Would like to see more from those superstars that they have\nChris Taylor I thought I had a good game in the lead off position going three or four or five score to run also drove into Ron tonight I'm that you want to see your lead off guy do good things like that so I was encouraged by that\nAre obviously we talked about Turner they're down the list of meat freezes a guy who's come on here recently they're going to accept a little bit more than a month see as well ... coming in tonight with a pinch hit\n'em score to run yeah I see what you're saying about manning Machado obviously this is the guy who's going to command the big top dollar hearing it I'll see if you would expect a little bit more ah but to be fair though so far he's come up a lot more big than John Carlos than has come up for the Yankees during the last round so\nAh yeah it again this this is um this is the brand new state for him he's never been here before so he's feeling it out just like everyone else's who's new to this league championship platform\nSo again I think overall this often is going to be most successful uh went Turner is heading which I Believe he'll get back to that tomorrow I really do um I expect him to come out tomorrow I don't expect to be down six to one not be very surprised that we see that again\nYeah it just started off in a hole that's when the ...\nThey get in trouble and so hopefully like I said they can jump out from the beginning and not play catch up because when they play catch up\nThis is what happens or losing by one game it was I was I was impressed of the comeback I Will definitely impressed about that but I just wasn't impressed that brought the air's it was like wow like you guys are really\nI think they probably just a little bit too tense you know and I I think that's really what it was they play to test they played uptight and the beginning and that's ... I I think is very ... it's it's just it's not them you know\nLook they've been hearing these positions before I'm says the new season and this and that I like to see them play a little bit more looser and hopefully they\nThey will next game yeah I I don't know I don't know if they were necessarily uptight and intent\nIs to get all those ... the air is that they had and it's just like men that\nThey could have been affected by the atmosphere there in Milwaukee looking at the team's not used to being at this stage so they're fired up obviously you have burning the mascot sliding down the slide there in left field when the home runs go out the park and you know all that so I I think maybe it was a combination of a couple of different things but\nI I Would be very surprised if this team is necessarily a quote unquote rattled as a series goes along because I I don't know if they're going to be necessarily intimidated by Milwaukee there's a high team right now no question about it but overall best to seven series\nI Do think that the leadership of this team timely hitting everything kind of sprinkled together ultimately shines through\nOne eight hundred to two to five to two two coming up we'll take your calls also mixing some college football discussion NFL week six preview along the way as well it's behind the might keep attuned right here to seven Ninety am KABC radio\nPlease join us at the ... his annual successful aging expo on Saturday October thirtieth from nine AM to to be at the grand Long Beach days filled with free activities in services including ... forty visitors\nBingo demonstrations and more mcentire from back in time in the morning we'll be speaking in additional seminar topics and food for this little candidates non surgical options for relieving pain Medicare option common aging conditions clutter in your life in which the mission and parking or free more information so\nTo successful aging expo dot com\nChecking when here this Sunday were digging deep in take Kiefer and wind lovers or joy ... not align a cat stopping by to share fall wine\nI live on Sunday at twelve noon right here on TALK radio and I don't see\nHow would you like to legally turn your garage into a great apartments that you can rent out for money each month turning your dust into dollars curious called a three three four dream live now in tune into living the dream with Sandy dunkley every Saturday evening at seven pm on KABC\nShop mounted started your next painting project before the holiday season arrives\nYou'll find everything you need a fresh look at your home including ... is it seen resisting paint primary and one that gives you everyday protection against Hussein starting at just twenty seven Ninety eight and don't forget the ...

which they won a hundred and eight games with impressive\nAgainst the Yankees the other night enclosed ... we'll see how things go along as they do seem to get going tomorrow night I Wonder if some college football talk now it's a big weekend or their week seven now there's still a bunch of undefeated teams\nAnd yeah but if you go down the list um in in the top ten right now one through six are all in defeating\nSeven is Washington news at five in one who since losing all burned during the opening weekend has run the table since I've had some close calls big game tomorrow at Oregon\nEveryone's really high on her birds they think he potentially could be a top five top ten draft pick coming out and twenty Nineteen from the docks\nActually there was some chatter yesterday the giants my actually even take a look at him I Want to move on from Eli Manning next year but I this is a big game I think for Oregon you remember a couple of weeks ago it looked like they had it in the bag against Stanford and then basically everything unraveled a from ... to you name it and\nThen a day long story short I as you know what happened at a car and walked out with the big time so I think Oregon I somewhat reestablish itself since then they continue to do so I Believe with the big time victory tomorrow to me this game is about\nThe Washington office and Jake brownie and then putting up a lot of points and again we talked about this kind of with Joe little bit earlier this week\nI think the biggest thing about Washington is that they're very inconsistent and often they don't have a whole lot of play ... defense in a secondary is very good very good strong secondary but all sense of late they need to really be able to play more consistent football\nAnd that means coming out with gains and getting leads on opponents tall task this week though\nYeah it is is a tall task but you know miles Gaskins is has been running all over the place and he's he's doing a great job in in full or those guys are are are playing well for them so I look at it as like this\nIf a ... in order for Oregon too when they have to they have to jump out of time on top of this team in stay the whole gang do I think they can do that it's possible they're very talented um that they can however\nWe've seen is a lot of times that throughout this whole season with Washington Washington tends to figure out a way to win\nAnd I think that's why again I think that's why they're still in the top ten because they always figure out a way to win and they get it done so you know it's going to be a tough game for them is it's a ... the league is a conference game on top of that\nSo um and and also you know Oregon is playing great ball right now so it's going to be it's going to be pretty good I is it true really good test for them [noise] um I Would like to see Oregon get on top and actually when this\nUh but like I said that's a tall\nOrder when you playing against a team that looked has been battle tested and actually gotten games they only drop one game this year so far and I was in his Auburn upsetting game that we thought we did you should have won\nBut they've taken care of business all throughout the so we'll see\nPacked twelve standing as we speak huskies on top and the north right now three in oh in the conference course five and one overall\nIn the south as we talked about before totally up for grabs us we have Colorado there over at the coliseum the Marta take on us see two into into conference five and overall for the buffalo we do think it's anyone's division right now in the south anybody come out of it\nAgain as Washington I I really this is to me this is the first true road test of the season it was a neutral site game against all burning week one this is a true road game for them and it is being in the mail was\nGoing to be rally at the dogs in Oregon and you know question man that's going to be as it is a tough place to play it kind of reminds me of\nThe shoe in Ohio State yeah car remind me of\nAnd man they have some great fans over there's student body over there they used to go out and they really support their team and then it's going to be a great game go see a sea of green and man it's gonna be it's going to be very intimidating atmosphere so hopefully like I said a or you can get it done we'll look out\nOther games tomorrow on top and the FCC big one Georgia against Alice I got ... winning that man I thought actually this could've potentially been the game of the week going oh did you have to say it it definitely could have been I guess just because she was coming off the last last week at Florida and boy do the gators look good\nThey look like they got some cooking down there and um yeah they they've been searching for some type of consistency\nDown there in Gainesville and I think they might have some going forward look out for them to rising in the rankings they moved up to eight slots this wake up the forests\nIn with that big victory over LSU I still believe in the tigers because I like would add or drawn is doing there\nAnd with this if they can pull up a uh the uh upset victory tomorrow against Georgia I Believe they're right back up there again probably knock on the door of the top five so\nYou have so many teams are again one through six are still undefeated right now still undefeated so you're still a lot of teams are undefeated and again it's it's the same narrative from a national perspective it's starting to arise and it's only going to continue to arise is that you're going to have a team or to get slipped out of the playoffs because it's such a small\nYears behind them on like\n\nSegment of the week here on behind the bike [noise]\nLet's get into the NFL games coming up on Sunday we begin in Miami where the dolphins\nAre really two consecutive losses now back to back after starting three you know\nIncomes to Chicago Bears who I Do think is one of the hottest seemed to the NFL right out key somewhat under the radar three and one they probably should be for no I Love what they're doing here with mixture Biscayne company and who doesn't love ... and defensively and to me that this is really detached for them this week\nGoing on the road playing a team that is down\nCan you continue to keep them down and beat them at this point in time I I'd say yes I I really like Chicago I I I kinda got the inkling that Miami was a little bit fraudulent would that three into start\nIt's not surprising to me that they've come back down to earth a little bit here I that's again the Ryan tannahill like a lot of quarterbacks and leave right now one or two games than they have a clunker too in a row\nMan look they don't have ... they can't stop\nChicago's from line they just can't they just that's the bottom line or defensive include Mac just changes the whole game and you know it's crazy about this is like you know he's in conversation of being the MVP of the uh this year\nThat is crazy about a deep within the last time a ... a defensive player has won MVP and ... have been too many long time it's been a very long time and he looked he has\nHe's putting up incredible numbers and again he's going to do the same thing he's going to give Miami Antonio fits you know there's no way\nIn hell that I Would start any of ... of a if you were doing a fantasy any of 'em\nMiami Dolphins at all not with our defense that defense is is is gave a lot of people fit as we've seen and that's just going to continue so Chicago um I definitely think they're going to be taking this game and I'm going to be a tough tough in a long day for tannahill\nThe chargers are in Cleveland and take on the two two and one Cleveland Browns who are on a little bit of role here and are there standards and Baker Mayfield\nAgain that's why they took him overall number one\nAnd ... especially with what's playing out right now in New York with the giants I Love steak one Barkley but a running back is never going to be the face of your football team that will always be the quarterback a really good quarterback and take you deep\nInto January a really good running back is not going to be able to do that alone and I obviously it's paid off so far for the browns the chargers\nI'm concerned kids because\nI just don't think there are really great football team who can put together consecutive good performance is\nI think they're good for every once in a while um every other week if you will but I just I really question if they can duplicate what they did last week at ... center against the raiders transition that over now in the road against Cleveland team that's playing with a lot of confidence\nI I just don't know to me that hey I think we can probably guess who's going to be another close game for Cleveland that may be comes down to a kick because had kind of been their MO here early in the season\n[noise] yeah but you know what this was with this they're vanishing Cleveland has they got ... Landry in Antonio Callaway they got to dynamic receivers airplay makers and that's going to give the um and look the chargers\nSecondary is not that great you know they haven't really Darwin James has been proven himself so far he's still trying to find his way and so you know it's gonna be ... and the problem is with the secondary where the patriots I mean I'm Sorry for the\nFor the brown is that they give a bit they don't um I was for the chargers from or where they give up the big place yeah they give up a lot of big place in use and rear end and that's what I heard that's gonna hurt 'em that's going to hurt them a lot so\nUh you know drivers Landry Antonio Callaway is going to be a long long night\nFor those charges secondary cause I can see them does\nHave licking their chops and having a field day with them so that is going to be a tough task for them but\nYou do got one of the best quarterback in the NFL player right now Philip Rivers was most accurate\n... going to go to play well I can see that happening and look you are I mean Melvin Melvin Gordon is going nuts man you know like he is his the way he's been running the bar I think he's averaging maybe about five yards or run a you\nWould be the best running by LA\nAre you in ... competed in my early and girly which is great to see because those guys run extremely hard you know what the caller remind me when Marsalis was the ... younger they look we remind me they both remind me of a marsh Arlene's younger I mean\nThat guy is still however is does still take the whole team to bring martial is don't get me wrong I'm not ... but this is going to be a great game um and if we possibly can go down to the wire but at the end of the day\nFilled rivers man he's going to rise to the occasion like he always does and he's going to get it done\n[noise] speaking of tiger early in the rams there in Denver to take on the Broncos back to back road games we talked about the aggressive play calling by McVeigh last week up in Seattle\nThat aggressive play calling paid off they got the victory still undefeated of course in Denver\nLook it's tough to play there at mile high the Broncos are not very good keep this was not a very good football team I Do think that the defense if someone on the decline now really\nYeah I I I think ... I mean here's the thing about that though they were raised to a high standard because they play a high level and and it really has slowly decrees that means I Know don't get me wrong still good pass Russia in his league but they're not uh they I mean they've had such a average ... for so long now I think it is kinda\nWorn on that defensive it because they're not going to get\nThe great support there as far as points going and they're they're really under a lot of pressure most of the time\n[noise] I don't know I Would disagree with you\nAnd I think their defenses decide they have a solid defence I don't think his Superbowl quality like it used to be but they have a very solid defence\nAh the rams are gonna have to worry about von Miller he somehow always gets to the quarter back I don't care if you double team them I don't care if you're triple team bombers will get the quarter back at least once or twice so I think they got to worry about that the most\nUm and then like you said mom has a very hard place to play live they got a decent quarterback on the Denver Broncos team as if to marry is an email you will show up this is going to be a is going to be another one of those dragged out games\nThat you saw that in Seattle look there's two places the rams the toughest places you give them yet in the NFL to play and win games that's in Seattle and that's in ... those are two places the win games I think this was going to be another\nA tight game a very close game going down to the wire so I I don't know I'm I'm kinda indifferent brat I think it's going to I think

have an organized thought no in fact the most organized thought was a guy walked by and he said you want to talk of goes down and all of a sudden you're the guy go make America great again [laughter]\n\nYou know and and and if it's just because you look at this look these we know that these protests are organized to a great deal it was happening during the Trump rallies in twenty sixteen we know that there was a great organization and money to a certain extent going behind a that was behind and driving a lot of these protests are we know that\nUh the left is very good at that but\nThat's that's why you can't find for a lot of them you really can't\nIt's hard to I identify with them\nAnd and for most Americans that is\nYou know again the idea of a peaceful protest and standing up for what you believe people are quick to you know speak out and that if there is a pollster that calls whether it's kneeling in the NFL or any other as you know I Believe people should you know have the right to be heard\nBut how many people actually do it are active in protest most people are not the overwhelming majority or not\nAnd in fact if you didn't have a you know a Soros organization or any or the organization or that I mean we can go back to Ferguson Ferguson name authorities they\nThey told they were equipped to tell you look we've got people that aren't even from the state that have come here from a long ways away and that was clearly organized so when it comes down to how many people are actually willing to get out there to the extent that are driven\nAnd motivated to the extent that they would get out there if not part of some kind of organization\nI'm well we're we're the Facebook crowd a pollster calls oh yeah yeah we'll answer the poll a Facebook post on there and uh one click the like and we share it we might retweeted\nBut the fact of the matter is is what is it I guess the question is what is it that really drives most Americans it's the everyday things in our lives and when we go back to the point that you brought up earlier we we talked about last week\nThat the majority of Americans it was somewhere around sixty percent that said well if there was nothing to corroborate claims from this additional background check on Capitol Hill we that sixty percent saying he should be confirmed\nWell that's a big deal now it's not eighty percent not Ninety percent of sixty percent will win you a fuel elections and the point being is that we stepped\nBack from the insanity and the display the show that's being put on by the left

way they want to and even on the Senate Judiciary committee they can say the most insane things if they believe it's going to get them political points well it just might in your state of Hawaii or

couldn't find the audio anywhere but I did see him speaking after the confirmation on Fox News where he said Democrats don't try to conduct a revenge ah inquisition\nAll right you know don't don't try to impeach it's not going to it's not going to work out for you if you attempt to do that and you should probably unconstitutional to try to impeach him for something that he did when he was not an office right\nYou know that he did as a teenager that is that the point you're going to try to bring you know bring up I mean there is no I mean they're going to try ... they're going to try to make the perjury claim for a again where there is no evidence for perjury or you know whatsoever and uh and and so uh it's like really you're going to bring that up and he used to\nJust and they do not and he made it known he said look I don't want to Brett Kavanaugh on mhm 'cause I don't want it goes but if the Democrats want to pick a Supreme Court justices win the presidency\nRight that's what you have to do and and that would be you know going forward a your best bet in fact if you're on the left and we you and I talked about this off the air last week\nOr to play would be look OK Kavanaugh's treated but we can't let this happen again we can't have a third justice cheated by the current president I mean that would be the argument from the left or I guess the a proposition or concern issued to the rank and file\n'em but the left doesn't operate that way the failure with all due respect that Mr Dershowitz in his appeal to the left\nI'm really is to is to not recognize what the left is all about they don't care about the process they don't care about whether or not there's a case there or not they don't care about anything else just keeps screaming whining crying\nOr you know foul and that's what they'll do now that's what we want them to do\nBecause it's working it's actually working right now because the rest of America looks at it and recognizes that for the silly behavior and at times outrageous behavior that it is\nAnd I don't know what's gonna happen you know I I read all the polls and everything else but I don't know because to have something like this happens so close to the election yeah so I think that has United the Republican Party like I've never seen before and I don't look I don't know how if it's motivated the Democrats because\nIf twenty six team didn't motivate the Democrats mhm right and they hated Trump at that point mhm\nUh will the motivation be there now or is it more despair from the the the Democrats\nWell the Republicans\nWho have definitely

if you're mindful to help other people do you help yourself do you help your family you tend to be healthier where at the very least happier what is your definition of mindfulness\nOff shore ah I think of mindfulness a in a slightly the mores or philosophy of science where your ah your your mind is clear or you can sit without judgment a sitting without judgment man's\nYou're not judging herself you're not judging others not judging or circumstances\nUm and you may a\nMeditation obviously is one of the primary tools for achieving model state and meditation and we have thoughts thoughts entering and leave her mind\nUh but when you're mindful you can recognize a your thoughts and kind of labels on push them away um and maintain a state where you're sitting without judgment that's the that's the way I see 'em\nA judgment can be a very can put a toll on you or when you're which we all do we all sit there all day and judge others in charge of our lives and told her so um but it's a big apple to set\nWithout judgment can be very very beneficial\nYou know as you're talking I just had a son I think one of the biggest problems America has today\nWithout being too political is that we argument for mental\nYou know I hate Hillary I hate I I I hate Trump I Love Hillary I loved from then I said that last anyway um but that judgment does come back in my junior ...

everything started to be corroborated through through\nUh the well not just the number of people coming forward\nAnd others who said that they were aware of this kind of activity pretend ultimately his own from that essentially had to pay schedule find schedule based on this kind of behavior if he were to be caught and and so\nThere were things where again if if if Ford made the claims and couldn't get anything to substantiate those planes that were nothing there and then Ramirez came forward and their war and then the third accuser came forward and she had things to back up her claim\nThat case would have been hard for the president or Kavanaugh to deny those cases collectively as one big situation that Kavanaugh would have been face\nBut that didn't happen\n... were we and the only one that the only reason the Ford came out just because it was leaked yes ... and so that\nThat it would not it on all likelihood would've never come out if it had gone through the proper a judiciary a of\nWay if it ... find something would have taken it immediately and taking a tug rationally than they would have gone to the FBI to do a background check but everything would have been\nAnonymous and what and what the what you just heard too was the failure to recognize how Ford's story changed\nYou know and and they talk about how the ... story change how the sweat the story changed but look at how the Ford story changed but what their point was on the political picture of being believable the scenario that was that was their\nStarted with a he said or she said he said\nWell then are we developing a pattern with the second and third no they fell apart and then we look back at the first one and realized it also changed and was falling apart\nWhat they what they were trying to point out here was\nShe could have been the victim the one person to centrally if she were to give him a Dr Ford or to have given her testimony and nothing else happened she could have been the one and it could have been at least plate or spend with out the evidence to back it up in a way that might have influenced votes\nBut because of the behavior and they mentioned\nCollins making the or the you know talking about having a huge role in her speech but it\nDoes that happen all of that happened because of what because of the left and made it happen because the people sitting on this panel helped make it happen\nWhile you're in you think about it too because of the narrative that\nEvery woman must be believed mhm and after Ford and uh\nIn her story was like ... the story itself is incredible yet right being told that was your major talking point you've got to believe that the the alleged victim the alleged victim if it's a woman alleged victim must be believe we've seen the science we know it must be ... and then you get a second and third\nThat also are not credible then you start destroying that narrative at that point right I Believe that's what they're probably saying even though they are the ones that plane you need to believe all the women all the time and they held eagles not you know they're they're yeah they're ... you know even Chuck Todd is making the point well that really isn't\nTrue yeah well so is the this is the version of a right after the twenty sixteen election or we need to go to the heartland and listen to their voices that's basically what you see except for the fact\nThat it had greater substance en route and relevant to it I mean they they were right by the way uh in in in November twenty sixteen when they said that but there was no expectation they were going to do just that in this case they're looking back on it and and recognizing\nAnd again they were part of carrying that narrative\nHelping to form those narratives along the way and then saying yeah well we shouldn't have played it that way it shouldn't have been played that way\nYou when when you look at well I have an empty a stormy Daniels' case that and\nNo one absolutely no one is shocked that a playboy billionaire had an affair\nNo and\nAgain not shocked not surprised and also not politically motivated either way by it but the left creates these narratives they give Avon that'd be the the ability to introduce the credibility if you will from their perspective not ours to introduce the sweating to claim\nIt must be because he's got a legitimate claim and legal claim against Trump now there must be something that he's got was sweating it must be legit\nIt's if it's against Trump Trump so it has to come out because there there must be some legitimacy to it even if there is that like I said the the only other point that I'd like to make is because this is what I Wonder and again this is a completely totally unfounded allegation without anything to back it up whatsoever but everybody will understand my point\nWhat does Joe Manchin have on Schumer [laughter] and Feinstein and and what does he ever had a Democrat leadership nobody's calling for a primary challenger to him in the next\nElection nobody is criticizing Joe mansion from the left at all rice a Democrat wired their screams that he should be kicked out of the party where is that\nRight exactly\nHow come all the Republicans were taking the flack from the the the left but the one Democrat who voted for Kavanaugh\nNot fame you know nothing nothing\nLike to go back to West Virginia just yeah I mean because because the reality of it I mean you know they they I I saw somebody liberals on on a social media late a while as late friday and also into you know Saturday continued on college\nWe need to find somebody who as Susan Rice spoke up who will challenge for our next elections Susan ... always runs Susan Rice\nThe woman who got on TV and lie and my wrist attack American please that's kind of credibility the Democrats made and\nAnd then and then I thought to myself well wait a minute how many of these liberals on social media would vote for Susan Collins had she voted no on Kavanaugh zero you know it's this disingenuous well now we're going to challenge or like you weren't any way right\nNow we're going to vote in election that's right now

uh\nIt it it is going to be interesting to watch those polls that because the polls will now a include everything from the hearing as you mentioned a and up to the confirmation day\nAnd then passed that there will be interesting to watch some of the polls that come out over the next week or two as we get much closer to the election that show the possible lasting effect if any uh on either side

what's the what the ratio there's a greater motivation on the right less motivation on the left or after the confirmation does that change anything had the left one uh what is it because you could

know women are to believe be believed\nThen it became well only some women are to be believed conservative woman are to be believed and then as you and I were talking about sort of the stories that came out and some of the blame now being thrown at white women white women are the reason that you know a a cabin up a was a was confirmed\nIt gets back to what my friend a independent Bob called me and\nYou know over the years now he has moved more during the Obama years he became more a ... he became more moderate Republican\nI Would say and in some cases even conservative I Am in a state of that well maybe we shouldn't call them independent Bob anymore or but he still proclaims all the time that he's an independent right\nAnd when he called me be called me yesterday and and just said that you could just he was so intense he said how could I ever vote for democratic get so how can I vote for any\nParty that tells me women are always right and white men are always wrong ... right he said white men aren't always right [laughter] and the women are not are going to be white men are always a wrong white men are always right\n... women aren't always wrong women aren't only write your aren't always right you've\nGot to take it on a case by case basis you said I Know that he said everybody knows it and he's but he told me he said but I couldn't change\nAnybody's mind on this because he was involved in a ton of social media debates\nAnd he was you know talking about his friends on the left that would stick to some of the new shut point that wouldn't even matter and I told him I said well look\nThe point I'm looking at is not trying to convince them 'cause you're never going to convince them what you're trying to do is convince the the middle trying to convince people like you and I told him I said I remember you twelve Thirteen Years ago\nYour look right now is completely\nCompletely different\nUh another family member of mine who was who was always more conservative but always said well it's good to have the Democrats are it's good to have the Democrats are it's good to have the Democrats there or was in a conversation with them over the weekend\n\nAnd I explained I said well you know what the Democrats did here as soon as I said that they just started going\nOff and just said I Can't believe that I Can't believe they've gone to this\nTo this point and it's the mainstream of the Democrats it's not summer Iran and and he told me he said you know I always I always like it that you know I agree mostly with the Republicans but it's always good to have an opposition party there but he said what good is that opposition party\nIs it because you know the Republicans don't always do the right thing you said and sometimes I Need to be kept in check he sort of who keeps them in check\nThe Democrats ... that the mainstream of the Democrats have gone crazy and I think\nThat is the key here so when I look at a couple of weeks from now for weeks from now and and the election or\nI look at history and history shows the vast majority of times when you get to this point and you've got a Republican president you got a Republican House you've got a Republican Senate in all likelihood the Republicans should lose seats yeah\nUh that's what history shows it's almost the same as when people call this up and and the one general number forget you remember the call to about a month before the election of ... he said you guys going to be surprised when Trump wins and said no we're not because history shows he should win based on the economy\nBecause the economy actually has been so bad and people have felt it and they view that there's a need for change so\nYou look at history and you think yeah now the Democrats should take now should they take enough seats to actually take\nOver the house I don't know but then you see the big huge on oh and that is the Kavanaugh nomination I have I I still can't come up in my mind when the Republicans have been so United the only thing that comes to\nMy mind is Nineteen Ninety four uh I'd only been a talk radio for five years\nAnd I remember Ninety four caught everybody off guard except for ... remembers Avi had her death threats as a result we became a poster yeah he ... he he came closest to to catch in what was actually happening now that was the United GOP at that point [laughter] just nobody knew that they were United [laughter]\nRight off to all go out go out and vote and were motivated at that point I\nHave not seen a Republican Party that was as fractured as this Republican Party has bat\n\nAnd with in a period of two weeks is a completely United party not because they love the leader or necessarily of the the party who would be the president not because they all of them a majority do\nBut\nIt it's because they had seen what the other party is and they look at the guy that they hated just a little while ago and said\n[noise] you know something he's not that bad I I I Wish you wouldn't say this I Wish you wouldn't treat this but these people when you see what they actually want you know they called Trump a fascist and at times I didn't like it ... times I I'm I'm speaking for me I'm speaking for never Trump hers you know never Trump per se but you know he he talks authoritarian but\nEven if he isn't and sometimes these sounds intolerant even if even if he isn't well then you see what the Democrats do when you say well actually this is what they mean right there is no nuance nuanced opinions here to what they mean they don't believe in due process they don't believe in a presumption of innocence they stereotype\nThey say what you know and they stereotype to fit their particular narrative at the moment and we'll change a day later\nYeah ... it's ... if you look at the I I think um where the Republicans have come together over two weeks over the last couple of weeks if not even just the Kavanaugh nomination ended up itself or\nProtecting the process during the Supreme Court nomination even\nIt's not just Lindsey Graham and no and and and the things he said I mean part of it uh it it it's all of those and more it is but the bigger picture is including by the way ... you know and and her speech which got a lot of praise on\nFriday but it really is you know the fact that I it it seems as if the party are saying yeah it's time to build a wall\nTo wall\nAround the party and what it really and four and a wall around the constitution to protect it each time that the party joined hands here and not that everybody has to agree on everything but there there has to be\nA greater respect and I think campaigning to go out and show what the and demonstrate clearly over and over again what the what the other side is doing\nAnd saying look we can all have our discussions on those issues within our house\nBut on the outside you need to know where the danger lies to you every single day and it is from this kind of behavior\nKnow the interesting thing is for all the accusations of being a fascist an authoritarian that have been leveled at Trump\nThen maybe some never Trump ... bought into ...\nA majority Republican was ridiculous because he wasn't if you see if you see what he was about if you see the things that he loves if you see the legislation that he's put into effect if you see his executive orders\nAnd what comes out of the White House about separation of powers in what they believe you know that's not true but I think that what and I think you're right on here this wasn't just about\nNomination it was the belief\nThat the Democrats truly are and it really hit when he realized it was the main stream it was those in the Senate Judiciary committee it is what is viewed as the leadership of the Democratic party that the mindset\nOf authoritarianism and fascism that mindset that they were throwing at Trump\nActually belongs to their party and they only get shredded it officially here and I and I I think it is I think it has scared\nSome Republicans who didn't want to be a part of you know the ... of supporting the Republican Party I think it scared them straight
