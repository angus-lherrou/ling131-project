clay them filling in for Ben on the bench Shapiro show with only angry women running around let's talk about what feminism does to your head I had a preview video come out\nTwo days ago David twenty four hours will say I've got a million hits on YouTube already it's an attack on feminism is tell me why I dislike them and I'm not going to play the video 'cause that's not what I Want to talk about but please go on and watch it it's telling why I think feminism is low stupid small minded meaning\nTheory a philosophy that degrades people and we don't need it turns men and women against each other and and look for me I can for most of us for most of us the relationship between men and women\nAre part of the joys of life right the ... most for most people the relationship between the romantic relationship the erotic relationship just the interplay between male and female is part of the chief constellations of life right and this is just a feminism has just turned us against each other and made people angry at each other it's promotes anger\nAnd it doesn't help women and as I point out in the video it's the constitution and classical liberalism take care of the rights of women I women are guaranteed their rights they should be guaranteeing the rights\nThey should I Want women to do whatever they want to do I think feminism degrades their femininity tells them that their feminine desires are bad and that they should have masculine desires and national and desires are the only good thing and men have stolen them for themselves that's basically what feminism says\nSo I've been obviously getting all this hate mail and what is fascinating to me about the shape now is all of it accuses me of shame that women shouldn't have whatever job they want or shouldn't have whatever job they can do wish\nIs nowhere in the video so why did why do people say this why why are they change\nIt has to be because they have conflated feminism\nWith the rights of women and this is something the press and the left has organized it's brainwashing thing where they would say if you would say a matter of fact I missed the show why against women I just I was against women I said I never found in the sample that's against women\nSo they just conflate they've conflated these two things they've conflated a philosophy feminism as a philosophy\nAnd by the way I you know you cannot say oh well it's not all feminists it doesn't matter the philosophy leads to a certain place a professor at Georgetown University okay professor at Georgetown University seen Christine fair and associate professor at Georgetown is a big school right an important school\nShe said on Saturday she said white Republican mentioned die\nAnd an added bonus would be if women cast rate their corpses and feed them to swan now if I heard words like that coming out of my mouth if I Would say gee you know something wrong with my philosophy because I shouldn't be turning into this person I got a letter from a young woman this morning and email\nIt starts out your ... and we're not going to let older white men tell us Russia's fill of racial hatred that's racially old white men and racial Adrian ages I don't like it was something wrong with being old if a if you think there's something wrong with being old just wait [laughter] guess what you know\nAnd ... and then she is and she says everything we do in the world we either do out of walls\nOr out of fear and if you're doing something out of me or you're just not getting it right so in other words\nShe is operating out of love when she calls me an F ing idiot which he says you're an old white man and white as bad the color of your skin is bad is right\nAnd and that is the delusion the delusion\nThat the ... cells that we're acting out of love and by the way you stink and I hate the color of your skin and you're too old\nAnd somebody who was a um one of the rappers just called Kanye West an Uncle Tom ... terrible it's a terrible racial

it seems logical date man I Can't why I've always had a soft spot the radical feminist smack down\nThey have conflated mixed up confused a philosophy with a gender with a group of people\nNobody is attacking women when you attack feminism but I'm attacking is the philosophy of feminism the philosophy the divides us into grievance organized moms and that's what we're seeing we're seeing the degradation of the left by that organization that's exactly it\nThat's it for me if you'd like to hear more from me can listen to the\nAndrew claiming show daily wire dot com for on I ...

Jeff where it all in a man was found dead inside a parked car by a pastor by in a residential area of West covina around seven twenty this morning in West covina police say that body may have been in the vehicle for more than a day\nTheir Cape I Know they're capable of doing good work but they refused this is where this is how you get Ted\nTurner and Greenfield a the the the dorm room yeah the\nFormer ah what was he the the CEOs either or the the the the president of CNN whatever he was a he ran CNN for for Turner both of them saying that's too political and these people see them cells that CNN right now see themselves as part of the resistance that we always knew that but\nYou know these are people that are on the right these these aren't the Fox news type saying that\nAnd then some MSNBC to for some reason they've been kept out of the discussion completely\nYeah yeah right right and and it's I think the you know what you're saying here really is that I mean it goes back to that but the um the the editor at at at buzzfeed saying\nThis is how we see are you know are journalists now ah and for the foreseeable future basically as active is is is what he was saying that was the message and that's exactly what you're seeing right now since saying\nWell we got a ton of things to ah to talk about the background check could be completed today was interesting the story that said you know our discussion is in our personal meaning or where the lawyers for Dr Ford are are\nAre saying look she hasn't been you know you haven't interviewed her yet yeah right and I saw store yesterday saying the FBI may not interviewer\nBecause she's already been interviewed right what we keep ... and we even because again because when you're talking about the FBI everybody thinks about an investigation this is not an investigation\nRight so all they are looking for is more witnesses and any new information what other witnesses are there are a you know are out there what were the allegations that were made right ... what were the allegations that were made again here\nOr in you know that that uh you know in the hearing that caused because it was after the hearing okay we need to have the FBI do for their background check okay what's the new news out there\nAnd I started thinking I said why wouldn't they interview and I'm like oh it's not an investigation it's a background check they already know what you said\nNone of them now I don't know I mean they may interviewer but I I was thinking well why wouldn't they and I went oh\nShe's already been interview and then as you interviewed by the Judiciary Committee\nAnd so what they're looking at is okay what other information now is is out there what other witnesses are out there what did she say at this hearing right and we will go talk to those people because she's the one making the allegations she's the one that testified under oath we don't need to interview\nWell she made her statement in fact she made her right to the Senate if there were\nAnything or that she anything else you wanted to introduce introduced\nTo this scenario to this a process she could actually she can do right now she could what she could still do it right and uh she and she had the opportunity to do it last Thursday but the great point you just made she still has the opportunity is still open\nRight and so what they don't have is they didn't have we didn't have witnesses making statements\nSo she's the one making the allegation so they're checking out her story mhm and if she doesn't updated with the Judiciary Committee the FBI maybe looking at this and saying well there's ... look to see the allegations she made ears and people she mentioned we talked to those people we give you a report\nWell because here's what the people said we don't need to interview her her statement is on record we need to interview all the other people that she made the allegations against or claimed that they were witnesses she has made her statement right we have that and then she wishes to change and she can go back to the she can write a letter to the Judiciary Committee\nStating or here's more information and then the FBI can go check that but they're not doing a here's the point\nThey're not doing a background check on Dr for no they're not they're doing the background check\nA on the allegations that she made against Kavanaugh\nThat we've talked in recent days about the the possibility of her perjuring herself\nBy telling a different story to the FBI but really when you think about it and you're back away from the whole thing and you look at the\nThe entire forest and not just the the you know the trees here than you or ... you very quickly come to the conclusion that there's likely zero political will to go after her for perjury unless she came out and said\nEverything I said was false and my testimony right and I I admit that I was lying about that they they would then but but any kind of you know variants in a story to the FBI likely is not going to be pursued a by the chairman a Grassley or\nBy anyone in the house I Know and I you you see Grassley saying they want to investigate the fact that her boyfriend says something ... something else because she was asked to specific question have you ever helped anybody and uh you know to counsel them about you know how to take a a polygraph test and she said no and her boyfriend is said yes but I view that\nAs putting pressure on her credibility politically in order to get the votes look once the votes on ... ...\nVote is made if he is if he has come from it's done it's over yeah right it's a ... this is this won't even be a topic next week we'll be back on moving back on the Russian collusion yeah\nYeah yeah it is not a ... and and I guess this is it is\nIt the whole I on the ball thing was asked to be the process is is really to determine\nYou know uh whether the those handful of senators actually uh believe he should be saved it or not and that that's it that's actually the only question here the media and the and the left in the media and social media want you to believe\nIt's about Kavanaugh and you know and and you must think\nThat he is you know a rapist or whatever they want to label him as now that's how you build political pressure but actually just what a five weeks out from the mid term election\nIf it is it's different because they're going to look at the polls if the polls that build that pressure and I mean the polls on the candidates themselves not whether they believe that you brought us to pull the other night\nOf while it when you introduced the facts to the case more people believe in fact it was a majority yeah if uh if you show you see that\nYou have to fifty seven percent than a change what they think and then when asked well if the FBI comes back with their report ... once once they were told that the three witnesses to cooperate and witnesses that she named\nDidn't cooperate if they said oh okay well then he should be confirmed and then write the sixty seven percent then they said well if the FBI does the background check and finds out no new information was sixty percent of Americans right believe that he should be confirmed\nA at a you know at that point of course you're going to forty percent of America as we said you know roughly it's forty percent Republican forty percent Democrats and the rest of her into the other twenty percent is roughly independence and that's where you're trying to\nUh you know that that's who you're trying to convince those in the middle ... those are the senators were looking at as well right and so uh that will that that you know who knows that that poll probably was looked at by a lot of those\nAre a lot of those or a senator so I'm a you know I I think the whole thing of the doctor for commit the you know\nAbout perjury ... on that will remain a you know will remain an issue I don't know whether they would I doubt I'd be surprised if they if they confirmed him this weekend ... ... I think it's all done yet either go to another and then they and they will do anything they they move on they move on\nTo the uh the the the next thing they move on to promoting the fact\nUh if I was the Republicans I Would promote the fact that\nYou know we you know the the we you know the Supreme Court you know we've got we've got the Supreme Court going up to the ... election\nAnd that would be promoting math to irks me NAFTA whatever it is now us MCA [laughter] yeah I I'd be promoting the the the the trade deal and Republicans you know uh you know or you know we're going to be voting on a that before the term I'd be\nTalking about all the positives and that I'd be talking about also what your political enemy spouses and you would reflect on what has happened you know in the campaign\nAnd I think that's what they would focus on at that point uh I just don't think that they would look backwards who knows I mean whether they could have a a a separate committee of you know continuing investigation as to whether she did commit perjury and ... and and not make it high profile because there would be no hearings it would just be an investigation and down the road\nA as a warning shot to anybody who might do it to a a you know a future\nNominee with you know try to come in and and commit perjury if they could prove it probably was perjury right you know they might they might do that as long as it was low key yeah I Know you're not gonna have hearings on that or a big to do on that because once they confirm him\nThe battle is over we must colors 'cause well they should go after every Democrat no but when it is you can you get him\nA on the Supreme Court yep after that that's the victory that's the super bowl\nYeah that's it uh and and I think Republicans to a ... you also campaign on look ah this this this kind of battle may not be\nAnd a man and woman were found dead in an apartment in Torrance this afternoon and what police are investigating as a possible murder suicide those bodies found and the two or twenty thousand seven hundred black ... avenue and police were sent to the apartment to conduct a welfare check\nIt's not knowing what prompted the welfare check\nBut neither of the two dead people have been positively identified K.

been charged in connection with last year as deadly Charlottesville riot and the other violent clashes\nIs scouting or sports analytics or a decision making within sports and as we'll it's a really really difficult competitive field I'm so in sports betting the primary thing your concern with his price and so you might have a really strong hunch or you may even have some data that you believe leads you to making a bet on a certain team\nBut at the prices wrong if the vigorous the rate as we would sing poker is too high you probably shouldn't make your bed meanwhile\nAnother thing you can do ... especially in a city like Las Vegas is compare the prices of various casinos and various sports books and then go hunt down the best one so you know first you come up with whatever you think your pick is going to be and people have lots of different means of arriving to their conclusions about who I Want to bet on\nBut the real secret sauces and getting the best price\nWe're talking to Tony ... professional gambler and co host\nOf the world poker tour and at this one joining us here lived in Studio ... is it something that came naturally to you or did you have to really work at like you said they're learning how to maybe play certain ... down and and you know just kind of was it was it more so naturally or did you was more like a feeling out process\nAre coming from the world of poker um sports betting was natural\nIn the sense that I accepted that my uh reads in my gases were probably value is that really it had to be a data driven decision and that um you know in poker a lot of whether you should sit in the game or whether you should you know call somebody with a hand is\nKind of putting the pieces together of all these little data points that you have\nA and all the patterns that you've been able to pick on typically through your history and not what often people think is like I looked in the guy's face and then he he you know scratch desire a little bit and then I knew what to do you know a lot of poker actually is is more data driven just a sports our data driven so I think there was a natural parallel there\nHow about just kind of follow up on that one is that something that is more recent as it always been more so that way as far as being data driven as that come here which is like the evolution of technology or what's the insight into that well\nI Will say that my getting into sports betting as a form of income is fairly recent within the last couple of years so it's difficult for me to speak about what it was like Fifteen Years ago because I Would sort of be guessing I Do know from\nReading a lot about how other professional sports better I think this law is going to impact change than it used to be easier to make money at this that the books\nUsed to be a less sharp about catching on when somebody was really really good at what they were doing and have had an edge on them um they used to share less data with each other um and they used to be less precise in the lines that they would put out um I can tell you right now that\nIf you're in Vegas and you want to do professional sports betting you have to be like at the casino minutes away from the sports book ready to jump up and get the best price\nAs compared to you know from what I understand tend to Fifteen Years ago it sort of like you'd wake up in the morning and you'd see which casinos were offering prices and you could go over there hours later and trust that it was still there they weren't adjusting as quickly\nYeah did you give me a tell us about the world poker tour that's going on um I Know I see I watch them poker on ESPN of course and those guys the intimidating look they have on their face you have to have can you can you give us some ... ... what goes on in the world poker tour and get absolutely\nSo the world poker tour offers a live tournaments in a bunch of Venus primarily in North America but increasingly international really proud of the fact that we're expanding in Asia that we have numerous event I see in Europe or we had South America last year had an event in Uruguay our first one in Brazil\nUm and what event you want to play kind of depends on your to your experience if you want to come play in our main tour which is going to be like a thirty five hundred to a ten K. by and\nYou know odds are you should either be very comfortable financially or you should be a really serious poker player and probably somebody who does this for a living but if you're just a lover of poker you\nWant to play a tournament take your shot that big money without something that might really hurt you or your you know monthly budget maybe you come up for a WPN the national event we offer like a five hundred or a thousand dollar tournament and that's still going to generate a big prize for first is going to be like six figures\nYeah and that's the thing because if I wanted to get her right I'm looking to get into it it's like where do I start yeah that's how big a thing of ... where I'd go initially and uh I think it's cool that we talked about his off the air before Tonight Show and these other countries and how it this is nothing new for them as far as like legalized gambling good acting and how that\nIt's just it's such a different mentality here in the United states and I know you lived in Australia for a period of time as well\nKind of compare and contrast that experienced a year in the U. S. like really\nOdd I Lived in Australia for five years and ah legalized gambling has been part of their legal fabric for decades now and there when you want to make a sports betting something it's just like you you got your house and you walk down the street to like I Can't remember what the term they had it for it uh\nBut it was you know something like punter shop or something and you just go you buy your bed as if you're like a seven eleven or something is very mundane in a way and there was so much stigma around gambling in the United states\nThat people are having conversations about like well what happens if we allow everybody access to this and are we going to have all kinds of crazy problem gamblers and look problem gambling\nIs a serious issue and it's one that does need to be addressed through tracking customer habits and giving people support if they do have those kinds of problems but I very much believe that gambling\nIs something kind of an inherent in in the human character and it's something that so many of us are going to do that we serve ourselves and serve our society much better by doing this legally and transparently than allowing it to be service through a black market\nYeah fascinating right\nYeah so that is fascinating man\nI'm excited man I Am I'm excited to what you're doing here and um it really shows a lot of interest in the world poker tour I'm

on the pod cast on the behind the Mike ...\nLet's go to the phones now for the first time tonight and let's say hello to solemn and he wants to talk about the Dodgers and he's in lake Balboa Solomon how you doing tonight\nI'm good guys thank you so much will you know going to talk ... because a been a fan since the age when they came here I'm\nNuts it already has fifty right I'm Sorry what\nWas the only since Nineteen fifty eight Solomon that's yeah years you know but um yeah you know of course excited about that a playoff game against Colorado was an\nExcellent game the only concern I have now going into the real post sees me first of all I don't want to see Colorado again there are several reasons number one Kennedy Jansen has to go may have to go and pitch in Colorado that's dangerous okay\nHum you can only be the team so many times a day so that's the that's the concern about Colorado\nThat's ... you know what I'm saying and and\nAgain during the horse field has always been a tough place to play dating back to when they won the world series in two thousand and seven through all of their postseason streaks and even when they've been competitive down the stretch the regular season it's a tough place to play if they had are friendly but then\nAlso hit it right on the money though you it is very tough to beat a team you know three or four times in a row and that's that's scary because they they have a lot of people they can figure out they know your rotations you probably know them they know you just as well as you you know them and that will be a much tougher game for the for the Dodgers and yeah they're\nThey're they're kind of do you know what I'm saying if you like rule do these guys here you you swept him you took that one game series they're kind of do and they started to show light which which leads me to my next point\nIn that in the bottom of the night I did not like those two home runs she can the gym say that is not a good side now you could say he was Rushdie but you do that in the postseason that's been a bite you you're not you're not going to pull to close games and close series if you'd\nThe closer that stat vulnerable to the Gulf War ball and he's done that too many charge this season\nTotally irrational I maybe yeah totally justified you don't like to see what he just gave up there the other day I'm with you on that one there Solomon and look the bullpen and shake you all year to me the key is can they get long starts and a lot of ... out of the starters here in the rotation\nYou saw guys like ... to get the job done recently young gene ... has come around they're going to need strong solid outings from the starting pitchers if we're going to get back to the world series that's the bottom line because the bullpen is not good enough\nAnd that's like ... with the bullpen and you know I'm constantly killings over the Dodgers this year as it's been their bullpen so you know uh it's gonna be interesting if if if we can sum this all up\nAnd let's say the Dodgers let's say the Dodgers let's say the Dodgers don't make the world series right or doesn't make all the other isn't happening or they don't make the play they don't they don't get off the first round what is it going to be because the storyline shows is the ... the ... the whole entire year\nI've gotten better as a season progress right now there peeking I think it's the right time hopefully their peak at they haven't it hasn't ... ran out hopefully that they can ride the wave all the way through so we'll soil\nOur our our guys got I got to put up a little bit of contention with you on that one yes they can shaky at times during the season but like I said you look at the overall staff\nFor like you know like I said when they get shaky and they had that stretch when Jansen went down and they were they you know blue all those like ninth any games they've been pretty consistent it's a pretty pretty good book and they're too biased came in you know in that in that playoff game man he he did his job\nAnd here's one aspect you haven't looked at the Dodgers lost a lot of three one games a lot of\nYou know to zip whatever they couldn't hit it was that it was that uh you know um [noise] buster or or boom light up\nNow they are the hitting starting to come around when they can't get those homers and tried to hit a little bit more consistently but they have lost close games where the bullpen was solid and they couldn't\nBuy are really so that was the problem also that you know reared its ugly head and losing to interior teams\nIt's been a couple of things and I think the best chance for this both tend to succeed and I think Roberts again you have to give them credit as he's done the best he can with pulling guys in it and taking guys out\nIs the only the circumstance and some of these guys coming out of the bullpen can succeed like you mentioned there Pedro buys again has been up and down tremendously this year but you're right to be fair like you said Solomon he's come in in some instances and has pitch well for them\nAgain it's just all about the circumstance for me what type of environmental they're becoming into in these postseason games that's really the biggest thing if they're coming in to\nBe called upon to be Superman were probably in trouble\nYeah oh no I agree and and and and and then this year not like last season you cannot depend on can lead Jansen to do their you know he's not giving you you know she's making you ate out or even for up early\nIt that that is definitely a a concern but you know then again that was that was such a great game that playoff game against Colorado the only you know caviar was that was that can really given up those to go through balls\nOf a little bit of her Vander Holyfield but to go a throwback a little bit of a a um Frazier\nIn a way because he's a knockout everybody he's ... he's knocked out\nWhich is insane you know he's ... the power he's very powerful then you've got to Tyson Fury who can who's six nine but can move and floating dance on his feet and move around in his ... like you did Klitschko and won the championship so it's going to be a great fight to see\nI'm I'm excited for it and tomorrow man I've been watching the press conference that the press tour that they've been having so far the editor in London and then they had it in in New York and that was wild with themselves so man it comes to LA and that's where the fight going to be a staple center in LA\nIs just well I Know is this excitement to be so I'm excited I'm excited to also talk to those guys as well so I was going to be fine\nGood stuff to come obviously here not only tomorrow but in the coming months in Los Angeles let's push back now to the NFL weren't the quarter pulled the season we're through four weeks\nThere there's some surprises there is some not some big surprises as well some of the things that stood out to me over the weekend um number one is that we take a look at the AFC East so much high expectations for the Miami Dolphins heading into Sunday and obviously a colossal disappointment against New England where they basically laid an egg\nWe've seen this happen many times over the years but we thought this would be a different Miami team not the same patriots to rule that division that's one thing of the second thing is the Cincinnati Bengals are a lot better than I thought they would\nBe keys or wind is called John ... Yeah John ... that's what it's called ... nice\n... nice and not only that but they've been doing some things that just had been really turning a lot of head and who they thought but the Pittsburgh Steelers were just talking about before are currently in last place and they asked the north so you know a little bit of a surprise there and in the NFC right now\nUh the NFC East the Redskins are a little better than what people thought at two and one Alex Smith not bad we know he is what he is he he's up and down and he can go through the streets where you get you some wins and I obviously that that's working wonders so far Washington it's early but at the moment right now tied for first and the NFC East and\nAh you know the giants are what we thought they were I think not very good at not a very good football team\nAgain they should have tried to go back home and they should have for one\nAnd here's I'm Amazed how people are surprised they're like Brad the giants we are going to be a lot better yeah I really thought that like I just people could not get past the names of Eli Manning oh del Beck and junior like you say keep and St Paul I'm Barkley who are all great in their own right but\nI mean let's face it you're like man he was an old quarterback in the twilight of his career and that teen outside of those guys is not very good you know so I'm not surprised there one in three and my I'll take the so my biggest surprise right now and the NFC is the Chicago Bears course got to be right it's\nGot to be the Chicago Bears we're really recently and we will be gone on our show yes and he ... and they died and um you know the bears defenses is he said they're not the eighty five ... but they're close they're close to it and they're tough defense man they just stifling man I\nI have to say do I think their their deepest is better than the Jacksonville Jaguars is close but not there yeah yeah there yet but man that defense of fry it is amazing a ... man I Know the razor kicking himself or giving him up uh he's just he's changed the whole dynamic of the team\nAnd not just on the defense of it but also in the office of in\nSo you're seeing it see right now leading in the NFC North uh which is shocking to me I got to say this though ... everybody was concerned about the New Orleans saints\nRemember we talked about what was going on with the sayings now you look up and where the new\nOrleans Saints right now either first player first house but I think there was more higher expectations of the defense will be a little bit better\nThat will be and not thinking about getting there just take some time just like I told you what the ... we said with the pets in the patriots you know they're getting Julian ... Gordon was in the mix the other day he had some great patches and stuff once you start getting your team and he started rolling along you start to see the things to start to fill out\nAnd I think that's what you're going to get with them as well so man and then our LA rounds\nTo me the most famous lawyers for now I I really believe that and they're going to go to a street cred they've got to road games coming up the next couple of weeks so people yeah a lot of people think they're vulnerable against Seattle this weekend I Do not lie though because historically right\nThey they if you look at every game they play it against\nThe uh the Seattle Seahawks\nIt's always been a close game or or even those in a loss or whatever that game is going to be a close game but that was Garza what you say I'm just telling you what we think the key word there historically historically and ... and ... even with the new team\nThis is going to be a close game why I think Carol Carol knows something and and so I think this game is going to be a tough game within yourself I I have to go with I'm going to Seattle\nCan somehow acquire levy on bell this week we just talked about the tire out for maybe they've got a pretty good shot but outside of that I just don't think so I I don't think this is the same Seattle team that dynasty is over that run it is not\nComing back with ... current group of players and there's not many of them were even left who are part of that the run there from a couple of years ago so again\nI think the rams right now head and shoulders above everybody in the west and to me obviously one of two teams left made an undefeated in the NFL I think for the most complete team because Kansas City although we can talk about them for a moment they've been\nIncredibly impressed of an ... the defense I ask you some questions about\nGod can I ask you this question where we have this debate off their ... homes and Jared off\nAre they in the top five quarterbacks talked to him quarterbacks\nAnd illegal top ten not top five knocks off the top ten yeah I think you can definitely make the case right now and it's yeah it's it's if not for sure they're on the during the conversation I think they are on the conversation but we didn't give him talk to\nYou can't I Can't Fifteen for you top top Fifteen yeah okay yeah I mean we can go through and we we did this recently for Jared golf and I definitely think jak off the top and quarterback now and I think he's right there at like ten\nHe I think he's right into I think Patrick my home and now obviously we have more of a sample size yet off than most homes\nAnd I do think it's again the early eighties very early and I know some people are getting a little bit carried away on his success here but again you have to obviously judges we go along and what we see on the field look\nThat was really impressive last night all your road in Denver I got tough place to play and we talked about the rocket foreign Denver the mile high effect as a matter what sport it's always tricky there and it doesn't matter\nHow many cars are either they miss some place though the rest of listen plays back\nBaker brat back breaker play and they did and he did yeah and it's not the first time this year that\nData that hard to say it's a whole dynamic of the game though that's my thing is like actual hold those work to throw it was passed a line of scrimmage they did it twice you get close to the judge and that was in the fourth quarter that happening you know those are decided I should get enough\nNow kid that he's I mean he's as advertised the quarterback who you can see why the chiefs moved up in the draft\nTo chicken or they did I I obviously I mean look Andy Reid is saying that that last time you see in a quarterback with this type of capabilities on off ants as far as like scrambling throwing in the pocket was Brett Farr not some high price\nThat is I've raised he reminds me a little bit of Russell Wilson oh yeah he's definitely a remarkable Russell Wilson and he was going to be a great quarterback in his league I just don't think he's talked in right now but he's going to be a great quarterback he's in the conversation in terms of really quarterbacks I have to say that\nRight now the most disappointing team is Houston now Oakland Raiders man who the raiders or do I look one and three I don't think really a lot of raiders fans\nI wanted to write I didn't anticipate that at all with the Oakland Raiders are wanting being one in three said on paper I think they should be be competing with the AFC West I'm the AFC\nA flat down the street it hurt them to you and as long as it has hurt them but you know that has been my disappointment issue has been the Oakland Raiders Houston\nShaun Walker is trying to get himself back into things you know he just not quite there yet that was a severe ACL tear very disappointed in defense do you what the defense they have with JJ what I mean those virus healthy yeah and they still can't get it in ... and that's what that's that's the only disappointing but all around team I gotta say the Oakland Raiders\nYeah it's disappointing again starting one in three there but it it it's year one out of ten years for a group that contract you've got to pass my concern though is their car you it's got to be because if he is this more so he's still working back from injury or is this what he is at this point\nBoth say hey great show today great gassed with Tony ... in Studio we appreciate his time back at it tomorrow night same place same time and to then for Keith I'm Brad keep living the dream [noise]\nFurnished by values media [noise]\n\nLos Angeles orange\nCumulus station\nEarthquake wait us Amazon's raise a

six six Ninety\nOr read I was Bryan we were just talking to yeah by the way he is Eric I'm Gary ... a just a a couple of things quickly here that that I respectfully disagree with him a on when he the one of the first things he said was uh that uh\nUh these these Democrats are saying all this that you know they're not normally democratic as they're not on the credit white and rhinos or Ronald ... while he's harbors Republican he's a conservative or they should get he said concert OK well then you're talking about something different but but the these are mainstream Democrats\nOr that they these are the Democrats up today and they may not be a my grandfather who was who was a ... by high grandfather and my dad's side today who was a the Democrat he helped form the Democrat Party in the town that I grew up in in New York because it was\nA Republican town or early early part of the twentieth century\nAnd when he came there he he immigrated from Canada and he ... because of the but the prejudiced against a Irish Catholics in Ontario mhm is family came to you and so when he came salt was one party Tony sort of I Want to\nAmong them other party my grandfather today would be considered\nAbsolute right wing conservative ... of uh so uh you know to to sit there and but but when you look at the Democratic party today\nWhich are seen as the mainstream meantime find signs of mainstream of the Democrats mhm are you this is the Senate Judiciary committee that you're talking about right this is mainstream Democrat as you can get\nAnd so I Would disagree with you when you say the the the the what's going on now today's Democrats today's Democrat right ah ah rhinos aren't conservative but rhinos uh our Republican\nThere the there is a bride if you look at at at how many are right now on Capitol Hill the Republicans have you do the headcount and and and do the put the real test in terms of being a real conservative well that many of them are in fact most of them failed that\nTest what we forget were rhinos came from because everything by the way the swamp as involved as about everything about from what the original meaning was and rhinos used to be those Republicans who would spend like Democrats ... well that's almost all the Republicans today including the president ...\n... and they're not talking about the tax write nobody's talking about the debt anymore one of the reasons Trump got elected was because when Paul Ryan was well after John Banner accidents stage slapped and Paul Ryan came aboard\nAnd Republicans were furious that were screaming but truck Trump was talking about it about how you know if they could they came in and he said nope the budget that rubber Ryan came in the budget it's been done is done and we're going to move on and people were furious and Paul Ryan became the rhino\nThey they they've got to care about spending that help motivate Trump\nMhm you know\nTo where he became you know a Trump than we need to get this budget down we need to you know do these things now the Republican Party they don't care about spending\nNo though yeah rhino rhinos may not be conservative but rhinos are the mainstream of the Republican Party right today they are and even the administration\nMhm it would not have been acceptable it would not have been acceptable\nFrom any previous Republican administration before this one as we talked about yesterday we talked about the trade deal to do the trade deal with Canada and Mexico and have the stipulation now the automobile companies like we had that would've been absolutely unacceptable and and and the debt\nAnd then what the project to the deficit yes a is somewhere around a trillion or ... or more you know when you look at that are over the is it over the next year I think they'd be next fiscal year um that wouldn't have been acceptable in fact I remember\nWhen Obama came in to to power came into the presidency he was talking about well I inherited that huge deficit remember that mhm which by the way we had to point out well you were actually a part of it 'cause you voted for that\nSeven hundred billion dollar package so you were part of that you didn't inherited you helped to make it happen it wouldn't have happened\nAh without the Democrats voting for\nIt as well including him but the point being is that back in two thousand this would have been

government raised the minimum wage for seven fifty an hour it's like oh you're doing it now that you've raised it yeah right or not unexpected tight labor market that we have today mhm well and there was a lot of flak\nOn a as the especially early on as they were setting up the distribution centers for Amazon or receiving a lot of negative press on the the uh the workers being overworked underpaid and that kind of thing you set the new standard which goes above I think even the Cosco\nA starting or or maybe it's the same as Costco I I Can't remember we're Cosco went a Walmart which ten dollars an hour a few years ago on starting wage\nAnd the starting wage now you will be Fifteen dollars an hour by the way private sector companies can do that if they wish but it is about and here's what happened at Walmart\nUm they you know they were clearly they were changing not just the pay\nThat that's there's a a public relations point to be made there no no problem but it's also to attract a people who might stay with the end and retain people for much longer period or they did the same thing with her college which uh they're they're offering college if you work\nPart time or fulltime at Wal Mart for roughly a dollar a day they basically take it out of your check and you go to an online courses to universities\nAnd but you have to do a business a business degree or a degree in a in a logistics uh but but either way a logistics management I think it is but what they're trying to do is get people trained people\nTo be at a company for a long time that is what every private sector company wants to do and they're going to pay 'em you know and I think the the market has changed for an Amazon because Amazon now you know essentially being the biggest in their take non Walmart\nAnd
