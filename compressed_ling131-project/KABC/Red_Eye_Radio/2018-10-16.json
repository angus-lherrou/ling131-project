ugly weekend violence breaking out between ... and the Proud Boys both in New York and in Portland so first Portland so there was a a march called the Patriot ... pay for it pride I Believe um and it happened in Portland over the weekend\nIt was and it got ugly because antifa showed up and people basically started beating the crap out of each other here's a little bit of the bra\n[laughter] fighting with each other you know other hoarding or the demonstration\nMartial law and order in the streets of Portland descent into chaos his rival political factions broke into bloody brawls downtown\nSaturday Night members of the right wing repatriate player and they're black and black clad adversaries none of antifa used they're sprayed therapists and baton to thrashing ... each other outside Kelly's Olympian a popular bar on south west Washington street and mainly which lasted more than ... ended when riot costs rushed and inspired pepper balls in the street fighters now as I say\nWhat's happening here is that group patriot prayer which I are being kept his white nationalist and I'm not in strong enough evidence to say that that the white nationalist groups I in any case\nAnd then this coming from a guy who's happy to say when I think people are white nationalist ready to episode after Charlottesville talking about white nationalism and the evils and be All right\nPatriot prayer was doing a mark in Portland specifically because they wanted to show that anti violent and people showed up and it looked like antifa instigating violence and the folks at patriot prayer then got into it with that including some of the Proud Boys from Gavin begin is his group um and it got violent now as I say\nI think that is perfectly worthwhile to publicly march against violence\nAnd I think it's okay to defend yourself too but there's a difference between being willing to defend yourself in spoiling for a fight to the point where you are looking to meet the living crap out of somebody because number one you shouldn't be looking to beat the crap out of people in Russia fashioned like once a guy down the guys down now it's time for law enforcement on it and number two\nIs perfectly obvious that the media are going to play it as though in his right wing group instigating violence as opposed to keep up which has been ... every single place it do instigating violence and all of them or video from that Raul in Portland\n[noise] in the front of hitting each other on each other [noise] people shouting at each other and then there was also a separate brawl in New York so\nIn New York there was a an event at the New York metropolitan club that had been defaced by allegedly antifa or over the past couple of days\nAnd there was an event for making is the leader of the problem now again the media have labeled the Proud Boys a white nationalist groups there members of the Proud Boys who are white nationalist Yemen is not a national and no Gavin Gavin is not only nationally Gavin\nI think it's any more strict about who he involves friends but isn't just the Gavin is white nationalist ignores any part of his rhetoric or that that's just not accurate now with that said\nYou the Proud Boys well for a fight yeah they do and you can see that in this particular video in New York now and he was planning of the problems in getting violent\nAbout boys are claiming that he plans to get into violence barely after the event they walk out there were many members somehow the violent get instigate it and you end up with basically talking numbers and the Proud Boys picking living crap out of three members that have [laughter]\nI mean they will get on the guys are taking them and then eventually you'll see some members of sort of surrounding crowd actually\nPulling people off of these guys on because they don't want them you know getting arrested or killing somebody on the street\nBrawls fought in public street this is not ... it's not divulging nation and if the police won't do their job is going to get worse and worse and it may or is not going to do their job is gonna get worse and worse New York governor Andrew Cuomo called on the FBI to investigate violent clashes connected the Proud Boys and he blamed President Trump for the hatred and violence he tied the altercation\nEnded up finishing this is not a federal issue\nAnd the state and city should investigate every one of these incidents and the people who instigate violence and go to jail if the city was doing that in the first place you'd brawls would not be breaking out we've seen them now in New York City is it all ugly stop\nYes you're ready to defend yourself don't go to events are spoiling for being there in coordination with the police if you're on the side of law enforcement you're doing something right and if the less refuses to allow law enforcement you a job this sort of stuff is going to become more and more prevalent and it's horrible for the country truly truly awful for the country\nWell we'll be back here tomorrow with all the latest updates including perhaps may be able to track down Elizabeth Warren's actual\nNative

ten o'clock I'm Jeff ... LA's department\nOf water and power reports said sixty nine hundred of its one point five million customers are without power this evening due to the gusty winds but ah DWI pieces its crews are working hard to restore the electricity to all of the homes and businesses that it serves\nIn fact I've wondered out loud if Providence was involved in his election after all Obama had done you know what do they say was gonna radically change our country and I thought it might have been too late for America if Hillary had won\nI at one says Bruce ... for those who don't know who he is he ran for the Senate against Barbara Boxer her first time she ran and ... and then I became is never think they told me is chief surrogates spokesman I Would speak for him when he could make an event\nAnd he ... he was poised to win it was fifty fifty I think the weekend before\nAnd then I'm just thinking about allowed the Democrats are always there's been in their playbook I said that last night they saved this thing against him that he'd gone to some kind of ... you say if you knew Bruce ... such an innocent guy\nHe didn't go there for for anything to do with sex or anything like that it was just a place they going ... in fact he was going on I can say this because it came out with one of the hosts set at KBC where I used to be a host\nA seven Ninety KBC and it was just like I said oh you want to go here Bruce and he said yes and it was meant to spring on him the last weekend sound familiar with Diane Feinstein or to try to show conservative voters oh look what he was willing to do to go to a unseemly nightclub to put it that way [noise]\nSo yeah I just thought of that they've always had some of their playbook nothing's new\nBut anyway uh he lost that we can and one of the reasons people said he lost his because if you remember a George H\nHad pulled out of California I think in that election that he lost a to Clinton and he pulled out all those funds and then they use all of that to make sure box one but it's fifty fifty before that we can and they pull those dirty tricks\nBut he's a brilliant man and I wanted to ask for surgeons in by the way he worked for Richard Nixon\nAnd I I think he said this on the air so I could say he was one of the few that said don't don't resigned don't give this thing up\nYou you remember some people think Nixon was impeached wasn't impeach the he withdrew for the sake of the country even though a lot of people thought Richard Nixon was was pretty bad but Bruce that I went with him there and I I tried to convince them not to resign but he said no we're going to do for the sake of the country anyway I asked Bruce once almost beat Barbara Boxer for the U.S Senate from California\nIf he thought God was involved in the founding of our country\nBruce always taught me something whenever he was on and he answered of course did you ever think how young the founders were and how they got almost everything right\nAnd it was it also Providence I Would ask myself that we got George Washington when we needed them so badly remember they wanted to make him king if you know your history and he turned it down and you know set up I'm going to retire a president says okay that's enough\nAnd Abraham Lincoln and Ronald Reagan when we needed the most you wouldn't get any argument from me about gods involvement\nAnd now I think you're going to ... I think I'm Crazy we got Donald Trump with all those personal shortcomings when the country needed him most as long ago was saying you know Providence I don't know but I wouldn't you wouldn't get any article from me\nYes he won and I was a strong supporter\nOf his during the general election of course that doesn't say much either considering who he was running against right\nAnd I remember many of us thought we would be very satisfied if President Trump would just nominate conservative judges that that was enough especially for the Supreme Court we all are a lot of people I knew thought hey that would work for me that's that's enough right there and I think a lot of people across the country felt that way\nSo I thought we were way ahead of the game when he appointed a Judge Gorsuch to the U.S Supreme Court but it didn't stop there and I'll just mention some of them are things he's done a metro ... much better lists last night ending the bomb a care mandate opening up the Keystone Pipeline remember Obama wouldn't do it and I n war reserves\nAnd in countless regulations hurting the economy and the proof is how well the economy is doing\nA significant tax cuts lowering our taxes and simplifying the tax forms by the way it was ... and the same one I mentioned who years before his time say we should be able to fill out or a tax returns on a postcard and then everybody copied them years later and ah that that is eventually the where they want to go with us\nMoving of the U.S embassy to Jerusalem getting us out of the Paris Peace accords withdrawing from the disastrous Iranian deal I didn't talk much about that last night can imagine we paid them hundreds of billions of dollars under fifty billion under Obama gave them secret cash on a plane which he denied\nPay them off for what they're our biggest enemy ... you know do you feel like I Do that you live that I live on a different planet I mean don't you always of our biggest enemies or at least the ones killing our soldiers right now we give them money to eat them to hurt us and hurt our people\nThat alone I mean is incredible eight six six nine to read I Want to know what you think about the Iranian deal is incredible\nEight six six same number nine o seven thirty three thirty nine meeting with Kim all young to possibly reduce the denuclearization of the ... then Sheila getting American remains return from North Korea making sure our borders means something I admit that hasn't been solved yet\nWe're gonna talk we didn't last night about the the Marshall people from Honduras opt to request asylum that's going to be a winning a situation for him to deal with and I'm saying that obviously sarcastically\nAppointing countless conservative justices lower court's not\nRight you watch federal judges and ah you know the ninth district which is a crazy district or gets overturned the most saying things like a you know he Trump kept the president can't do is they can't do that it's a Muslim ban and all this kind of stuff and they've taken power and their own hands well some porn that he points these lower court judge a federal judges to\nAnd of course the naming now of a second Supreme Court choice another conservative Brett Kavanaugh the list goes on and on\nAnd the American people love that he's not politically correct\nThe American people are tired of all those politicians who spin and spin and spin and are afraid to see what they're really thinking so maybe he does too much but at least you you get people love his honesty or at least he says what he means\nYou can never say that about President Trump that he doesn't say what he means he may say to watch\nBut he never says two little I came up with that one is one of the most conservative presidents in my lifetime and he's done a great job and most the American people get it but it doesn't matter to the left or to Democrats or the comrades in the media\nI'm afraid to tell the left the Democrats and liberal listeners all the call and they let me know what you think and I said last night I bet it's said softly if the presidential election were held today President Trump would easily be reelected\nHe's kept most of his promises and the American people appreciate that and he is resonating with the American people more than ever\nAnd I don't know if you feel the same way I think each day he's becoming more and more presidential he's growing into the job if you remember Harry Truman to replace the FDR and people set off I teach government history too so I Know some of the stuff and they said oh he's going to be awful terrible but they said Truman grew into the job also\nYou're dreaming by the way if you think he's going to be defeated I just wanted to tell you ... out there and the other side you will fail to get rid of him but not from lack of trying you start in the day he won that it's so obvious that\nActually we know they started the resistance against them much before election day but it was election day can they couldn't believe that this ... so called bumbling fools had one\nAll right he was so bumbling but he's still one right no matter what the upper lead or of the FBI and the Justice Department may have guaranteed right where we've seen the text between page and struck and all that stuff\nHe won I don't know about you but I was teaching in that time at night and I was almost in tears when I heard he won Pennsylvania which was always seems to me like Republicans fools goal you know we're going to wait at this time going to win Pennsylvania we got down\nAnd not only did he win but despite their best efforts he won he still here and he's going to be here for six and a half more years no matter the Mahler persecution I okay\nProsecution so persecution to me no matter the hostile media media no matter the never Trump hers which I can never understand them no matter all the elites and the swamp President Trump is still here\nWhich never should have happened according to them and despite their best efforts to destroy him including getting a special prosecutor appointed I fault attorney general sessions for that I'm going to talk about that more later he should never have recused himself he played into the Democrats hands\nPoliticians typically talked our adversaries that's not a big deal you toss them you've talked to the Russians including a bomb and you remember Obama promising off Mike the things would be better when he got re elected that'd get you know make more stuff happened\nI've been a big supporter sessions when he was a senator but I'm disappointed in his jobs attorney general and disappointed his lack of oversight Rosenstein but more of that later\nSessions should've made amends by fire Rosenstein especially if he threatened ... did you hear that he threatened them as they helped their bosses conduct oversight\nAnd justice disappointed by the way is the new FBI direct to almost nonchalant attitude about corruption in his agency that amazed me\nThis is all gotten way out of hand and it is clear to many people by now that Mueller's investigation is a witch hunt in search of a crime\nIf anything there was a soft coup to get rid of President Trump perpetrated by the highest that blondes are our government at the Justice Department and at the FBI and I'm not sure until all the dust settles was my prediction if\nWe won't find President Obama's fingerprints all over the you wait and see we're we're never supposed to find out about the subterfuge because Hillary was supposed to win\nAnd says it's crews are working

customer found the infant last Monday inside the stores the restroom and immediately notified a manager\nIt it's hard to adjust you know the the traveling the different calls and stuff like that and for me\nThat was also the hardest part of getting adjusted to European style of the game is that things are slow or you know here we rely on a lot of things like a athletic ability and a\nAnd there's more thinking man's game because let's say the athletic ability is was not really there and you know as much as it is here so\nLike you have big guys back then so I'm Talking Fifteen Years ago I started who was shooting three pointers which was on a herd of here yeah we've stuck to the big guys down on the block yeah that's right jumping up and I can do the cream you got it yeah they were shooting threes and\nAnd really moving and stuff like this and you know so there was a lot of things that get adjusted to yeah and this is the main challenge at the beginning trying to adjust to the European style of the game and\nYou know and it's also the language and things like you you know like edge niche\nBut he said to the you know you gotta you gotta learn these things and this is this is part of their culture but at the end of the day that was the the biggest challenges I think at the beginning\nUh basketball itself is pretty much the same at the end of the day just a small difference this yet to get over\nCould you have for scene originally when you started over there in the early to thousands playing that style like Europe all becoming popular in the states at some point as a kind of is now with some of these guys such as ... which may be somewhat of a\nPassing the torch down there in Dallas from Devinsky to him this year other guys as well gee noble e over the years in San Antonio and did you think it would eventually come over to the states at least popular to the extent it is today\n[laughter] no I didn't but I mean like with everything else I think the technology helped a\nLot of things are going on a lot of big movements in in in Europe as far as basketball and so\nYou know like every way you can find talent everywhere all over the world and I think it was just a matter of time before the MBA so I look and I think they probably should look a lot more in Europe and to bring bring in guys here I mean it's difficult what thirty guys get drafted a year and the guys get dropped the years\nIt really is amazing race small sample size especially when you compare to other sports you got like ... the major league baseball Kelly what twenty rounds essentially and hockey does as well we know about the NFL it's a great point because I feel like it's not stressed enough about how it is so limited when you break it down to how many guys actually get to play in the NBA come out of the draft each year\nYeah yeah it and also then I I just know\nHow it was also adjusting to cause your point guard so\nThe coaches schemes things like that that nature communications coach look we're in Northridge we always we were the general on the floor right we have always whatever ... brands was gay but as we had to make sure we relay that message out there\nHow was it out there in terms of in Austria how ... how are you able to to communicate with the clothes knowing that you didn't even know the language at that moment in time how was how did you communicate with him or did you or what what was that like\nI think that communication always I mean when you have a good synergy with the team and when she coach and with the place but it did the communication is always got\nHow I did it was like how many other player who uh is a pro should do it the coaches expect you to know a lot of things may expect you to be on a level and and and when they recruit you they know what they did yeah so you do they're looking for certain types of player and like you know me I was a pass first kind of guy\nMaybe I got into a situation where I had to score a little bit more\nYeah but this was easy yeah I just have to play my game and\nThe real communication is when you do something bad a method ... overall I mean the you know you know schemes are the same everybody has a ... a little bit differences of how they want you to path and move but yeah you can get adjusted easy what's\nThe biggest misconception about European style basketball that maybe a lot of people still don't realize here in the states\n... a misconception [laughter]\nThink about that with uh\nI guess that the guy is really can't compete on the level I ... I mean I think that the talent level is much more deep than what the people really no yeah I I you know this is a big misconception and um it\n'cause we only hear about a couple of guys you do hear who you know when you have like those mock drafts put up they're only talking about maybe like two three four guys you're saying it's a lot more deeper than that the pool\nYeah it's the same as here you know I mean we got you know in America loan raises obviously there's many more tolerance than that make it to the NBA and it was kind of the same thing now and there's also a little bit of politics and the game you know what I'm saying like\nThey got the guys look good dancers for example we supposed to live any other movie and I was there for a tournament and he's a hometown guy he was brought up there and and and kind of you know push push to be in a position he is yeah and in this situation\nThese guys stand out yeah that might be another guy is just as good in in in the neighborhood but just not in the right you know not in not in the right position and that and that that takes away but I think there's a lot more talent and then you can imagine\nMarcus car joining us

of it for yourself playing basketball in his case and also kinda venturing into some business stuff than as well I'm really cool stuff\nYeah is is great in is really inspiring to see that he's made it pretty much the basketball just isn't everything you know it's kind of paved the way this you know for a career wise from going overseas to now building a brand\nThat's been huge out there and it's just a really good to see if you have to see him too I haven't seen him\nIn about seven years man has been a long time you're saying yeah days he stays out there he does his business he has family out

man to come back in in in in the um is get just get to see and also just think about the times we had when we were there so it's crazy but I Am I'm very happy for\nA little trip down memory lane doubt that's incredible he led the nation and assess\nA man he was on north or it he was I I just I didn't honestly I was I was the guy that back them up and and and uh\nBut man not just only off of a defensively was tough and we have battles man we were battling each other but this guy would just he was he just remind me of like a Magic Johnson he could see things that you just couldn't see how ... how do you get that ball in there and he used to tell gas\nYou know be ready have your hands or have your hands up and you know and he can score that's the thing\nHe told me this one store is really bad he ought to he went to camp for the Lakers and Kobe Bryant and was there and he said he where the Kennedys working out with the Lakers he did well but he said man Keith I've never seen the guy\nShoe one leg shots but over the back for a hundred times and just work on that the whole time for like an hour now are straight he was just like when he shoots the ball\nHe literally follows all the way from winning releases his hand into it drops down through the net and to the ground that that that's how how focus ... so you know he has a shot and everything but it's just great to see\nUm what do you know how far his career is taking them so\nOnce again check out his work crossover nation dot com on Instagram switch underscore cross over nation YouTube is well it's kind of cool to go in pain yeah check that out as well one eight hundred to two to five to two to taking your calls at that number let's get into this Dodgers game tonight game three\nFour to nothing I mean brutal to watch very difficult Walker ... actually I thought did not pitch bad in this game you want to have an innings or give up for runs obviously got no run support\nStory the game was not even so much for me the uncharacteristic play once again of ... um and some of the areas there but it really for me it was just about\nThis walkie pitching was fantastic yeah and it wasn't even so much them over powering the Dodgers lineup\nThan just being able to methodically pick them apart sort of say and paint\nAround in and around the strikes on their um it was quite a show that they put on again very frustrating for the boys in blue trying to get anything going offensively in this game it reminded me a lot of game one of these early in the game how they were just so struggling to even touch or some of this Subarus pitching so that that's where I started on this well\nYou know you look at the game and I I was\nWatching the game from start to finish and they really get nothing going through the ninth inning again what's really frustrating about Washington's everybody's trying to sleep for the fences man instead of just trying to make it into the ninth inning regardless just trying to get basic because you know why because they had to\nThey're forced to because they're turning it feel ... think older Maria\nI compared to what the Yankees went through last theories against the red Sox and the division around same thing when ice cold at the plate they lived and died by the long\nBall yeah and and I guess they're just going to do that and if they're going to do that this is going to be a very long or short series for them you know\nUm and and and the next thing or what I look at when I watch the game is the errors the brewers just capitalize\nOn the air is that they have you know when you're in this part of the game and you're in championship games you can't there's no room for errors\nYou can't have those errors and they had they had a couple of hiccups I'm from the pitching mound to even the catching around\nAnd you know and it and it hurt them and then you know it was it to me it wasn't just one person that mess the game of it was a collaborator collaborative effort of all of them and they just wanted it and it goes back to I say I sat down I was I see is the Dodgers have a tough time when it at home or they're not a great home team\nUm but I think what has gone on here is that a guy's like Brian ... who were brought into somewhat replace secret leases rental this season\nI think and many Machado is well it's the first time these guys are on this stage\nAnd they're good hitters but I I don't know if if they're necessarily the right hitters for this team right now because they're almost like looking at many Machado is okay I think a lot of fancy before he needs to be like a superstar yeah in the series I don't think he's a superstar he star star\nThe difference between the star died\nYeah he's going to carry your team yeah and that's the big thing but but again it it it's not all his fault it to me the main thing you can break it down to is this team is not good enough to just have one or two guys this is not the Yankees light with guys who are going to hit a bill in home runs they they just don't have that\nWhat they have is a collection of players that when they're collectively playing good hitting it works but right now again you can't have Ballenger going over for and you can't have plead not playing up to his capabilities\nAnd again you know what as far as I'm concerned I mean last time I remember ... is a very fast runner\nWhy isn't he not Bunning the boss sometimes in in ... and running you know utilize or speak to your advantage you know are they got a lot of guys that can run really fast and they're just not utilizing to their advantage\nThere that's what I'm saying they're not ... to me they're not maximizing their their players talent and and I think they need to do a little better job of that and look maybe they don't do it this year and maybe I think it's too late because they they're just going to go with what they know and what got them to this point\nAnd I get it you know you know you got to trust your system and let your system work\nBut to me this is not a system this is just a fifty fifty\nHit if this is not a it's like a home run derby so to speak to swing for the fences and if he gets there it gives different doesn't hopefully it stays in the in field and gets dropped or something like that\nAnd I just think that's the way they've been playing\nAnd is catching up to them and it it it definitely has its catch up to them and I think the Milwaukee Brewers are playing a little bit more smarter baseball you know they're playing a little bit smarter and you know they wanted their really here they are in the end they know they need it because those two very talented teams on the other side\nYou know you got the ... and ... and ... and the red Sox and those are two very talented teams\nAnd those are the teams that don't just sleep for the fish fences they play baseball the way it's supposed to be played\nSo I'm just hoping the Dodgers can do the same thing next game maybe they'll change it a look\nTheir their manager he's doing a great job in terms of\nUh uh you know\nSwitch up changing of the guys but I think he should have state you should be you know change of the catchers and things like that but I think he should have stayed with each other\nYeah I I don't blame the Roberts too much in this series I I think that ... has been fantastic for the most part from Milwaukee\nAnd look I think that the brewers have just simply I played them in spot so far yeah\nI mean it you can make the case um a couple of moved here and there but again a ground all starting him today I never a problem with that you started Barnes on Saturday I mean what ... what is going to need a week off I mean hello yes I I just you have to kind of roll with what you have at this point\nAnd um I just I I think I think Roberts is a big reason why it seems even in this spot right yeah I I ...\nDefinitely not the person to take a blame he's definitely not the person that they should be blaming I think he's making some decisions I think today he made a bad decision by starting ... that's just my personal opinion I just think he did but for the most part man he is\nBut she's not the one plane he's the one he's managing but he the one plane man these I've got to perform he can't go out there hit the ball for you you can't catch the ball can still bases for you you got to do that and you know you get paid this amount of money to do that you got to do that you got to show up\nSo you know I think he's made I only decision I think he may wrong in this whole aspect was starting to ... I was I Would stay with what I had actually won the game and that was it\nFor for the most part I think he's done a great job\nThey need a big performance tomorrow out of rich ... he gets a start geo Gonzales from Milwaukee you have if there's any day that hill is going to come out and it is really going to take out of them are going to be them up on and I have confidence I think a lot of doctors should have confidence that he should be able to do that\nAgain this is not a crazy high pope Milwaukee off and they pick their spots\nAnd there look there'd be into the country now and opportunities but you have the ability to some kind of return the favor a little bit from what you saw tonight as far as kind of keeping their up and down the way they held you down\nQuickly I Want to get to a Monday Night football Aaron Rodgers put on the show does once again but the crazy thing was this was actually a game and I mean on paper this look what I mean no Jimmy ... below CGI bath or you're not really feeling this\nMatchup on Monday Night especially a dome game in limbo it's already like sub freezing temperatures up there if you noticed that one already a kind of like how it was intended for yesterday with the snow outside for the rams but\nUm yeah Rogers is being Rogers some of those throws work textbook Aaron\nRodgers at the end that game to leading down the field is at the game when he feel go by Mason Crosby who boy did he redeem himself here from last week a going ah like for for for tonight\nAnd really make it better go forth from Florida and I haven't been as John ... exactly right although right now uh unless you're adjusting Tucker everyone's kind of struggled rallied to kick out fuel goes by much\nI'm either way on the Packers get it done it just feels like they are GI ... barely hanging on by a threat or the lawyer it feels like Aaron Rodgers has barely hanging out right away if he is the whole team\nGet let's just let's just call it what it is man he's heart\nHe's playing ... I think it's more of him saying I'm going to give it a go I was going to play this either because he's not moving the same he's definitely not you can tell he's favoring that me\nHe's a you know even the play he may even the place he made a playmate a divide Lee Adams off the back foot which was incredible throws where it touched down um you know he just not he's not moving the same\nOdd to say this the dry that he made with a minute left in the game eighty yards was impressive that last item win the game that was impressive when I was ... like you said textbook Aaron Rodgers um and that's why he's great and that's why he's a top five quarterbacking is lead today\nAnd um and and I look at just what he what he's done his whole resume all around man it was just a phenomenal performance for him and doing it on one lake it was just great to see\nIt makes you think how much longer is he really going to go that he I mean there's no way you can finish shop the season\nI I don't think it's going to be lucky these these are going to try but man you can tell Brett he only can move he can't move you can only can go up and down he can't move laterally at all\nYou can see it no cuts no anything you can just see the way he's moving and that goes back to ... broke on ... over here here's a tornado you it that's what it is\nRams remain undefeated win against Denver yeah so like I said it was it was snowing outside and looked like it was like middle December is crazy out there I mean again Todd ... the money man he's earning every single penny of that contract right now talking to a hundred yard yesterday he's the most productive back right now and the leak\nOh yeah absolutely um you know you look at what he's been doing and his resume when he's he's showing why he's supposed to get paid that amount of money\nAnd that's what you want from ... do you ... you weren't he reminds me of a little bit of a brand new Jacobs didn't bring that goes with the with the with the giants of some years back when they went to the championship as well yeah in averaging about six years and carry that's how he's running like a\nLike a just a man just going nuts there's a freight train coming through and he's running you over so\nIt's great to see the way he's playing and I'm hoping they can continue to move this train through I'll be honest with you man they got a couple of games or you know you got they got the second half of the season about to START I don't think they go slump anytime soon man I just don't think I don't\nSee I I don't think so either they got some top ones in there especially when they're down to New Orleans there's a couple and then they get the Packers at home which I think is big and who knows again with the health of Rodgers will be at that point but yeah they're like you said this train has not flown up anytime soon it just the big differences the defense\nNo not many other teams can hold a candle to that effect you just can't just when you think that you're getting a a full dose of the ... the defense because in the field a book it's been proven that the off season they told everybody we're going to be all in here and twenty teens some people were like really\nWhile you're seeing it play out now in the field to the first six games or the regular season\nVery impressive chargers with big one yesterday as well and they\nI Can't believe just to save some ESPN some of the guys are saying that the charges of the favorite the AFC\n... said blacks than they will talk to you tomorrow night keep living the dream [noise]\nFurnished by Sally is media [noise]\nYou talk\nThe real estate conference\nWalk out making the claim I'm only a friend says a growing number of Trump's business leaders are pulling out of a high profile Saudi investment conference owning the disappearance of journalist ... we've kept them bomb report\nJ.

got a laundry list I won't go through 'em all but the the barbaric handling of immigrant children disgusting um there is at Youtube video I've seen and believe me I don't believe me it's been taken out for you to\nHave a talk show years ago I Believe it was a David Letterman or he said in his slog arrogant way\nI'm very very intelligent so of course I'm an atheist or he's got a Christian\nOr can you sing\nHold hold on I Want to just I'll give you a chance what you said something that hit me right away so the barbaric treatment of immigrant children first of all they're not immigrant children they're illegal immigrant children\nOr let's call them the way it is and I don't know what's ... why it's barbaric to say that you have certain rules and laws and ways of getting into the country and if you don't come in that way\nThen we can't accept you what's barbaric maybe is the parents bringing the children here they're responsible for the families being separated broken up so I don't think he's being barbaric you would probably call me barbaric just 'cause I Want some rules and I want some uh procedures in terms of sovereignty why is that barbaric\nI don't care who the children belong to the handling was barbaric and if it was your child you'd be singing a different to you\nKnow I Would you know no no no you don't have to go on you don't run around and you know you don't get to go on if you don't give me a chance when you say something so absurd if it was my first I wouldn't bring my child's us here if I knew they could be separated from me\nI wouldn't do it in the first place so don't tell me what I Would do I'll give you a chance but don't try to read my motivation on my mind these people I don't blame them from trying to get away from terrible conditions but there are rules\nIn our procedures and it's not barbaric to say if you do that we we have certain laws and rules and procedures how we handle this go your return\nExplain our federal judge a put a stop to it it is barbaric whether you want to say it is or not the way they handled it not necessarily joining it in the first place separating the chill around your with that but if you want to go with the

caller and the young lady before a earlier tonight are typically people who'll amongst my peers I noticed that they hate Trump so much that they're a coherent they can't really articulate why\nBut ... says they give some time full with other people's point like mine where he was talking about the immigration or\nMaybe they're not immigrants because the ... to say that right he's an immigrant without it came here legally I served I married my wife overseas\nI got married when I see people coming over here\nAt the I have to pay all that money and go to to get her over here and help people jumping off on the line because they came here because you're graphical Haitian I mean people got a real live America is a country of laws\nAnd this man is trying to make sure that law enforcement constitutions fall and the problem is we got people have been a benefiting from the law being broken and I and our Democratic Party wants to make sure that space broke up because just recently\nAre uh uh the woman run their favorites is running for governor she admitted she oil illegal aliens or is she called them undocumented people to vote I mean it's just ridiculous\nWhat about how she learned she added it how\nShe thought maybe oh yeah she had chicken pox news you can go back when Steve ... a ... interview a writer Kevin she ... they showed the video and I'm a truck driver so I Can't watch it all the time because I'm On my work I work right now\nAh I worked in a early morning shift to the morning but I'm ... I'm telling you right now I Believe in what the president's do that's why I voted for him I don't think he's a racist at all as a matter of fact as a black man uh I remember\nIt was about maybe like Fifteen sixteen years ago in double ACP gave him an award how come they you hear all these other people calling him a racist but how come you don't hear them speaking up than he is but they won't even\nSend them either because if it's convenient I think for people to just put a label on people without any proof\nThat's right you know ... if\nIt's just it's just ridiculous and uh he has done more for this country the last president in eight years and I'm the I'm going to tell you right straight out Obama was the worst president ever\nAnd you'll be surprised may not want me or you may be surprised\nTo know you haven't heard me 'cause I've been on a number of years but until recently not back on this network\nA I feel the same way I think President Obama is the worst presidents we've had in our history certainly in my lifetime he did more damage and he started by apologizing for the greatest country in the history of the world he was a ... going on or apology tour uh I I agree are examining who\nAre in that one before Saudi king and which is ridiculous but I like what Trump you alluded to in his speech a couple of weeks ago a\nAnd the un I well I got out of this speech was one of the things it doesn't exactly say what what I took from it when you say it's going to make America great again he was letting people know why don't you make your country great again and make it a place that people wouldn't want to leave\nYou know what about that\nWhat we've done network so well right free enterprise little regulation limited government why don't you try that for awhile guys and see how it works in your country right\nExactly and ... and ... again going back to the immigration boy that guy said the uh the kids were treated the old policy was put in place long before Trump became president\nThat's right and as a matter of fact\nA lot of those a lot of those kids coming across\nThere there may may not even be those kids are a so called adult children it's quite up somebody a walk across we saw it on the videos was with us some of the uh\nPeople from Syria which just picking kids up walking across the border to get into some of these places that they didn't belong to them so you don't know who these people are\nAnd in Mexico as a matter of fact treats the people that come across the board of legal be from Honduras El Salvador Nicaragua already won them

I finally deathly afraid that we're gonna have to ride this out another six years I Hope not I hope there's somebody out there who can\nA organized the the ... the Democratic base and you get the Reagan Democrats back on the Democratic train\nOkay I get a gay man I'm number ... let me respond to some of your points or would he certainly has hyperbole I'm not going to defend that and he says lots of things you know he's the best of all time or whatever he says it bothers me too we had the biggest crowd ever when it's clearly not the case\nSo you're right about that and and I said we get the whole package but that doesn't change the fact that um in terms of wall he certainly wants to build a wall but you've got to get Congress to agree and they haven't agreed yet\nIn terms of lock her up\nI pointed out some of the reasons why I don't want to see her\nLocked up even though she's not above the law because of the chaos who would create and you know it's it's not it's not good it's not good optics to say the least even though she deserves to be locked up for the crime she's committed\n... as far as draining the swamp I think he is doing that is going to do that more in terms of we've got to wait till the Mueller investigation is over I think you'll see him get a stronger attorney general and certainly it's clear that people at the highest levels of the FBI and the Justice Department were out to get him and maybe a soft coup occurred\nUh so notice you and I don't see things the same way in terms of violence in this country almost all of it is a committed by the left\nVery little ... infant test them all the Proud Boys whenever they call themselves than just a small little group\nUm I I can compare that to end the for the black lives matter of fact I Can't speak at a college campus and people who share my views cannot speak in a college campus\nWithout being shouted down I mean the it's not even close in terms of what you can say as you may not her just for the show you can't I Would never put a Trump sign on my car in my yard he would be to face if not worse\nSo I you know you and I it's it's good to clarify this you and I see the world differently and you know tomorrow I'm going to talk about the New York\nOr maybe join us talking about the possible democratic candidates I think you've got a problem there 'cause a lot of them have their issues and I think you may not have heard me say this I think Trump's gonna if was held today he easily winning reelection or maybe not easily but certainly would win re election\nSo I guess for clarification point of view I agree with you that he says things he shouldn't say but you get the whole package but as a conservative I'm very happy with the way he's govern\nI\nI I can see that and like I said yeah it's just I I don't see it because I constantly see in the news yeah\nUh just recently in Kentucky trains laying off six hundred employees there's a West Virginia mine that's closing down laying off employees Harley Davidson is laying off employees and he's talking about bringing\nMaking and America\nA producer again yeah he's getting it and all the bidding and all these ... taking with these other countries causing us to lose jobs\n[noise] that that's my final point I forgot to mention and yeah I like I said I enjoy the show\nAnd now I'll definitely keep listening on my way home from work or the rest of the week because I enjoy listening you talk to the people\nWant to thank you I appreciate that very much Patrick keep listening and then when the guys get back you might want to consider that also or you clarified it and you're on the other side and the you you express yourself very well and we're not going to agree\nUh bought the there should be more people liking a let's go to Gary in a coma Kansas carry around with mark\nHey mark Thanks Michael yeah one is about the illegal border crossings separation of parents and the children\nAnd the ... my point is it it doesn't matter whether you're an illegal alien or the United states you break the law I'm selling crack cocaine or Kansas City or or um all manner or or um an illegal alien cross order I Am not taking my wife and kids to the oldies do what I Am going to be separated\nFrom my kids and I I'm just tired of hearing about this\nThere they broke the law if you break the law you're going to be detained and separated from your family it's it's just as simple as that I don't know what the or even ...\nYeah I never understood you know why this wasn't front and center\nA they'd say well my kids are being separated from me and all the people the bleeding hearts saying how could you tear away the kids from the parents don't bring the kids in the first place it seems so obvious to me that it was the mother bringing them\nAt or very few fathers I think in someone points out even now what do you call them the coyotes were bringing them right and others were bred maybe terrorists who knows what\nA super known it was barely mentioned if you don't want your kids separated don't come they're\nAll just do break the law if you break the law and get thrown in jail you're going to be separated from your family or even if you're a citizen of the United states whether\nYou're of course that doesn't matter if you're going to affect your kids and stuff to jail with so many factory illegal and you get arrested failure not take your kids to do it it's just retarded or it's just so ridiculous argument so I've got to get back we're like oh\nYeah yeah well you must be a conservative your work and I'm just kidding oh you liberals Democrats out there right I forgot that all the great points I did say it in the past but I haven't set up this week\nAnybody who goes to trial and gets convicted you don't get to stay with your kids you get to stay with your family\nPlan it why feel so often that I'm living on another planet but that those are the arguments one why'd you bring the kids here we do in the first place except you hoping to get a package deal where you both get in right that's what you're up to I don't even blame I Do not I can make this point clear\nI Do not pulling illegal immigrants for coming to this country to try to seek a better life I Would do the same\nI blame the government and the people on the on the left to particular maybe some liberals to for saying they should be here without following our laws as he made a very good point but who doesn't get separated from their kids\nWhen you commit a crime and him and coming here legally is crossing the border is not without documents if you're a legal there's nothing to discuss\nSo you're whenever anybody commits a crime that happens sometimes things seem so obvious and you wonder why someone isn't making your point of view I'm just repeating myself like Geraldo Rivera and the rest of them saying\nIllegals commit fewer crimes percentage wise I Know\nWhat if they weren't here they wouldn't have committed a crime what are you saying they don't believe they're belong here and if they committed murder which is the worst thing you can do it wouldn't happen if we didn't allow you in I don't care about the percentages and I didn't even think you're right\nI'm telling ya I live on another planet you tell me what you think eight six six Ninety red eye\nThat's eight six six nine o seven thirty
