back to the bench Shapiro show so\nPresident Trump has stated that the left is now engaged in a sort of mob of anger and he's clearly right about that Hillary Clinton just came out and said you cannot be civil with a political party that wants to destroy what you scan for so all the civility on the right member we're told at the right was super dangerous and ... and then it turns out the less supports antifa\nYeah well they're doing the same thing with regard you from doing normal things in the White House introduced Brett Kavanaugh and did what I think is correct he apologized to Brett Kavanaugh for what Brett Kavanaugh just had to go through for the for for simple parties in political reasons here's President Trump getting it correct\nOn behalf of our nation I Want to apologize\nTo Brett and the entire Kavanaugh family for the terrible pain and suffering you have been forced to endure our country a man or woman must always be presumed innocent unless and until proven guilty\nYeah President Trump is correct\nAll that stuff it turns out that independence didn't like how cabinets handled by Democrat either by twenty eight point margin independence were not particularly fond of how Democrats handled all of that but that's not going to stop the Democrats from doubling down here is an MSNBC legal panelists yesterday talking about how Brett Kavanaugh is going to issue in a thousand year right\nJust like the Nazis here it is on MSNBC\nIf this way that they now have control over all three branches of government we're going to see if this rain slash for thirty days or two years for cells and you're right because that is how that is what these people have set themselves up for\nA thousand year right now because Brett Kavanaugh isn't just a gang rape but she's also knocking that's exciting news that we found out about it my favorite part of this particular segment by the way with Noah Rothman that with my friends now he's on MSNBC right for commentary magazine and he started trying to explain\nWhy roe v Wade was not settled law and he was then accused of man's leaning on MSNBC because this is how far we've come as a country\nIs not interested in overturning roe the log will make it over there as he has a philosophy and conservatives were\nFiring under and you know and I didn't have that little survey to tell you that ... had it right for the man went and you know they'll say I'm trying to explain something to a woman and when it happened it with reproductive health care I don't ever do that because we're glad I got I don't know what can we are not a good idea here\nOkay [laughter] don't use the word explain when you're talking about reproductive issues but what if you just got it wrong lady like what if you're just wrong what if you don't know what role the way does what if you don't understand conservative judicial philosophy as man's planning now ... in the words of my colleague Andrew clay then I'll be happy to stop man's planning when you start woman understanding\nIt it's so silly it's so silly but don't worry the media have really got their stuff together they're not they're not out of their minds in any way so for example when the president of the United states says that left has decided to engage in a form of ...\nJim Acosta and find you somebody who loves you Jim Acosta loved him Acosta Jim Acosta over on CNN he says well President Trump does about my encourages mom\nYou know it is talk of a mob rule and so on\nI mean have you have you been to a Trump rally ah I mean if you do hear rhetoric at at those rallies that would uh conjure up images of a mob or go back to the twenty sixteen campaign when the president said as a candidate that he would like to punch protesters in the face and so on\nA and so perhaps the president knows what Marlborough and ... tactics looked like because he ... himself\nOkay well so the Democrats because it turns out that people like Kamala Harris who was a front runner for the Democratic nomination and twenty twenty she's now urging Democrats clearly to use anger to take back power\nThis last week and and all that we have experienced\nIn terms of our frustration\nAnd anger and art that\nLets you this week to give us\nThat extra energy that we know we have to remember\nThat the bottom line is that they may have the power\nNow but we need to take\n\nThe anger and rage you're gonna be the currency with which Democrats attempts to buy the next election they'll find out if they're successful or not in pretty short order I think I think we'll find out pretty quickly or\nWell we'll be back here tomorrow with all of the latest meanwhile I'm gonna go has mice criminal crime myself sleep in the corner I'm just so sad about Nikki Haley will have all the cases adventure here\nTalk\n\nShow the real estate [noise]\nABC News live in local at ten o'clock I'm Jeff will and the Los Angeles city council\nIs now cracking down on members of the public who repeatedly disrupt council meetings and the council members voted unanimously today to change the rules were meetings in committee so anyone who shouts from the audience rocks unruly will be banned from attending council meetings for up to six days of the time and that upset this speaker at today's\nA you're talking about the fact that that ah with with the flooding they don't know what the logistics will be for ... and this is the case for any major storm but especially one\nOf this magnitude you don't know what the supply chain of of ah goods is going to be a in terms of the essential especially things like water so if you're not able to use or drink the water\n... imagine if you stayed in the building or in your home or if you have no electricity and you you can't use the or drink the the running water or or or any of that uh you're going to be in a very dangerous situation not on top of that you're also uh putting others at risk in in the event that you have to be\nA rescued or because you're a structure cannot withstand the flooding or the or the winch\nWill have the uh the latest updates a throughout the morning including when the national Hurricane Center releases their next update that I Believe is ah about Fifteen minutes from now right so we'll have that to for you plus a meteorologist Tom hale will join us here at the bottom of the hour he covered

meteorologist John proud will also join us little bit later on in the show so updates throughout the morning plus we'll be covering all the different news items out there a Nikki Haley resigned says the UN ambassador\nYou know the interesting thing is we have gone now over twelve hours ... and nothing has leaked\nYeah\nAnd I you know why you know why she's ... right even though it seems it seems that\nThe media was jumping on this ... immediately in fact who was it was at MSNBC or CNN or somebody who's making the thing well she's out because of the Kavanaugh stuff and it was like yeah come right right right I mean I maybe I saw that on social media that's where I ...\nI don't I don't want to die to anybody who didn't you know make that statement right right well I Believe I saw that on Twitter ... and and I can't remember who did it 'cause it you know Twitter flies by so quickly but they were just pounded on immediately that oh she's quitting because Kavanaugh is going to be a Supreme Court\nA justice apparently this had been in the works a uh a while and it seems to to be right now that most people really have no idea but they sense that\nShe only wanted to be there for two years because she's staying until the end of the year which means he right she's been there two years and by the way that happens quite frequently and getting them in the streets and somebody will come in put in two years gets you go in and they they want to move on to something else everybody is is trying to predict what she's going to do whether she's going to run for president\nUh and I like the you know the uh a scenario that that ah she's out ah you know there and\nWhat was the scenario oh I Know it's just an aerial had had um bad is going to\nRun and twenty twenty ... he's going to be the veep it in a debt no no [laughter] it edited with Jeff Sessions or you know a ... you know being out of a number of uh\nOf being attorney general ed ... sorts of conspiracy theories we look at it and say well we'll wait and see we don't really deal with conspiracy theories here right now but uh you know she she did good I mean she was if you look at one of\nThe people that he brought in early that actually worked out she was one of the few yeah well and\nI think she goes out on a strong note I you know yes absolutely if you ah ... anything could happen in the next three months but I don't I don't think it's going to change the demeanor\nAnd uh and and the fortitude of of someone like a Nikki Haley if you listen to her words at you and if you live if you look at a you know her positions are and how how strong she's\nBeen for the president a that is that\nIs a very unique position to be in for its especially for this particular president who's not afraid to speak his mind and himself I think has been very strong we look at his un speech recently and I think he ... he did a great job\nAh and and he's been very clear on his positions or if you look\nAt a having a Michael Bolden a at [laughter] jot and both of his son Michael Bolton is not there yet\nWhat oh man I Love\nYou so bad remake [laughter] in the White House\n... way [laughter] I mean John Bolton I by the way\nI'm Michael Bolton could be a a it could be a good national security advisor\nHe would scare them other people [laughter] oh so you're a singer not add on debt not the guy from office space or no is there a Michael Bolden from office space yeah that was his member that was I was already named ... ... I didn't watch office space\nOh no no no no no you know what I'm thinking I'm thinking the off the office now I don't know a hundred percent not on a NATO ally ... yeah office space on his face the movie\nRight ... yeah the iconic movie the iconic movie yeah I don't get it out safely today more coffee please yeah okay but if you have John Bolton by your side I don't know if I can reveal it I Know I Know maybe I should have brought booze\nOr but if you have John Bolton by your side is national security advisor if you have a Nikki Haley in places you in the bathroom my question is how do you feel Nikki Haley shoes I Know what you and ambassador and it's\nOne of those um odd jobs where you know you're kind of just basically in this case your the the mouthpiece for the president you're going to you're going to go out to the world to the other nations and you're going to\nI'm a ... advised them as to what the policy is we're going to be\nBut in this scenario where you have a John ... and then you have a my palm payout did I get that one right um the ...\nThe strength I think right now of this cabinet and staff or it and and I put Nikki Haley on there is is is right now I mean and and we could maybe in the first year you could go in and you could poke holes and and people did with Tillerson\nOr as secretary of state saying he's not the right guy in alternately he wasn't but if you look at it right now where it's set up and I'm Talking about national security wise and where we are with countries like Iran North Korea\nUh and and and even some of our um you know Saudi Arabia you know the president's stance on the Saudis recently um I think it requires somebody of significant strength I'm not saying there's not anyone there what it's going to have to be somebody who has that strength that can go to\nThe un and do what you I I don't mean to downplay the importance of the UN ambassador ... but it is somebody who can if if you're looking for quality ... you're you're not necessarily looking for a quality of the normal presidential spokesperson\n... uh and and I'm Talking about Sarah Sanders okay I'm Talking about the\nNormal one where you know if you look at all the you know the the ... the presidential spokespeople over the last you know just like what Twenty years if you look at them and you just said because remember their their parenting what the administration wants their pare down their message right and\nAnd the thing that made Sarah Sanders how can be so great is she's directing in your face mhm that is actually the way and and you want to project the image\nOf the president of the United states that you represent mhm so imagery of being able to take what the president says go and speak at the un with that same kind of force that she did\nIs what you're looking for and I can't tell you because I haven't seen you know I I really haven't seen in that setting any of the the people that I hear so far maybe up or I've never seen them I've never witnessed them speaking in that particular matter one thing that I wanted to say about a a Nikki Haley though\nAre and and just shows you how the the the mainstream media is just nuts\nBecause they would always ask her and I love this question it rarely is asked to anybody who serves in a Democrat presidents or a cabinet but\nWell what would you disagree with the president how do you deal with it of course I'm going to disagree with the president because my job is not to promote what I Believe it's to promote what the president believes right so of course we're going to have differences but if we have differences we talk about it but it's his administration that I serve in\nIt's like you arrive one of the reasons we out of trouble ever work right in any administration\nIs because we have a we would have a problem promoting something that we didn't believe in right and there are there are people that and and again I have nothing against people who do that that's your job\nYour job is to ... what the administration wants you repeat what the administration wants to the world when you are un ah you know UN ambassador the problem with you and I we've been talk show hosts too long we just\nWe could we probably couldn't do that or we will get frustrated that are doing that even if the president was even if we thought the president was Ninety percent right we want to get our ten percent in well you can't do that when you're\nA UN ambassador you have to be the national security advisor\nBe to be in that position I mean not only that that he that he talks to the public but he's an advisor as opposed to someone who is mimicking or or ...\nAt a campground in Malibu Creek state park and June two people dead after being struck by commuter trains an unrelated tragedies a woman killed by an Amtrak train while walking on the tracks in Anaheim this morning\nSecond person dead after being hit by metro LINK Train just west of Cal State Los Angeles K.

early fall on red eye radio [noise] and I'm Gary McNamara longer they're hardly eight six six Ninety red eye meteorologist Tom hale joins us right now ah just\nTo get a get caught up on hurricane Michael good morning Tom\nGood morning I'm Renee how are you guys doing doing well ah what do we know about\nMichael uh in the current conditions and what do we expect over the next uh twelve to twenty four hours\nWell I I Wish I could say that this is going to be a pretty picture but it it's not um I Am encouraged by a number of the reports that have indicated a lot of people have evacuated Panama City\nUh also uh down all the way through saint saint Joe and at Appalachian coal and and that southern point a then of course from their up to Tallahassee now folks in Tallahassee I\nSome of them have been boarding up and all that but what we can expect is really simple right now it is a category three\nHurricane that means sustained winds at a hundred and twenty five miles an hour and for those of you who are kind of geeky can write this down the middle of the pressure is nine forty seven nine forty seven middle of ours and it's moving to the north it\nAt twelve miles an hour right now it is two hundred and twenty miles to the south southwest\nOf Panama City now it's in the northern direction so for it to actually hit the target which right now is estimated between Panama City and the tip of the Appalachian coal\nAh it's going to have to make a little bit of a right turn and so in simple terms what people are going to expect is in some significant or whether that they have\nNot seen in their lifetime um well it's not totally fair to say that well no I I guess it really is um because I expected\nIn the next advisory to go up five or six miles an hour if it goes up six miles an hour it'll qualify as a category for hurricane and a category for hurricane hitting this coast according to the national weather service outta Tallahassee would be the strongest hurricane on record to hit\nThe Florida Panhandle coastline\nYeah so\nYeah and and that's ever that's the strongest down yet on record you know we we talked earlier that you know ... down the coast a little bit into the category five in sixty nine\nThat just you know the state of that that that part so you have an idea of what wins\nAnd and and that's the point when you talked about you know you get to a category of of for hurricanes you're talking about winds over a hundred and thirty one miles an hour as a little different than maybe you're a hurricane one where you may have eighty mile an hour winds arena five mile an hour winds so it's a completely different ball game is right\nExactly and when we get to the category three it changes we call it a major hurricane a category one and two are not major hurricanes but they're still I mean we saw a\nCategory to Florence a it was a\nCategory three briefly but we saw Florence coming in and get a we did coverage here on right on the radio for four days with Lawrence and that puppy just hung along the coastline and this is not going to be the case here by tomorrow\nOr as this moves its way out of here it's wins will be affecting the Florida and south and North Carolina\nShoreline and in fact the last time there was a storm of that kind of situation that came through was Kate in Nineteen eighty five and Kate's case\nKate at the same time it's wins wrapping around giant Winfield were causing storms and uh and tornados along the Carolinas and the Carolinas have got a\nPretty good chance of of multiple tornadoes associated with this and and you know anyone in this entire area of the Big Bend and the panhandle uh are are going to basically relate to\nA K which happened to be in Nineteen eighty five [noise] um but this is gonna blow Kate out all the water\nTom ... in terms of the the the danger coming ashore because I think a lot of people may be who are looking at you know the I coming ashore but I mean the where the danger and the potentially\nLife threatening situation start what is that timeline where is that window and and what should we expect during that time line\nOkay when it comes to the timeline on what you should

all the Los Angeles city councils cracking down on disruptions council\nMembers unanimously approved changes to the council meetings and committees rules allowing audience members to be banned for several days for unruly behavior in a show of defiance protesters disrupted the meeting before the boat\nIn the ... Red Sox Astros I said last night that I think the ... is going to go seven\nI think they'll see I just couldn't go seven as well I think we're in for a treat or mostly championship series ... especially this ... I mean it has a little bit of everything everything you want to see from fantastic starting pitching with\nHouston too I mean Boston's right behind them was good starting pitching as well especially what we saw David Price a sale who pitch seats any tonight boy you look good there's some question marks about him in the postseason so you figure he'll get a start coming up\nAnd they obviously have Rick ... who started this game tonight for Boston so I I Love everything I mean two great all kinds of as well your ... pens are there was some question about Boston bullpen but like you talked about keys or you have regular season players and yet postseason players and you ...\nThe law to postseason players for the red Sox right now they remind me a lot of maybe the twenty Thirteen team that won the world series for them they can do a lot of different things it's not just one guy and even though they have an VP candidate players and the wind up there and I asked\nTo do everything I think that's the thing there is no pressure on any of these guys at least it appears that way when you watch these games that it can be a different guy for them on any given evening so odd it sets up I think for a great ... else yes like I said I think it goes seven\nI'm going to say I'm going to take Houston right now because I have a hard time betting against that rotation and I think ... can be downright untouchable and filthy and I'm just because of that death I think they have a little bit of an edge that much but a little bit of an edge of the red Sox\nYeah I I I Can't go use ... to defend the gyms I think I think just bosses got something here I think they\nThey got a chemistry going even though\nLike I said in the ninth inning they ... they were they were ... it was getting away from them a little bit hey they settled in they took their time and they did with veteran teams do and they got it done at the end of the day so I don't know I think they've been tested they've been battle tested all season are shows have been tested a\nThan battle tested all season but I think Boston just got something going here and they just can't be is this a formula they have they just can't be beat so I'm gonna go with Boston\nOne eight hundred to two to five to two to let's go to the phones for the first time tonight and say hello to Solomon he's in lake ... Solomon how're you\nDoing guys will go to work out every week now and I don't intend it I'm just in the kitchen hanging out you guys come on and I figured okay I'm calling in with director\nTo talk to archers of it as Gary ... who here's my thing I I'm this is what I'm hoping for a hoping that she used in Dodgers again cause you know I Want revenge from Russia doesn't everybody wants to\nTell me about it now but here's the thing and I know it would be sweet to win at home I'd rather when game seven at Houston to go house it's the ... that that's really sticking the nights and if you beat them in game seven at Houston\nI liked the thinking is there really is nothing more sweet as they say in sports is if you can win in someone else's building especially in the clenching game\nThat is special when it solve I I'd love to see it and I wouldn't be surprised to look it it's so wild right now because you can make cases for all four of these teams potentially for coming out on top and and wasting the commissioners trophy or the certain matches I mean you can easily see Milwaukee Houston you know you could see the rematch like we talked about there you could see maybe Boston\nAh LA right it can be so many different things but yeah if it is obviously the Dodgers and the Astros he I boy I mean we would be in for a great rematch from last year and I look at the biggest thing is you just have to um be able to get to that starting pitching I mean that's the bottom line the Houston starting pitching is so deep\nUh but if look what did it in the Yankees here in this series at the end they couldn't hit the ball to the ballpark yet we know the blueprint for the Dodgers hit home runs that that that are often\nThey have to do honestly this first game they have to set the tone\nWho's going to set the tone is the key is key to this first game is going to be the brewers or is it going to be the Dodgers who've come out and set the tone in so that's where I'm looking for further on any\nI I agree and that's one of the things that makes me a little bit nervous about the Dodgers is that boom or bust lineup\nI'm ... that sometimes though sometimes they kick back a little bit and and they play I don't know if you want to call it a small dog but they're not you know going through the fences and when they do that that's a really tough team to beat 'em but but man you know Milwaukee is uh they're hot right now and then they are hot\nUm and that that's going to be a tough series what do you see uh what do you see that coming down to as far as Dodgers brewers\nWhy said last night I think we're in for a long series I think you can go seven games my prediction is Dodgers in seven I think that just obviously Milwaukee is playing with house money now a they're a team that hasn't been to the world series since eighty two really talked about this last night I was when they're in the American league it's been a long time coming for them\nThey have they have obviously the national again BP and Christian Yeh which they boast a fundamentally sound bullpen that his strong guys can get you out there some filthy nasty stuff\nBut I just think the leadership and the the veteran leadership is Dodgers team I think that ultimately shines through in this series\nI think they're built to win on the road we saw that this year and the regular season despite the up and downs right Keith they were able to both say good road record even better than a Dodger Stadium I think they lean back on that and I think they're able to get it done is not going to be easy it's going to be a whole lot of twists and turns is going to be some times when you think I don't know if they can pull it out in the series\nBut ultimately I think uh I'd I have a lot of faith and Roberts again it's a total opposite from what you saw in Aaron Boone the ... the the moves that boom couldn't make I have confidence that Roberts will be able to make those if they if they kind of show up here\nAnd I think you can go can win it in six I Am hoping they can do it in six and they can do it at home um yes there are better row team this year than they are a away a home team however that percentage is very close but I'm going with them in six or hopefully they can get it done in six at home\nOh ...\nWell they are going to have to win it on the road just like you said it'd be nice if they could get this year is at least at home um one one last thing I'll leave you with one thing that will end when they make it to the world series and I cringe when I say his name no Jew dark dish\n[laughter] they don't have\nThat in their starting pitching and a curse shock and can keep his for the old for sure that we know pitching the new way though right 'cause you're you know we always ... power pitcher any more\nUm they don't have a weak link in that study lined up ... last season that didn't just give away one game gave away too when you got to win four games from the Houston Astros and you're starting pitcher gets away with those four wins\nCome on man that day we're doomed with that with that guy so thank God he's gone and let's see what happens\nAt Solomon and thanks for the call I really appreciate it a pilot I feel that you speak for the entire Dodger fan base or by saying that you're happy you ... ... is no longer here and obviously it hasn't really worked out in Chicago either\nA it just yeah that was a disaster last season no no real need to rehash that any more I look I think ...\nIs the big differences share a with him and how you have a whole lot more confidence in cars drivers just kind of like the number two in the postseason it's a whole lot different this year\nWith a bill or in that situation so feeling good about the boys in

evening bragging teeth take us to the top she our here on seven Ninety ... am talking a little NBA lines of all making is pre season debut tomorrow\nFirst time he's going to play alongside the Brian how are things going to go\nThe NBA returns one week from today great matchups to kick it off on opening night you've got the Sixers taking on the Celtics\nGolden State will be an action as well keep you and I were talking off the break about the warriors and now\nI just ridiculously stack this team is everyone to known this now off season long obviously\nThe addition of to mark his cousin says only added to what they can do and to me like I was just telling you before they're the only question with this team is are they going to beat their own record a of of uh Seventy three and not are they going to top that and I would say probably not\nBecause they're more inclined to take nights off now and I you know ... they'll still get the one seed but um I I don't I don't think that record will ever be broken actually\nYeah I don't think I'll ever broke you know what I I listen to um clay Thompson interview today on jump\nOn ESPN and uh you know they were talking to him and they they said that what you guys like motivation this year in terms of getting back to the championship and and they told them they said look teams that three peat there in that\nCategory of one point eight percent of of actually repeat three PT\nAnd so he was they were like well that's the motivation is to to to actually be able to do that and I think also what it is in the ... the role of the nation for this team is\nHow they have to have different goals set for themselves from what would they did last year I think a lot of teams they tried to go by the formula what they did last year for this year and it doesn't work out that way doesn't work that way at all it's\nAt every season is different from the last season yet of object game exactly and in the west\nJust alone a lot of teams in the west that's gotten better you know he said that we're not focus in this place they were not focused on the east because the west has gotten ... it has gotten better and that's all we really got to focus on is really look at who's coming on the west you know you have\nHouston has gotten there okay they're they're not I don't think they're better than what they were last year because they last trip or reason and I think they needed that and why it might have Phoenix looks good whichever ... over there and right and this and they got two boys in Houston I look good they actually better yeah I Know your\nYou're right the west has gotten better if that's possible\nBut one of the big reasons is I think teams are just getting a little more older and more mature\nA geyser you know especially groups together of players are just getting another year under their belt in certain systems in on western conference teams are going stages better obvious yeah so I but I Want the warriors are specifically in motivation I really don't buy into\nUh the notion that teams aren't going to be motivated coming off of a champion are not I just I don't in any sport because\nEvery season is different like you're talking about their each season is unique onto itself that's what they're really great coaches obviously really good at doing getting their teams ready to go and just\nBlocking out all of last season saying it's in the past it's done it's over with the wrong to the next season easier said than done obviously but again that's what separates the great teams from the average team yeah\nI think you know Golden State I don't think there'll be a problem at all look they're not going to be\nHighly motivated in the regular season on an average given night we know that there's a lot of teams or like that so but that's it doesn't matter that's the thing\nThe NBA season is so long we some of these some of these regular season games are totally a somewhat irrelevant in my opinion I mean we have we've had nationally televised games on ABC last couple of years\nIn which you had the San Antonio spurs and pop which choosing to not even take his daughters with the team on the trip our LeBron James sipping coffee when he was with the Cavaliers on the bench\nOr during a primetime games so uh again it's a big problem for the league we saw that last year I Believe is going to be continue to be a big problem coming up here for silver and company so\nIt it's it's a problem for the league but it doesn't matter for Golden State if you're talented with all that again the only thing that's going to slow them down as any kind of injuries and um look I mean they've they've um they're well condition there and\nI'm there I'm a very disciplined basketball team I think Steve Kerr has been the perfect code for them that's been well documented and now I think year after year that they've been able to win\n... also the team the God the nucleus of guys if they ... they have on the team they bought into the system they like each other and they just want to them it's like they want to have fun they ... they know getting to the championship is one thing winning is of course is everything but the thing is about\nThese guys they they're used to each other they like each other they genuinely do like each other and I think when you have that and have a good nucleus of guys are like each other and they understand each other\nThey're all making money in endorsement deals everything they're getting their money is really is what measures where people say oh Kevin originally I bet I bet you your bottom dollar hundred percent I'm I'm I'm ... I'm a hundred percent sure Kevin interesting in in uh in Golden State\nThat's interesting yeah if you had to report that came out recently and you know a lot of rumor taught him that he would potentially be willing to come to the Lakers\nYes his early I doubt it uh I'll say I doubt it I'm a I'm a hundred percent going with that he's on the state and go to state why he likes to a group of guys is fits his style of play what he's doing over there\nUm and you know I just look at even clay times has already came out and say he's content with their ... saying over there you know I'm I don't know what's going to happen with dream on I think that's a whole day and they got to make a decision between dream on ... at the end of the day\nI'm but I'm sure we never know what can happen those guys can probably work it out we don't know what this season will bring I'll tell you this everybody who plays against Golden State is going to give them their best shot right there the villains of the NBA right now nobody likes them they want to beat them so they're going to have really tough gangs\nOf having a secondary and shut down corner\nUm but you know I think they're getting they're getting some guys back to um from injury I'm not going to count him out for one game um because I've seen and we all seen how their defense really plays and they play pretty well and they get after it\nThey're still the number one defense and the league after these even this whole this whole debacle they have this kind of go into a road to go\nAnd get a big win that we haven't seen you haven't seen that yet but that's the question the remaining and um but I think they will be able to get it done um\nIt will see man a is a really big question mark there I'm In it and there's a lot of question marks you got to start raising like ...\nFor one I mean he had the worst game I've ever seen him play in a while you know yeah I ... I still think he's a I'll say this I still think he's a good fit for the Jacksonville I see why they make any lie because I go\nBack again like I've been saying even baseball postseason players and he showed up in the postseason this past the\nLast year so that's why you gotta give him that respect bingo you can't just go off from one game so I'm Still going to say hey you can still get it done 'em and hopefully he does but you know it was time remains to see you know they're going to get tested coming down the wire right here in terms of\nThese teams on the roads are going to play again so they played a lot more home games they have in a row lately so we're going to see\nThe eagles lose running back J uh Jayanti I you've done for the season he's injured I'm injuries are kind of starting to pile up their bid for Philly what's the biggest problem with that team right now\nMan they got they would know receiving corps right now I think that's the really the problem you've got nobody but I'll find Jeffries and I'll shine Jeffries in and that's it I mean I think in cars in which your your line hasn't been blocking well for you and giving Carson's time to throw the ball\nYou only got ... matter of you know so now you are those guys are not catching the ball right now they're not getting any type of separation and then you got Jay giant use out but\nWhich raises the question why the eagles go after running back I mean there was some speculation\nLevy on bail however they don't have to me it makes a lot of ... let me tell you it does make a lot of sense to go out to be on bill\nHowever let me tell you guys should have won after ... McCoy why you know the ... got pushed out by chip Kelly right right well ... know that ... wants to come back to the I mean he he's been away from the eagles or while he's been in Buffalo\nBut he wanted to be there you know and so he will be ... I don't think he will be opposed to going back to civilian playing there\nNow and I think so either he would go back in a heartbeat\nYeah exactly so I just don't understand why don't make a play that you know why haven't they not made up of others they're just content\nWith you know dares produce heart you have a ... that's a that's hurt as well you don't know when he's gonna come back when he got while you're not playing small would what's going on there and ask\nA quiet you know sort of ... and defense really they're not generating nearly as much of a pass Russia had been done by the way what is going on with ah Michael Bennet with those shoulder pads oh God\nWhat is that I don't know what's going on him and it's just like a custom made sure had deal I I don't I don't know that is the weirdest thing\nOf it is where it is weird I'll tell you this do Brett this game right here in the eagles lose against the giants oh wow\nIs a big big there is an Earth Day night for because this is for two teams\nThat is a must win situation and you know what and I look at the gate I'm going to be afraid to\nEven afraid I'll tell you this I Know gamblers gamblers are afraid to even bet on this game because\nThis game's going to go down to the this game as a type of game is going to go out to watch the wire or it's going to be a chess match for sure I mean the giants need to win that's the bottom line they need to win Eli needs to play better yes now you know so\nThey they're vantage is there at home but I'm a you're playing against the bank the eagles team that really doesn't have anything you can really\nPut put your foot on their neck and see what happens is also Lucy\nYeah ... tend to be any game where the giants defense can potentially step up and try and hold their opponent below thirty points you think it would be this week again they were talking about there with all the injuries that has gone on\nBut that's the thing with this giant scene there are so hard to predict and you're right they do play a lot of close games you figure Keith like you said here this will be a close Thursday match up\nOr it's going to be very interesting because the east right now is just so hard to predict I mean the Redskins to lead division despite ... last night's loss and you have Dallas who's at two in three who you can't make heads or tails of\nSo it's a again I think the eagles will still come out of this bunch but\nIf you're gonna if you're one of those three other teams right now while the eagles are down here's your chance right here's a chance to kind of stop ... stop on them a little bit and see if we can continue to drag him down to your level in I'm In the division of standing there so it is a fascinating Thursday night game coming up on top\nI'm In New York actually that'll be that'll be good one to see how things shake out here to like you said it is a big game overall\nGreen Bay how much longer does Aaron Rodgers play\nI don't know man they they got to let them you know what I don't that whole dream of him doing what he's supposed to do to get you guys are the super bowl is over you know it's over I mean let's just call it it is\nThe man just can't move if you look at 'em brand you you just can't move he can move like it used to ... and is it because he's injured and\nHe has to like we've broke on the show he has a tour ACL guys like that's what it is you know so\nYou know if he's playing you can play on it but you know it's gonna get worse and and it tells you get and they knew they ... they may very much so um but he's like a pinball machine up they look he can still throw the thing the ball which is great\nBut man I Will be if I were them I'll be trying to protect my franchise quarterback\nThere comes a point in time and right while you have to put the safety at at the top of the list I get it you got nothing behind him to Sean Kaiser is tied the answer but and you went through this whole situation last year with the collar bone with Rogers when he was out with an injury\nBut again you got to think of the ... I mean if they forced into my share his career might end a whole lot sooner that everyone thinks potentially you know what I mean you don't know you're playing with\nBut I Know what I think also I think it's not just them\nUh the the the organization I think is is Rogers I think Rogers is like a Tom Brady they can tell you when they want to play when they not right and I think Rogers' type of guys that look I can deal with the pain I'm I'm here what I'll let you know when I can deal with it anymore and I think that's really what it is but\nI think you need to be the head coach you need to be\nThe owner and say look you're franchise correctly pages and a lot of money to come here we are here now and we want to protect you and look let's just get the surgery done in this gets you hang up for the rest of the season in and get you back the following the following year so\nYou know I think that's where you have to go buy it's like you said the safety of the player\nBecause you don't want him to be another Robert Griffin a third or when he was ... and hand over there with the Redskins and you saw how that happened when he ... it was a disaster he's never been the saying ever since and that will be a shame to get an air Rogers like that you know\nYou mentioned McCarthy at this point when do you evaluate the situation there injury status aside of Rogers wonder we evaluate McCarthy and him maybe being a little bit overrated at this point he's only won one Super Bowl that was a long time ago yeah and they haven't gotten back since\n... you got to start evaluating him now you know if he can't get it done because to me it looks like look you should be able to look Aaron Rogers was out last year you have brand hardly you still should be able to make some type of run you had some players when you're talking about they add all the time that they're kind of had a\nRare layers ... right there in like a similar situation of Pittsburgh in the sense of why talent you know not as much down his picture it had more time right now by exactly what I'm saying over the last couple of seasons they had opportunities to break through yeah ... and having done so a whole lot like the Steelers so I I think that McCarthy very much like Tom and at this point in time or\nUm you know this at the at the end of the season you might maybe want to look to make a change\nJust just to make things up I think they could benefit from a change honestly I just I I just don't think that they should they should have a whole lot more of a lot more success and what they've had yeah\nAbsolutely I agree with you totally agree with you [noise]\nGreat show tonight will do it again tomorrow Joe ... Wednesdays with Joe coming up off and maybe this is the way you feel like it's the first one the almost the wash about it [laughter] I Can't wait I'm Talking about that and more behind them like ABC Radio for Keith I'm Brad Will talk to you tomorrow keep living the dream [noise]\nFurnished by bally's media [noise]\nTalk\n\nCounty cumulus station [noise]\nI'm trying to investigation I'm Elliot Francis as predicted hurricane Michael has grown in strength and set approaches the Florida Panhandle a head of unexpected landfall later today we're all just John travolta's on update\nBecause it's seven pm Wednesday the of what would be left to the eye which would at that point still be hurricane wins would be right at the\nUh you know the the border of of Florida and southeastern uh uh excuse me south western Georgia and that point then it cuts right across the middle of Georgia and then uh it continues to move or northeast coast of South Carolina\nAnd the eastern half of the eastern southern half of a of North Carolina so they've got a ton of rain there as we all know because of\nA Hurricane Florence but also their coastline could also be affected as are also tropical storm a a a warnings are especially long the the George in South Carolina ... online actually tropical storm warnings there and watches a\nFor a North Carolina so we are right now there quite often you'll see tornadoes uh that that that spin off from storms like this and they can become destructive and they are and they happened very quickly\nA ... knowing and and growing up in tornado alley uh you understand that that they are that that often there is little to no warning for those of tornadoes and they become of course a ... a separate a destructive force\nOf their own so certainly all the folks in the path of hurricane Michael or over the next twenty four to forty eight hours heed the warnings or keep your radios on\nA keep batteries charged and to stay alert or coming up here in less than thirty minutes after the bottom of the hour we'll talk with meteorologist Tom hale who did a great job\nAnd covering Hurricane Florence force or we talk to him earlier he also a covered a Hurricane Irma in Florida for us\nUh on red eye radio so we'll talk to him about this a new report the update from the national Hurricane Center which came across at two AM eastern\nAnd what changed here and and again what all of this means in terms of the energy behind hurricane Michael\nAre you getting back to what we're talking about a last hour when we played the audio cut from Hillary Clinton sane civility is impossible until the or\nA Democrats take power again so that was her call for civility and the interesting thing about that is an and we've talked about you know whether it's Ted Cruz or you know in the restaurant that made a a big news\nUh uh a couple of weeks ago or Mitch McConnell are at the uh the the airport or a a Jeff Flake in the the the elevator uh what's you know what's going on right now the the call number from Maxine\nWaters remember when Maxine Waters and she might have been really ignited that that political flame of of actually Democrats to like the office to write that was calling it a you know and and so we saw what happened this past weekend we saw what happened to Ted Cruz saw what happened to Mitch McConnell saw what happened to Jeff Flake\nOr the conversation on CNN yesterday if it's not a mob it's just a people expressing their their uh their their their viewpoints and it's like well most of America looks at it and when they see people screaming and yelling and going into into a private place not an organized protest\nOr organized protest Americans are fine with you go out and you protest and you're with tens of thousands of other people and it's a peaceful protest and that's fine Americans don't want riots Americans don't want mob rule they don't want you go they they don't uh most Americans don't approve\nOf the fact that you're going into a place that is not your property trespassing just to the point of harassing right or you know a ... some you know somebody else has happened in Ted Cruz's place but that call to harass people are ... anywhere uh\nYesterday a Rand Paul again and you know Rand Paul's wife\nOr has been on this year for the last uh a couple of weeks talking about the instability Kentucky Senator Rand Paul on Tuesday took aim but the rhetoric employed by senator Cory Booker and others accusing them of ratcheting up the conversation\nOr to the point where unstable people could commit violence said Paul to Kentucky radio host I fear there is going to be an assassination why I really worry that somebody's going to be killed and that those who are in a war ratcheting up conversations those who are saying get in their face\nThere have to realize that they bear some responsibility if this this elevates the violence\nThese are people that are unstable Paul says we don't want to encourage them we have to somehow ratchet down and say we're not encouraging them the violence and violence is never okay or there's never a reason uh to resolve things that weigh directly calling on Booker\nWho last July told activist do get up in the face of some congresspeople Paul referenced his own uh salt of the hands of a neighbor\nAs well as last year's a baseball field shooting which Representative Steve ... was wounded to show that unstable people can easily take things are too far and then we talk about the fact that Hillary\nTalked about you know no civility right share her call here so you've mainstream did completely now with Hillary comes out you can't get more mainstream Democrat over the last Twenty years so Hillary now calling for ... you know instability number one we talked about the fact that\nThey actually think this is an effective way to go\nTo the actually think that politicians you know calling for it now to the point of Hillary Clinton saying can have civility which is a call for instability ...\nWhich is the calls to harass people in their private life\nAnd\nI that was the first thing that hit me was was they think this is going to be effective\nBut then you get to the point of Hillary now bringing it up work she feels comfortable saying it looks Hillary's a follower she'll be asked you and not take an opinion on anything if she believes\nThat it is perceived as radical at all to anybody in her base ... we've seen it before remember when she was up in Canada\nYeah and she was asked about the pipeline right I'm not going to comment on that because other people right now are making a decision look you're running for president if this is still a a an issue we need to know what your thoughts on it are and she didn't want to take a side right\nAnd so now here's Hillary Clinton calling for instability\nAnd and and they think about this\nSo now it's becoming mainstream and and and what it why instability over what\nWhat is the issue you're calling for due process\nYou're calling for a presumption of innocence you're calling for preponderance of evidence you're saying where's the evidence\nYou're coming out because this is and we talked about this yesterday we came out of this whole thing or you know from from Democrats is if you believe in due process than you are enabling rapists and therefore you deserve no civility because of it\nWhich is of course that's their\nDefinition it's not the definition of people that believe in due process under the law people to believe in due process under the law\nObviously are not advocating\nRape or sexual assault that any other crime right\nAnd\nThat's the point and so I think about it that it's very important to get to the actual issue what is the point that they view that is so radical that the writers taking were instability must lead and it's that simple point the belief in due process\nAnd evidence in any case to show the guilt to anybody and not just an allegation that is what has set off even the mainstream now of the Democratic party to call for in civility this is\nHow far how low\nAlways wonder we always ask the question how long will they go you know calling somebody and not see you know and and and saying that that's been for a long time but you get to the point now where they're calling for instability based\nOn people's opinion on the other side that evidence is how you judge somebody's skilled right due process should apply and all of these cases which means you look\nFor the evidence to find somebody who's skilled you don't believe anybody because of their demographic because of their gender because of their race because of their age you believe people because the evidence\n... what they what they say now you can believe that you can sit there and why I think it sounded credible it doesn't mean that that person that you look at them and called them a rapist because that's what they were doing they were calling him arenas and the gang rapist yes I Believe her which means they believe you did it yes\nThey believe Kavanaugh did it the evidence isn't there right never been there right yet that's what their state and because you don't agree with that because you say no I Believe in the preponderance of evidence I Believe in the presumption\nOf of uh of of innocence I don't believe anybody just because they say if I Need evidence and when somebody stories change I'm suspicious those are all rational\nCritical thinking commonsense arguments and the Democrats if you believe that way are now

right hurricanes often spawn tornadoes just be aware that that situation is very real and those tornadoes or you have often little to no warning or so again or if you are in the path of Michael and

or so that you can stay up with it and be able to hear any warnings that come across four or something like a tornado or as it was being described by Tom hale are meteorologist on this story and will again talk with him here and just a bit\nI'm Talking with him about the storm surge and the way it is a you know as he described it it's like filling up a bathtub so\nIt is not something again or if you are not familiar with this with a a storm surge and very few people are\nBased on the the ... diction models for the highest storm surge from this storm very few people on the planet has ever experience that and again we just have to repeat that that is a deadly deadly\nA danger to uh to to individuals well that may not be familiar with it and not a understand fully or what the impact is\nAnd I I never lived in in Panama City but at the looks familiar the the downtown city area and with with a lot of residences right next to the water on the bay right and it reminds me of a lot of like Fort Walton Beach when when I Lived outside of Fort Walton Beach where I live actually lived in\nIn Fort Walton Beach were very short time but mostly in Nevada or Florida which is between Pensacola\nAnd in Fort Walton Beach and and that's in my head trying to figure out what it would be like\nYou know when I remember sitting there right in you know residential the in in the city there and you could see the bay and I'm thinking if and that would have been a in Fort Walton Beach outing shocked to hatch you may if if that came up\nYou know fourteen feet what that would be like him that's what I'm trying to imagine in my head ... estimates and on and look at ... or ... or look at the uh\nPanama City in and say you're going to have a lot of flooding\nAnd and again uh we we talked about it the the houses on the beaches that are on stilts they're roughly a the four of those houses and the deck roughly at ten feet so if you're talking about a Thirteen or fourteen foot surge\nThat means that inside those above the cells inside those homes\nYou're still talking about three to four feet of water\nA and that becomes a you know I think that puts it in perspective for anyone who's even seen one of those homes and I stayed in one over the summer I Can't imagine water getting that high there's a reason that they built him on stilts and that\nThe average is roughly ten feet it's because it's thought to be above the ah average storm surge\nIn in the path of a storm or you know in the average begin storm but Michael hurricane Michael is no average storm\nWe'll be talking to meteorologist Tom hale coming up at the bottom of the hour trying to get in all the other stories that are out there and they're actually a quite a few stories the the one that caught my attention yesterday because\nUh we really have gotten no response from the White House on this especially with the president coming out really uh yesterday and and dating\nAnd Monday that a Rod Rosenstein is going to stay mhm uh you know he's she's going to be there they had the talk and everything is great then the story comes out the two senior FBI officials told the bureau's top lawyer they believe the deputy attorney general Rod Rosenstein was serious\nWhen he discussed secretly recording Donald Trump and invoking the twenty Fifth Amendment to remove him from office last year according to sources close to a congressional investigation\nAnd an account that conflicts with the claims from Rosenstein and others the comments were either inaccurate reported or made in jest\nUh this is again former FBI general counsel a James Baker more information coming out about his testimony are told congressional investigators behind a closed door deposition last\nWeek that then FBI acting director Andrew McCabe an FBI lawyer Lisa Page came to Baker after Trump fired FBI Director James Comey and may have twenty Seventeen Baker said page and McCabe relate details of the meeting where Rosenstein made the comments\nThough he wasn't personally in that meeting Baker told congressional investigators he took ... pages word\nA seriously sources said further Baker trope congressional investigators\nHe suspected that Rosenstein was cooperating with two people in the administration to vote the twenty Fifth Amendment a source said wow yeah the testimony would appear at odds with other accounts of those discussions Baker who's testimony was described\nAs deliberate and sober added he had not done a legal analysis and was not on sure whether it was unethical or illegal the source at it\n[noise] yeah I'm\nReally just the the story that we have talked about the one that is\nHas been completely buried\nWhere there's been a really items that somebody may have written it out there but I haven't I haven't even seen it National Review mhm Henry McCarty I haven't seen write about it the Kimberley Process all and and this is about ... analyzing the the fact that the president with the Pfizer warrant application\nThat he said let's see classify it\nAnd then came out and said well\nWe're going to give it to the inspector general to look at\nAnd he will expedite it quickly and we went for what for what you're you're if you're afraid that\nUh some things should stay ... you know redacted well then you don't go to the inspector general you\nGo to you or a secretary of state former CIA director\nBecause what you're claiming as some of the allies don't want somebody information out so you go to him or you go to the director of national intelligence you go to the director of the CIA the last person to go to is the inspector general because the inspector general looks at\nWhat corruption oh oh\nThey declassified it next thing you know let's go to the inspector general corruption why is because it seemed to be that nobody in the media is covering that story every day I wake up and I said ... what am I missing\nWell because if you look at it there is there's nothing to gain the president's not going to get any kind of I guess political feedback or direction from the inspector general no that's not first of all it's not who Horowitz is\nBut it's not the role of that office of that position to be an advisor to the president that's not the point\nThe point of the guys use office is to investigate misdeeds and wrongdoing and possible criminal activity by people within the department of justice ... ... if you look at how that played out and nobody talked about it except for the fact\nThat nobody talked about it and I'm not\nTalking about the Kimberley straw souls or you know any anybody that has been covering this or even a Sarah a quarter who's been covering an a number of things and\nAnd those are really good job at it I'm Talking about the liberal media who's been screaming\nRussian collusion Russian collusion Russia inclusion Russia inclusion since before the president took office so it was about that time that they went completely silent on Russian collusion\n... ah Devin Nunes has brought it up like that I I don't know why the president doesn't make sense and then he stopped talking about right because nobody is talking about it in Washington none of the politicians Adam Schiff isn't talking about it nobody is talking about the fact that they did the rejection and then gave it to the\nTwenty three thousand people having their registration
