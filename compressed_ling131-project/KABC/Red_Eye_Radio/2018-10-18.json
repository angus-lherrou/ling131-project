President Trump continues to tackle is a bit more but not in the most effective way how many times I have to tell you need to sign a check to listen to board or nine hundred and Seventy six dollars and fifty six cent one one thousand twenty fourth of a million dollars\nThat's what he needs to do now is that he's waiting about her between Elizabeth Warren is being hammered even by the left or false claim of Indian heritage is only challenge very low IQ individual\nThat President Trump on the attack again he's a hammer in church when al sometimes you get to nail sometimes you get somebody in\nThis case you nailed so\nAt least there's at at least that it that the light continued should've been\nSick continued to defend Elizabeth Warren by the way I just this new cycle this week is too much I'm not sure I can handle it my brain is exploding Joe Walsh the residents feminist in chief over at the nation which is to say a crazy person she has a piece today called Donald Elizabeth Warren will not let Donald Trump define her\nBecause that's what she's doing when she says you Native American in fact she won't even let biology to find her it's pretty amazing she won't let any they will inject of reality to find her it's it's really really an impressive feat according to Joan Walsh Elizabeth Warren releasing her DNA test was a way of preventing Donald Trump from defining or sunset you to find herself\nAs a pool that was great that was it that that was that was really exciting stuff\n... do you remember Rachel Dolezal number there is that white lady said she was black and that you could be like the head of Spokane N. double ACP and then people found out that she had just been basically canning her skin and doing her hair out in in frizzy haired new\nEveryone said well that's a white lady and that's a racial helped I Would bet money and if you took a racial DNA tests of\nOf racial Dole was all she has more African background that Elizabeth Warren has Native American background\nAnd now I'm desperate to make that happen so Rachel if they're listening right now I Will pay for twenty three and meet us because I Want to know whether you are more black and Elizabeth Warren is Native American that we can laugh endlessly as a media which ... you to shreds has to have to say that you are more black and Elizabeth Warren is Native American I just think that would be\nAbsolutely delicious okay well we'll be back here tomorrow\nWith whatever insane crap is happening in the news because there's always something in there will be back then essentially Russia [laughter]\nTalk\nShow the realization\nABC News is live and local at ten o'clock I'm just a little and five\nMore women are accusing the Newport Beach surgeon to end his girlfriend of drugging and sexually assaulting them\nDr grant rubber show interest so Laura or pleading not guilty to numerous spelling effects charge and Flora sister spoke to reporters after the arraignment\nSo they are much better at the finding the terms and using the language to their benefit here here's another one pro choice now how could\nA conservative be against you having choices so the other side had a you know came up with pro life but there's about right because you look pretty bad if you say you're from women having choices and then you say no they can have a choice\nOf course it helps in all of us have the media on your side perpetuating these faucets I recognize that that's huge and one of the other callers pointed that out and mark you can't leave out the media\nSo those on our side or off and on the defensive even though they are explaining the ... by the way one of the other things I mentioned last night\nThe left is very good at slogans right so hope and change right Obama had open change how could you argue with hope and change\nYou have to it's much more complex to explain our position wait a second or you always for change and I'll ask my students you know or you happy when you're younger and your parents are decided they were moving and they didn't ask you how about that change\nOr how about a change you know the take away your car not every change is good but hope and change sounds fantastic\nSo those on our side or off and on the defensive even though as I said they're playing the obvious the most recent case being parents with children trying to get asylum and you know why I mentioned 'cause it's happening now but I'll get that in a minute\nSeeking asylum and President Trump and Republicans accused of ripping children of course there's the help of the media ripping children from their mother's arms and putting these children in cages never mind that this was started under the bottom and ministry Russian\nPresident Trump and Republicans are on the defensive never mind that if the parents of these children this is crucial but you're hardly ever heard of the parents of these children didn't come to the border and the first place there would be no issue\nNo one force them to come here\nThey made a voluntary choice and we have a right to our sovereignty and to protect our borders and to decide who is welcome to enter just like we do with our homes this is so obvious it's incredible that we have to explain our position but again\nThere's a simple right how can you you know you're ripping away from the parents how could you do that and we're on the other side having to explain things like what are coming here legally means why that's not acceptable\nBut the left and the Democrats and the media likely do not believe in having us you know our sovereignty but rather they believe in open borders\nBut they don't like to admit that because they know they would lose the argument\nWhich is why they would rather talk about tearing children out of their mother's arms is really bad they get to set the debate and the terms of the debate when the media's on their side because no one's questioning them with comments like I'm throwing out there now you would\nNever mind that when anyone does something illegal and they're hauled off to jail their children do not go with them to jail boys that a big one\nThat's a huge one you'll never see it when you know in the in the last time this happened and it's going to happen again with these hunters ah Honduras refugees coming you know seeking asylum that's going to happen very shortly whenever they get here\nYou get to stay with your kid you could you could use the same phrase oh she was found guilty of robbery first degree robbery and put our child was ripped out of her arm you never hear the media say that but that's what happens in effect\nThere also and so to speak torn away from them why isn't it said and I was just then became the latest reincarnation of this conflict is is the news hundreds of Hondurans are heading for the U.S border in a mass migration to seek asylum\nSo again President Trump and the Republicans will be on the defensive just because they want to defend our borders and the media will again show crying children and distraught mothers you know what's gonna happen\nBut no one is forcing them to come here and we have a right to decide who gets to enter our house and under what circumstances\nAmong other things we have a right this is pretty obvious to it seems to me to protect the American people from harm weather from terrorism or disease we don't know the terrorists aren't coming through our\nOpen border or disease or we checking for diseases like we used to know or ... well you can't if they come here and Russian or even fat matter this is important people don't talk about this\nTo make sure that people who come here share our values\nAnd just about every country does this including our neighbor immediately to the south Mexico good try the same thing down there\nSome of us think this is also obvious but there have been huge forces arrayed against this common sense\nThe Democrats want more votes they will tell you that they they know illegal immigrants vote for them in huge numbers and the country club Republicans for lack of better name they want cheap labor so you have a newspapers like the wall Street Journal I I stopped subscribing to it\nWhen they would have their editorials and it would talk about immigration in the title and then I mean they say illegal immigration the title and some are in the middle they would just sit switched immigration oh immigration has been a great for America over the years how could you you were in Iowa list right how could you oppose this this is insane\nBut they would switch on us even though they pretend to talk about illegal immigration in the title\nOf course the Republicans are also the stupid party that's my party than like knowledge ring that so you have people like George W. Bush and Karl Rove saying things like boy we can get this vote George W. Bush got up to forty percent of the Hispanic vote in Texas wonderful\nI'm not a math major but that seems like a formula for defeat\nAll Lawson politics by the way politics in particular a loss of sixty percent of forty percent is huge and that is based on an optimistic assumption most illegal immigrants come here for jobs but they also take advantage of government hand that says we know that the rest of us are paying for\nAnd by the way the Republican Party can never out do the Democrats and offering benefits\nI uh I think I use this phrase years ago when a ever voters given a choice between Democrats and Democrats meeting larger Democrats they choose the original ones they need us to who these people going to vote for it's not that hard to figure out\nAnd if left unchecked the Republicans will never win a national election again\nSo even on a purely selfish basis it is clear that we need to control the border\nNot to mention fairness what do you say to the people around the world who have been waiting many years I've heard of people waiting a decade to get here but I have to undergo long waits on and says some paperwork to even have a hope of getting here so they have to follow the rules but those who dash across the border do not\nWhich is why a border wall makes sense among other tools is not the only thing but it's one of the tools so one caller and this week and if you didn't hear him suggest that border walls don't work in the long run\nAnd I said but even if that were true I bet they work in the short run while we try to clean this mess up and have an orderly procedure coming to our country\nIt's to me it's the same ridiculous logic that the defenders of illegals murdering innocent America's like Americans like hates finally use\nAnd I you know I pointed Geraldo Rivera 'cause I watch them do a time and time again saying oh illegals commit crimes percentage wise you lower numbers the Native Americans as if\nThat matters who cares even if that's true if an American is killed or harmed by an illegal immigrant that person would not have been hurt if that illegal had been denied entry no matter what the percentage isn't that obvious and that wall by the way in Israel preventing Hamas for murdering Israel's Israelis is working to shore room\nA lot of these arguments is baffling to me unless you realize they have no real argument unless you change the words and the terms\nI more to say to you but I Know you have to go to the break surely let me give you the numbers and I'll go on a little bit more eight six six Ninety red eye and that's the same as eight six six nine seven three three three nine\nSo example how can you ever justify sanctuary cities were criminal illegals or given safe harbor if you come up with phony arguments like illegals will not you've heard that they won't cooperate with the authorities if they know they can be apprehended or sent home so that's why it's important that you know we have sanctuary for them\nBut how about they not be allowed to come or in the first place and we wouldn't need to cooperate with authorities isn't that obvious how can you ever justify harboring criminals who commit crimes that native born Americans have no asylum from\nYou change the debate watch this to the evil police officers at ice who had the audacity to arrest people who commit crimes that said these guys are really clever on the left\nSo the rest of us live with long lines at hospitals through reading schools and intolerable traffic while the elites often live behind walls and their gated communities so what's my solution\nYou take away the benefits like free health care and free schools you enforce strict penalties against businesses that hire illegals even sending some CEO to jail you say in the first CEO to jail for hiring and illegal immigrant and they'll never happen again\nAnd you'd be amazed at how many illegal immigrants would return home\nRun they actually had a right to use the wrong language self deport there we go again would language right we're not good at that self deport we keep losing the language war to the left\nBut I Would say that those who remained right everybody would leave it there are no bad if I take them back\nNo on one tonight three hundred and Seventy eight million dollar Powerball dry and so Saturdays jackpots expected to be four hundred thirty million by the way friday's mega millions jackpot is now nine hundred million dollars K.

S. um might want to be a little bit smarter and think about other places to possibly go that may be easier to get into\n'em if they have farming skills I mean South Africa or they're kicking people out of there and taking their farm so\nAh maybe put together a band of you in some of your uh guys that are think you have the the Gulf to go over there and maybe protect some of those people get paid some money or or use your farming skills and go over and help out South Africa because uh they're digging themselves into over right now so\nI hear your sarcasm delusion [laughter] ... yeah I I Do hear by the way you bring up a new story I don't\nKnow if it a lot of people know about South Africa's expert breeding the land of a lot of the citizens right and that's going to be a real struggle and I had a lot of them are going to resist right with a force\nAbsolutely absolutely yeah\nWe was you know when a thanks for your call when we meddle in other countries I don't mean coming to their aid into fence but like we did in South Africa you got to be careful what you get I ... and all this talk of makes me think Egypt right we we helped them over and throw a\nWhat's his name Mubarak and I asked of the time I was doing national radio and I said wait a second to what they called the springs something what was the term anybody out there can tell me I've forgotten or for a second I'm\n... now and Brian was helping me and not their spring there was some something was spring but anyway uh the fact is we got where she got to ask that question what's what's after this so you got rid of Mubarak and you've got the Brotherhood Muslim Brotherhood which was tyrannical and certainly not on our side\nAnd then eventually ... took it over there we were saying maybe it was the Arab Spring I may you may be right Brian I think you are now that I think of it um producer Brian so you know when I'm mentioning the fact is that you you\nJust do the spine when we did that in South Africa right you overthrow what you have and then you don't ask what's next is going to be attorney rights open the best example might be Iran\nWe were so thrilled with Jimmy Carter to overthrow the shock yeah but they didn't ask goes next are you happy looking back and seeing what you've gotten instead of the shah\nI ... the biggest enemy maybe or at least our enemy that's and you might say Russia China but certainly the biggest immediate threat in terms of what they're doing to our citizens\nSo it's very important that you not just act emotionally I'm thinking Gadhafi in Libya right Hillary was for that Obama was for that what is your place Libya with weren't didn't they killed Americans right\nIn being gossipy is you just can't operate let me get myself in trouble with somebody you now\nIn Saudi Arabia we got a real problem there what they did was horrendous in my opinion needed stone assassinate people like that and go inside and chopped them up and some people picked on me for that is that it's none of our business\nBut the other side of President Trump's got a huge problem now is they're our biggest supporters in ... you know besides Israeli and trying to work against Iran cause Iran's their threat to\nThis world is very complicated and their offer no easy solutions or maybe you don't notice historically we had a war there was a war or not we between Iran and Iraq\nAnd you know you got to choose sides sometimes they may both be terrible we worked with the Soviet Union during the more I think about this we work with the Soviet Union during World War two because we had a bigger enemy and Hitler\nSo a lot of leftist and liberal say well you work with these people what how do you respond to that well life is not easy you're faced with difficult choices and you got to figure out what makes the most sense\nThis stuff is not easy\nAnd that in St Louis illegal immigrants coming in right now it's not it's a tough challenge [noise] let me know what you

shooting\nAnd the Harvard heights section of central LA the teen who was walking along ... boulevard when he was wounded was taken to the hospital in stable condition there was no description of the suspected shooter or suspect vehicle\nWhich is what he did last night we got a couple of hits again today and I'm\nNot all over the map here but also or just after the one specific question about why um Milwaukee went with my leak or just those ... pictures like that\nBecause you were talking about this the other night\nHe thought they Roberts was gonna jump you know and it was like it was like a Crick council says jumps and then they brought bridge goes how high he didn't do that keep your best lined up out there really is to have freeze in Muncie Ind the lined up\nHe said this is my desk lined up and we're going to take this game because it means that much\nAnd they played up to it and I knew her shawl was going to throw a gym I just had a feeling because somewhere in his might it might have been his last game the Dodgers stadium\nFair you don't know at this point obviously I he himself has has been laboring at times this year well documented\nMany innings on that arm is his but\nWhen you absolutely needed against the wall he comes out today and just throws an absolute ... and that's obviously what it's all about it this state of the game that's for credit counseling and trying to play those nine games I'm not a fan of it I never have been a look unless you have three four World Series championship trophies in your back pocket\nThen you can if you start playing mind games and things like that but again I mean taking outweighed Molly you really thought that the answer was going to be Brandon would rough\nHe was going to get you write a book by committee it never works and we see this a lot of times in different posts seasons and I you just can't do it the Milwaukee pitching I give him credit that's a very good pitching staff overall and bullpen but\nAt the end of the day you're not going to be able to do both pine by committee and get through um especially when you get down to the final four is not going to happen to them\nYou know sometimes managers try to think themselves they try to outsmart themselves they try to get cute and sometimes it's not that complicated\nAh one more thing I did want to say if you don't mind about the Dodgers played a little bit of small ball finally hit they can continue to do that they already know that can hit home runs but if you got that line that they could go either way comfortably that is going to be cut team to be\nYeah I'm with you on that one so I'll let me ask you a song and real fast you sure do yeah um what's your prediction for friday's game the Dodgers do Dodgers close it out or does it go again [laughter]\n... call tough call um\n[noise]\nNo pressure on game sex that they can you know it's interesting it's a good question here because it's so hard to predict when these teams go on the road at this point in time and I I can stews I wouldn't be surprised if Milwaukee finds a way to kind of rally behind those home crowd fans and they're able to win game says\nI'll say this I have to say this if the Dodgers play like they play today not swinging for the fences\nPlay baseball and as pure as far as purest form meaning but the ball still still bases keep the ball and field and you know when they have their opportunities you know sleep with a ... and when you have your opportunities\nThey when they went on a then went on friday\nAnd also ... ... oh sure guys you know I saw the guy had finished I Know also\nAbout game six is I've been to you about a little more I think ... gonna come back from this performance he do for for a much better game that eat pitch last game show I think that's one thing to doctors have going for them\nThe only thing I Do here on the other side is I don't know how long that pitching staff can hold down the Milwaukee Brewers because man that that will lead course has been lights out\nAnd uh if they continue like that no I didn't the Milwaukee it's not going to win but if they if they could break out in the game six then you're going to see a game so\nSlow to solve out of exciting place down the stretch here Solomon as always thanks for the call you gotta take care guys\nOne eight hundred to two to five to two two how about the American league keys and I know we're kind of looking ahead there before but tonight why a lot of our fence eight to six Boston comes out on top commanding three one series lead\nWe were impressed I think last round what they're able to do against the Yankees but now you're seeing on full display I mean man to be fat movie best today essentially turning on was a kind of like a double play turn from right field is able to throw out a the runner on second base as he was trying to get into second down for a crucial out towards the end of the game\nOut I mean while they can do it offensively it's like they have like four outfielder sometimes yeah I'm saying and and just take your pick as far as this lineup goes anybody Jackie Bradley junior I\nMean this guy's on a ... right now and this is the guy who if you were to say he would be a big time stand out in October and the pre season in spring training you'd be like what really\nExactly look this is a great game in the U.S I mean the Astros fought hard today\nThey are they just couldn't get a dime and just the better team won today you know that's how I look at and the man I'll be honest with you brat I think there's I think the series is over man I think it's over I uh I don't I don't I don't think the Astros\nA can come back three one is going to be very hard to do it um you know in ... I think this really\nTook their heart\nOut of the whole thing I mean they had a ball they had to play than a controversial ball or I honestly felt it should have been a homerun beginning of the gas to get into that yes three start and I said I was sitting there watching I said well the best is about to make a play right now\nBoom hits the ball goes over the fence and look that play honestly it was a home run hit literally off the back of his glove and then the fan headed but\nLook the chips in fall that way they call it they call in and out\nYou get the ball you get an opportunity again and do something and man what a hell of a catch that they make at the end of the game to to to win the game Boston did win the game and you know that just kind of shows I think they're right there just depleted the Astros and I don't think they can bounce back from that I think it's done I think it's a done deal\nUm I think the the Boston Red Sox will advance of the world series is just you know what I'm saying is is when you take this that took the spirit out the Astros\nI think they closed it out and it goes on a friday\nWe're up against it but I Want to get back to that later on tonight especially the point about the controversial call there at the beginning again because I think that's somewhat of a problem right now from major league baseball great show as we continue on tonight

he'd hanging out talking UCLA football's a joke the choppy\nThrowing nation dot com and joined us each and every Wednesday here in the fall\nDiscussing the Bruins first when a twenty Eighteen it finally happened and believe it or not uh there's teams that are are are still searching for their first Victor yeah twenty Tina brass actually comes to mind\nAnd it it kind of compare and contrast actually right now the situation between um you know what's going on there was Scott Frost and his first year in Nebraska\nAnd chip Kelly a obviously a kind of all of a sudden now I think he'd much rather be in this situation right here for UCLA compared to some other situations what's your take on that job just kind of comparing other schools right now they're kind of getting up to a struggling start\nWell I mean like I say that the key thing that everybody's got to talk about all season long with the Bruins is is seen constant progress and and if you look at you know the further the game as as a low point\nGot as I said earlier they got better against Colorado to get better against Washington ... and they got to win this past weekend\nAgainst UC Berkeley I think he I think it's hard to argue against that um I think I think didn't they started finally started making steady progress stuck with the Colorado game and a and you know I think that there are many a trend and uh you know I\nI haven't watched a whole lot of Nebraska so I don't know exactly what their situation is but you know\nWhen you're when you're starting to win games\nYou know that's a that's what people want to see and uh and we finally got the last Saturday with chip now they come in this weekend uh they they come back home to a to face Arizona on Saturday Night at the rose bowl\nI think it's another winnable game um the Wildcats not played well this season under Kevin someone um ... we used to be silly weapons for Nader ah for most of the gym more years or has come over to Arizona\nWith someone from Texas A M M M which dreams\nWhich means that jury has an hour over the defensive coordinator\nShould be looking have shops have because\nBecause there's only ... by his own admission known lives only call the ... the cause of fame fired plays in a different order throughout the course of the game so I'm\nSo jealous let me let me ask you know you got Arizona you got Arizona coming up this weekend right what is the key for UCLA success in Wayne is game is running the ball is it maybe being more aggressive on the defensive in in the ... and getting to the quarterback what\nDo you think is their key to winning this Saturday [noise]\nUh I think the key is gonna be woman run on the ball well again I'm Missouri only like ... like ... lives only likes to like to run a fast off ants um uh unfortunately he also has a tendency sometimes to take his foot off the gas\nA home you know all you got to do is look back to UCLA game against Texas a and then last season\nOf where they had that that you come back with Josh Rosen to see that you know Missouri only had had his foot and UCLA Mac and he took it off\nAnd they came back to win the game um so uh\nIt's crazy how that is a theme right now yeah across college football we've seen that maybe at the professional level as well teams who are not able to close out games really clamp down and their opponent when they need to and I I don't know what do you think it is at this point in time Joe ... why do you think so many teams\nHow having difficulties right now with closing the more so we have a lot of parity right now we know about the the very top one percent if you will in college football they're dominant y'all damage to the world but outside of that and there's a trickle down effect I think a lot of parity right now throughout the league here take\nWell I think I think you get a ... I think you've got to go and then he got to finish yeah and uh you know I mean the the biggest knock against against it was only ... was was that he was always call in the ... he he wasn't very imaginative\nAnd allow fence of coordinator um and like I say everybody always point to that you know to the to the interview he did where we turn around it's a just cause the same fire phrase over and over again on gay wrong except in a different order um\nYou know I think I think\nIt presents a great opportunity for the Bruins defensively army and look for a lot of lives only lives only has a big tendency that called bubble screens um so I think there'll be I think that would be on the lookout for that um you know he's got a great running a great quarterback they're\nRunning quarterback in a you know they're over there at Arizona and and that's what they had at UCLA with Brett humbly um so I think I think they're going to I think they're going to try to keep you silly off balance with with their quarterback\nBut uh I think ultimately are the Bruins will will be able to turn around and contain Matt um especially in the second half if ah Jerry asthma can make some half time adjustments and uh I think I think the birds are just going to turn around and pounding the ball because that signature\nBut also but also there's this series and it's like\nWhat you're getting from UCLA is is if they can continue to get when they do right now I think it's more of\nYou want to salvage the rest of your season and you want to say look we get some wins under our belt\nWhat can we do to build from there it is building like you should like they got to win tonight they gotta win last week I'm Sorry and what can we do to build on that they got a tough game coming up with Arizona\nI'm can they build from that can they wind from that is putting together a winning formula and some change it takes a little longer for them to figure out how to win than others\nAnd so I think that's what you come in with UCLA is a situation where they've figured out a way to when they figure out the form of what they need to do now is about building upon that and how you're going to do that so\nYou know and also trusting your system you know believing in your system that it will work for you so I think that was a problem with them in the beginning was there was a lot of guys on that team that really didn't believe in what they were doing and\nI think there get last week they bought in let's just say that chip Kelly won his team over because they bought into the system\nThey beat the breaks out off the couch thirty seven is serving as just says a within itself that's not a matter of like that's not just the emotional when that's the person that's the team is trusting in their system believing in it and say you know what\nJust give it a hundred and ten percent every time we were on the field and that's what they got that's what you got right there so I think if they can build from that man is good is great news for the Bruins a nation over there and is great news for the fans and including the team you know so I think they just got to continue to build from that once they do that they're gonna be okay\nOne eight hundred to two to five to to to I Want to go back to we were talking about earlier with the baseball\nThe al ... tonight John ... towards the beginning of the game involving moody bats in the outfield they're reaching up trying to catch the ball for went over the fence obviously it appeared that he was interfered with\nBut here's the thing I agree with AJ Hinch the aspirin manager and basically saying that look look he's a great player we that was evident tonight and this guy is very deserving of the airline BP is probably going to win it\nWhich is crazy he's only played for four years so far young guy but how can you say if your major league baseball and you review that play that without a doubt\nWhat they're saying is without a doubt he was going to make that play\nHow you know that you know what I'm saying how do you know he was going to make that play sure 'cause if you look at it the replay one more time again it looks like initially his glove was opened up but if you look carefully added there's no real evidence that he's a glove was actually pushed in by the fans\nThere I was in pushed I looked at that played many a times I'll watch that and the minute I say I said it was bumped bumped slightly or anything but he missed time that jump in that catch all the way he went up he does\nHave the ball over he had his glove open he closed it and then when he closes\nThe ball hit on the backside of his of his glove in the back side was love and then it bounced off the his glove hit the fans and and from there that's all she wrote but clearly to be honest with you if the fed even put his hand out there that would and bounced off the black of his\nGlove or the way it did that was a home run it was over it was over the wall so you know the\nThe fair putting his head now enter recur saving of the glove to their head and then it bounced bounced right back into\nWhy so no that that that ball was ms time and they just they missed the call and you know but look it was early in the game right when that happened yes that was a key key a\nKey moment for the for the Houston Astros there was a lot of causes them to that but there was a lot yeah there was a lot of calls that went against them and not just the only one\nAnd that's what I'm saying like they had the opportunity to win the game even at the end of the game Brett they have their opportunities to win the game so here's my thing is he says hey what the old saying says is that you got to be able to coach the team out\nAnd don't let the referees are the umpires and by getting involved in that so they had their opportunities to do that they just couldn't do it\nYeah that's true I my thing was Houston is last season\nGuys like ... for example we're talking about right there that controversial play with the potential what it looked like would have been a home run\nLast year he was phenomenal right\nAnd I think this kind of can count for a lot of guys that Astros why they were really really good last year there are still good this year to really good\nBut they've fallen off just a little bit in that line up and I think it shows I really do think it shows they've fallen out just a little bit and you have a team now like Boston who just spreads at all throughout the light up like crazy and to me that that's the big difference there still good Houston there's two putting up runs like you saw tonight\nBut it's not quite the onslaught of what you saw last year especially in the world series against Dodgers when they could just put up run after run up to run and youth especially in that crazy game five last year that Fifteen fourteen game twelve eleven something like that\nOr they could just keep coming at you it's a little bit different issue the officers caught off very slightly but that's like ... and this is making all the different because of such a young upstart Boston team um who really is doing to the Astros with the Astros did to a bunch of teams last year\nWell ... is you know let's call it what it is man it's when you look at this team you you say they got the brakes beat off from them in the series a couple of them I mean seven runs a runs you know that's\nA lot of runs man and then I was a really good ... and ... you got to Boston line up\nThat really knows what they're doing they're very um they're very savvy and and they know what they're doing your plate when you're playing against a very good team they're going to exploit you and and that's what you see him in his what's going on in the series has there been exploited and so\nUm you just got to look at them and say you know you have to ... all you can do really at this moment in time when your deep in the series is trying to find a way to to limit your heirs you're going to still have them but when you're playing against a very good team\nI'm like the Boston Red Sox and use it actually was a great team too as well\nUm but when you're playing against a team like the ... they're going to exploit you're you're you're weak points and\nLook we looked at the Astros we looked at one of the way they've been playing the whole season we couldn't find too many ... planes right why because they're a great team and you did that was hitting but when you start playing teams there just tells you is you in better or better\nYou're going to see and it's going to be is going to be wide open and that's what you're seeing right now so you know they look this is going to be a tough way out for them um\nI don't believe they can come back from this like I say I think there's game right here was an emotional and all the time there was more knowing yeah three one depleted\nThey were ... they are depleted I think this to the heart out of them the spirit of them and I think a Red Sox close it out and getting five\nYeah I Do think the series will go back to Boston I don't think a Houston will go down without a fight them I think they're good enough to push back to Boston but make no mistake about a Red Sox and the driver see going forward quickly on the NBA opening night opening night number\nTo hear our early thoughts for marrying great great love Golden State lives good we've got to say that I mean all yeah what a ... good they're going to\nLive there is going to be go to the state in Boston and find those I'm Sorry guys say what you want have all the\nYou can think whatever the hell you you want to think Golden State Boston will be in the final but I'm going to say this\nAbout what's the Celtics real quick I mean would that help the team I mean they're heading in ...\nTheir head and shoulders and you know what joellen beans comment the other day about this is not a rivalry between us and the Celtics and and uh and you know they beat us every time we play him why would you say that\nYou're supposed to be a leader of the team why would you say that and this is only one game and starting out this season doesn't make any sense whatsoever you\nKnow so they gotta they gotta fill you got a long way to go I'm just going to say that there's a great surprises this week I saw the pelican is being used in the Houston shows me that Houston as when you leave lose Trevor reason we went to Phoenix and while say Phoenix is great\nWhile I'm a I'm at right now and they look good but\nYou lose them you there's a drop off there so you know ... pelicans is right in the running man and look good NBA regular season off\nAnd running we love it here on behind the Mike Lakers purple and gold kick it off tomorrow night on the

certainly not governor band name and the whole state of sanctuary space which I don't I don't know how many of the city's pay attention to him I Know some of them have actually\nVoted against a following his directions but I don't recall ever hearing any voter that sanctuary city down here and\nThere was no it wasn't so they were on it it's just to get Democrats off at the very liberal extremely leftist a Democrat in office and he just decided that's a good idea does it and I from what I understand San Francisco's kind of a dump now partly\nWhat it is when I was there a few months ago and\nI'm used to it was amazing when I was walking the streets with\nMy kids are so many other just now look at this hand this hand as a weapon and then another time something ... someone says something about a knife that doesn't count how dirty it is now I didn't see this but they were needles and all over certain sections I think they said market street and of course the problem with the trash and the\nAnd the homelessness is a problem but that's true yes you know everywhere in California right\nYeah uh-huh but I think uh I I haven't been to San Francisco in a long time I don't really go up there that much I mean it's quite far from San Diego and I've I've just never been into their way of thinking so um yeah it's\nIt's it's ... it's the only thing we voted on and I like to ask you one other thing I didn't mention is to follow that spoke at first but but you have you heard the thing about the the um um birth tourism\nHere it was on earth especially this gets\nMentioned this just a few people and they've not heard of that and actually it was on television some some time ago on twenty twenty dateline or one of those where they fly on these Chinese women that are pregnant and they have a place all set up and they go there and they have a baby get their little American citizenship for the baby and leave\nAnd then leave yeah no I actually I did hear that pregnant women going into hospitals yep they've got to figure it out and look people take advantage of the weaknesses in anything right especially your in laws horse we of course we call that anchor babies right to so they come here and they have a baby and then there are they have all the rights\nAnd wrongs of course has long an awful\nLot of people have not heard about that because I've I've told that she likes the politicians here and they well they are people that work for them and they had heard of that so I'm I'm Glad to get to say it on national radio so people can know what's going on it's we're very close to the border here so I mean people come over here and dumped the baby's all the time I came down from I mean they have them\nAnd I and I just I don't think it's right I don't think a lot of the country and the other countries in the world do that\n... somebody had a ... in Italy I said the baby out deals citizenship and they said no she was born in an air force us air force base so I don't know why we're handing out citizenship like if I can but you know it's it's it's the parents\nThey're actually yeah glad\nThe actual do Sylvia there was a reason for it which is a ... with the with the slavery issue we want to make sure that they weren't taking advantage of it any way but of course if you pass a law every every law by the way this is a phrase I've heard was a one time a solution every problem was the one time a solution to something else\nSo you you mean well and you pass something and then people figure out how to take advantage oh I Would do the same thing I Lived in Asia
