technology when it can have a positive effect on our lives and heart disease and stroke a church two of the biggest causes of death worldwide now imagine for a moment\nThat you can get a warning that you were going to have a heart attack\nYears before the event ever occurred that's right well thanks to technology developed by teams at Oxford University and institutions in Germany and the United states\nThey now are using algorithms to examine the fat surrounding coronary arteries as it shows up on the tea hearts scams\nNow most heart attacks are caused by a buildup of plaque fatty deposit inside the artery interrupts the flow of blood so currently the CAT scans tell a doctor when an artery has already become narrowed by plaque well that's the problem\nThey say now that they can figure this out even before develop they can say which arteries are the risk of narrowing they can say that your arteries are inflamed\nAnd what's going to be going on five years down the line that you should start preventive measures right now to avoid the platform for me so you can start singing are you ready don't go bake\nIn my heart [laughter] okay [noise]\nActually thought that was funny [noise]\nAll right this next story is not for the kids so if you have kids that are listening to the came commandos\nSo time for them to cover their ears or you wanna mute the television if you're watching the game commando show there mute the radio if they're in the room as long as they're clear we're good to go or are you ready\nGood there's a dark side of the technology that a lot of folks are brushing off it's the use of robots for use in\nHow do you say intimate situation things that happened between two people\nJust like there are those gentlemen clubs where someone might pay ten dollars for a pole dance and those ranchers branches in Nevada where prostitution is legal the city of Houston was wrestling this past week with how to deal with the company that wants to open up a brothel filled with robotic sex toys that's right [noise]\nThey wanted to open a loved ... brought the one issue soon so that people would be able to use its human like dolls\nA kind of sad that it sounds familiar it was in that movie Westworld K Houston remains the only major U.S city without zoning construction of the site for the proposed robot bravo had already be good\nBut it was stopped after the city inspectors visited location and they figured out that the business owners that they didn't have the proper permits\nSo Houston's city council actually updated the local audience to specifically banned individuals from having sex with a device that resembles a human being\n[noise] okay I Know what you're thinking maybe the city council couldn't ferret away to tax the robots but those of us here at the Kim commando show a we have come up with the perfect name for that how about a Sears\nAnd Roebuck yes Sears and Roebuck yes okay [noise] okay the kids are back and let's talk about selfies research out this past week that death by selfie is on the rise\nAn average of forty three people a year have died while taking selfies in the year two thousand eleven drowning and falls are the biggest killers\nThe study shows that men account for seven of the ... fatalities millennial daredevils those between the age of twenty twenty nine make up almost half of all sell the debt so here's what's going on\nLegislation politicians are getting together and coming up with no selfie zones says right okay\nYou're going to have no selfie zones near water bodies mountain peaks tall building a U.S woman died on a highway accident just seconds after uploading a selfie of herself singing happy on her car stereo\nOr there was a ... a young Mexican guy killed himself he was posting with a selfie with a gun next to his head\nOr a tie woman was hit and killed by a train this past spring she was wanting to take a picture of herself and her friend on the rail tracks\nBritish woman Louis she's thirty seven her partner Michael thirty three they fell about sixty feet to their deaths after topping off a beach walls so now we need these no selfie zones or maybe it's just the latest crop of the Darwin Awards and we may see that's it but if you think about it on a positive way\nAt least they had a refund head shot for the funeral mhm\nAnd finally be careful what you search for

free app to fill out forms sign documents and review PDF without ever leaving the app\nIt also has to do besides directly into acrobat reader\nAnd those are going to recognize blanks in a forum that previously you know the Dropbox around where to put a tax and it was always a complete nightmare so over a commander dot com we'd have a whole article about the brand new way than do these changing the PDF that you're going to love and meanwhile\nA few updates from Google this past week that she needs to know about that if you haven't used Google Translate it's really slick or use a lot when I was in Europe over the summer I Love it especially when I was in a restaurant and I looked at the menu and I didn't know any French and I could say definitely don't want the snails\nUntil now Google Translate on your phone listening to the same pronunciation this is really amazing technology dumped brushes up\nGoogle Translate has added speech output local version English French Spanish and golly you can hear English results for example with a Spanish accent or with a French accent or an Indian accent or listen to French Canadian spent and really something\nAnd this next Google update is one that you might want to pass along to your family members and friends you see they've been working on a brand new product that lets Android users control their device using only their voice it's been in beta a really long time two years but\nThis past week Google started releasing the global aids called voice access allows you to write text\nTalk to the Google Assistant navigate using your voice oh so you can click buttons and other things just with your boys\nOne's voice access is activated you see numbers next to everything so if you want to issue a command you'd say like click seven for example\nYou can go back home you can tell the device to turn on the wife fire Bluetooth suggests the volume open the app basically what ever you would want to do on your Android device you can now do with only your voice you can download voice access through Google Play [noise]\nComing right up and just a few moments where five route or security settings to turn on before it's too late and then later on\nThis hour the things that you should not be even thinking about buying as far as technology goes in the month of October\nBut back to the phones me go with Nick and Oakville, Washington\nEditor Nick how are you I'm good what's going on [noise]\nUm I've been looking into some money making an apples um the ones or you can earn money watching movies and TV shows or share your online shopping received so I'm Wondering if these are legitimate abs or if they are\nOr you may be inviting trouble to the phones ... possibly viruses are now where\nAre you know it's all those are really good question um how much money are you trying to make or would you like to make\nOh say moving you know feeling of books extra months\nLiving here it's a it's not like you're like OK I Need to make a thousand dollars were you know two thousand dollars or anything like that so you know some of the ap she mentioned like swag bucks is one that let you watch TV Shop kick is the one that you know let you cumulative points for shopping uh there's I poll this way it's something that allows you to take surveys\nGoogle also has their opinion out that will pay you one dollar per survey\nYou know if you wanted to make like\nA couple of hundred bucks a month that may be the way I was in costs go a couple of weeks ago\nAnd I had a put TaskRabbit on my phone 'cause one of these apps right um 'cause I just figured you know as testing it out and then when I got to Costco came up and says hey you know we have a task for you and so I figured you know what\nMight as well I'm Wondering how stuff works right and so it asked me to go over and take a picture of the the downy fabrics oftener and ... and and how much is being sold for at that particular Costco\nSo I took a picture and send it off through the gap and then I made like seven bucks my foot that's not bad I mean I'm already here anyway right\nAnd so you know so the way that the absolute illegitimate apps is that you don't have to worry about malware and viruses but I always caution people that some of these they don't actually give you cash that they may give you like an Amazon dot com gift card\nOr a gift card to Starbucks um there's also other ones like once called folk\n... that you could take a picture of anything and then they submitted to the various um agencies and so you may get a couple of bucks that way\nThere's Moby and it wants you to go to a particular business and then take a survey about the business [noise] uh there's field agent which is just like TaskRabbit there's diet bet if you want to lose a couple of pounds right\nOr you can place a bet that you're going to be and you participate in this you gotta weigh yourself and all that other stuff\nAnd but the average take home for a month is like sixty bucks their sweat coin gang for every thousand steps you can get a point nine five sweat coin that will be translated into like an apple gift card their surveys on the go there's just a whole bunch of 'em but\nUm they these are the ones that I mentioned are legitimate there's probably some some that are not legitimate\nBut what I can do is direct you to the list of legitimate moneymaking apps over my website\nDoes that help you out to cook or someone in a little confusing and\nOh it does and then when you and like most people nobody reads the terms and conditions on any of this stuff so I posted a link to it over a commando dot com and speaking about making money coming up in the third our of this week show you don't want to miss it because I have even more ways that I didn't mention here\nIt's like we're having a trail charger\nAnd that's like one of the actually lower points but then you build up to you know like yeah there is a a hashing go commando T shirts which they don't really want to buy an al ... do you want to get that certain um and then all the way up to a you know the ... and that everybody is really then I got a hundred and\nFifty dollar prize really as it and then we have a laptop so basically here's what happens folks is that you become a commando ambassador okay and when you become a commando\nVassar you share our newsletters with your family members and friends and the more that you share the more potential that you have to win these great prices and so if they're already getting the newsletters how did they joined the

length ... that's how you are on private land\nAnd then that's how you keep track of how many points that you have and the prices that you've gotten and the prize is that you were about to receive a

be in a divorce which is a big part of family law they're not married it'd be in a paternity case either way you can end up in family court could benefit from the help of someone like myself\nAlong with that goes to the issue of child support if you have a child there needs to be financial contributions from one person the other to make sure that that child taking care of huge issue\nIf you're married there's a lot of other things that I help with their spouse will support which is what we call alimony here in uh in California spouse will support alimony spousal maintenance saw the same thing\nIt's just a payment from one spouse to the other to take care of them um and the other issues that you might not think about that are technically family law that I handle our domestic violence issues meaning a restraining orders\nAnd we most commonly see those in my practice in either the context of a divorce or a couple that may have been dating or living together\nBut it can also extend to other areas such as a family members the boyfriend of an ex partner it can be anything really anything where somebody in poses a threat or make someone fearful for their safety and they need to seek legal protection\nOutside of the criminal justice system they can still get a restraining order so do a lot of that I also help people who were not married and don't have children together but formed a partnership with one another by living together by sharing finances maybe one person gave up his or her career and that's what we call palimony\nSo that also falls into family law but I don't do is I don't do estate planning I don't do ... things like that well that that's really fascinating I mean mad is the man we love and by the way\n... murder law s M U R D a law dot com you gotta ... murder law dot com\n[noise] no I'm not going to ask Matt please so suddenly calls\nYou is it mostly men are mostly when I Know it it's an equal division honestly I have of my client roster list I Would say it's just about a fifty fifty split\nBut here's an interesting thing that people that do call me or not my clients and that is the new boyfriend or girlfriend of my client who is calling to set up an appointment oh to make it easy for their new\nBoyfriend girlfriend to come on in and get that and ... that's right here and just out of the book I also get a lot of calls from the mothers of my clients are trying to\nHelp fix something that they're concerned about and do you welcome those calls or is that a horse says no no no of course I mean the only thing to understand is that that's not what we call an attorney client privilege communication because they're not my clients so I'm like that very clear but\nYou know it's a good way to to get an idea of what's going on and see if it might be a good fit and then set up an appointment with the actual person and take it from there well do you do mediation as well do you try to kind of settled at ... the whole group so I Am not a mediator by trade um what I Do is I Try to diagnose a case to see if it should be mediated\nAnd ... the metaphor I use is this um you know if you have a cold you're probably better off going to urgent care than to a surgeon and I look at what I Do more as like a surgeon for the more complex difficult situations um and so if somebody has a fairly simple case and if they can't afford it what I Will do is I Will refer them to\nA a mediator and I have a lot that I work with but what it does is that raises an interesting issue for something I'm working on\nWhich uh it's not ready to to launch yet but I'm really excited about this this side project I have a a centrally a service that I'm working on developing that's going to help people who maybe can't work it out but also can't afford a lawyer

the average age school marshal for you but you are kind of a Bon Jovi follow on job yeah\nBy the way I Want to say it is because we are completely politically incorrect mass murder has the beautiful blonde eyebrows oh\nI have to do I want to sell my eyebrows I Am white hair yes on my eyebrows I can handle that my eyebrows are getting whites okay so the other day I got a five minutes a on my eyebrows oh uh-huh I kept it on for Fifteen minutes okay and I had to wear sunglasses for two weeks\nOut show more you see\nThese are my natural I but I I ...\nYeah the little ... little well let me go rounds cause I don't say that all the time ... it's a seasonal thing oh no no it is it's a seasonal thing like the ... and my daughter who's gonna be turning eight years old this month she called them might Elsa eyebrows Disney movie frozen L yeah\nVery blond care well said blunt you know it's quite obvious it from being out in the sun or in the poor thing or another using like in February we're not going to see these blonde long you want in February hard to be very well we have a caller\nJune a hygiene a how are you I like that name\nWell thank you I Am I Am I calling a hair salon or an attorney\nBoth our you genetically yeah Madison as gorgeous is very handsome in genetic I think\nYou've called before and uh you know were politically incorrect will let her let her ask a question shoes me boss ... are you a single woman\nThat I could probably do better job on your eyebrows kill\nA minor math or you know I really I looked like a nail marks\nIt looked like an idiot I had to wear sunglasses for two weeks well we're in attorney\nYou can't you you need to professionals to ask\nAbout mad as the attorney I'm as I Know as you say how are you OK you good a generic I asked this question ah so what's your problem\nOn this cat she stabbed jak ...\nI actually lived through there so I got it for a year ago my daughter and my daughter now is the youngest daughter she's twenty five and I am now just starting to get my back child support and I was told that\nWhen my and reaches the age of sixty five and he starts to collect his Social Security so I was told that I can\nI'm a Social Security board and start collecting a certain percentage of my ex has a Social Security at all\nAnd not paying child support plastic ... percent interest is that correct\nEssentially yes but let me ask you if you question just to make sure so you say you already have a child support order in places that right\nWell I had a I I was going to get your attorney and I also have a court order and\nOkay so you have a court order requiring your ex husband to pay child support he's not been paying the debts accumulating um have you been working with the department of child support services at all\nI Know just ... it's a district attorney\nOr it's not the district attorney but I think it's what you're referring to the district attorney as the district attorney is actually the person who would be responsible for criminally prosecuting things should if I'm really a lot of crime and I didn't want to you that will let me let me give you an\nEasy solution and a free solution is losing if anybody in the entire county who has a child support in if they also have espoused support order can do and that is you contact the department of child support services and that is a public government agency and they will actually enforce your support order\nAt no cost to you so you can call them up and they can actually do more things than attorneys can do you can ask them about a lead being on the ah Social Security payments that you believe your husband is receiving but they can do more than that they can go in and actually take money out of his bank account\nThey can actually garnish is tax return and they can also even if you didn't have money they can start compelling his ... his performance by they can suspend his driver's license\nAnd they can take his passport and attorneys can't do that and this is a free service so okay\nSo if I don't want to do anything that harsh and if it they're taking it out you know about how that goes with the shore security board am am Senate shy would get\nWhat you're probably going to have to do is you're probably going to have to go back to the family law in court you have to file what's called the post judgment request for order and that's just a fancy name for a motion you're gonna have to file a motion with the court\nYou're gonna have to get a hearing date you're going to want to go in for what's called the determination of child support ridges because what you need is you need a set number as to what how many payments have been missed what the interest is there any penalties that go on top of\nThe uh the balance that's accumulated so you can have a hard number that you can take to Social Security or anywhere else or to a bank or to his employer or anywhere where you think he might be receiving money that they can then use to account properly for what you\nCan get like like right away and then all the current interests who takes care of that\nWell if you're working through child support services they actually will do it all for you know what he'll wire the money to your bank account so it's a great resource I really highly recommend you give them a call you'll get a case worker they can explain things to fairly clearly does that help you\nKnow it helps a lot further question yeah June a how long have you been divorced\nUm I think it for a city that's a good one a while and goes by so quickly\nWay me in the end is laughing things I'm going to ask you out for the guy he he does that to me no but but you said you know while Eighteen years\nWow how long you have a twenty five year old daughter\nDied but he never but you know what was interesting when I did the attorney said that and talked to so it's just I I mean the district attorney you know they gave me the choice that they were going to spend his license imply that or maybe\nIs that a ... I think they can go after professional licenses as well but the most be driver's life okay\nYou can go in and seek payment of your ... by the other side which is a remedy available under the law but it's not\nEasy and it's not always guaranteed right and there has to be assets or income there to make that payment\nAnd there's a lot of activity that goes on before the trial date right and absolutely or court appearance who you have to do a lot of front end\nWord it's very it's very different and most of what you would call it the litigation meaning the court proceedings that happened in family law case happened before the actual trial the trial is often the the end of closing act\nWhat sort of things do you have to get a clearing away\nSo the the most common thing is once somebody starts of divorced by filing a petition usually they're going to need some money to take care of their expenses because maybe they moved out and maybe they want to move out so they're going to need in order for spousal supporter child support but they can't wait one year or two years to get that they need that money now sure so that will be dealt with in a pre ... motion which we call the request for\n... so you mean if a woman is not to I'm employed and has no revenue stream a and then the divorce proceedings are starting or you can make sure that she will have some sort of a spouse's support to ... well that would probably be um adventurous and a lot of women who might be in that situation ...\nAbsolutely and um another thing would be child custody when two parents whether they've been married or not split up and have now two households\nHow is the child shared when is the child with mom when as a child with dad or parent one parent to it doesn't really matter um you have to have an order on that if the parents can't agree in the way to get that is by going into court\nDo they agree most the time or not it really it's really hard to say and sometimes it takes getting an initial order to get to an agreement\nMeaning you have to get some order that definitively gives time to one parent that the other one may not have been agreeable to and then at that point the schedule that the judgment of determined\nMay not work for the child and that incentivize as the parents than to work together and say okay the judge said you should have four days but I don't think it should be you know Tuesday here Thursday there I think we should just do it Sunday through Wednesday you know something like that wow wow really life are you listening\nTo Matt's murder Myrtle law dot com SMU R D a law\nDot com and some fascinating stuff here so now but Matt I'm not going to mention any names where you do you know you can go on the Internet\nYou know try to get a quick divorce but what you're talking to us about now we'll shoot which will happen soon yes what is the difference is it can you tell because people want to get a little bit of a warm and fuzzy which you can get from the others those guys warm and fuzzy feeling good services\nAre fantastic if you've resolved everything agree but how often do to people that are splitting up agree on everything not a lot\nNot a lot and like how long and how often do married people would\nNot allow to draw [laughter] the whole other than Debbie ... shoes you out of the perfect marriage failing us forward yes so ... so this this service\nWill help people who are kind of stuck without an agreement but need to move forward and need to understand what they have to do how to present themselves in court what types of things might be helpful to help a judge because really what it is I feel bad for the judges we have great judges in Los Angeles\nTony and they're really problem solvers they get presented they're the ones who have to fix this problem of people who don't have representation and they can only make rulings based on documents information and testimony that's presented to them so this helps people organize present\nGet get ready to for their day in court so they can effectively represent themselves if they can't afford a lawyer well not a substitute for a loyal make that very right understood subsumed dollar but it's better than nothing\nBut the cat just probably know you and so I Know you're knocking at your ... you're going to bring them something legitimate and you're going to have that kind of organized some topic culturally you're you're moving through the ... and they trust that and that's how it's really important to have a good reputation with the ... than right\nYeah I mean my God I was twenty times if I didn't ...\nThe judges yeah but but but he was in ... okay so now someone is going is preliminary staged embryonic stage of ...\nSo they're going to go to your website and metal men will be back and we will you know expand on this further so what is it like if we go on line ... fewer online business yes\nEven let's say it's me yes what do I want to why benefits by go you know

miss last week show there's always pod cast library opportunities where you can go in\nOn my website and get into the pod cast library on demand and listen to all three hours and three hours a week before that and so forth\nLast week we asked a question do you expect one of your children\nTo health care for you when your health fails in old age yes or no we ask that question because there was a big survey that discovered that three and four baby boomers with children expect one of their kids one of the children to help care for them\nWhen their health fails in old age and they don't have a spouse who can do this for them\nSo we asked that question do you expect one of your children to help you\nWhen you get old and frail and broken down in old age yes or no you voted and I thank you for making the effort to go to my website of Dr Bob dot com they give us your opinion of it here the results of last week's health poll question on that question\nOf those who voted\nSixty five percent of you said no you don't expect one of your children to help care for you when you're sick and frail in old age whereas thirty five percent\nOf you said yes you expect it and there you have it then age than I as I interpret that\nUh I Would ... you know personally I Would rather have a family member caring for me\nWhen I break town when I'm frail when I'm aged then a perfect stranger [noise] uh and the\nThe reason should be obvious\nBut apparently those people who voted no or just not getting that message somehow maybe there's issues in their family or they don't trust there or they don't uh want to burden their children maybe they think well I Want them to have their life too well wait a minute here\nWe took care of our children when they were small and couldn't take care of themselves and frail and a sick and the runny noses and the ... and all the other stuff\nNot that I feel like my kids are obligated to do this but I Would think that they would just naturally step up and I wouldn't want them to do that why because I Love them they love me so I was on the side of this I was on the minority answering side of this equation\nWho better to take good care of you that I loved one as opposed to a stranger and I I get it I get the other reasons why uh parents shoes\nOr in this case of those who voted sixty five percent the majority said no you don't expect him I Do expect him\nAnd I hope they do this for my sake as opposed to a perfect stranger who doesn't have skin in the game All right well thank you very much for participating\nIn last week's health poll that we
