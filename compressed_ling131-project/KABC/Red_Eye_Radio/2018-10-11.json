Injustice\nWhich I mean listen we sell T shirts here at the daily wireless have set up the shirts they have things like that don't care about your feelings which feels like something you'd want to advertise and feels like a relatively eternal message\nI'm not sure why you would buy shirt that says Supreme Injustice and then just be wearing it around like in two years anyone gonna know what in the world that T shirt means answer courses now but this is to take them Democrats they cannot let this go and if we don't let this go we will win yeah at the polls are showing so Jennifer wing or\nLike the New York times just this sort of tone drives me up and well how do I explain justice capital to my daughter's\nWell here's what you say justice Kevin I was accused of sexual assault back when he was Seventeen years old there was no corroborating evidence to support the allegation and we don't ruin anybody's life in this country based on just allegations without any corroborating evidence\nWill get it in two senses but here's what she actually right\nBefore he entered politics President Trump is a fan of different sort of spectacle professional wrestling and pro wrestling with this long running soap opera like storylines back heroes and villains faces in heels you don't win if letting your opponents Clemens and it turns out onto the robes hurl yourself on the body of your defeated both in our declared the winner\nThat was what Monday night's primetime swearing in ceremony a Brett Kavanaugh Supreme Court felt like\nWell set for the fact that he will actually sit on the Supreme Court and then decide cases it's just like WWE\nHey here's what she says with his wife and young daughters in the audience justice cabinet and they'd all the correct conciliatory noises going was red faced furious men of late September but his claims about dark money and Clinton funded plots gone was the man who alternatively weapon roared and looked as if he was trying to pass a kidney stone of compressed rage\nYou accused him of gang rape and if he had been robotic you'd have accused him of being robotic how do I know 'cause you did two days before when he was on mark on the calendar show\nAnd then and then here's what it said that the gloating crusted over the weekend on Saturday once justice Cavanaugh is a sure thing Senator John Cornyn pleaded out his ears for bread hash tag along with a picture of a glass of champagne Senate majority leader Mitch McConnell think the clowns who protested justice cabinets dissension and helped unify his party\nMany but he says that this woman says for the record the clowns the angry mob the violent protestors were the women who confronted elected officials in office halls and in elevators many survivors of sexual violence that same kind that Christine Blasey Ford testify change or they were trying to get the men and power to hear them and asked accordingly\nBut as I said that has nothing to do with anything\nI made the lead your story of sexual assault that does not mean that I have to bleed every story of sexual assault\nBut here's the beans meat ... what am I supposed to tell my daughters about all of this of course our you know I've been talking about it for years\nBe aware of your surroundings that makes sure someone knows where you are and when you look back to back don't drink too much don't put your drink down don't walk or run or by the same route don't ... don't walk alone ended are but I asked you out and you're not interested don't hurting feelings and don't laugh at him because of humiliated man is an angry man and sometimes angry men or women\nOr some of that I think is good advice just for anyone like walking alone in the dark in a climate area is I'm not drinking too much\nMakes sense right don't drink too much that stupid I've never heard this thing that I asked you out that you have to not hurting feelings like that that's a new one I haven't heard that one because frankly I Can't think of it do that I Know who haven't asked a woman out and has feelings hurt I Can't think of a single do the dishes that this has not happened do and\nNinety nine percent of do do go on to rape people and that's that's not actually a thing but here's what she says she says our girls will learn to police their clothes their words of renting their behavior their choices because they've been watching and what they've seen is that if you get hurt it's probably a fault not a single person says that\nIf you tell probably no one will believe you know a single person said that and even if people do probably nothing will happen not a single person says that either the conflation of\nI'm Upset about justice cabinet with America systemically unjust against women\nIs just it's it's absurd and its ally and I'm speaking as a guy with my own daughter and with three older sisters\nIts in its silliness but again the motivating factor for a lot left right now is raging they don't understand that that rage there's gonna be a delayed it back but the rage will blow back on them anger in the short term high and it's a long term low we'll be back at them out with all the\nLatest news on the

Anthony rouda LA county sheriff Jim McDonalds as deputies found rouda armed with a rifle after spotting this boot prints on the ground near Mulholland Highway unless virgin this road investigators\nThat one hundred and fifty five mile an hour winds and I think that was roughly if you take the diameter thirty five to forty miles are bad and it moves probably anywhere between thirty and\nThirty to forty or a depending on where it was a and I was trying to explain to people you understand this was like a forty mile wide tornado right right that's the one thing that people don't I don't I don't think a lot of people didn't understand\nIs the fact especially one that you know the winds and the outer eye wall in those areas you just knew and and I you and I had gone back and forth because of some of the coverage on the ah the the Weather Channel and um you know putting on baseball helmets and things like\nThat that Jim ... you know at one point put a helmet on and and by the way there was a smart move because I ...\nI went a lot about that I always said why you would think they would do that more often even Windsor Seventy miles an hour I Would if I'm Out there sure covering it with the the debris flying around\nBut uh you know and a lot of them are reporting from around the vicinity of of Panama City in ... and really what the worst was to the east ... uh uh you know a lot of them and and you just knew what you just said well you know it seems like if you're just\nCasual watcher you might even say well there's not really a lot of damage your well that's because I saw one of the meteorologists they had down near there\nAnd you know she talked to attend tour and they just said no get out yeah get out yeah we cannot report you cannot report from a place where you've got wins of a hundred and fifty five miles an hour coming in you that you can't do right which was a very I sat there I said okay that's a very smart\nMove right well that's it when you know I mean ... that tells you the the strength of this storm\nOr when the weather channel run for cover that is that's one indication that that you should do a you'd look at the number of people that are that stayed behind did not\nUh leave the area did not evacuate ah and you know of course our thoughts and prayers are all was with everyone affected by a storm and and and uh and others like it\nOr you know we looked at the uh the situation with with Florence we looked at the ... and and covering that\nAnd and the recent storms in Texas you and I mean go going back to a Katrina really and then a Hurricane Rita\nAh along the Gulf Coast and and and the storms I mean we have so much devastation I have a friend\nAnd New Orleans you know and talking about that you know people not coming back many of them moving to neighboring states like ours um and staying and saying you know there's you know there's I don't want to go back there's you know again if\nIf there is not going to be a that that long term rebuilding effort that is a in some cases permanent devastation\nOr you know not only the physical devastation but of course the economic devastation of of a region or like that my ah my nieces husband station right now going to school in Pensacola he's in the Airforce and uh I was checking in on them and they were you know they have a mandatory basically\nUh order to you know stay in the in a shelter and uh and stay there he's a he could not leave a but they had of course there on the base where he is a they had it set up of course to keep everybody sick\nOr that's you know again I was watching a couple of the storm chasers that were alive on periscope and and Facebook Live throughout the day\nAnd one of them had plans to stay or through the whole thing or two to give us much coverage as possible uh but uh he had already are in this building\nHe had a a huge sea meant stairwell that he was going to stay in a but it was the one in fact a drudge linked to to his coverage or that was that storm chaser but he actually showed everybody where he was going to stay within the stairwell and it was meant\nYeah I saw 'em and and so um do you look at the I guess the job of these meteorologists and and people and and and a news reporters that are that are out on these storms\nAh they often stay right there and their hotel is right there close to the beach in fact that's where the weather Channel's saying at this hotel that was right there on the beach\nOr in one of their locations and those were buildings that are likely a severely damaged although they are bigger buildings and can withstand a more damage than some of the other smaller buildings\nAre coming up here just a few minutes\nAfter the bottom of the hour we'll talk once again to meteorologist a meteorologist a Tom hale\nHe's been with us he was with us yesterday he was with us with a performance\nOr as well and uh and Irma doing coverage for many years in fact in his career on hurricanes we'll talk to him and John trout as well we'll keep us up to date on the latest uh as of right now Michael still hurricane yeah yeah ... Seventy five on our sustained with wins\nSo that puts it out a category one just just barely a and and we're expecting you and I are talking during the a crucial meeting and you were saying you expect a and I think most do or that the next report which comes up here and I'm In uh in forty five minutes or we could see that downgraded to a tropical storm\nAre still very dangerous uh you know if you think about uh the the uh a hurricane heard sustained winds of Seventy five miles an hour while they're not what the ... the storm isn't what it was in terms of its power is still dumping a lot of rain and then of course those winds are still damaging\nSo uh we'll get letters from Tom hale and John trout along the way coming up here and just\nThat we have an election coming up here in just a little under four weeks yeah um yeah breaking news uh and\nUh some of the polls out there some of the uh interesting a poll numbers up in the New York times yeah yesterday right well we'll get to that look at the CBS headline ... also coming up here on the show prominent Democrats reject taking the high road and as a viable political strategy that is yeah you know that's after Hillary Clinton\nAnd uh uh and then the more I got my like Cory Booker or none of the former attorney general\nOh I'm a I've got Eric Holder oh Eric Holder yeah coming out and saying if they go low kick them yeah ah and\n... and we you know said this yesterday in the day before a ... and as well we said the day before it looks like they're heading in that direction and yesterday was obvious that that's the direction that the mainstream now\nOf the Democratic party holds is that we're going to be it's gonna be instability it's going to be mop like tactics\nOr it's going to be getting in your face wherever you are it's going to be getting that on camera\nMhm uh in order to what to do it and then ah at you when you had Eric Holder going to the point of saying kick them that was really the first statement of using physical force against your political enemies they seemed to have no shame in at this is coming from not the fringe\nAs as recently as even a month ago remember we had to call and somebody called up and said well not all Democrats are like that and we said well your party is\nYour party and that this was really basically going to where the party is being controlled by the left ... uh but now when it comes to instability and getting in people's faces and wanting to film it\nAnd and getting to the point of terrorizing people with a with a mob yeah how 'bout mob terrorizing people matter where they are\nThat has now become a mainstream mindset of the Democrats if you're a Democrat\nYou know that this isn't again when CBS writes it\nYou know that even in the media are saying well what are they doing here what's the strategy right Hillary Clinton coming out and saying it Eric Holder coming out and and and and saying it and so here we go I'm\nRand Paul and his wife taking on a Cory Booker for his for his previous statements ... and I still have not heard one\nOr maybe you may have heard it one of the debates if they asked one of the senatorial debates I don't know I didn't see that but I haven't seen in any major publication where you have had I haven't seen any publication and make that clear I have it may be out there I haven't seen it where you had one Democrat come out and say\nStop this ... is this is ridiculous enough and as we've said when you when you think about it I I understand why\nThey're going there because wherever else was there to go either you were going to make the decision as a party\nTo do what they said after twenty sixteen was look we've got to go to the mid west we've got to go to fly over country we have to start talking to people we have to find out what they you know what their needs are either you're ... you're going to go in that direction\nAnd talk about the economy and talk about those things or you were going to say our bases radical left\nAnd we need to go radical left and so this is obvious and you know that they're doing this this is obvious that the mainstream of the Democratic party have realized we can't beat this site we act on that last week\nThere is no are you there is no road for them to turn around basically and come back\nCan say no at this point certainly that is going to be part of the ongoing investigation a homicide is working closely with the the rest of the team\nRoute a has a criminal history that includes burglaries and weapons violations he was booked for violating us role in his being held without bail K.

I mean you you almost want to give them the the Barry Bonds treatment just walk and every time but you know and\nAlso just give them a free base either so I think they just got to you know execute their pitches and and not miss over the place because he'll make a pitch that\nWhat is the strategy you think for the Dodgers I'm going into a the brewers going to Milwaukee and playing the brewers is defense may probably their main focus you you feel in this case\n[noise] ah yeah I think I think their defense is been kind of hit and miss at times of season um they definitely you especially rotates\nYou don't want to make a ton of physical airs on the field or or mental airs for that matter [noise] um\nSo yeah stokes the on the defense will be good but I think just trying to you know kind of stay within themselves and not go super crazy it's a plate and and kind of just take what the the birds started or giving them because they're they're not be\nThe hard throwing ... guys a lot of teams have these days they're more crafty so you've got to kind of just in that regard and ah as for the ... got to execute I mean ... they have clearly better starting pitching\nI'm with a Walker Mueller hungry as their top three so as long as they execute and they don't get themselves into trouble walks like we all ... came through that and I'll be as I think they're going to be okay\nThis run that Milwaukee's on obviously they've been a kind of the toast the major league baseball here recently by the bats obviously is going a lot of runs a guy like Ryan Braun who's been on this team for a long time we know he came under scrutiny several years ago\nUh for failing to drug policy for kind of being linked to steroids there and I\nWas like what does this mean for players like\nHim who whether it a lot of storms there been around the block more than ... being a part of this Milwaukee team we always see a team each year that kind of emerges we're talking about this before or whether it's a team who's really hot coming out at the end of the regular season\nWe always see a new team kind of emerged she wants to the post season comes around that we haven't seen a for a while so I'm just from huge analyzing the series we're starting to at least here Destin\nUm what do you think it means for a guy like Ryan Braun to be at this\nPoint yeah I think I think he's ... he's obviously enough player he was he's thirty four years old I'm ... not the guy he was a few years ago he's not the guy he was twenty love only won the MVP um\nPerformance enhancing drugs or otherwise um\nI I think it's good for him that he doesn't have to shoulder the load he's got guys like yell at each um Lorenzo channel is a big free agent signing childish on his ... or your each it thirty to thirty five home runs the season so he's\nKind of even though he's been pretty high up on the line up a lot of times which you know used to criticize gray councils for that but he's\nHe's the face of their franchise right now I'm or he has been at least ... you know almost decades so um it's probably it's probably\nA little bit of a relief almost that he's not\nTasked with carrying this often like he has been in years past\nQuickly on the American league are we in for maybe one of the\nBest league championship series in recent memory between Houston in Boston\nI I'm probably in minority on this I think Houston is going to smoke the Astros are the the Red Sox fast now\nI just yeah I don't see it with Houston or me with the red Sox if you're saying that um their starting pitching asset of Christ sale he's coming back from the shoulder source of the second half\nAnd he had around a little bit last year in the playoffs by the Astros so I'm not sold them their their starting pitching against Houston and they're both in his big kind of messy if he's turning it into a slug fest then I can see it being a a classic series but you're looking at more you know\nYou know you know ten twelve runs night total um you know it being a slug fest of the series but like I said I'm In the minority it will probably end up going seven games will be in classic I just\nI'm I'm kinda bearish on Boston right now\nDustin really fast who wins the Dodgers brewer series ... the Dodgers move on to the world series\nUh I've I'm taking the Dodgers in six it wouldn't surprise me if it went the other way if it went ... five or six or seven but I I just think the experience is going to play out here for the Dodgers and they're starting to pitch is going to be the main reason they take the series\nSo we've got dusting down for a World Series rematch which I think a lot of Dodger fans are kind of see clearly rooting for it yes\nAnd I I don't know I mean I I kind of want to eventually but you I guess by the callers in on the show I think tend to want that yeah so I can see I understand but at the same time I mean\nI'm not as confident and this year's Dodgers as I was last year the Dodgers and they lost last year so I'm not I'm not especially looking forward to seeing as a band seen them get beat by the ashes again in the world series should that happen\nFair enough he's ...

I don't see the other thing I did\nI I think that's what he is that this last year and they're not they do they really need him to be anything other than that I mean yeah he could get a little more aggressive but he's never going to be like a like you're never going to hound anybody\nRegret although I mean aggressive in terms of getting to the basket\nBeing able to be a presence on the floor well you can pass the ball and do all those things but when you got guys land Fifteen six seven feet off are you in just wishing you to shoot the ball and your air ball and that's the product is definitely part you know so you know I I just I just think that\nHe's got he's got some you can be Tim and at least not be timid out there at least take it to them and be a little bit more confident but I'm going to give them the benefit of the doubt listen he got a knee injuries coming off of that\nI understand all that but man I Would like to see a lot more but I think raised on is perfect for him for men to worship\nBack to your point about how this team stew needs a three point shooter could Josh heart potentially more into that player for them I mean not ideally but maybe in the interim\nI'll say that he he could but he's ... he's capable of putting up thirty a game a thirty points because we've seen in the summer league he's capable of doing that but I just think where you watch what's going on here I don't I Can't see that you know who I Am I'm looking at to be honest with you in their best three points you I think the best report shooter on their team\nRight now is ... that's the best one yeah I'll say that he's proven ... once you get what he's proven so caught up hope has\nBeen playing well I Love the way Lin Stevens has been playing a grass that's what I Want to see from lines up\nIt's not just this is not about scoring but last Davis it would take it to you you'll get to the basket anytime he wants but last year we can score he can pull that Fifteen flea jumps out he's very consistent with that he knows how to go drivel driving kick\nI Want to see a little bit of that from ... I Want to see that type of person who's not timid and look I think it's going to take some time look he's only a saw I must say sophomore he's a sophomore and in the NBA right now so you know hopefully it gets better\nLakers open the regular season one week from today up in Portland against the trailblazers Jimmy Butler made a a highly anticipated return today to Minnesota it was I mean he was ripping\nThe tables front office staff teammates during practice the guy he ... he got heated first off are you surprised she came back today you\nI Am surprised that he did come back because\nYou know Jimmy Butler to me look I don't know the guy like that I don't know him personally I just know that just things that have been reported that every place he's been it's been\nAn issue and to me if you're moving and jumping around teams ... I think you're the issue you're the problem that's fair you know and I and\nOh and so when I look at it now I mean look I'm surprised that he did come back I think he's just one of those type of guy that it's about me me\nEven though I heard an interview today is about teeming competitor and stuff like that I think he brings it to a whole nother level you know so uh and and what I mean by a whole 'nother level is that he\nHe puts himself in front of just being a competitor like it's about me\nLike you need me plug today like you said he played against for I I like the situation he played he proved to everybody he put anybody yet for other guys on the team that that weren't starters on the team and they scrimmage today and he guarded Carl towns he guarded away again and then he killed them and beat them all and said\nNo you need me but you know again it's about what me and you need me\nYou get what I'm saying that's what I don't like is is that part is what about it's not that you need me was about we need each other is that I Want to see that team camaraderie and so by him going all the way he did it\nI'll just say this I Love it because I Love the competitive now and he did prove a point like get your stuff together guys but calling out the gym the coaches tips been Tim as being on your side from day one since you've been with the bulls\nTip loves him and so you know but the rest of the guys yeah which is what he did his brother did was wrong calling them out and things like that town is just the guys just wouldn't be a team player but you know I'm I just I like\nWhat he did but I don't like to call him out of the ... of the gyms and stuff like that I don't think that we could do without it\nRight yeah speaking of ... I think he's in a really tough spot here I really do I just because look\nThe big thing for all last season for Minnesota was butler wants to be traded yeah we we've heard that a lot of ... a Friday Saturday and but the thing is is that\nIt it took Minnesota to the final night of the regular season last year just to get in the postseason they need to get back otherwise he's probably gone and although he probably needs butler to get back there at this point based on the other Oscars constructed ...\nI I mean talk about how he's been such a pain here recently they probably would be better off in the long run with out Jimmy bother with the problem is it's all about here and now for typical deceived and that's why he really I think it's caught between a rock and a hard place um I Would not trade Bodo and the other under any circumstances I really\nWell I think you know I honestly I think I Would train him because\nI don't want to call somebody who doesn't want to be a part of this organization and be a part of this team why because you're not going to buy into the system that were running here is just going to be more detrimental to the team you're going to continue to call out people in the media the players they're going to get the media's gonna continue to juice on that the whole year and the whole season um\nAnd it's just going to be a distraction and so why deal with distraction you know my whole thing is I Would train them I Would trade them and get something for him and try to get something for him but\nThe bottom line is that he's detrimental to the lock them is not what he does on the court Brett\nIs what he does off the court in a down the hall and that's the issue that's the issue that the and I'm thinking about the team and general now\nLike I said Wiggins\nAnd Wiggins in in uh in his town you know ... tells needs to step up yes but we're going to have and his brother saying something that was out of pocket ... that they shouldn't have said that\nHis brothers I have it on the team exactly doesn't make any sense [noise]\nHey tax winter passed away in a lot of people a Laker nation purple and gold and know about him kinda tied with Phil Jackson and the sense that the innovative to try and go often said when somebody championships for when Jackson was was Chicago now to hear what the Lakers Ninety six years old wow\nNinety six years old look the genius of running that try and go off and I don't know why a lot of people in the NBA don't we're now these days I think the Lakers even should be running it um you know I learned to try and go off and I know it inside\nAnd now I've coached at the high school level and um and we won championships running that triangle office I Love it I fell in love with that and I learned from watching text winter\nAnd Phil Jackson running and they lost all the Lakers so it's a great officer right man and a man I was just my condolences to him and his family in him but what alleging we basketball legend that we've lost\nA and men and will be missed tax when\nHe played college basketball at us said you know that one\nOh yeah ... usa played at Oregon State also junior colleges well started out his coaching career as an assistant at Kansas State way back in Nineteen forty seven\nAnd that lasted all the way up through two thousand and eight when he finished his career as an assistant with the Lakers yeah what a legend there I mean the NBA's had a lot of them over the years\nUm but this one I think ranks right up there I mean the innovator of an office\nMultiple championships so that people just do run they find it was not dead people\nAs a lot of things do sometimes they go out sometimes they come back we'll come back and forth\nWe're back at it tomorrow night same place same time last Thursday Night Football [noise]\nAnd everything else is going on in the world of sports and to then keep living the dream [noise]\nBehind the mind furnished by values media\nTalk\nHave easy\nOrange County cumulus station [noise]\nChanging storm women were Fishell charged Francis Michael's we can to a tropical storm as it moves through the south east forecasters say the system was one of the strongest storms to ever hit the U.S what it made landfall on the Florida Panhandle Wednesday with your own just bedroom ...\nAt his office and done the same thing I\n... [laughter]\nWe all know we all know the bias sure you know we did [laughter]\nAnd it it at least\nThere is somebody you know on MSNBC that recognizes it I Believe they all recognize it and you know this is as we've said many times and and and you had Republicans stating that really with no argument coming back from the Democrats which was\nExcuse me you had the process to do this\nYou had the process to interview her you had the process it existed already it's done all the time as Lindsey Graham made known that you could have kept her out of this and done an FBI back\nCheck and it probably over that month period done a more intensive background check then you could have even done in a week\nAnd\nYou could have kept her name out of it and then they asked her permission as to whether she wished to go\nForward with it or wish she wished to say no that's okay and it stays in the private record whatever evidence was gathered as it did already\nAnd it's never brought up again and her name is kept out of it why because everybody knows Scarborough knows his guess whenever they're liberals they know\nBecause it was never about attempted sexual assault it was never about doing what's best for the alleged victim\nIt was about one thing and one thing only using her\nTo make a political statement now is it right and we said this always back a and\nA lot of other media has said the same thing conservative media has said the exact same thing and now you got MSNBC said the exact same thing that that we have said all along that\nAnd and it's interesting coming from a somebody see the ... and Grassley had late that it would have been the number one story yeah again I Would have been that they would surely will be going after him today day in and day out the questions would never\nEver stop why is a but my first question is why as a Joe Scarborough are pretending to be on the right again [laughter] and it's something happen\nAt home ah [laughter]\nI'm just asking questions I'm just asking why should I like the question but a U.S we were talking about that in the ...

[laughter] just that's\nJust amazing I mean if you look at the the power of Michael as it came ashore a a Wednesday afternoon and something that we touched on yesterday during our program and that is the the because of that power because of that energy\nBehind the storm and grew after of course uh we got off the air uh the it it intensified that that means it's a longer lasting a storm so you're expecting Michael to still be a tropical storm a strength in terms of a ... when it goes back out over the water\nAnd reaches Ireland\nYeah yeah why why so [laughter] yeah well\nOnto our friends in Europe or you know um you can have ... does does that does that I'm On the water is warm enough that far north in the Atlantic to keep it going then yes no guy yeah\nWow yeah I I did I just assume by the time we got to walk Tobar and probably be cool down so I was surprised to hear that but there are still warming up yeah L and\nAnd and that's why we're having these storms and the you know the the normal hurricane season ends at the beginning of November right and so at this point there's a reason to that extent this is the fourth\nMajor hurricane that we've had in the month of October period and so yeah that's and that's simply a and it was unusual to have a major hurricane to begin with in October when you consider that there's been four of them total ...\nAnd and so and the last nine something that just sticks in my mind was and I can't remember which one of you said it well is it going to kind of lose some power as it comes into shore and\nAs a voice easier on the years in mind reads the stories to you well listen up for starters the print edition preferred by Ninety percent of votes your drivers is now available for free as an F.

I Wonder if there is pressure inside Congress I guess it's just pure speculation\nBut inside St look if you're going to do after we got to get the steel and aluminum done we're not going to do and we're going to do it let's get everything done and that's putting pressure on the on on the White House or the fact is yet you know having NAFTA is going to\nAt least stabilize the market with some good and bad\nAs we have gone through and we have gone through a a NAFTA because we do believe that if if the new NAFTA passes\n[laughter] it'd be trade agreement formerly known as NAFTA if it passes it's going to hurt the auto industry and it's not going to help the auto industry is going to make cars more expensive that's not a good thing now initially when you say it it's something that may not hit the market at that particular point\nYou know at at but when you take everything together the worries about regulation in the tech sector or all of a sudden the the you know the the fed or raising rates are the fact that the bond yields are going up again it's taken us taking us more interest money\nUh to to service the the the the debt\nAnd the possibility of the trade war with China where there isn't doesn't seem to be any type of conclusion and still a great uncertainty about\nA steel and aluminum tariffs and still and uncertainty whether you know Congress really hasn't there's been no indication from Congress or the leadership in Congress about\nThe trade agreement formerly known as NAFTA\n... well you mentioned now or the the terrorists and PG E taking a ten percent hit yesterday a and you that this is a very old company but talking about raw materials and the cost of raw materials and and so as you know there\nAre essentially they're manufacture a and and distributor of of uh of of coding and special material specialty materials\nBut that is also part of the auto industry so the the the car sales a the automobile sales\nHave or seemed to have stalled out for now or what's behind that are certainly you know that the cost of automobiles is going up and that is directly related to tariffs\nThen there's a greater demand for used cars when there's a greater demand for any group in terms of products that cost goes up so it it is it's a number of things that hit start to hit all at once\nAnd you go back to All right well how much of this is controlled\nBy either the fed or the federal government and how much of this has cost of government and right now you could look at ... and I think you could look well at interest rates ... and you see those two right now sticking out but everything that we just said here\nIs related to what government regulation ...\nEverything that we just and I didn't even think about that until you just said\nThere until you're ... wow everything is government regulation is so you can actually make the argument that hurt it irrespective whether it's trade agreement government regulation the fed rate you know ah on on interest rates are the the debt that with the debt that we have in service seen our our debt all of it goes back\nTo [laughter] in in some way a government\nA regulation and when we talk about the tech industry and what are they worried about government regulation so it all gets back to that\nWe said this before and you know look when we you know we've gotten into great debates and disagreements with the administration about ah you know their their policy on tariffs therefore or new label tariffs babies\nAre that the president came up with a but the look the in the real world you raise prices it hurts when the economy and the story right\nYou can sit there and go rah rah rah usa usa you can have all the chance you want but if you raise the cost of goods and services it always hurts and economy and hurts workers\nAnd just because you wish to chant or\nYou know just say America First doesn't mean America is necessarily first by the policy that you put in because you love the slogan slogans main nothing ... economics is related to how people respond to incentive\nIf you make the cost of goods more expensive it's going to hurt and economy not in my opinion it's the reality of economics and the story well\nAnd and again it is something that can be controlled through policy of this something that can be a tempered and and why do we want the ... why do we want to step in front of the progress that's been made that terms of you know well wait what are we what's been done\nBy the administration has done so much good that when they do bad that's going to we believe hurt them ... because I don't believe\nThat a Republican\nIn the United states can handle a bad economy as bad as they ... a Republican president can not handle bad economic news as well as a Democrat I Can't tell you why but it's just the reality above I got rid of Obama got elected for a second term there was nothing moving in the economy\nRight\nI don't believe Republicans can survive a bad economy especially if you look good economy and then it goes down over the next two years and what is it what it was the first couple of years\nI think at that point almost all Republicans in this day and age are much more vulnerable because Democrats cell that better than Republicans do\nYeah uh you know you see that the interest rates rising and the you know any kind of slow down in in major sectors\nThan you you put those together ... the housing sector at the at the toward the end of of or I guess getting close to the actual fall out of the subprime mess the fed was raising rates\nSo

has plenty of energy or what are we looking at a I Know we're a scheduled to get an update or within twenty five minutes or so\nBut yeah the last update has it at sustained winds right now at roughly sixty miles an hour I'm guessing we can expect and then that report that to decrease\nI Would think so too drunk to probably fifty if that um it may still maintain itself but I think a ten mile an hour drop as reasonable\nAlthough it looking at it and radar and just kinda clocking it I I I don't think it'll drop more than ten miles it might pick up a mile and forward speed gone to the north east it may be Twenty one miles an hour and I said earlier predicted it would accept the United states at about twenty three to twenty five miles an hour [noise]\nUm but that's not going to be until it gets up into Virginia want but for the exits outta here yeah um\nYeah it's a uh it it it's an incredible storm it let me give you a little kind of a broad overview\nOkay along the coast and the outer banks they're gonna see storm surge from the storm and the Carolinas two to four feet that's water inundation rice and then you can at high tide waves which could cause some problems it's not the biggest one there then it will be another one not the biggest one\nIt will be feed her band soon we'll be talking about the potential for tornadoes\nNow these tornadoes and the feeder bans the feeder banter coming in from the eastern moving off to the west so that kind of curbing from southeastern northwest and the bans have individual storms at 'em and they're moving out of about forty miles an hour now those individuals store\nAnd ... are capable of brief spin a tornadoes\nIn the individual super cells and as we get into the afternoon those storms will be heating up in the afternoon maximum heat and that's going to happen primarily over the Carol North Carolina's where you're going to see that the greatest potential for\nTornado activity but it's a wind and so whether it's a to an addict wind\nOr it's a sustained tropical force winds to forty to forty five miles an hour\nIt's going to do damage and a lot of that damage is going to be treated damage and it's got to be in North Carolina because what's going on in North Carolina or what has gone on his Florence and so it's saturated soils and so these trees that we've noticed that most of them because of the wind have been\nToppled over we've seen a lot of root ball photos right\nOn on television mhm so\nBoom overcome the trees now what are the trees hit the power lines\nBingo so we got the trees hitting power lines and we currently have seven hundred and thirty five thousand customers now that's they count customers is homes right\nOkay multiply that by two assuming there's only two people affected by every home and we know that numbers low and\nAnd you're already a one and a half million people already without power\nAnd that number is going to grow as it gets into the Carolinas and I think\nThe next big numbers for power outages are going to be in the Carolinas during Florence between the Carolinas they had over seven hundred and fifty thousand power outages and I think this is capable of of if not repeating it at least bringing in another four to five hundred thousand customers\nYeah and so we're going to get a will get over the two million mark on on people affected without any kind of power and\nThen you have the question they were staging people for power\nIn Pensacola and just draw circle around from Pensacola around this whole area or thousands of power of of trucks utility trucks right\nAnd they're going to go into the area say can get into first so maybe the Carolinas Georgia and so forth they are going to have a better shot at getting power even though they did stage I Believe the number was up to Nineteen hundred power trucks uh around the Pensacola area and around the panhandle", "show_name": "Red Eye Radio", "station": "KABC", "day": "11", "state": "CA",
