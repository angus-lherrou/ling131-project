free speech here's what it's at first it says in the report that users are asking if the openness of the Internet should be celebrated after all and they say that free speech has become a social economic and political weapon\nThey say that the early free speech ideals or the Internet where utopian\nThey even pointed out that maybe they shouldn't be considered a platform anymore I said is on the program before ... essentially admitting they might in fact the publisher not a platform\nThe breathing from Google identify several factors that allegedly eroded faith and free speech the election of Donald Trump and the alleged Russian involvement is identified as one such back so basically Democrats brow big rally to Google into believing that they are responsible for allowing free speech and Donald Trump being president\nBut the most important thing appears on the age of sixty six through sixty eight net racing argues that Google Facebook YouTube and Twitter are caught between two incompatible position first ... it'd be an mediated marketplace of ideas\nLike that would be the free speech tradition of the United states and second he well ordered spaces for safety instability which would be\nThe publisher space right this will be done in determining what sort of conversations we all have they say at the American tradition prioritizes free speech for democracy not to Billy the second tradition is described as the European tradition which favors dignity of liberty and civility over freedom\nAnd then the briefing conclude all tech platforms are now moving toward the European tradition\nThat scary stuff that's very scary stuff and that is political correctness come to life\nThat is all your social media companies siding with the woke let that most Americans don't like saying we should shut down ideas we should redirect people's eyeballs we should move people tortoise ability that we want and we will defined civility civility may not include your viewpoint\nIs this dangerous dangerous stuff and it's one of the reasons why we should all be very wary of these massive social media companies that seem to be targeting specific political points of view now I Do want to talk a little bit about the situation\nWith regard to Jamal shaggy he is a columnist or was a columnist for the Washington Post is missing since entering the Saudi conflict assemble last week\nThe Turkish police allege that he went into the consulate and that he was then murdered by these by members of the Saudi constantly the basically the Saudis brought in Fifteen people like ... to go into the conflict kill this guy just remember him and then bearing him the Saudi Government is still denying foul play\nThe Turkish government has provided specific evidence there's video ... entering the consulate and they provided the names of Fifteen Saturday agents and it says flew to assemble in pursuit of him the Saudis have issued blanket denials but this is raising some very serious issues for the United states because the United the Trump Administration has been very close to crown prince Mohammed bin Salman\nAnd that's because Solomon has been treated as a reformer he's somebody who supposedly wants to move away from some of the fundamentalism Saudi Arabia he's been involved in the creation of an anti Iranian alliance in the middle east United States is heavily funded the Saudi Government in their fight in Yemen because the Saudis are basically having a proxy war with Iran in Yemen\nAnd so this has raised questions because ... was a legal residents in the United states is has raised questions about whether the United states ought to punish the Saudis by withdrawing support for their for their arms you should stop selling the weaponry for example\nThe reason that this is the day the issue is not because we should keep providing them arms on a more level there isn't it the ... is because there is another party at the table Mediterranean government which is an actual terrorists government and the Turkish government is much more warm with uranium and they are with the Saudis the Turkish government right now is holding a U.S pastor and presidents and none of these regimes are great\nBut it does provide the Trump Administration with the choice choice number one and basically slapped the Saudis on the rest pretending nothing bad happened twice number two is to basically downgrade the Saudi relationship with the United states over all of that\nTo suggest that the choice doesn't have ramifications or that it's easy it's misread the nature of global politics\nMy tendency is to say that if this happened you have to downgrade the shouting there's no way around it you have to withdraw armed support for the ...\nAnd they have to be punished because this cannot be allowed to go on by my American ally it's just awful this outage but the United states in this position geopolitically and also obviously a lot more awful but it sounds like a murder and the guy because he was a dissident at the consulate in Istanbul it's just just terrible just terrible\nBut we won't be back tomorrow with all the latest breaking into the

I was talking because the cameras were were on ... ... is doing this because the cameras will be on ... as long as he's doing this but they don't get it\nWell the uh the the the token or a comment let me just to get down through here some of the the different uh uh headlines assault on our White House that came from MSNBC [noise]\nYeah that I and I will tell you that I did like uh I did like a a that one ... um that the Trump is\nA\nExploiting a mentally ill person\nOkay that also came out yesterday um\nAnd what was the the uh and the other one you know that you've basically who's being controlled by\nYou know white supremacy ... the white supremacy that is controlling you basically you have the master and the slave ... what you have that analogy was also made ... uh uh uh yesterday the one thing the left can tap\nIs somebody of the status of Kanye West in popular culture not endorse everything that they do yeah uh as I said tiny West is not a a a Walter Williams or\nA a a Mia Love or even explaining things the way that you know ...\nA he's a rap star ... he's going to be all over the place has he has been a has been all over the place\nAnd his politics that's not the point it's not the point is not what\nThe point is not dissecting\nThe uh the ... the legitimacy or accuracy of the specific economic and political\n\n... G of Kanye West ... it's the fact that he's in a room with Trump complimenting them and it ends there and so at that particular point and we said this for the longest time before a lot of other shows were saying it\nAnd that the\nUh the liberal elite and the liberal black leadership in this country\nA believes in the bigoted and racist idea\nThat all blacks must think alike and\nIf you don't think alike you are not truly black\nYeah that's it yeah\nThey don't have to go much further than that and that's what you were seen uh yesterday\n... look I'm [laughter]\nAnd the more attention you give a Kanye West ... he's he's always out for publicity he's making the headlines then it's not even about a tour\nOr a song when does he not made\nHeadlines the ... the whole point is is that's why he does kid rock was an afterthought mhm he was there yesterday apparently they asked him a question right yeah reported it and didn't like the answer well and at some point what where do you what age do you drop\nKid [laughter]\nI I'm just asking questions I like the guy\nBut you can't call them rock 'cause we already have raw [laughter] see [laughter]\nIt started out I never thought about that when I was a kid [laughter] starts out well meaning and then how do I have a career at sixty\nYes exactly you know kid rock ... not so much anymore or so ... ... ... ... it could be has a kid rock\nI'm not sure if you have you on the air one time you know I was in ... when he first run almost like\nOh come on in the nineties I can ... and then I uh\nI uh\nWas behind the music to the biography of his life ... and you see how hard he worked\nTo get where he got ... that he had not right as you see how awkward and I went oh you know I have a completely different opinion of him and it was just you know your little prejudices you every kid rock\n... having a kid and is it uh but uh\nFor um you know yesterday again this is now I'm I'm not going to spend five hours are going over the economic and political philosophy of Kanye West\nHold on let me tell staff had guys or cancel all that stuff that I wrote down for the next\n... yeah exactly uh but because because you don't need to go that far all you need to do is he likes Trump therefore to the left he's not a black he's not truly black ...\nWhether you have this about me alive so not meal yet you know and and that's but that's the backward thinking that's that's that's right\nThat's the bigotry and in tolerance\nOf the left today it's the racist mindset\n\nTo the point where you know coming up with the analogy the Trump is the master and Tanya is the slave shouldn't really tried to convince America of that you're going to you're going to try to convince a millennials up that you're right\n\nThey ... a west in his mind used himself as a slave really now\nBut this is this is the what's great is that they're actually proving ... right in there from their behavior this is Ben and it\nSo maybe we will spend some time talking to both the accuracy of the ideology of God yeah he was\nWhat I mean you know in the past talking about you know why can't someone just a decide they you know or or for whatever reason or you know they why can't they think this way\nDoes it matter who they are we've been saying that for no ages and it doesn't matter who they are we we talk about um Hollywood conservatives\nAnd you and I both know some that and I haven't seen where they've come out you know and you know I'm back in the day on Jay Leno or or whatever over the years um uh and and claim to be a conservative some have\n[noise]\nBut I I Know a a couple that that are have not uh as far as I Know and\nSo I'm not going to you know I'm I'm not going to talk about who they are in it that really doesn't mean anything or it's just the fact that they know what James Woods has set it that's why he better just\nTo hang it up yet you hung out and and and\nRetire we'd go play some poker if he's pretty good at that but um and and be able to issue his opinion than to have to walk on eggshells around people 'cause he wasn't going to get hired you know he knows that that more and more you're not going to get hired\nUm Kelsey grammar talked about it openly on the Tonight Show one time just said look I mean you can't be a conservative in Hollywood and expect you're going to be treated the same I'm paraphrasing but that that was his message on that night and it's true\nWell why is that the site that preaches tolerance has none no\nAnd that's that's what you saw yesterday so we'll get to more of that coming up your latest election polls are Arnold apologizes for using the phrase girly man\nYeah listen I we still talk about Caitlin 'cause I don't know where did you go with this I just want everyone to know the I'm Sorry about that\nI Do a ...

gentle by going to the front of the dot com [noise]\n[noise] okay [noise] Los Angeles orange\nMueller station\nKABC news is live and local law at eleven o'clock I'm Jeff with all of a man was shot during the confrontation with four or five young men in Culver City around four pm today\nPolice say the man was shot in a parking lot at Jefferson Boulevard and Machado road and was taken to a local hospital with non life threatening injuries\nI well they were just I'll ... I'll Sean Jeffrey was just killing them today I mean I mean deep balls either deep balls Brad throwing in a secondary in hairs couldn't stop it yet apple a\n... year apple ... they need to really move on from those guys it's just not working I worked for a couple of years now with that secondary they don't get much pressure out front either most of the time on a consistent basis they made that trade for Alex Ogletree from Iran's and the off season and\nThat would have been a good trade if they were like a player away\nOr something like that to kind of filled out linebacker spot but it hasn't really panned out because there's needs all over the place so many holes in his name\nAnd you look ahead of their schedules coming up you know they got the falcons that's going to be a tough oh yeah ... ...\nIn Atlanta that's going to be a very took the risk is looking in the balance back well that's a great bounce back gangs of gifts giants\nYou know the ... games you see I don't even know if they can beat the forty niners the way they are playing as you and I got to go down there to to up north to go play them in San Francisco so when you look at this team you just you know they just keep thinking and they keep sink in and they keep thinking and it's like\nYou sound like we had said I said before numerous occasions they just don't know how to get out of the situation again household names but not quality players and that's what they have the guys that can put fans and the fans because they want to see him but the bottom line is they're not getting it done and not putting the Wu besides those games\nAnd so you got to really go back they got to like you said they have to go back and really rethink what they want they want to do with this team and this heart I I think they got the uh top the gym and that they got separation issues that's what I think it is is like oh deal has great catches or he does he's a big play maker\nOr he lie manning has won two Super Bowls with his why why why don't we stick with him you know and then you got Shirley are saying look we're going to stick with the lie realistic with him he's came out of the post game he says he's going to stick with the like why are you know why because they have nobody\nTo back him up or anything so they have they're stuck with him\nYeah and in my opinion it comes from the top down I think it comes from the Mars I think they want you lied to start while he's there I mean especially I think\nThey thought that really they kind of embarrass themselves last year when when the ... new situation was going on when he was the head coach and how he actually benched you lie if you remember for that game in Oakland last year because his grand plan that week was to start\nDavid ... for some reason he thought David as well I was going to help put them over the top obviously I was a complete disaster so I think the Mars were embarrassed by that and and they've somewhat tried to make it up to ... cents and probably rightfully so because you I was very classy last year and a handling that difficult situation when they went to and fourteen\nUnder Mac do but nonetheless at this point it comes a point in time obviously where you have to evaluate the town and the players as they are not how they used to be\nA but I don't think that's going to change of why you like they're going to be there as long as he wants to be there and when he retires that's when they're going to make the change but Keith I'm telling you they're going to have to draft the quarterback and twenty Nineteen 'cause if they don't and if they wait and to maintain decides to retire and one or two years from now a dirt they're going to be screwed for\nMaybe five years or so because they're not allowing this team to re booty itself and to get new players and draft players getting worked into the system\nReally they are going to have to make a big decision now also you're talking about the gym the front office there I Know get 'em in was battling um some off the field issues as far as taking care of his health and things like that I'm not sure where he is at this point in time\nUm and and more than moving forward with that so to your point are probably not on the same page for more reasons the one right now they're in New York yeah but they got a long way to go and and the crazy thing is is how the ... not very good right now and arguably they might be one of the worst teams right now in one of the weaker divisions\nAnd the ... and I want to say just as before we go to break is that oh the back of his antics that he has on the sideline things like that\nIt's not helping the team and he knows no shape or form you know it it seems like when he was going off\nBut he was trying to hide the team up like come on guys was go\nBut that shouldn't have been done in the beginning of the game you should have been I really love them the day from from the start knowing you're\nThirty one to four thirty one to six they're all back or you know it's it's totally backwards you know so you know you you they can't get themselves in holes like this this was horrible they literally got wiped off the floor from start to finish they didn't they might as well not even showed up to the game [laughter]\nYeah right I mean yeah it's it's crazy\nIt was ... you mean I hear I Am I'm not even a giants fan but I'm watching the game and I'm pulling for I'm thinking like well give us a good game you couldn't even give your fans a good game\nThat's the thing that's what really baffles me bothers me a lot as you got these people are paying all this money to come see you play no deal you're getting all this money but you're not making plays me totally ripping off the giants organization I'm Sorry\nYou are is

behind the my branding keep hanging out we're now joined in Studio former Los Angeles Laker Corey Brewer a you've had a great career Corey and um I Know now you're I kind of trying to um continue to move things along Kia how are things going these days first off\nI'm sure it's been working out a\nOf Spanish and looking for a chain\nOf course you know what's what kind of work out how those workout pretty much how\nI was growing up and do a lot of shootings I got to be able to shoot the plan today's NBA and so I've been doing so whatever Jamie shooting in managing because\nWhat do you make about the current status in the league right now where things are at obviously you have the powerhouse in Golden State doing their thing year and then you're out a lot of moving last couple of years of players kind of jumping from team to team you have like these mega teen starting now um what's your take on that and and we're the league is and where it's kind of evolved from\nIs totally different from when I first came in back in two thousand seven but um as great right now you know the leaves evolving were overseas is everywhere global\nBut I'm chains like doors or or power of what you are but you've got some good things you've got the Lakers are going to be good this year um got Philly is a good young gene Boston so it's\nGoing to address and what's the biggest challenge you\nFace saying what\nBeing in the NBA I'm probably out of traveling and we have a family 'cause I'm a little bit too little boys so the travel and stuff for your family but I'm the best job in the world\nDid allow you to kind of reflect on like your personal life when you're currently in between teams in kind of you know reevaluate everything that's going on and maybe does that help you to kind of go into like the next chapter of basketball or whatever else may be coming down the line\nOh for sure your gender you understand what it's like not to be able to put it best where every day you know for me I have a family so just to be ... to see my wife every day for good but I Do want a job\nWith that I mean if you look at it\nHow do you play college one writer put any off\nSeen on with their families or mark okay whatever the case may be but what how much time even after she was over just work out how you doing this\nAnd you take a you got to have some vacation time spent time with your family but then after a few weeks a month or so you got to be right back at it so it was going on in the morning at work and you're damned for a couple of hours you gotta live and you know for me I got to shoot for going back and shoot him again so you put it in his own\nYou got\nNo question we're talking with Cory brewer here on behind the Mike ABC Radio\nThe Lakers right now we know obviously all the talk also about LeBron joining team rightfully so\nUh but there's a lot of other guys to like a young guy guys we're going to play a role positions this year ah what is it like to kind of play um you know side to side with somebody superstars in the league a number one can be intimidating and then to uh how do you kind of try and find your role\nI play with them James Harden which is one of the funniest film stars play with a player Russell Lewis wrote\nA book or the other great but I'm the young guys and the Lakers are going to be good and the Bronx man but bringing it was going to be really good when my favorite players got ... was really good in laws or if he's healthy um who's gonna show people are getting really is and I think they're going to be a tough famous you're\nPlanning is playing with ...\nA with a okay she thunder I'm In the policy of words over there now\nWhat is that like playing with how competitive we talked\nHe told his competitiveness was and that he's a very\nHeavy of your job of anger and he's in his in his eyes but what is it like playing somebody like him in James and James Harden as well to\nRaise the SARS ...\nOn that it was great for us discuss like you say so competitive and he wants to win so but and every night he goes out there and give is all so he gives a chance to win\nSo for me it was just oh man this is amazing just go out there and play my role and do whatever I could do the same and same with James James is different is if they have different games and the rest of the hundred hundred miles an hour all game like never stops and James is more you know he's smoother at other still bags um it's a different type of game\nSo but they're both great they're both everybody goes\nYou talked about James Harden I'm specifically with him but we know heated MBP type of player you won it last year or what is may be missing from maybe not his game necessarily but on the Houston Rockets to kind of take that next step this season and when you can see\nFrom what I could see them you know last year that a great chance if Chris doesn't get hurt 'em anything can happen and this is not going to have a chance to go to the finals but um I think they just got to come out and play the same where they play leisure and try to get old home\nUm guys go step although they mellow is going to be use everybody's and going to be you know if it's going to be tough for him but I think Chris and James going to help them feel more comfortable and the slogan\nWe know we got that power houses right now in the west with Golden State than Boston looks like they're a young powerhouse potentially in the making\n'em there's been talk about receding potentially whereas versus instead of doing on the ... conference you just do one through six seen throughout the NBA Adam Silver it's kind of hinted at that or would that be something that you would like to see perhaps them because there's a lot of talk obviously about how making it more competitive that potentially would be what's your take\nUh this is going to be a great time um for us in all the families can enjoy in uh enjoy is talk sports which would be great I'm a gimmick site\nThat this Saturday five to six right outside the coliseum or on the behind the Mike act\nYeah big thanks once again to Korea brewer for joining us that great to chat with hands out everything going on in his life right now and the world of basketball I Want to get into this story about genius Winston in regards to video the promo video that the bucks released today you might have seen it\nAnd it's kinda weird because it looks like a a promo video for a quarterback more who'd be suited for like Drew Brees yeah honestly a guy who's been around a long time who's accomplished a whole heck of a lot\nWhere it's kind of the opposite right now for Winston I don't understand why they're so in love with him and I guess from the standpoint of they\nDon't want to be wrong with with the draft selection and they want to think about that is being successful and I know dirt cutter is somewhat going out of his way to say that look Jim is Winston is going to be here way after I leave yeah well I I I don't get it they are they really promoting him they wanted him to be the quarterback they really want him to succeed so bad and to be a part of what they're doing down there\nWell if you look at it man look what he's getting paid just signed up for your due for twenty five dollars that's a big part is All right when you're getting signed that type of money\nYou know you're pretty much stuck with them and you're saying that's what we're going to go with you know so you know they don't want to waste their money of course and\nI I don't know Jay was just really tradable because the ... off the field issues you've had I don't think a lot of franchises will want someone like him you know so you really are stuck with somebody like him and look\nFix Patrick hasn't you know the fits magic so to speak\nHas really dissolve that's no more you have and it's more like a lawyer his point yet it's done so you know you just go back\nTo the guy who ... basically you pay a lot of money for and um is gonna be the face of your friends are it obviously them doing that promotion uh video\n[noise] pretty much tells is that's proven or putting putting to pretty much telling you that what\nJames is our guy so I think that's really what it is rather just look he's not tradable he has a month to fill the issues and we signed a deal for for for years twenty five million with a including a signing bonus for sixteen million\nYeah he signed it through twenty Nineteen contracts signed a couple of years ago when he was Twenty one out of Florida State has a rookie obviously and this year it\nBasically he's um [noise] the base salary this year for him in twenty Eighteen is five hundred eighty thousand dollars but that's including a three million dollar roster bonuses while yeah it's a capital over seven million for the box is what they're looking at\nUm he's not going to be a free agent will be under ... restrictive free agent in twenty twenty so they're committed to him at least three twenty Nineteen unless they can somehow find a suit or to take him on and believe me there would be a team\nIf who'd be willing to take him on forget that there will be a team I'm I'm Talking about the Buffalo's of the world they stick out um maybe Arizona as well although\nYeah Josh Rosen Josh ... and he does within flashy you know you got to look at look you know who needs some help out there we just finished talking about them the giants you know can\nCan ... if if the guy at the personality of him to\nIn yeah that's true but I mean look I mean we need to restructure new quarterback a new phase\nTo the team I mean you access situation there and I think he can go I mean look not only you can go all through all the quarterback started going right now and there's many a quarter back like you said that\nHe can go fit so we're both James probably needs to be somewhere in a ... was it like in a small town type of our deal he doesn't need to be really in the big city like you said\nNew York is a big city you can you know he'll just getting to a lot more trouble so\nYou know he needs to be somewhere small so I don't know but look the blocks are stuck they're stuck with them they're stuck with them so they're going to go with them um I just want an interesting to find out what the team feels about that because\nThe Sean Jackson for one was leading I'm leaving the league and receptions at one point in time and now that's kind of that's going to fizzle out you know I don't think James can do is he doesn't do a lot of long balls like that were accurate were late fits was doing\nAnd so you know we'll see we'll see though is these coming back is following week they had to buy this past weekend so\nYou know you have time to get some reps in and hopefully they can get in sync and he can move forward but he's definitely needs to prove\nTo everybody that fan base that coaching staff the team that look you didn't make a bad decision by bringing me here\nYeah and apparently they love them as far as a first first guy in the building a last guy to the gym type of thing we've heard that um to exhaustion at this point I was from within that organization\nAnd um yeah ... ... a apparently they're again they're they're really trying to shape payment as someone who with the uber incident\nHappened two years ago doesn't excuse it by any stretch imagination I don't think so at all and that they're trying to dismiss it as it was a long time ago but you're you're gonna have a hard time convincing a lot of people that he is somewhat a change person from that I don't think it would surprise anybody we see another type of event and he's a long history of those events\nYeah it just seems to troubles just seems to fall on his lap and hopefully that's not the case over he learned from his ... but we've been saying this over and over again I'm sure they've been preaching the same thing to I'm hoping you learn from this\nBut you know is eventually those situations I ended up biting you and right now I think for him he has to build a whole character is a character issue with him his character is being questioned and\nYou look at it the fan base there they are not to accepting of him right now to be honest she has to win them over it's going to be tough and how you win them over is winning games that's the bottom line because still fitzpatrick remember they wouldn't be in the position they're in right now if it wasn't for foods\nYou know those games he's won the habits they count somewhere in the Sean Jackson scored a touchdown and things like that remember\n... when they brought me he wasn't score no touchdowns now he is the receiving corps is very happy with with it and so now you step in step back into the limelight\nYou got to prove to your teammates that look I'm going to be a leader I Want to leave the team you got to go back to that back to the drawing board for James Winston just personally for him\nQuickly I Want to go back to the Thursday night game we talked about what it means for the giants what does it mean for the eagles now look we we said how the NFC East is fairly weak compared to some of the other divisions very favorable for that moving forward and I you know I I think there'll be fine it they needed to win tonight\nThirty point type of an effort ostensibly kind of you know dust out the ... say with with went anything left over from him coming back from injury that he was still kind of on short it looked like he got a lot of that kind of taking care of the night again it's a mistake that they're playing better off offensively with a guy like al Sean Jeffrey coming back in there it's a big big help for them once\nThey got to help brat that yeah that I I think I got to help this this week\nYou know line blocked a little bit more they ran the ball a lot more this time or Cory climate did a great job and it really that was the question is Jay a dry when he went out who's going to step up and be that guy and be honest with you small would Corey climate\nUh they all stepped up you know join in math used after ... passes so you know I think it was a collaborative effort team effort it was a team win and so they basically are showing that look we are the Superbowl champs\nYou know we are and yes people questioned the as the thinking we're not going to do well and this and that will look\nWe're showing you though we're still years day our seasons not going anywhere so you know look there's still the cream of the crop of the in the NFC\nCan any I can either Washington or Dallas challenge them and that division because like the giants at this point probably not at one in five\nI think the Washington Redskins can positive anybody is not going to be dollars but if any if there's anybody looking child you know there'll be Washington\nYeah it I don't I don't think that the race is over yet by any stretch again the eagles I think are are back in in a good spot here in first place temporarily ah but yeah I think there is to some some things to to be settled on that division as we move it along tomorrow night friday night show for fall friday plenty to get into his we'll preview all the Sunday games in the NFL\nWitness some college action as well as some college games this weekend Washington at Oregon you've got Georgia LSU list goes on and there's

is not going to happen\nIt will be Medicare for some do expand I've I've set for a long time I think former president Brock Obama would be very happy if all that was left behind of Obamacare was the expansion of Medicaid he would call that a when\nHe got what more than that because the rank and file Republican didn't want the the benefits to go away and and Obamacare\nStill in place you know something up and just didn't get a lot of coverage I'm so glad you brought it up and you talked about Medicare for all and I really don't know how many people\nActually say that but it is something that you were promoted did you hear Trump's response ... Medicare for all mhm well then you're going to destroy the system for old people oh sure yeah I went whoa I mean that was a ... a that was a great\nPolitical responds oh the ... from our product from the president I went whoa mhm my Medicare for all the new kill than than you are destroying Medicare for old people because we can't pay its are you going to be taken from them and it was set up for them or not for not not for the rest of America\nIt was set up specifically for them you do it you heard old people ... that was well and I thought that was a great political age I think it's a\nGreat response\nRemember when when they were talking about slowing the rate of growth this was Paul Ryan slowing the rate of growth of Medicare they were uh they depicted him and ads as wanting to kill old people\nBut which site is it that says\nPeople should go home and die\nWe're not gonna you know afford all the technology and medications were going to send you home so you can die that was Robert Reich ... almost verbatim what he told Berkeley years ago and the former president Brock Obama again saying the same thing\nThey don't care about the fact that\nElderly people will suffer if you if you give Medicare for all first of all you can't pay for it but I imagine you could pay for even part\nOr half of it again pure fantasy\nBut what would happen ultimately because you can't afford it it is going to affect the benefits of the ...\nAnd\nThere's ... there's no way to debate that the question is does elect care about the old well Brock Obama and and Robert Reich ... one of his advisors a and a labor secretary for Clinton\nKnow old people should go home and die that's the way they thought so maybe they don't care I don't think they do but ah Schumer needs to say it right\nWe we found

burning and to quote\nBut\nAs the more rights than not that piece of the New York post who is the political party who is the country and who under what President\n\nHas reduced greenhouse gas emissions but most when it comes to the substance who has actually reduced greenhouse gas emissions who is number one\nWas a candidate nope no nope Germany nope Australia nope France no\nThe one country that pulled out all the phony Paris climate accord reduced its carbon emissions by half a percent the most of all major countries in the world\nThe\nSo the rest of the ah the rest of the countries are joining homes United States has now when I joined the group because they're signing up there because there's ... there's they're signing things were actually doing things and why what's the main reason why the United states has done it\nFracking racking\nFracking fracking fracking fracking fracking fracking fracking so the people that actually\nVoted in a way\nTo get the substance of how we go after our energy that actually voted\nFor the policies that made it so we can produce energy\nWith lower greenhouse gas emissions which has nothing to do was signing the international agreement but everybody is cheating on and not getting to the levels that they say they're going to get to in fact the United states blows them away\nThe people that actually do the job and get the job done that\nAre viewed as the people that are destroying the world where all the scientific evidence shows you that they are not\nThat's where we're at today\nBy the way the number two nation in the world and not a a big nation but the number two nation in terms of reducing uh they're they're a greenhouse gases and ah and such Venezuela\n[laughter] [laughter] [laughter] so there you go\nAnd

Roberts will be here all week next week to uh have great conversations with you\nAnd then we'll be back a week from Monday but the\nThe polls if you start looking at the polls are and you know that the numbers in the house\nI mean I'm I'm ... it's it really really really really I mean you know going up over you know hundreds of polls there are some that are going to be blue with no doubt a there are some that are going to be read the thirty to our sci fi has thirty to\nEssentially\nA you know that that are in the middle undecided basically just yet it doesn't show the polls are neck and neck\nAnd does and did you see some of the amounts of the unjust\nI did you're talking ten eleven ... percent and that's a big deal it is and and the pollsters um\nAren't as active in the house seats as as they are for the Senate ... I'm right they will start seeing that but we haven't seen any polls post cabinet well we don't make predictions but if you if you if you look at the number of toss ups as they call them\nOn on our cp that's thirty two uh the the polls in those areas or you know it in those thirty two districts\nAre really going to start juggling things are showing something here probably by the time you and I get back a week from Monday\nOr when when I started thinking about somebody who was undecided today and again in a congressional race who knows but all I'm thinking is that if you've got ten to twelve percent that are undecided\nIt means they're not driven by Trump hatred or Trump gloves right it's not either of that that's driving them\nSo what is it that is what is it that is driving\nThe you know that you know that independent in that particular district and we're never going to get the specific poll polling on that lets pull the independence this congressional district to find out why they are undecided and what would change their vote right would it be in their local congressman came out and said\nEverything is free but by this time\nThey've already seen a ton of political commercials so what is it that would push them over the edge to build a certain way\nEspecially if they're likely voters\nWhich means in all likelihood they're going to vote but they're still undecided at this moment what is it it's got to be an issue that's huge right yep and what's the hugest is an issue over the the biggest issue over the last couple of weeks we'll be Kavanaugh I don't know if there will be a bigger issue\nThat that will come out in the in in the next few weeks in popular culture that will reach everybody Kanye West I [laughter] I'm Sorry just throw that out I I I

it's not going to change what's it think about it who can this day and age how can tend to twelve percent possibly be undecided and ... and and most definitely be going to the polls\nIn November\nYeah it's really it's only when you think about that here's something else interesting looking at\nThe end and it's just one small indicators of small movement but I find it interesting looking at our

some some semblance of due process and the court of public opinion is going to have to be arraigned in some way\nAnd I think that's the Republican direction yeah\nThat's a great history by now yeah\nNo I think it's a great point is that you say that you know the the the court of public opinion or isn't the final determination of of uh of of anything and and the court of public opinion we're talking about on the left side of of of a public opinion and it has to be it has to be due process that's a very that's a\nYou know that that that's a great point that comes from the capital here it's\nYeah I I think it is and and people apply it uh it based on their their own life you know our our audience\nA and a ... and news hounds and and and people who do we do we're we're in the thick of it and we're always immersed in it but most people the average American is not but if they're still politically active in terms of voting\nThey look at it and say okay\nThis this is you know insanity the fact that it went this way they don't uh applied the left believes that they apply their feelings directly to their feelings sleep that is the case for some\nBut most Americans look at it practically speaking and going you know this is a big deal to vote to be able to vote is a big deal and if there to the point where they are you know in that likely voter category this is why those\nPolls start to shape the way they do and that's why a likely voter gives you a better read but they look at that and go you know it's a big deal on election day to get up and go cast my vote\nYou know I Know people show up and they're driven by\nYou know a slogan are driven by whatever imagery but we can't forget the people that take it very serious they consider things they may not be immersed in it every day like we are for whatever reason\nBut they will show up and they make an informed decision and often it is a reaction Chuck Todd on a ... and and Chuck Todd who's saying well a lot of people get it wrong in and say twenty sixteen was a referendum on Trump but it really was a referendum on Hillary\nThat was a small part of it what what Chuck Todd as we're getting here because they are discussing the polls in the mid term is is about you know the house in the Senate and not a presidential election and his point what he was implying is that Hillary's not here to be the the bad guy right\nWell what\nChuck is forgetting is the real facts of how the Republicans in districts all over America outperformed Trump and that it wasn't a referendum on Hillary it was a referendum on the left\nAs a you know that that's a great point of the other point brought by the color of their ... and I think you can't underestimate this is that Americans may not know the three branches of government right\nUh you know and and that's what the polls show Seventy five percent of Americans roughly could not tell you all three branches of government they might know one or two or ... zero but they couldn't tell you all three as you said you need to know all three to understand how the government actually works they may not be able to tell you the freedoms and the first amendment\nBut think about when it comes to due process\nThink about since Perry Mason let's go through all the lawyer shows that have been that had been on TV and battle salt [laughter] well I uh well I'll Try I'll drop Perry Mason officer all matlock I'll throw out\nAlmost Thirty years of law and order on the television and everybody understands a presumption of innocence everybody even a significant portion that we're trying to tell you that the allegation is enough\nIf you actually asked them off the record if they believe that they would tell you know why that is that is just think about that in not just in the courtroom if you've ever been in a jury but it is they're completely in our\nPopular culture shots from the greater does on ... and it's a great point because you don't have to get into the details of how legislation worked for the three branches of government no but in pop culture we got we got those and yes they are simple lessons for the simple lesson can be

two percent said they would support Shalala difference that falls within the polls margin of error a plus or minus four percent Thirteen percent of likely voters said that they were undecided\nSellers

you you broaden out right to the other thirty two or well together thirty one because it's a this district four and a twenty seven is one of those on the our sleepy toss up\nA category a of a total of
