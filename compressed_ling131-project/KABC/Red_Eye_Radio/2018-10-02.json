got mediocre and he's a scale guy called off what winning\nYou know you\nGuys do expect great savings in a whole lot more\nWelcome back Andrew Cleveland's doing in prevention bureau on the bench bureau show let's talk about Kanye West so Kanye West God loves the man went on Saturday Night live he was a late replacement on Saturday Night live to hosted and when it was I think toward the end of it he put on a magazine\nAnd he went on in this part was cut out I think this did not make the final cut he went on and gave a kind of speech all they do is call it a ramp how you can tell when Kanye West is ranting as opposed to when he's speaking I have no idea what kind of us went up and it's it's kinda hard to hear but let's play a little bit of it anyway\nThat's what all those [noise] you know it was a [noise] on the whole ... [noise]\n\nIt's always a way for\nA little old we also have still [noise]\nSo it is basically kind of half wrapping half talking he says I Want to cry right now a black man in America as opposed to keep what you feel inside right now he says and he says the blacks all want oil is Democrats she says\nYou know it's like the plan they did to take the fathers out of the home and promote welfare does anybody know about that that's a democratic plan that's not around that is actually a kind of the troops that what he's talking about is back in the sixties and seventies when there were designing welfare\nDaniel Patrick Moynihan said you know if you do this you were basically promoting the dissolution of the family because you're going to pay people they they they were repeatedly warned that your pain essentially people to have children out of wedlock and if the fathers they lose their welfare\nAnd it is that worked out that way the black family has been virtually destroyed they are now more\nBlack children being raised in a single parent homes than there were when the Democrats were the slave owners\nBack in the day when the Democrats were actually breaking up families intentionally people booed and people were applauded and he and and he said in Kenya where should they bullied me backstage they said don't go out there with that had on they bully me backstage the bowling me and then they say time in the stomach in place\nHere here's the thing why is this why isn't even knew that Kanye West supports Donald Trump why is that even news first of all\nFrom his improve the lives of black people in this country economically is certainly true it's news because the left insist on monopolizing the culture is not the things that they think like oh you know we're really good at culture so we're going to it is that they insist on monopolizing it every single comedian on TV\nIs left wing every single one every late night comedian there's not one show and if there were a show if there were a show that had a comedian who was pro Trump it would drive everybody crazy when Fox News came along Fox News has like one\nTenth I think of the ratings of the ... networks that the networks have like ten times the range of Fox why is Fox stuck and people had\nPeople's heads it's because they're the only people they're the only people saying what they're saying that the only place you can go to here Sean and these point of view and the only place you can go to watch it the Bret Baer news program which is the most honest program on TV it doesn't have a right wing slant and the the point\nThe point here is that on the white\nI don't want right wing culture I don't want every comedian to be right winger I don't want comedians me right when he was laughing because I think you can laugh at everybody in politics you really can cause they're all what they what we see in front of us are all pretty funny\nBut they weren't monopoly they want only one site to speak they weren't silence on the other side and we have let them get away with it and it really really has been a mistake the ... because of that is because of that that they can sell this Brett Kavanaugh\nNarrative it's because of that that the conversation we're always reacting to the conversation never making the conversation is because they monopolize the culture and insist on monopolizing it that we are always fighting a rear guard action against left wing tyranny we have to keep it up until we take over the mainstream\nThat's it for me I'll be back again tomorrow and if you'd like to hear more from me you can listen to the Andrew claiming\nShow it daily wire dot com for on I just coming over and give a listen I envy flavors silliness aphasia feel on the bench\n\nIs your dog is heading to\nTurn off your Instagram shelter no self [noise]\nLos Angeles\nYou less station [noise]\nFeces news is live and the local at ten o'clock I'm just a little and we have a another police for Sunni underway it's a a police will stop chasing the suspect who was wanted for allegedly driving under the influence of alcohol or drugs according to broadcast reports I suspect had been heading\nBy the way we're we told ... that was a sworn statement\nNow I don't I have no idea uh who would pursue anything if there is anything that could pursue for her given a sworn statement but we were giving were were given by Abernathy of the media was given\nA a document that had her making statements as fact and then she walks back but I think this is what the president was getting at you know so many things have changed in this entire thing you could look at the claims and depending on what is set\nTo the FBI and these interviews\nYou could be looking at perjury for Dr Ford and I think this is what her attorneys are worried about\nI think it's why they were so anxious over the weekend remember they said over the weekend we've contacted the FBI trying to set up the interview and as a Sunday they were saying you know no interview yet they haven't talked to her well why would you want to do it so soon after testimony because you want to keep her on track\nYou don't want to change in her story now\nThe FBI is not going to do anything against her and I don't know that there would be any action against her except for the fact that\nShe was under oath last Thursday so whatever she said then her comments to the FBI are part of the process is betting Kavanaugh and if they differ from her\nTestimony there will be questions\nAnd so the the left is coming out and this is why I think they're also going for perjury a per capita they keep making up these bogus perjury things that aren't going anywhere\nAre and all of them have to do with the amount of alcohol that he's drinking and he was never very ... who was having said well listen I was very clear to only have a four four ounces of\n[laughter] Ritchie Cunningham and telling you that okay for those under the age of Seventeen but you kind of ... was a a character in a show called happy happy days yeah yeah right\nBut it was on all through the eighties all but I Want to read it was and and now Ritchie Cunningham as a as a as a liberal a director but his brother\nYes it's a concern that's right and so he at Ron Howard who were it anyway so is that ask them well because that I you know I've just had you know as these tiny little green so how many do you have\nSeventy [laughter] I Love that episode it was great I'll I'll never forget a you know the you know looking at it that\nRich you face because he actually [laughter] Ron Howard ... trunk thought man that's good acting but if if Kavanaugh I'd come out and meet certain planes I was clear to only have one drink at any function he didn't say that in fact at the time in my mind when I was watching it\nI was almost critical of him and I thought no actually this is exactly how judges are they're very forthcoming especially about anything that they have done in their past or to this extent there's just not criminal behavior to the\nOf throwing the was the exactly throwing the ice at a bar you might according to one lead to report he might have thrown ice right yes yeah and he never says he threw eyes\nBut in the police report someone claims they threw eyes and the guys here was bleeding a lot of people's ears legal but you haven't dared ears leaving whatsoever on the [laughter] that was from the other person's throwing the year ... luck I'm paying\nAttention to this because it damages I Need to know ... or you know\nAll that matters is that it was listed as an assault and somebody was bleeding\nSo you've got to think like a liberal okay so this is but this is the the insanity\nBy the way you know I'm laughing huh I was a club DJ for years yeah I saw a massive bar fights and\nWhy would I in my time and and\nAnd all the oil field workers in the ... are probably asleep right now but uh out in West Texas or screaming the guy got to leave the bar with his ear intact oh [laughter] well the recall that a good\nDay so here's the thing I'm [laughter] actually comes from a real scenario um but ... ... ... the entire equation has to be distorted and there has to be this distraction\nRight and now it's about what did he know when did he know it about the claims right because the text messages now show well that that he knew about the Ramirez claim ahead of time before it\nGot to the media well okay here's here's the concern I think for the Democrats is that the president has essentially directed the FBI to talk to anybody and everybody who might be relevant to the situation will that includes\nPeople who were supposed to have corroborated if they've got the FBI agent sitting in front of them they're going to be nervous they're going to ... and and I wonder how the story is going to change and again if it does I Wonder where this thing go while\nJust it just as you're talking about that just as we're talking about this this comes across a from our news feed from uh from Westwood One okay our company guy so Westwood One is\nEric Swalwell ... the the us representative from California and I took her curls before this guy's a piece of work yeah and it just comes across as you're talking there just I didn't mean to interrupt you but it ...\nIt says Swalwell Senate Kavanaugh lies or just qualifying and I went well what are the lies or a buyout right\nApparently I've ... I've not listen to this audio cup and I'm going to play it here okay a but it's just a former college costs would have brought Kavanaugh says the Supreme Court nominee was not truthful about his drinking mhm here we go All right let's play this\nTypically this would not be disqualifying for any Supreme Court nominee the fact that they drank in college like most people in college too however it is disqualify him because he has painted himself as a choir boy who never engaged in any of this behavior wrong and I'll\nSay oh he lie wrong there's ... ... that's the whole point of lying disqualify you from the Supreme Court then you need to step down from office\n[laughter] we'll say we'll\nSay it again CNN did the interview over the weekend with one of capitals former classmates I Would have stayed on the sideline if he had said I drank to excess in high school I drank too accessing college I did some stupid things but never sexually assaulted anybody\nHis actual comments I drank beer with my friends sometimes I had too many beers sometimes other did I like beer I still like beer but I didn't drink beer to the point of blacking out and I never sexually assaulted anyone\nWhere's the perjury there [laughter] and that's it the leftist scrambling so hard right now frankly I Believe that there's thank God it gave me that it works for all all well\nAnd this this entire thing as a gift to the Republicans if you're a Democrat right now you should be worried about this at this behavior right now by your party this should concern you greatly because here's the difference\nThe blue wave may happen in the house Nancy Pelosi I'm going to be speaker again I'm don't grab the keys just yes Nancy even if you do when\nIn the Senate\nYou and I you were going over some polls are some recent polls are some that had Thursday included but not just Thursday and that's that's important because of this right the hearing\nBut if you look at these polls in the Senate they're very close right now and if you get a a a a couple of other seats a couple of more seats for the Republicans in the Senate they can afford\nTo lose the columns on the next Supreme Court nominee I mean you you look at it I mean we were looking at uh the the New Jersey Senate mhm uh hugging versus a Menendez Robert Menendez come at the Democratic incumbent right and and it says if you look at the real clear politics open ended up\nBy four well huh\nThe Quinnipiac poll in August with registered voters had him up by six the Stockton University poll that goes to the twenty seven to last Thursday of likely voters that's more accurate or a has a Menendez only up by two\nYeah\nAnd that's the margin of error for points very\nWell again this is not over\nAnd you're a Democrat and you should be absolutely worried about this because I I've never in my lifetime in my adult lifetime I don't remember the Republicans being the health\nOf a and motivate Kramer over high camp just out from the seventeenth or NBC valley news from the Seventeen to twenty seven there's just a a came out alright six hundred and fifty likely voters he breaks the fifty one percent use up fifty one to forty one over Heidi Heitkamp yeah\nNow that goes to the twenty seventh\nOr Donnelly in a in ... in Indiana\nOr the Fox news poll a but that goes to the that's the latest one of just until the eleventh of September but still a his uh his ...\nWe're Republican I'm a\nEvent carjacked an SUV at a local park but crashed into a police Gruber crews are trying to escape and was taken into custody one passenger also captured the other remains at large\nAnd so Cal at us and crews are working to restore electricity to customers in la Verne mirror wheeler avenue and highly oak street service expected to be restored by midnight K.

her Padma the hour and that\nWas his is anything going to take the Democrats off the brink I I don't know of anything right now that brings them back from the brink\nAnd in our lifetime because this is what happened last friday when Jeff Flake is confronted in the elevator\nAnd then those who confronted him later that day said this is why we go direct\nWhat it did was to justify and attempt to legitimize the shouting\nOf Ted Cruz out of a restaurant even though that same restaurant is not hired security guards it is they see it as well it worked and this is why we're going direct this is why we will keep doing this because\nThey believe again they're going to get the same reaction that they got out of Jeff Flake well newsflash he admitted in the sixty minutes interview if he were up for reelection that would've never happened you never would have gotten him together with tunes that agreement to delay this thing and have an FBI background check this week\nWould never have happened he admitted it he doesn't care what the people of Arizona I think\nHe doesn't care what the people think\nHe only cares what the people think if it serves him him\nAnd so this entire equation\nUm ... is is the what they see is the momentum now here's the problem the party has\nBy the way to the party we need to repeat these people don't care about you either\nThey don't they don't care that Jeff Flake had disdain as a Republican for Donald Trump after he got with Coons and they came up with this agreement to do this FBI background check they started screaming it's not enough\nAnd so they don't care about anybody in the party\nBut the future of the party is certainly in question when this kind of behavior drives that paints a picture for the rest of America and as you mentioned Gary

they couldn't corroborate her then there ain't no story that New York times that of course did that last week and said no we can't we talk to and then interviewed several dozen people and couldn't find one with firsthand knowledge of this event\nAnd she sweating the cat and walk it back and say he was near the punch bowl I don't actually know if he was putting drugs and and I don't know if he was putting drugs in the punch and he was\nHanging out with people in the hallway I don't know if he was actually lined up but it seems like she said it seems like a that's a strange coincidence no it's not\nActually it's not you could have people at a party that would never condone that kind of behavior and still not know that it's going on behind closed doors\nOr in the the fact that they ran

donate today at truckers fun dot org\nThat struck responded dot org gave us today at truckers fund dot org\nThought\nADC\nOrange County cumulus station [noise] the\nABC News is live and local out of love and our clock I'm Geoff Wardle in the LAPD detectives made an undisclosed number of arrests in connection with the recent burglaries at the homes of Los Angeles celebrities police announced today details\nLook they bring the ... pretty much play all ... atmosphere for the last month and a half because they were balance to see if they can get they had to do actually a tie breaker right but now you get into the playoffs the actual playoffs were really count\nAnd you wonder if they can get through the whole series because it is really nerve wracking we use when you look back then you look at them and during the season\nAnd you're like man like the the mariners like you've got swept you got beaten that series and you play teams those type of teams and you just go to the fall so it's a little nerve wracking for me\nReal is it is scary because you're going into that you're going into the playoffs and now you're going to be as teams that are the top tier teams and the winter is going to come out that right and you know the first games are very important you got to win the first right\nSo I think now when it comes to yes they can concentrate on that a Dodger fans are happy that they're in the playoffs because we're a ballot for that but I think now that is\nI think their minds that has to be look we were one game a waiver when the world series we gotta get back to the world series and the thing is the key is is the Dodgers thinking that or is are they thinking out or they just thinking we got taken one game at a time would either\nI think they should be leaning on their experience from last year that's the biggest thing and I feel really good about this series against the Braves game one coming up on Thursday you're going to have the home field hearing the divisional series it's a very young Braves team yeah and they over achieved all year long\nCan they continue that this is new territory for them Dodgers been here done that last year the Dodgers swept the diamond backs in his division around\nI think you're going to see them lean on that experience as they should like I said they're they're getting some hot bath right now things are going their way Walker bealer picked up the W. today obviously in this type breaking game over the Rockies\nI really liked the spot there and right now I think they're easily going to take care of Atlanta and this divisional series I I really do I don't think they're going to sweat it too much or\nThat that's just shows you know it\nIt's when you see this in sports teams that if they just get into the post season and then they start to go on a little bit of a run\nAnd it just it it it's a whole new season that's the biggest thing here are ... should all look at this says look\nIt was a crazy twenty eight team we had our ups we add a whole bunch of down but the regular season is over and the post season is a whole new ballgame the slate gets wiped completely blank and that everyone has to feel good about that at the moment\nI think they're in a good spot here pitching wise or set up while in the rotation\nIf they can get quality starts in the rotation and if the bats can you continue to come alive they don't have to worry about the bullpen as much that's the formula\nWell I mean look down on a brazen suggesting they ever lose a street fair to a two game losing streak right now\nYou're hoping that they continue to do that um but you know play off as a whole different atmosphere there everybody's now zero zero it doesn't matter what you did in the pre season is really about what you do now in the postseason and what it comes down to ... this is this is where we\nSaw in the ... of the world the um the turners or the world the pleads of the world\nYeah it's it's postseason players and that's really what it is that's the different that's what's going to separate these guys from the regular the guys that kind of gets you to the playoffs you know\nPostseason players is where it matters and I think that's where it comes down to we signed players like the\nTrial of the world the price Harper's of the world\nIs he a postseason player\nOr is he just the season player and that's what you got to look at and you got people like in this where they get their money to be honest with you demanding job does to the ... who's at the end of his his a contract coming up I'm Turner\nAnd you look at those guys and you like look or they are they post the the players I think that's what the determination lives where the front office is am I going to sign this guy because yeah he can get me to the play offs but\nCan he get me over the hub can he perform in the playoffs and so\nI think there's pressure on those guys right now they got a really perform especially already getting to the world series is can they get there so I'm excited man I Hope that they can possibly get there and then we'll see what happens\nI think it would be really fun obviously if we had the Dodgers in there and if it was like a Boston Dodgers World Series I think you'd have a lot of people to sign up for that one I Know some people still want to see Dodgers Yankees to the biggest markets that would be intriguing that would\nBe awesome man do you know how much money that would generate New York ... not to mention\nWas the last time that even happened I Know right in any sport we had the two largest markets in the championship round so it would be great from that perspective and obviously the Yankees have to get past Oakland they're wild card game coming up this week\nThe big loser for me the key right now is Colorado a live game today they had things working their way out of home in Denver now they've got to go on the road to take on the cubs and his wild card game tomorrow\nI think the rocky season is over there you know where they're going to touch lesser in my opinion yeah ... got to start tomorrow for the cobs out regularly I don't see it I think the Rockies really blew the shot I'm a really today I think today was opportunity\nTo somehow get a Dodgers team who didn't lay their best baseball this year at home it didn't happen

Martinez you know low key Bogart the pitching staff price I mean the most wins\nEver in a state go all the way and they win it all arguably the best team at all in baseball and that's those are the Yankees by the\nWay do you think well I'm with you all on the sense of I mean you got bats Martinez ... it's crazy how they have to MBP caliber players on the team was the last time that happened right so that's impressive the number of games this year as well\nI don't know about one of the best of all time but it's certainly up there I mean it is certainly up there for a debate in in the top five top three\nI'd I'd have to say this though the Boston Red Sox they tend to get it done in the playoffs though\nWhen they're they're postseason team to me you know I'm I think the only team they really have to worry about the Yankees however they tend to they got the Yankees number and they they beat them in many series this year um I think\nIt just there's just a season team and you know when you had those seeds and team they know how to win\nThere the team that knows how to win and I agree yeah and I think they're just they're ... they're dangerous they're dangerous team\nOr this year and I think you really would be upsetting I think there definitely the favorite of winning the world series um you know I'm really excited to see them and I look if that can see them in LA Dodgers play in the world series that'd be great but you know what\nThis is that this dream that's a dream that the jury that is that we are the dream and I thought\nYes I can definitely see that but you know what other team I'm kind of excited to see them match up against\nAs I Want to see you know look these two teams and the American league that what a hundred games and you got to respect the teams that with a hundred games this year right so you got to respect the Yankees you got to respect the Astros\nAnd I think that's going to be ... to me they're they're most a dangerous team are threatening teams this year getting them over the hump but man it's gonna be exciting to see they are they're definitely the the veteran season team and the favorite I gotta agree with what we got our hearts\nBroke we got our spoke last year we we come in first place to get a wild card\nAnd they beat us we don't get a twelve steps using it all the way to wrap look they just they just beat us two or three over the weekend the let's let's admit play all our top guys weeklies week ago we don't need to compete against the Yankees\nYou know in the in the last week and we don't need to compete against the Yankees and that's just it but but we got our hearts broke last year so they're coming out full force begins to work if they get the players this year in his state do we know what to do against the we know what I'm mistakes that we made him last year a real quickly\nLet's ... man before before I go to the patriots the Dodgers Red Sox is the dream that would be a big danger without question without quite huge huge tickets right now they're going to be five grand to twenty five grand ... much bigger than any other uh ferries\nWell Jay can we say this it was the last Boston LA a massive we had in the championship that was Los Angeles Lakers were the Boston Celtics right and what how was that a game seven right and I was ... with it and sell nothing better\nIt's not a very er and I think we're going to get it this year and I'm happy that LeBron is here because I Love with Ron oh yeah\nWhat's your take on the patch\nThe parents the parents had a rocky start we'll have Edelman a so receiving wise we don't have like a main go to guy but still trying to think if people\nAre well he's coming back on Thursday obviously I don't know how that were on the way and yeah I mean look you're totally right Jay and a rocky start obviously yesterday they take care of but it's the same old ...\nAnd you got to also remember J man look John Gordon despite well he's been going through\nHe you know he needs a team that's going to give him colors some direction right in ... other place I owe them Bill Bill a check there's going to give him some direction and leeway and you know some players just need that look it goes back to Randy Moss Randy mosses that type of guy off season off the field issues\nAnd he needed someone that's going to get taken serious or take this game series and being a serious look we can do it with fewer without you and that's the way the ball that's the way the patriots are right and that's the only way Josh Gordon Josh going the same way it's like look\nThe past week and when they lost to Texas\nAnd we just didn't do well to now is like we just didn't pay to the best or ability that raise an eyebrow for abuse because then those people who are looking out there saying well wait a minute we got some great recruits here they're supposed to be the ... played the best of their ability every time and if they're not getting the best we're not getting the best out of them\nWhere does that come from that comes from the coaching staff\nSo you got to look at things like that and you got to think about well why are we not getting the best out of you why are we not getting the best place or the best out of\nFour or five star recruit will we should be getting so when I look at that man I just think you know raise your outlook\nThey don't have those they're willing to anybody really they don't that's part of the problem they don't have a um we know they don't have a go to an ... I think that they do consistently well that would strike fear in any defense right now that's obvious and they again they don't go out there and they don't trying to stab wish anything\nBecause I think they don't themselves have confidence that they can do that at the moment\nIt didn't team it's a team right now that's in search of a lot of things\nAnd uh I obviously I'm the most important thing is victory which they're just getting by at the moment but yeah it just it it's a bad taste in everyone's ... mouth right now with this team look man you look at it and in their division\nThe south I'll say this Brad ...\nIs really a saying look I'm going to say I must say this I they're they get a Colorado can beat them [noise] Arizona State can beat them and to\nBe honest with you I think UCLA can hang with them you can go to\nAny of those yeah honestly I actually just about any team to pack told as a whole you can do that yeah and you could say that anybody can be be\nI'm the same as you say can Utah State\nUtah you can use can beat them you know if they're at home and advantage is just\nWhen you look at them manage just a just a team that's out there you know there's just happened to be in the ... they're not the same as what you thought they were who everybody thinks that where you go off to name your like us She's a prestigious team USC players usually get invited those guys usually get invited to the ... by automatically\nAnd you just don't see that with the program right now I look I I'll just be honest with you man I think ... I think his jobs on the line man I hate to say it and I wish that against no man\nI I I don't think I I I think you can make a great case for that there's no doubt I'm yeah as far as how this team should be a perennial top ten Fifteen team the country but I just don't think internally I don't believe that's where they stand I think he is safe you think so I Do think he said\nHow does how are you ... figured that when let me just tell you this how you figure that when you have a team that a program that is expected to be elite and\nMost of the people that are in a restaurant ... ... is that our highest stature they expect that seem to be at the highest stature this team us the football program as always supposed to be in the top twenty five\nI don't care what you say they always supposed to be the top twenty five they always supposed to be at the top of the division and winning the winning the PACs wealth or at least\nIn the championship you can't say that about this year every year for the last couple of years they'll get ranked high in the early ... drop out quickly why because they just not the team that people thought they were on on paper it's just not the same so\nWhen you look at that that's very upsetting and I'm telling you man that's what people will look at these boosters or or these athletic director ... ... with this team is not just you can't you gotta be UCLA in order to day we know they can't beat or the day we know that if they don't be UCLA\nMy man held is gone now I'll just say that right now but you look at this team this team is not performing\nTo the talent that they have on the team and that's just the bottom line okay you say they are J. T. Daniel's young guy whatever they just are not performing the way they should be a you know how we know that Brett because they're coming out in the media and they're saying it by themselves they're saying it and that's the problem is\nThere's town there but it's raw talent as anybody can see there was a long way to go and look clay helping\nThe sand Arnold Arab bought him time with this team by them starting one in three with max brown a couple of seasons ago he made the move to put Donald in there it paid off obviously\nThey won the rose bowl they won the pack twelve that season and they've been building since then and and obviously you know they got the ... last year came up short against the highest state this year they go they it it's somewhat of like a a rebuilding they're not in they're not in the category yet\nOf being able to have a program established that they can reload players they're not they're clearly they're rebuilding right now they're not ...\nBut because I I don't think that's going to cost quite helping his job this year I Believe he gets another year now if we're having the same discussion at this point twenty Nineteen yeah I think he's only in in there's no doubt he if they lose this year too I don't think they're gonna lose the boat Notre Dame UCLA I don't think that's going to happen but\n... even if the worst happens I there's no doubt I think he survives it but he he is on the hot seat\nMore so than anybody hunting to next season that's how I that's my take on it\nQuickly other things from college football over the weekend nationally Penn State Ohio man when I was a wild game I was there Keith as you know just crazy I was basically right in front of where eighty four John how are made that incredible one handed out back um style cash for Penn State catch the year as\nHerb straight in the guys were talking about in the broadcast incredible an odd to me and my biggest takeaway in the first half was\nPenn State's defense was his most impressive as any defense I've seen against anybody this year ... the way they were able to shut out Ohio State for the majority of the first half\nLooking at the bottom line is Penn State's not a sixty minute football team yeah that's\nWhat I was watching his game ... and you know as to say this I never thought the game got away from Ohio State wide because Penn State jumped out I'm In the beginning but they never could get over the hump they never could executing the second half they had numerous I think after ... by\nA symbol has there was a killer at the end of the fed has got a Thirteen seven they got back into\nWhat they jumped out on them for the I Believe it was like fourteen zero yeah you start seeing zero and you'll say OK pits they may run away with this game but then after that they really do second half adjustments urban Meyer did with his team\nIt to me it just didn't seem like the Penn State couldn't get over the hump after that they couldn't they just were stuck and then you start to see the momentum shift\nAnd in Ohio State just start to put it in other gear and in\nThe outcome was they in the winter I said I said it was going to be a close game are doctors that will beat I'll stop and say would be the Ohio State I did say that\nBut to me or what happened was Penn State just couldn't they couldn't they couldn't deliver the punching the second half mandate is like you said they were just the first half team\nAnd you can't do that if you're gonna if you're going to go to a championship playoff team you know you can't do that against routine light like our state our state to me is proven that look we came into a hostile of their uh oh environment and believe me\nThat environment was hostile why was that was one of the ... one of the most hostile environment I ever seen in a while and they delivered the punch and they and and they and they got him and that's what's Europeans do man\nI got to give it to him they might saying they're chip in\nA while I'm saying in that case yeah that's what elite teams do\nThe game winning touchdown Dr led by Haskins was all trend prejudice started like their own five yard line me back up and the students section they must have been doing silent kept to get out of that 'cause it was so loud I mean it was impressive and look\nQuick slant patterns crosses across the middle of the field and died dismiss the yards after the catch killed the Penn State's secondary in the game but it's not really why they lost the game with a defense played well enough the majority of the game\nA you know if you're paying for the fourth downplay horrendous fourth and five I don't know what they saw their uh their playing mind games like three time outs in a row essentially combined between Penn State Ohio State uh look they're they're on the ... I think there's no doubt the Penn State is a top ten caliber team\nTo get into that top five top for discussion they just got to play sixty medic but\nMaybe we'll get a rematch too big ten teams in the software to actually see team last year we'll see hey great show tonight it flew by\nWe will get back at it tomorrow night we'll get into more NFL news and that will kind of also talk a little bit more about that tonight's Monday Night football game and you know will roll long hair as we go along this week on behind the Mike also\nBig event coming up we'll get into more tomorrow night but October Thirteen USC Colorado will be there outside the coliseum more on that tomorrow night\nFor Keith I'm Brad keep living the dream [noise]\nFurnace by Sally is media [noise]\nLos Angeles orange\nMueller station\nRight producing the refugees I'm only a friend's US Senators on both sides of the Iowa or winning the White House no they want a complete investigation into the allegations against Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh when the Kenyan has\nThis trade deal makes it harder to ... ...\nAh the trade deal and the president used the tariffs babies and then one right onto his big accomplishment which was the automobiles will what happened in the automobiles\nThere has to be more not American North American content in any vehicle that is sold to a you know or you know a menu sold between the three countries\nThere has to be more North American content not necessarily American but North American even though it's not the north American free trade agreement it's the United states Canada and\nIt's still North America and so it's so are\nThere has to be more North American which are content which is going to raise the cost then the the um a salary requirements that he put on Mexico\nThan Mexico must you know race it doesn't affect Mexico with actually affords General Motors and\nFord remember the companies are talking about are all American companies and if you noticed none of the American automobile manufacturers are saying this is a great deal for them they don't like the deal the deal will make it so Ford and General Motors cells fewer cars in North America\nAnd because you've raised the cost of automobiles\nIn North America more expensive to manufacture what the president said he wanted which was to send more vehicles\nTo manufacture them in the United states and send them overseas is now going to be tougher to do because you've raised the cost of manufacturing\nOf cars in the United states in Mexico and in Canada and view the consumer will pay for it and that is what the president viewed as the greatest victory in this\n... and so as I you know we only got one email on at the one guy said to you know you and I said well wait a minute to ... there's some parts of it we like but the big part of it the president promoted is wrong\nAnd as I and I you know invited him to argue more than debate more than just the rhetoric\nOf it makes America great to what does it actually do when you raise prices but we live in a ... we live in a look we live in a day and age and I understand that we live in a day and age where nobody wants to talk about\n... when you look at these specific sub of what's going on with Kavanaugh\nNobody wants to focus in and say okay what's the actual thing everybody's off into a different tangent\nThe same on on on the economics and trade everybody picks their own little corner and they stick with it instead of saying okay what is a result when you raise prices overall and that's what the president has done in the free trade agreement and our trade negotiators have done he has made cars more expensive\nTo buy in Mexico in the United states and in Canada were all in it together the cost of buying a car in the United states Canada and Mexico will go up in price at a time as you mentioned yesterday Eric\nYou mentioned it yesterday I don't know why I focused instead Eric ... uh but as you said yesterday a ... and you and I've been doing some some uh the reading and analysis on this is that her prices are going up people can't afford to buy cars they run out of ways to finance them and so what are people looking to do that looking to buy\nUsed vehicles yes and that's driving by market right now which when there was a greater demand for that group of vehicles the used vehicles and the price goes up\nAnd so for some people out there they believe this is ... none of it's personal it's all economics how does it work I Can't tell you how the president things because of president\nOr even in this trade deal has done some good things and done some bad things and and that's one of the bad things as automobile now it could have been a lot worse from what he was promoting before but the fact is it didn't affect probably Ninety eight percent of the free trade between the countries and that's a good thing\nAs we said what happened we had predicted look who's going to be all this high all the soup ... and what we're going to basically get\nIs the same kind of deal a little bit of nuances here or there they get a little victory and timber we get a little victory and dairy\nThe big problem with it is what the president and what the trade negotiators did on raising the cost of all cars manufactured in the United states in Canada and Mexico that you that consumers are going to have to pay and it means we are less likely to ship\nCars from the United states anywhere else\nAnd the president views that as a great victory for the United states but doesn't explain why it's a great victory\nRight yeah and I think if you look here's where the tell will be you'll see certain industries that the reason the automobile industry is his key\nTo the economy is because you look at the the the how often now people purchase vehicles right or more and more they're holding on to their cars\nSo that hurts the ... because well they want the stuff off the assembly line to be sold\nYou make that more expensive you start hurting an industry you start seeing layoffs as a result of that then and then also make the used cars by default\nMore expensive and you're going to see not just the automobile industry but of course all the dealerships\nAnd all of the uh if if you look at the finance arms\nOf those companies they're all going to suffer as a result of that because people will choose as they're doing now to hold onto their car for longer periods of time because that's the cost of government that's not the cost of anything else we're not talking about well\nWhether it's steel and aluminum or the parts going into the car or electronics or anything else we're not saying that this stuff is scarce that it's hard to come by it that a small group of people have decided to get together and determine\nHow expensive is going to be for us that's the difference\nAnd we view it as a victory and as we've said nobody can explain to us why\nThat's a victory now as we said the other things when you look at the dairy you know again that's that's moving in and in some of the agriculture stuff where we do have more free trade now because of it and we had in Canada was able to knock down some of the barriers that's fine but it's almost as if we make the victory over there and then we shoot ourselves in the foot\nOn automobiles now the other good thing is\nCanada will like this will be was mentioned with the timber\nThat the president in all likelihood will be lifting the tear if they put on timber and now that has to go to a panel to decide whether\nA candidate is subsidizing it not the president to make the decision on his own which should sheep and construction\nIn the United states because that timber will be coming over and that was a fear of builders that housing prices were going to skyrocket another construction from the use of of would because of the Canadian timber\nAnd hopefully in the next year that will bring those prices down so there's wins and there was losses across the board but but overall if the president is stating\nThat the threat of tariffs on Canada and the and and and Mexico and the steel tariffs in the aluminum terrorists made it worthwhile for this he's going to have to show me the numbers on it\nWell and that's that's again it's it's it's the second largest purchase that people make and if people are homeowners it's the first largest purchase on on vehicles\nAnd you start seeing that slide you start seeing the economy slide and that will be your tell this is what the the Bush administration saw steel terrorists they saw companies leaving\nThe country and they said this can't stand we cannot keep this going you can't we cannot do this because the the job loss\nWill be well who knows what it would have been had they not ended those still terrorists uh prematurely\nBut overall the vast majority of products unchanged right\nAnd so are you know the president which was called a victory fine we just do the analysis on the reality of economics\nHe'd give me when you get ... he's got my support if if we're going to stand strong against China there's ... then ... and by the way politically you can get away with that all day long to it's going to it is going to hurt but if they're not going to play by\nThe world Trade Organization rules then not only the U.S but all of our allies and other trade partners with trying to need to get in line and putting the pressure on them that's a very real strategy\nAnd it is going it it has to be effective because uh\nThey don't know how you can put a cost on on trying to not playing by the rules and stealing intellectual property time and time again and getting away with\nEight six six Ninety ...

is that Senator Flake man actually help the Republican Party by calling ...\nYou're a senator in a a purple shall we say state or a state where your reelection is a tough one a year now and say hey\nLook I was kind of go towards not voting for the man or I was leaning towards voting for him I wasn't sure I sat through the hearings and like so many Americans I couldn't make up by my only cold than the FBI did a full investigation and any reasonable person would say that there's no real conclusion after that investigation\nUnder the vote for him so I think this is that's the case it\nGives some cover to Republicans\nWho may have been afraid to alienate some of their email or voters and gives them a little political cover to vote yes well\nThere there's only works if they if the polls since Thursday which will start rolling in over the next couple of days it by the ... by the end of the week those polls show that the American people are not with them that the but more importantly those senators in those states especially where it's close\nA are not getting the support of their voters in their states uh and ultimately it only works if the vote is to confirm Kavanaugh because it doesn't work for the Republicans if he does not get confirmed or it becomes still a very very much so an uphill battle\nOr even in November even though I Do believe that this whether he's confirmed or not will work for them politically I don't know too what effect in November at the mid term\nAnd I think the Democrats plan is it doesn't really matter what happens with Ford anymore it's let's get at

this I'll make it simple for you okay if I did the figures in my head or something that you and I came up with ... what was it maybe ten years ago I Can't remember ... okay when I was swimming in my pool and instead of thinking things that normal people think\nI was thinking to myself how do I simplify the budget situation so everybody can understand it within thirty seconds and then they can say okay they can relate to it because you said billions and trillions and a\nLab and blah blah blah blah blah or\nThe situation we're in right now okay yes if because the ... the budget just ended what just September thirtieth just sun ... last year or so and these are all rough estimate but but um if you if you took the federal budget\nAnd put it put it in basically somebody who\nLast year made thirty six thousand dollars okay okay so this is the situation that we're in right now in this country a as a person that made thirty six thousand dollars last year you spent\nForty point four\nThousand for a for a a a forty thousand four hundred dollars is what you spent\n... and you made to thirty six thousand right yeah you have outstanding debt\nA of\nMississippi and make sure we get this right here two hundred and Fifteen thousand dollars\nThis year\nYour salaries gone down to thirty four thousand dollars and you're going to spend forty four thousand dollars\nAnd your current debt\nIs two hundred and Fifteen thousand dollars with bills that must be paid over the next two years of one to two million dollars all you do is take off aid zeros so everybody can are you now understand the situation that we're at last\nYear you made thirty six thousand you spent a little bit over forty thousand or this year you're only going to make thirty four thousand you're going to spend forty four thousand\nAnd right now you have debt of two hundred and Fifteen thousand dollars\nAnd the bills that will come do over the next ten years at a salary that as you can see went down this year and a and bills are going to have to be paid over the next ten years of one to two million dollars and that's where we are as a nation right now if you put it to an individual\n[noise] and nobody gets ... nobody here not even a topic of discussion now not even a ripple now\nAnd ... and drugs put it up as the main you know headlined the main\nStory for a while but that was only because there was no award show going on in Hollywood\n[laughter] drugs like saw them yes [laughter] I'm not that I'm a liberal that easy like the movies and then yes that sort of an inside joke with us we we ... we always tease him we always tease him on that show uh there's where we are right now as a nation\nOr a fiscally does anybody believe that that's a good situation to be and would anybody want to I wouldn't want to be a message nothing no no especially with the bills that have to come do over the next ten years when you're talking about the millions and you're making thirty what something thousand a year yeah\nRight it's time to\nRation your Rahman but no we we don't want to do that we don't want to control our spent\n\nA I guess then that everything is settled in\n... does this just lost completely this this wasn't a part of the news whatsoever right but the president had to agree with all the spending bills with no additional funding for any\nYeah I mean you we had at one point two trillion to the debt so that didn't happen you know that's oh wait a minute no no no no no if this is Obama's economy it also has to be Obama's debt right now [laughter] ...

Republican senators have called the White House the stress that they expect a complete investigation that's the FBI reviews on vacations against Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh or both window reports comprehensive\nAnd uh the the the daily wire ... looked at all the different pulling out there and they brought the Harvard Harris survey\nWhich found that when people are told that the three named witnesses do not cooperate the accusations of Dr Ford\nOpinion shifted decisively in Kavanaugh's favor or they go through the other polls\nThat were asking do you believe Kavanaugh or do you believe and never asking these specific question you know based on the evidence that exist let's lay out the entire case in front of the American people and then see how they think don't ask one specific question because the question is not whether\nYou agree with your whether whether you believe that a a Ford is credible there's no way I Know whether she's credible or would achieve seem credible\nI don't know what seeming credible means all I can look at it say okay\nUh what does she have to say and doesn't match up with the evidence what does she have to say it doesn't match up with what she said yesterday what did she say oh she has witnesses what does what to say oh they say the opposite of what she said\nOkay it's not just what she said it's everything at all the evidence surrounding it that makes you credible or not credible and so when you have a particular amount of evidence out there if you\nAcross as credible because you have in fact she was yeah you can add to the credibility of it\nAs a person but you'll yourself just speaking alone with nothing else around you\nAnd when your statements contradict your previous statements and when your witnesses that you had stated even friends say don't know what you're talking about\nYou lose credibility so what they did was they went up the Harvard Harris survey and ask people uh you know what that what do you think once they tell them that the three name witnesses\nThat she picked that she said\nA word there said don't know what you're talking about ... didn't didn't happen that way when you do that it changes a fifty seven percent\nOf of ah people worse it here\nI'm\nFifty seven percent of people believed Kavanaugh okay they they don't believe the allegations than when you don't want that and if the FBI finds nothing\nSixty percent believe it should be confirmed the point we want to bring up is whenever we have a debate people call us and say well you guys you're never going to convince everybody that's not the point the point is never to convince everybody in the political process in this country where you are roughly have forty percent Republican forty percent ah a Democrat it's the twenty percent in between\nAnd when you get up to sixty percent convinced the majority of independence and that's how you win elections you make the case you stick to common sense you stick to critical thinking and you'll still be able to get the majority of Americans to agree with you except for the national debt\nMhm\nAh so there you go they found the people that when people are told a the three of the three name witnesses not cooperate the accusations of a doctor Ford opinion shifts decisively in ... favor as a daily wire reported on Monday posed by you govern writers found that people largely believe what benefits they're affiliated party\nMore than two thirds of Democrats believe the sexual allegations against Kavanaugh while roughly the same percentage of Republicans do not\nOverall you got found that forty one percent belief for thirty five percent believe cabin off road respond forty two percent belief forward and thirty one percent believe Cavanaugh\nA Harris Poll chair Mark Penn a former Bill Clinton poster reporting Sunday\nThat the Harris Poll study found that forty percent who saw or read parts of the testimony last Thursday felt that Ford alone seem credible wall twenty three percent said Kevin all alone seem credible that means just themselves without anything else no evidence surrounded by\nA total of twenty seven percent said they both seem believable does sixty seven percent of the of the total felt the Ford was credible fifty percent uh felt Kavanaugh was credible so there you go sixty seven fifty\nOr the Harris Poll study really gets interesting and its findings on the impact of the FBI investigation and on the issue of cooperation\nThe credibility of the testimony does not appear to be a decisive factor writes Penn ... rather the question comes down to cooperation as the standard for tipping public opinion on whether Kavanaugh should've send to the highest court\nWhen the response we're told with three name witnesses did not cooperate Ford's claim fifty seven percent said they were in favor of his confirmation if the FBI fines no cooperation of Ford's claims sixty percent said Kavanaugh should be confirmed penned reports so there you go\nAs we shut all the time it gets down to the evidence we stayed at from the very very beginning and that's why what the Democrats are selling independents aren't buying\nAnybody who has an out some critical thinking understands the presumption of innocence even in a study in like this the Democrats tried for a short time to use the the uh uh the phrase well\nOr this isn't a court of law it's a job interview yeah Americans understand the fairness and number one most job interviews do not have an\nFBI investigation by the way only only certain jobs this is an appointment to a branch of government and it is one political party\nNot just your employer is a political party trying to defend the character of that long term federal judge\nOr who has been nominated to this particular job Americans understand that they tried to use it for a short time in and that really didn't work because Americans understand it unless you are a part of it\nYou look at this and you say sorry not enough here and that's why a you know the\nThe Harvard poll Harris Poll that Mark Penn talk to me indicates what America really thinks and it shows that the Democrats are convincing anybody\nOther than themselves well and and and that's that's it but when this is the this is the I guess downside for them of the media carrying their stories and their narrative\nIs that\nIt makes a lot of people feel like well I don't know she's going to win the election it makes a lot of people feel like it's going to go this way or that the reality is this when it's often not\nBecause of willful ignorance drives all of this people that are very uh [noise] in fact clear about staying away from the actual details of the story but also make a decision\nAnd in a situation like this we have to be reminded that that's how political pressure was built\nWell\nIf you start asking questions and pointing out the details\nAnd they only have to really be informed of ... just a really short list of those details the opinions ... to ... to change to the point that there is no political pressure against the Republicans in the vote for\nCapital I I think I can safely say this I Believe that out of all the determining factor of how people make\nTheir opinions and there may be ten different factors\nI think the leading won the the leading factor of people are making you know that that making their opinions is ignorance mhm I really do yeah because uh we we deal with it every day on the air I've been doing this down as a as I said a few times\n'cause there was you know I don't know what they exactly it is this week but it's the first week of October twenty nine years and talk radio and and the number one that we don't debate anymore we don't debate issues\nWe debate with people that don't have the facts behind them that's all we do I mean that's Ninety nine percent of what we do yeah ... when we have when we confront somebody of the opposite opinion I mean we do spend a lot of time\nYou know ourselves doing it but when we confront somebody who was a different opinion with us\nThe vast majority of the time is spent\nTelling them no you don't even know what's going on here it right you don't know the truth you're ignorant of how this works yeah ignorance to me especially\nFrom the left it does exist on the right but I think in most cases it exists on the left and it
