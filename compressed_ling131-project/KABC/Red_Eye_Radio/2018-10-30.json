in terms of the momentum shifting you can't have a guy like Walker Mueller who is getting things going and he yanks him out and then you go with somebody else because he's pitched a hundred and seven pitches\nAnd they were lucky and they were ...\nYou know it just doesn't make any sense to me in and it didn't make any sense to me the whole time for this whole weekend I was sitting here and I was watching I said I just don't understand why you keep on this guy out\nWhen when you have somebody in their rolling you let them go forget about the analytic crap or whatever the case may be and they said there was a rumor that it wasn't Robert controlling it happens to also be upper management but whoever\nIt is the bottom line is your the manager and as a manager you have to manage the game and so go off your instinct and no and make your decisions but\nMake the right decision to stop going off the statistics analytics and all that crap go by what how the flow of the game is going did you see\nYou noticed price when he was in there he pitched seven eight nine eight innings sometimes the last game and he was wrong all the time they let them go and so they're like okay now is make a change right away\nAnd that's what they did and they in you know but the Dodgers with his analytic crap I mean it was killing me the whole game and I was just like\nThe the momentum ship was not from the actual game it came from the ... and they came from the management it came from the manager and he came from a top if that was coming from a top tell them what to do that's where the money to shiver and it hurt the team so you know I just think that they were bringing\nGuys unnecessarily they just poorly managed the world series all in one I knew this game was over after they lost the second game in the LA I said they can't ... many times I said this on on the show you cannot lose they have put himself in our whole by getting swept in Boston too oh\nAnd then coming to LA and I said you got you have to win all three game\nYeah we got a last week yeah ... it was going to be an uphill battle even if they were able to win all ... and they couldn't do it obviously so that we knew it just it was it was an uphill battle from the gecko [noise]\nBut but right after a night I just they were ... it's just it's just crazy how these gain some of them were there for the taking as better as the red Sox were this year they were clearly the best team in baseball Dodgers had their chances in this series but again\nEvery game they had in ... they had a chance\nRight and you're going to get so many of those you know what I mean the only like one or two per game they couldn't take advantage of any of it and that was a really big disappointment to it and\nMean look last night you get your one run\nThe first battle of the game with the home run by David Freese and that's it Mm again it does me the story was the red Sox pitching dominating dominating the Dodgers heading\nAnd the only problem for this team because there's going to be changes that are going to be made obviously and I'm hopefully those changes are getting bats in there that can you know not necessarily um the perfect match for him but but the Wright Patt sort of say\nYeah I I you know it's it's gonna be interesting to see what they do this off season it's going to be interested in next couple of days to see Robert actually going to be\nBack but if he is manage the team man than it actually managed to team though not and managed to team means not going by analytics all the time you know manage the team as knowing like OK personnel no your personnel know that okay walk abusing young guy\nHe's a you know let them go on there and let them throw the ball you go on the biggest stage of his life it was it a point where you even saw\nWhen they were getting pulled out like walk it'd be like for instance I'm going back to him that they were even frustrating and Matt you can see their face like why are you pulling me out you know it it just things like that you can't do that is not trusting your teammate that's not trusting your your your your player on your team\nYou should know what he can and can't do and to me they just didn't and that's what you saw so\nYou know the last game that they love so they get 'em game a game six I'm Sorry game five you know that was\nIt ... it didn't even matter I think the last game or to the heart out of the Dodgers and was over it was just ... it was it was more like a moral standard like hey for fans and everything I just don't let him celebrated on your home field you know what I mean one of those things but to me\nIt's just that they didn't have anything left in the tank and again you had your management who's holding you back you can have management hold you back in a World Series you on the biggest stage of baseball and I'll be quite Frank with you\nThey'll probably be just to make sure they probably make it again and again make it again next year I'd say probably aware and see if that there's probably no guarantee but I'm just saying they probably will\nYou know and what I mean whether they have the same personnel they have a good team there's no doubt about it the Dodgers have a great team of got a great talented team they just got management and upstairs\nBasically put in a short leash on them that\nYou know it's part of the problem but I just I look at it from a a broader view I think there's many parts of the problem here and never won yeah Roberts you definitely on the hook for a lot of issues that went down and why this thing came up short this year but\nLook at Clinton curse off for example y'all love our that you bought him a one off again another brutal postseason start for her shot and\nUntil we went to a championship Keith he's always going to be labeled as a very good regular season pitcher and a you know very underperforming mediocre at best posing performer that he just has never been able to get it done on the mountain and yet you're down to nothing rather the gates yes so the lady I mean all Dodger fan tend to feel that\nYou know it's just it's just their work and a half Dodger set the tone down there the whole night\nThe Dodger organization and the fans look I understand he\nIs the heart and soul of the of the Dodgers team these historic courage talk like cars are women are a long time and you know\nI understand all that but you got to let them go man is a is it is it time to play there's there's times to me is one of those things where it's just like look he is not the player he used to be\nHe's not going to be he's not a starter he's not up to your clothes hitter he's not he's a relief pitcher to me he's a type of picture you bring him for a good one or two ... two innings and that's it he is not the type of guy who could pitch Ninety to Ninety eight Ninety to a larger picture the night\nHe's not that guy ... not any more he used to be yes he used to be a study that but he's not\nAnd we have to understand that and I think\nDodger fans have to understand that I think the coaches that needs to understand that and after that okay we can get we need to get younger and\nYounger players in there we're going to use Clinton Kurt saw as a person has come in and just relief guy for two to three innings\nAnd he's good for that but other than that there's nothing else he's not going to be your not your play maker he's not that any more\nWas really clear this postseason that Walker viewer is more so a big time game reliable arm at this point which is crazy because it was just a rookie think Clinton Herschel some guys can just rise to the occasion\nAnd others just can't quite do it to the level that you needed to be you know you needed a performance like David Price from Boston\nDavid Price completely flipped the script\nOn his entire posted his career he did at one posted in key it's amazing what ... when you want a championship we have a couple of starts as a pitcher it's amazing how that wiped out all the previous starts throughout his time plus career none of it matters anymore throw out the window he's a champion now and he's always going to be known as the guy who got a dime\nAnd in a big way for this twenty eight team team so\nCrucial that's a major point to talk about going into the off season here is it going to opt out of his deal is he going to maybe sign somewhere else is he going to come back and be a Dodger for life\nThat that's a that's a big thing to look at at this point in time I'm challenging reuse gonna be a free agent or we know walk ... definitely the picture of the future we know that for sure a lot of excitement around him\nA rich hill is up there in age so as Alex would\nThey have a couple of different things to side what they want to do moving forward um but yeah the ... I just thought Roberts was way too conservative if you will put too much textbook I mean he went way too much by the book and didn't go on a limb we all know that at this point and it definitely cost them in my opinion a game for a Saturday\nLike I said I was there it look like one per week at the home run they wrote for nothing I skied I could've sworn I thought it was going to be two two and all of a sudden five runs in the ... um that's a that's a brutal of spot to go five runs I've ever seen and who you're pitching brag\nPlease tell everybody who was pitching if you didn't know\nAt that point in time they brought in a ...\nWas the woods was was in there\nI think Alex what came in on my eight are really got rough stop yeah and that was surprising because of how well he had pitch the night before on friday night um but the bullpen story the series it was that um the Dodgers starting rotation generally speaking not back\nWhen the bullpen came in Boston teed off they were having it

chief Herschel has into Wednesday\nThe thirty first to make up his mind whether or not he is going to opt out he seems like a guy that would be with one team for his whole career I'm at this point though I think a lotta Dodger fans are kind of looking forward to more so the future especially with this rotation where they have to do if Russia is going to come back\nIf he doesn't come back you know either way um we know he's going to have somewhat of a reduced role in this team AK you can't count on him to be a big time pitcher anymore I think we all know that that's the situation so I'm looking at is okay what free agents out their pitching wise because really you can make the case that they in another starting pitcher and then you need another bat\nI'm maybe about a little bit more than another picture um because like I said also real will be a free agent this off season as well I'm looking at Dallas ... from Houston who's going to be a free agent top tier picture when the world series last year obviously with the Astros a lefty\nThat the guy you could potentially go out and targets\nUm I think they would maybe look toward someone they can hitting wives you talked about Bryce Harper\nI think that makes a lot of sense I think a lot of Dodger fans are more likely to get on board with that one than many Machado at this point in time but they got to be bold just like they were bold at the deadline this year the trade deadline to bring in many Machado I didn't have to be the same way again because look\nBoston although they grow a lot of homegrown players around\nTheir big time I'm a really kind of like all star peace if you will that they signed the free agency which is Dee Dee Martinez most of the guys were homegrown overall so you do need the super stars didn't need to pay you know what I mean like money stew matters in baseball I think that's one of the big things because\nThey paid for JD Martinez lot of people criticize them move last year a but it worked out obviously tremendously for them\nAnd it took the heat off of some other guy lots of other guys to flourish in that line of and the big thing is and keep you know you're talking about postseason players the red Sox are just a perfect example of those type of guys that they had basically step up and whether it was Jackie Brad the junior Rafael divers in this series\nUm Brock Holt was huge for them so many question marks about this Red Sox team got answered\n'em and with exclamation points in my opinion and that's the reason why they were able to put it over the top and and when the whole thing but again it just you feel like the Dodgers had these big hole that they absolutely have to fill\nA ... again it's not like it's adding a reliever here or there it's a big piece in the lineup right you know and some other guy to add the rotation so um that's where they have to look again\nBy by many Machado in my opinion not looking to resign in ... in the outfield wise like we talked about before they're out with Alan from Dodgers digest\nMaybe they look to move a Mac camp at this point in time yeah and you know that I Am all on board for that because the current makeup of this team is not good enough even with Cory Seeger I don't think they're good enough to win a World Series that's been proven now and back to back years obviously no secret this time around but\nI think all fans would agree even if she was in there\nThat probably still wouldn't have been enough to have more firepower\nYeah I mean I I honestly feel that they make should keep many Machado but they have is a given take because he's just a rising star in his league like\nHe to me he made some great plays uh\nIn in the world series he yes he didn't sometimes when he got a baddie didn't make a play or he got struck out whatever they're having everybody pretty much but defensively like I saw some place some big play some big time place he may he may just as much as would return did or probably even more\nAnd so I'm going with I think they should keep many Machado however\nYou we mentioned need more at bat power I think you got to go after Bryce Harper I think that's something that you got to really look into for the simple fact that this guy\nIs was the this past season homerun derby hitter um champion and um he's a big ... is a big back and he's highly respected and to have that line of of the power hitters you already have\nThat's just going to catapult them and bring it to another layer level now postseason wise we don't know where he can do postseason wise but I'm sure\n\nNow say hello Rico San Antonio is talking about Dave Roberts Rico you're on behind the bike ride I\nSaid I was going you're doing and how are you\nI'm dumb dog right now I just want to say from the outside looking in obviously not professional opinion I think\nOne of the doctor's office that day was\nOver managed at times but I think the reason why over managed because with a lot of little bit too much or analytics rather their times just cleaned the guys in the lined up that could get the job done and also just simply making plays you know once upon a time people kind of quiet on the angels were planned quote unquote small ball\nBut I think eight that would have helped us and be like you guys were talking about\nParts when he can move here and there to a certain degree in short seven game series like that we actually had too many parts and too many players wait a few more glue guys here and there and a few less guys that will you know swing for the cuts is every time and we have to especially\nCapitalize on a one hour runners at second and third in scoring positions we just have so many opportunities that we did not take advantage of\nSpot on you are one hundred percent correct about that one we saw so many examples in a series of the red Sox had somebody runs this postseason with two outs timely heading you cannot won a World Series I don't believe anymore with just a hitting a home run here or there and and not to put the game\nThe pitching is it's just not ... not good you know what I mean guys aren't going to go deep into games as we saw as they have in the past that we referenced the Dodgers passed a you know World Series in the early eighties\nFernando balance whale I pitched the game where you had like over a hundred and forty eight pitches those days are gone and we don't see that anymore you have to have guys in your office of lab who can produce had to play for you\nUm and if you don't you're going to come up short and I think unfortunately for the national league at this point in time\nThere's do somewhat backing the stone age compared to the American league where I Believe maybe they've embraced the analytics a little bit more ... it's a good balance right core had an excellent balance between analytics in the eye tests in the series Roberts me way to textbook and he needed to be a little more\nI mean you know I I mean ... you know and the point over managing a you care over managing the world series this is the mainstay of the series these guys is these guys know what they need to do to end up getting you over the ... and I just felt like\nHe held them back you know he held them back from doing that I mean many times I looked at it I was like when when guys are in a group you can't just yank them out you can't do that and then you bring somebody else in who's kowtow just trying to give themselves going\nIt it you know is it a certain part of the game where you just gotta let them play and I just think he did too much of over managing so I totally agree with you that I got to\nAsk you though who do you think is the guy that that needs to go who's the guy do you think they need to get rid of or shouldn't resigned or part ways with\nThat now that's a tough one um I like the thought actually of keeping Machado if you could move secret a second I'm I'm totally okay with car so sticking around\nBut we can't rely on court Kurdish ought to be who used to be he is not a number one a starter you can't pitchman games won\nFour and then expect him to go on seven and maybe you can get you a a close savior there he's got to be your number two maybe even your number three I actually like what they did in the book series starting him and gave number two at this point your is your age\nHe's definitely your age um as far as who else goes you've got to take advantage of trading away some of those pieces that you can get something in return for\nBeing much see the ... Peterson um and I got like ... we've got to keep them around but he's got to start being a lot more discipline up late and forget all this shit he's got to learn how to beat the shift hit the ball and go the other way and beat beat it out where those holes are available for you\n... it was a huge disappointment in their ... and really did not have good postseason overall again he's the guy the future for the theme you just hope maybe next year when Cory figure comes back things can kind of balance south out but there's no doubt they got a lot of holes in this sign up by going forward hear Rico great call thanks so much we appreciate it\nThanks where they go\nOne eight hundred to two to five to to to I Want to make sense of football news yeah Keith and specifically Hugh Jackson being let go today by Cleveland why you know what I mean yeah we do is when you went on sixteen why way to almost a middle point of\nTwenty Eighteen and when they are almost starting to build something here\nIt just didn't make sense to me like this situation right here he got a whole new to brand new team and and you bring a whole new team of guys in there getting used to his coaching style he wins you two games this season so far I Would Pittsburgh Steelers diverse game ... arguably\nWas supposed to be a team of contention in a city you know um and and you just get rid of the guy I mean look it's just a tough situation I get lucky he's had a rough here on top of that his mother and his brother passed away and the same in the in whether it within the same month\nAnybody who's ... really got a glimpse into his life how things have been tougher exactly\nIt has been very tough and and I understand that it\nYou know you know performances matter I get all that\nBut you brought it in a whole new team for him of this season I think you just got a raw deal man I think it should they should have let him go this whole seeds and let him do at least let them go through the whole season and then\nDecide what you're going to do after that but changing them up right when he's brought in these other places this is his time where he really brought in his own way this is really accurately Brett\nHis first season with the team really uh when he goes out I'll I'll say well we say technically you know why because those guys when he came in you didn't hear those guys\nThey already did always said you inherit them or not it's the grew in Tony ... syndrome I ain't gonna ... you get the credit\nBut he bought it and he had to this was his first year of a of a draft of a drive to bring in some guys he wanted he made some trade drivers Landry came in he got some guys that he really want that he then he bought into felt looking fit his system and\nYou should let him the bottom line is this measure the wasn't should have been able to play out the whole season and they got rid of them too so I think he got a raw deal in the situation is fortunate I Hope he does get another coaching job somewhere\nUm people say Cleveland is a hotbed place to go I don't think so they're going to be pulling people like that [laughter]\nThat I Want to say that I think I've heard all ... initially how hot bed is out and they go\nThey just ran Hugh Jackson out of town tie Lou was just fire to let go by gathered Olympic start but Cleveland is now the place to go to be a coach why\nYeah this is to make any sense of ... we were talking about there that will be the hobbit to go\nAnd I'm just like absolutely not just the way the cat that uh the browns rather were finally able to own a couple of games\nThis year it it it's all bad over here in Cleveland right now you know came a bounce back they can we'll see how they do it but you got to give you all say this guy because he has a chance\nTo remember a chance not even build dollar check a winning Cleveland that's how hard it is to win there yeah\n... that's hilarious to hear that it's it's so hard I mean I'd ... whoever takes that job ... maybe it should just be Gregg Williams honestly they named in the interim head coach today maybe they should see how it goes and if the second half of the season pans out decent for them\nMaybe they shouldn't let him have the full time job I you know I I think the fact that they keep it in a house for someone who leases on the staff\nMight be more beneficial to go poorly outside the organization because you know he's going to bring in his whole new staff and they have to kind of start all over again\nBut I guess they're thinking I'm you know Jimmy has them and company that basically they had the quarterback now yeah so I think they're excited about may feel as all brown\nFans are and they think well we had him maybe now and then we got that point maybe we can start to work on the head coach that'd be better suited him I don't know I just don't like the ... season move\nI don't either I I think it's a raw deal I think it's unfair for the players I'm as well to get that type of deal when they're trying to get accustomed to his style where they're going to play and then you just switch it up\nBut my last thing is is I think the browsing to get younger and younger heck ... just like ... over there with the rams they got a young head coach it's time to get younger if ... if if you're going to go with someone go somebody fresh ... hungry who's willing to go through the battles and up and up and down those young\nAnd go with a fresh new coach and so even if you get that means go out and grab someone from college but\nUm I I can see them possibly grabbing someone\nWent to a ... a place at the end of the season when their staff members 'cause he got a young family over there I mean very you know in the office of mind you coach I think that's\nWhat I Need I think they've

good morning yeah so you know and when we talk and analyze the midterm elections we've talked about the strong and weak points for the Republicans are and the strongly points for the the Democrats one thing that Democrats brought up\nA now we think they may have had it too late but it's still doesn't mean that people don't recognize that especially\nIf you know this is this was a time of the year when a all of us I mean we here at at at our job\nAt a put in for you know benefits you're the last uh ten days or so a lot of other companies are doing it a Obamacare but you know premiums are are coming in now and we had said this back then that the Republicans left this thing wide open\nThat you know they did a horrible job or a you know when it came to especially premiums that we're going to sky rocket and we said they got to come up with something as to what they're going to do when they really happen\nAnd Newt Gingrich wrote an article for Fox News and so the twenty Eighteen mid term elections were less than two weeks away this was three days ago and many polls show there was a sizable block of independent voters were not yet made up their minds at the same time health care remains the number one issue for the American people\nThe best way for the Republicans to earn the votes of these undecided voters an honor commitments to the Republicans who are already support them urge to clearly articulate how they would fix the broken healthcare system\nAnd he goes to the whole thing that the should be Republican principles up for the book for America as a Republican principles for America's health and health care system we believe that every American should have the opportunity to live a long and healthy life supported by a health care system but it's simple to use innovative unaffordable\nWe believe that every American should up his or her choice of the doctors and insurance that meets his or her specific needs\nWe believe the healthcare system should be transparent about health care cost and quality of treatment options and that this information should be available to every American in a simple understandable wasteful patients can make better decisions about their own health we believe in protecting patients\nWith pre existing condition so they can obtain affordable health insurance coverage we\nLeaving the importance of American Medical innovation that leads the to the breakthroughs that dramatically improve\nHealth outcomes while significantly lowering costs we believe that a doctor patient relationship\nIs the center of ineffective healthcare system and it should not be disrupted by micro management from public and private bureaucracies we believe American seniors have ruined their health care benefits and that they their families and their doctors should make their own medical decisions not an elected government boards bureaucrats are private third party\nPayers are middle men we believe in a competitive healthcare market were private sector innovation works to strengthen public programs one size fits all government controlled healthcare\nInterferes with doctor patient relationship knee caps new medical breakthroughs provides less asked access to treatment and lead to long wait times for critical care we believe that the current health care system\nAnd America is far too expensive while it is very good at treating people when they become sick it is much less effective\nAnd helping Americans remain healthy which is equally as important we believe the goal of health reform should be to build on what's working and fix what's not destroying what's good about our healthcare system in an attempt to fix what's bad is not acceptable step\nTowards a better future and then he goes on to the Republican accomplishment so they go to the accomplishments [noise] you know including eliminating the Obamacare individual mandate\nOr the or a six billion new to fight opioid epidemic the past the right to try legislation passing historic VA mission\nOr the Trump Administration providing more affordable health care options for Americans through association health care plans and short term limited to ration plans so they go through that there's ten different ones there then they say the Republican promises for additional improvements\nIf the American people re elect Republicans to a majority in the house and Senate we pledge to enact a series of practical in specific changes based on what works in the public and private sectors to build a better healthcare system the system will keep people healthy and provide effective treatments and economic security for those who get sick\nThese legislative changes will and they go through the pre existing condition which really goes back to the block grant right\nWe do we do so by committing the resources necessary for states to try new approaches like high risk pools\nAnd reinsurance so everyone regardless of medical history has access to affordable insurance but again it goes to the states\nRed eye radio in our sponsor so devoted to trucking safety that's why we're proud to bring you the red eye radio million mile club for
