{"content": "Can any city put conditions on this new law because then it gets into the gray area as to what you can and cannot do because you know the local authorities are getting involved in this have you heard of any conditions that you think or unfair so far\nWell yeah I mean some you know some cities have they don't want to have you rented out for an ... so we don't touch that I mean they're\nThey can do that there's a whole situation on what the setback requirements are ... different cities have different setbacks a richer bloom an assembly member who had a companion bill two years ago had at least for Los Angeles area had a five foot setback for your a standalone garage so we're going to wear unifying that in this Senate\nBill a three one we're going to unify the five foot set back from the side and that at the back yard so that\nEverybody knows what they're looking at\n'em and and what's allowed so we again at the end of the day we want to have these\nNon permanent units to come out from the darkness and get permitted but also to allow the homeowner to say this is what I Want to do I actually went to build a cottage in my backyard and have a family member\nA friend or just anybody lived their\nSenator usually when the law comes out a lot of people perceived every law that comes out as to limit team everyone's freedom but this law to me sounds like it's a win win situation for the homeowner who can generate additional income as a landlord and also provide affordable housing\nI think this is rare would you agree that uh laws passed that that is such a win win\nYeah I'm I Would agree with you I mean this is one I have talked to different groups and folks this does not require a government subsidies is is really saying government get out of the way\nAnd let the homeowners and I every homeowner and wants to have a cottage in their backyard or convert their garage but the folks that do should have a a streamlined process to do it and then we'll in ten years from now I'll come back on your show and we'll see how is how is it working how many people built an accessory unit now is our housing crisis\nWhat is your estimation as to how many people may do this thing California over the next five or ten years\nWill are working number is probably a million wow\nWe we ... that would include to two hundred thousand other existing a debt as folks have and again it's it's sort of like the additions that people put under house is once you see it in your neighborhood and you look at it you you think hey I like that and this is going to go to somebody's party in backyard they say yeah we put this\nEighty you they have you know there's the private industries are working on and I saw a video of the other day about ... a cement ... a style are\nDesigned six hundred and fifty square foot unit that gets all the smoke gets poured in over a twelve to twenty four hour period proof that the building gets up and there's much lower units in the traditional construction so the financial community into building community and the architects are excited about\nWorking with us and and and trying to fix this situation\nYou know so many people say they have to move out of California because it's too expensive but I think this law really allows people to stay in their neighborhood and either move into the smaller unit or to rent it out so obviously there's so many more options\nAnd so you may not have to leave California because she could have a revenue generating cash flow monthly situation right on your own property I think that's great nicely\nAnd also on the front end where you know for our millennials it's really daunting to try to put down by a million dollar house for two hundred thousand dollars down and financially if they were if they were approaching the banks and saying we're going to\nConvert this two eighty you and this is going to be an income stream on top of the income that we have here and I've talked with the the baking community about about that then that\nOpens up other opportunities for somebody says I'd never be able to stay in Los Angeles\nGood afternoon than it had this is Sandy ... thank you for being here with us today we've made me appreciate your time\nWell thank you Sandy it's my pleasure\nYou're well can I wanted so I think you mentioned the amnesty program in fact timeline on that with the animals the how long would you not that ten take effect and continue on tastes so people can actually bring back\nThe stand on its face covered how long would allow that to go far to sharing because he went to an adult enough to eat\nAt a tree when we come effect in January one twenty Nineteen so I Would give the program right now would a set in twenty twenty six so basically eight years\nWow that's great for ten years\nIt's a duty once they started that ten years in the in the bill to to complete the corrections that needed that needs to occur\nSenator is there any budget to get the word out because we're running into people who are on aware of this a new law is there any a budget that can get the word out so more people can understand what this new law is and the opportunities that brings every homeowner\nNo actually there's ... there's not that it's a it's a good question what we're what we're working at it said we're finding that some of the cities are putting in law are passing laws that are restrictions that um that are ours\nAnd non compliant what the what the state law is so this new bill eight three one is going to have um\nA notification chew the housing community development director split before anybody passes a new ordinance and then it comes back so I Would hope that they would you know have that the website that that that will get in I Know that the real estate community\nGenerally is excited about this and that in another opportunity to have so they\nYou know I've appeared before them and talk with them and Dave and Dave said that we want to know more about this we want to get it so it's not structurally we're just sort of doing it with the with the real estate folks in ... nice programs like yours\nAnd also it adds value to your to your property if one day you do want to sell it because suddenly you up a rental unit or on the existing property so I I Would imagine a property values continuing to go up because of this\n... in it and then ... you can see there's so many models of\nExtended family were people you know when I grew up in a generation where everybody wants to get out of the house as quickly as possible and and now you see extended families together and you can see\nGrandma it in the uh um uh eighty you or as you said as you age you plan to it's a source of retirement income where you're going to build the eighties now and when you retire you going to be traveling and seeing your kitchen you are to live in the eighties you and ran out your house and\nAnd it's just it's just multiple opportunities so I'm not saying this is the one opportunity or\nOr a gold but people can start thinking about their\nReal estate investments in their home and how they're going to age\nWill senator thank you so much for spending some time talking about this new law because I really think it benefits homeowners who can now have the ability to rent out an existing space already on their property as a rental unit and as we discussed\nIn the interview there's so much a that needs to be done when it comes to housing and this is one step forward in my opinion to getting more affordable housing so our special guest today California state senator Bob ... center or thank you so much for joining us we really appreciate it\nPleasures all mine John what a great opportunity they say the ... I think that's a great thing that's come out with the Senate tests out with very instrumental\nBecause essentially someone can get that own property\nThat they felt tell the DSM ... cash they convene ... liquid die some of that act that you have and did this one time essentially using your own property and income bang you can become an invest that in your property on your property today without buying something and not the state\nSo folks reach out to Sandy and our team of construction architect and design professional specializing in constructing these gas homes that you could rent out on

alive and well and therefore being able to protect all the consumers in California I'm you know those ... down the road that have not yet been hurt and may be hurt or harmed in the future\nThe consumer eternity to California really there in Sacramento they're dealing with the legislature um and and again just to help\nPass pro consumer legislation to make it safer for all of us in the state of California and to defend against anti consumer legislation a cause that happens way way more often than people think so that would I Would consider its fundamental role um you\nIs interesting the the concept of trial lawyers and exactly a concept that people embrace Dave de nose or let's first thing you kill all the lawyers and the fact of the matter is that what trial lawyers live for is to try to help other people\nTry and make things a little safer try and make sure those drugs aren't going to cause harm to people trying to make sure that the stupid card and going to roll over\nTrying to make sure those sorts of things that's the whole focus of the organization I mean that's all there for trying to make things a little bit nicer be it of uh in the stock market of people doing\nManny ... and so forth are there was a very interesting case came down last week versus a\nPerson you want to buy all the school company he was a major shareholder Milan or buy 'em all and so therefore he lobbied the shareholders and got all these years and so for shareholders to begin thinking about it and they didn't think that um\nMaybe this person was totally fair to them and so they filed a lawsuit\nLast week the down\nThe church came back with an order that\nThis guy who's ... there's a hundred and forty seven million dollars for his shenanigans or fourth\nGrade and there was Mr Murdoch has to write two hundred and forty seven million dollar check and then this market change for him or is it is but it's not pocket change for the sheer whom drive that guy do out of what they were was rightfully there\nTom and watch a a trial attorney you're a trial attorney what does a trial attorney me\nNot to just people in general but what is a trial thirty mean to a specific individual we always talk about how you represent the little people against the corporations those who were agree what's it mean to one individual one person\nYou know Dave dino um that's a good question and the fact of the matter is that there's no nicer job because at the end of the day quite honestly even if you lose\nAlmost all of those people thank you gave us a shot Saturday and then if you win the hugs you get from people who've never really know and so forth it's I'm I'm indeed you don't win all the time or one of my first cases you know\nMr and Mrs ... so I'm a kid lawyer he went camping in the Coleman Lantern in the tent started leaking out get right on this is this for us\nSo I see the Coleman Lantern\nAnd I think maybe I had a little more experience and so forth things would have turned out a little better but during the course of the trial lawyers for Komen pretty much crews\nThat it was the way in which the Landrieu moose assembled by Mr Esperanza not anything bad about the length of time a trial but she just runs a seven months pregnant fill this hole the scars on her face\nOn the jury comes back and five or six were crying they sat in the chair and should we find him\nObviously that's just you know richer are down ... knows\nAbout four months later I got a little picture a little baby from Mrs ...\nAnd she's just home we want him to have the same court you know so we named him ...\nDe de how you felt terrible off when the jury is a ... or what they call each and are really did well and things are things are good\nBut it is so much fun to represent somebody and to you know quite honestly the trial lawyer representing insurance company I don't like the head of the insurance company I recall and says well you did a great job you know\nOkay Brian why are you in this business\nYou know I'll agree with that I literally went to law school to be a trial attorney didn't just fall into it I never represented a corporation I've always represented individual my entire career and you know my motivation was\nTo stand up for the little guy against corporate interests because we know often times we're the only thing that could stand between them and justice you know the government can do it it may try from time to time where there is yeah we see they don't they do not do a perfect job on drugs\nUm the national Highway Traffic Safety Administration they do not do an adequate job on regulating the auto industry so oftentimes we there's people like us on the stand up for that individual when you asked that question Dave about the individual um sometimes\nIt's you know someone kid we can be the difference between being homeless and thrown out of their own or giving someone literally adequate healthcare so they can maintain their life when they've been catastrophic Lee answered so I Love representing the little guy\nUm I've seen so much um corporate things that go on against them if they don't know about that it's a real honor and privilege to use my wife to try to make some last life a little bit better\nYou are listening to champion

know which you know we we will likely never know [noise]\nUh All right I I I ... I'm keeping up to date on this every single week just because I Do believe I Do believe I Do believe I Do believe I Do believe that my prediction we don't make many predictions but more than my predictions\nMay come to fruition and that is where I said months ago I said I think I Know what's gonna happen here with the whole NFL kneeling thing I think it's going to be basically don't ask don't tell\nWhere they the players association really encourages the players not to do it or stay in the locker room or do whatever\nAnd have the thing just slowly fade away because contract talks will well I mean the contracts up what in\nA almost two and a half years now but they'll start negotiating ended a good year out yeah so you're a year and a half away really year and a half year and three quarters away from the the contract negotiations probably starting\nAnd they want to make sure the TV ratings are going up and not sliding down because they sign a ten year deal so we believe that the NFL players association is probably gone to the players and the reps in say encourage your people\nNot Neal wow weeks for\nBangles that falcons all players stood buccaneers it bears all players stood lions and cowboys all players stood bills in Packers all players stood the bills kneeled as soon as the game began though those versus titans only Michael Bennet\nThe NFL player Who Lied to the police\nAbout the Las Vegas police or lied about ... light about the Las Vegas police\nAh was in the locker room ... Texas versus Colts all players stood it's only the dolphins only the dolphins ... a wide receiver Kenny still ... Wilson kneel during the anthem defensive that Robert ... raised his fist\nAll of the players to for the national anthem jets jaguars football players stood Brown's raiders all players stood Seahawks versus colonels three players were in the locker room for the national anthem so you just have the dolphins rent that's all that's left ... and that's all you've\nHad a after they're gone\nAnd that sort of fades away now that it's down really to one game because nobody noticed is if you're not ... no no cameras can be on you if you're in the locker\nRoom but you've got four players in the locker room and\nThree players on one team standing that's what you're down to now and I do believe it's they ... they just wanted to fade away they don't want any official announcement is just slowly going to fade away\nAnd and ah it'll be something that will be a footnote NFL history yeah but I don't think because you don't hear they've been discussing this for three months four months mhm\nNot you haven't heard anything about or the ongoing him worthy I'm going to go ... going on between ... and F a NFL players association and the and the owners sure I thought they were doing negotiations it shouldn't take longer you stand or you don't\nWell then I was no way to draw heartland in the sand no so you just let it go away and you encourage the players not to do it and finally money winds over\nYeah\nYeah that's right it's um I don't watch the show but I saw the story on a ... I think it was news busters that have the story on the show boilers on HBO\nUm\nI think Iraq is that I think he plays an agent or something but they were talking about the whole ... thing and the people who objected to capture Nick kneeling and everything else and they use some of course it's HBO so they use some language blank them\nAnd uh\nIn the in the dialogue and I thought to myself why is that\nThe story even for news busters I mean I Know news busters typically\nThey're promoting them or they're reporting on the media yes you know\nIf it were CNN saying that or ESPN which I'm sure they have\nWell blank them it was a ... blank the people that are buying so that people who objected to call you a okay\nAll right I ... what Eric I I've said this before though when every\nSingle person when they say you're not watching known I Will not explain to them why they go oh I didn't know that oh I didn't know that oh I didn't know that oh I didn't know that every single person that I've talked and there's probably fifty over the last that you know it's been over a year\nThey said well I think it's a free speech issue or actually it isn't a free speech\nIf you do what they did ... because of you know here's what it's about and here's what I object to when I tell them they go\nOh I get it okay I didn't know that I didn't know that I didn't know that\nWe live in an ignorant nation let's be honest the majority of people on the majority of topics are completely ignorant not our audience while they make a choice a majority are yeah they they make a choice to stay out of it and then jump right in the middle of it without knowing they don't know they don't even know what's going on mhm we talked about this on economic issues\nWe talked about it when it comes to understanding how government works the vast majority of people and we're talking over two thirds of people can't tell you\nThe three branches of government they have no idea they don't even know why we live in our society and why we talked about it and why we talk about American exceptionalism they have no idea why as I said before I understand why these people come out now and say America is an exceptional have no idea how it works ... ... ...\n\nBut I heard somebody else say they don't like it so they don't like it either but yes where that's where we live right now it's on it's unfortunate that in\nThe day in age and think about it I just I go back to when I was in high school and college and how you have to search for information remember going to go you want to have a question you go to the library it it could take you\nKnow I I you know I really need to find out about this let me go to the library okay I have to get in the car drive to the library ...\nYeah you were ... limited right find the find the right book there's the book open the book go in that's not the right book totally different but you've got ten books in front of you just to find out one thing I mean\nLook at the difference in the way the media runs everybody complains well the media controls everything actually they don't these days imagined back in the day that you went to a newspaper stand right or one of the machines All right so you had a newspaper machine and you put your quarter and and you grab the only one\nOnly one grab the only one because you don't ... to no matter how many coupons you need and imagine\nAt that next to that same newspaper machine were Fifteen to twenty two hundred other machines fact checking what was in that MORNING EDITION of that newspaper\nThat's what you have today yeah\nYou can the Washington Post can come out and they can put their story out or CNN\nWell and and and that's the thing we've talked to and people say well the media controls go whoa whoa whoa whoa whoa whoa one thing we we can tell you with age as we know how it used to be back then ... and not only are there more news sources out there\nYou just brought it up ... not not only they're more news sources out there\nBut you have to realize that heart access to information to find out exactly what's going on is greater than it's ever been before we were growing up and they can say whatever they want and if you want to research it it would take serious time to do the research\nTo actually know what was going on yet might we say\nThat people are actually more informed back then than they are today well because they did the basics first\nThey actually learned and paid attention to and knew\nThe basic ideas on which this country was founded well they were taught to base now you don't have any of that so what do you have\nPeople thinking I guess they don't have to learn it because they can Google it if they need it well they're not even willing to do that but when you know the basics of

Jake Tapper asking the panel yeah uh that at you know the saying ... ... ... it's clear now that the Democrats somebody ah in that party leaked right and there and and the response was somewhat right\nAnd\nAnd so you you know they did it and so Lindsey Graham being on the Judiciary Committee means to them that's in fury aiding because it's something that I Know Lindsey Graham has never done ... and there's a certain protocol that you're supposed to do understanding what's your role as a senator is\nLindsey Graham may be at times are part of what was used to\nBe called the swamp ... but as we know the swamp as involved in Washington D. C. uh especially when Republicans look at it are Trump supporters look at it or even Trump looks at you know what the swamp is and\n\nThat's I think what are the other reasons that Lindsey Graham was just so infuriated ... and why he led off at that at that point\nBecause the you know you you think about it remember first it was an immediate knowing he should be disqualified he's not qualified for this whatsoever secondly they hit ... an allegation an extremely serious allegation\nFrom the Senate Judiciary committee she got word of it she's the ranking member mhm\nShe's supposed to bring it to the Senate Judiciary committee or\nTell the woman look or I can bring Mrs to the Judiciary Committee but your name's eventually going to become known we keep it secret for a while but I Need to bring it to the ... committee and then we'll have the FBI do we keep your name out of it until then but at some point if you wish to continue then you know we can keep it anonymous in the\nIn the FBI in Korea but after that if you wish to continue then your name will become well known she didn't do that you know\n\nAnd so everything along the line of [laughter] who paid for the the ... you know a ... lie detector or the the suggestion of a law firm and everything that has gone and then you get to the point where they leak or name\nAnd\nYou know they they they link her name the people that were supposed to protect her and that has to drive somebody like Lindsey Graham just out of his mind ... as it as it did he feels he has been completely betrayed our point is you're just learning that\nNow when I was like Jeff Flake you know I I'm I'm guessing he thought at some point he was going to make friends with a lot of people on the left remember he was doing the whole to buy a thing when he announced he wasn't gonna run\nYou know this isn't this isn't a the way it should be uh the politics has gotten so ugly\nBut on friday he was being cold out and even after he decided to go to the

[noise]\nAnd as we know the terrorists went into effect a and you have many financial publication St ... OK here comes because the Chinese tourists have gone into effect the president knew that he had the administration knew they had until\nMidnight mhm\nOrder to get the deal a possibly past uh you know for example in Mexico you know before the the the president the president of Mexico leaves would they believe that would be no chance after that and the other point was they\nGet Canada aboard because there was no chance it was going to pass if it was only between Mexico and the United states so there was pressure on both sides\nAre Canada's been very quiet and was reading a few articles in the Canadian media over the last couple of weeks that was stating that was on purpose they said Trump can rail all he wants we're not going to say anything anymore we're done\nWe'll negotiate where we need to negotiate but we're not going to get in the back and forth with them because they believe that it fuels it ... it feels his passion and then support for what he is doing in the states so they said if he's just screaming and we're not responding\nIt brings all the rhetoric down and they said Jared Kushner was the one who helped the deal really you know get through on on a ... what the actual deal is we don't know but we don't see any major changes are in the free trade deal steel and aluminum or not included don't know why\nOn that one yeah and and nothing is done until it's done and the signed agreement will be the agreement\nOr yeah because it would they haven't even worked out everything you just are a lot like Mexico and I and I do think that one of the things is they they said look we got we have to announce in we had to announce that we've come to an agreement to get the clock ticking on this and we can work things out over the next couple of months\nYeah right\nBut that takes it off the political table and gets behind the the number\nOne on one of the problems as we've always said it is with the president we have no idea since he has covered every single opinion on on trade we don't know where he stands we don't know what's acceptable or what's not acceptable he's gone from a complete protectionist\nA and a much of a you know rhetorical protection is during the campaign\nAnd then ah he had the ability about two months ago to be on Monday a complete free trader and by the end of the week was being protectionist again and so when you hold every opinion on free trade it's tough to figure where the president stands and what this eventual free trade agreement will look like\nUh but uh if it's more free trade and it's not protectionist as he promised in the campaign and his supporters are happy with it I'm fine with it\nYeah I mean it's it because it once and I think we will get the aluminum and steel terrorists are those that is going to fix itself\nAt some point it will have to just the way it did during the Bush administration and it takes it takes a lot\nLonger for that process or let's say [noise] back in the Bush years it took a lot longer for that process to play through to the market\nThis year or or or these days I don't know that that's the case actually on on aluminum and steel because when you talk about the basis of the of manufacturing the base material for so much manufacturing you're going to have ... have already seen a number of industries\nScream over the the aluminum and steel chairs so that's likely going to play itself out naturally the way it did during the Bush years\nWell you had a lot of financial publications just over the last five days saying ...\nThe indicators are already in that the economy is starting to slow down in the United states and also in China because of the tariffs\nThat had been there and as we subtle along we believe that the president was absolutely wrong to isolate the United states if you wanted to isolate China because of their unfair trading practices yeah that you could win if\nYou didn't isolate yourself\nIf you ... the the goals should have always been isolate China don't isolate yourself because you are going to have basically the same free trade agreement that you have\nRight now with Canada Mexico and your role modern western civilizations but you're not going to massively be able to put tariffs on all of their products and they'll let all of our products Winfrey it doesn't work that way we knew it you're not going to get rid of the one hundred and fifty billion dollar\nA trade imbalance especially when you have such a huge\nInvestment surplus into the United states so we knew that wasn't going to happen and so to us we thought there was a lot of wasted energy in the administration trying to\nUh have such incredible trade war rhetoric with Canada Mexico when Europe when there was really no reason to have it and and with the Asian countries as as well but I Do think that when you see it you're going to see everybody claim their little victories here or there are already ... Canada\nSaying okay this is a great deal of great deals so they're going to be promoting their victories\nIt'll be interesting to see the media in the United states promoting what is viewed as a victory and as we said\nYou have to understand that when it comes to trade now a victory for a particular country is when the consumer has to pay more\nFor products yeah that's how posterior backwards we are on trade it's a victory our consumers pay more to say but somehow that's\nThat's the way that it is it so that's how it's promoted yes I was promoted that's the ... that have that the political positive right is what they say\nWe're hurting the economy slightly All right good [laughter]\nThat's because the consumers pay because the consumers pay right\nAnd if the idea is protectionism which it is for targeted industry which it is then by definition you're asking well you're allowing that industry to raise their prices it's not just about being the tariff\nIt's about paying the higher prices for the industry that\nYou say you're protecting and it's the first initial impact as we've always talked about the initial impact as when you see that there's an over supply in the market and they can't sell it for as we've seen with the with the many different growers in the United states\nWhen the Chinese tariffs hit and then they had to sell it you know that's what initially happens at rock bottom prices ... ah you know everything because they need to\nGet rid of it and then when the adjustment gums those prices will go the way up\nRight is that they'll go way up afterwards after you get rid of the stock the demon tore that you already have that you have to get rid of and that's why you had so many of the poor producers of Iowa killed over the last four to five months and because of those particular terrorists because they had to\nDrastically lower for as we shut all on a economics is simply how people respond to incentive\nThat's it right\nOr ... or you can say just instead of instead of one way distance that's it ... or anything else his opinion\nAnd the president can change that nobody can change that you can you can distort the market you can help one industry wall hurting another industry but you can't change how people respond to and send them a disincentive\nAnd so when you do that when you decide to raise prices you hurt the overall economy if you decide to raise taxes whether it's income tax or attacks through tariffs you hurt industry\nYeah\nAnd it's that simple and I don't decide that Eric doesn't just to get people mad when we say that well known some tax was helping the economy no they don't\nKnow [noise]\nThey hurt an economy and so I'm a I Can't change that you can't change that none of us can change if the president can change it all you do is distort the market in some way\nAnd that's the that's the only effect of it and then ... then there's inevitably that reaction against that because when the economy if the economy starts tanking\nIf steel and aluminum products start skyrocketing which they will by definition then the consumer is going to react to that with the consumer reacts to that the economy changes\nThat's when you have to have another political answer which is the opposite political answer that you gave for the first place you undo what you did eventually\n[noise] a lot of a of our listeners lined up to

term\n\nRight but the next year meet right but the six year meat would again that but you can meet and that would be a constant negotiate second that's\nThat's my point it's a kicking the can down the road right yes yes\nUh the exchange rate ... in a global first and have to pack includes enforceable rules to deter countries from artificially weakening their exchange rates\nTo gain trade advantages but the whole point is they said neither Canada United States and Mexico are doing that so it's not really a big deal a U.S to negotiate a greater access to Canada's dairy market as we\nSaid the president's talked about that a lot we're not sure what the actual cap would be on that but it is a small part of the actual trade deal overall\nJust as the whole thing with the United states has what the three hundred percent tariffs on tobacco that was going into Canada ... so they probably decided to do something with that the rest is a dispute resolution which the Trump Administration had to make some compromise is\nA on a here's one under the agreement\nLast month Mexico would be protected from any brunt of the national security tariffs the Trump Administration is considering on vehicles in auto automobile parts and Canada got a similar deal which means with the president says it's about national security doesn't apply to Mexico or Canada anymore but they still got to do a deal with steel and aluminum\nMhm\nSo that's where it is and it's also says that that uh the other countries cannot use dragons or wizards well as we said but older and we're making their shut overall you we we knew what you're gonna have you're going to have little victories here or there but the as we said\nOverall\nYou know Ninety nine percent of the or Ninety eight percent is going to flow across duty free everywhere else on every other\nProducts mhm and that's still has to go there still has to be approved oh yeah yeah it's supposed to be approved or not you know lawmakers still have to get this thing yeah yeah\nOh by the way they kicked it too after you know they're just basically gives them sixty days to get it done but assume that the Republicans don't retain the house then Republicans are going to feel pressured in December if they get this thing\nWritten up in done to vote on this and December\nBecause they're saying right now this gives them another sixty days to work out the details right and that's the devil's always in the details and that's where you have possibly Elaine con\nWell my point is this is mostly this has been symbolic across the board and write a it always has been ... that Ninety eight percent are still going to be duty free the president's not going to get rid of the hundred and fifty\nBillion dollar a trade imbalance that we have that's going to be the natural flow of investment\nAnd however that goes and you know we're attempting to protect North America remember the protection though it's going to raise the cost of goods and services\nSo overall if you look at the automobile terrorists depending on how that its overall and I have not seen an estimate on that you'll raise the cost of cars which will hurt if the steel and aluminum tariffs still remain that will increase the cost of goods and services that will decrease GDP yeah\nAh we've never been sure what the president wanted to accomplish\nA especially recently over the last few months because he has held every position on free trade from unfettered free trade or no duties terrorists anything on any products to fallout protectionist policies so we don't know\nWhere the president never stood on this to begin with a window when the campaign he wanted to get rid of the hundred and fifty billion dollar deficit as we said that's not going to happen with the free trade agreement nope\nAnd if you make things more expensive people ... will respond and it looks like that especially on cars the United states Canada and Mexico has decided for your benefit to make automobiles more expensive\nFor you that's one of the problems we're having with new vehicles right now the ... that's the whole point yet at the end it's only going to get worse yes\nGovernment at work but\nAt least Mexico Canada and the United states have agreed to gather to raise the cost of automobiles well what are instead it's yeah and what happens\nWhen the new the new vehicle cost goes up the demand for used vehicles goes up which means skyrocketing right up prices are going way up\n\nWhere you saw that already ... it's been out the less you know the last month or so that that a used car vehicles\nYou know the sales are skyrocketing the demand is skyrocketing which means the prices sky rocket and that's exactly what you're seeing a now you do have essentially by the time they get this thing done you're going to nail that coffin\nShut that's a done deal\nAnybody believe it's her previous ... ever going to reverse\nWell anybody telling me how it makes our economy better by making the cost of automobiles more expensive for Canada Mexico and the United states right\nWe're all in it together though sure victory and that's the big got it done by the way that the big victory and we've made cars expensive for everybody that's when\n... oh and Canada's buying more cottage cheese and [laughter] I mean it's just yeah\nWe're idiots [laughter] well I mean that's [laughter] became really are really really good price when\nThe price of a vehicle goes up\nAre you ever seen anything in terms of the average price coming down no the cost of government has been driving the cost of vehicles up for a long long time well the the other point that middle class families can't afford it and now\nMore and more as you drive the price artificially the price of a of the youth vehicles goes up you're also making it harder for middle class families to afford those mhm\n\nYou hurt the poor in the middle class the most ... saw an article uh that that came out over the weekend about the the the battle that's going on right now with the the big three well they used to be domestic but they're not for you out is not domestic bought\nThe dodge Ford and Chevrolet and pick up say I saw that yes where you know you've got fifty thousand dollar vehicles\nAnd now some of those trucks can get up to a hundred thousand dollars man I Love my old truck\n[laughter] I Love it because\nYou look at the cost of government associated with such a purchase and it frankly it will drive you nuts but it might also save you some money [laughter] rather rebuild everything on my truck than than go pay the cost of government\nRight they're beautiful trucks but when you when you factor in the cost of government sorry that's where I have to draw the line I haven't seen anything on the soft temper thing you know soft butter we got that [laughter]\nWell because it's often I mean the increase in construction cost here in the United states by\nA a also I mean it's it's a look it's the one thing it's the one thing that uh the great debate in this country we know on the show because we've been criticized for stating that increasing the cost of materials to build goods irrespective of who does it is bad and the response for many people know if Trump\nDoes that it's right if others do it it's wrong\nThat of others raise the cost of goods and services that's bad if Trump prices it will he knows what he's doing well there's never been a time in recorded history ever in economics we're raising the cost of goods and services makes an economy overall better you may help certain factions you can help this person over here\nBut if you think they said this is the unions are going to love the fact that we're raising the cost of building a car really unions are thrilled that's a good deal making cars more expensive ... making used cars more expensive\nMaking people you know how people what they're holding on their vehicles a lot longer now mhm my old vehicles Fifteen Years old some people are holding the average was it\nEleven twelve years now mhm and that wasn't the case and and so when people hold on to their cars longer that means what there will be fewer\nJobs in the auto industry and

that\nThat at that point Grassley and and and McConnell will just say we're done it's time to get a ... well that was the agreement then\nThis is what a Coons agreed to do remember\nCoons admits to sixty minutes last night uh you know what what we've already known and that was a deal struck by him and Jeff Flake and that it's reasonable that one week is reasonable\nIt's going to go forward band there by the way the committee voted friday evening\nThis didn't really make a lot of the headlines but the the committee voted friday evening to send it to the Senate majority leader Mitch McConnell now has the options open for the full vote right\nSo that's a procedural thing but there's a reason it was done friday night after it was agreed that there would be the FBI follow up\nBackground check\nThere's a reason that they did it then so that they can basically put it into motion they put it in the full Senate its hands and now the Senate majority leader McConnell has the option to call for the vote as soon as that report comes back\nI Want to play an some audio from place to nation yesterday Senator Tom cotton on I Want to play this and it's um least over a minute long I Know that maybe a little bit longer than that but I'm On a play it because uh on face the nation he gets into a discussion with John Dickerson and gets quite insistent that\nHe wants to let people know what's going on and wants to wants to let them know what the process could have been because as we know now Tom Cotton talking about the fact that they want Dianne Feinstein investigative Lindsey Graham is talking about the Republicans are saying that she did not do the right thing\nWhat specifically let's hear from Tom Cotton\nWell John first off let's understand why we have this hearing\nMiss for these allegations in a confidential letter to Dianne Feinstein and July shortly after ... having all was nominated the very not he was nominated Chuck Schumer the Democratic leader said that he would do everything in his power to stop the nomination and that's what happened for three months the Democrats have turned the advice and consent process into a search and destroy mission\nThese allegations are completely supported by any evidence what evidence there is thirty six year old climb all support judge Kavanaugh style but then the Democrats have disgrace this process and the United States Senate and the orchestrated smear campaign of character assassination they've run against judge Kavanaugh hair argument\nOf course was that soccer for an ass to have his health and confidentiality and that they tried to do that and that's what it was ... I don't know nine eleven now now now John let me talk\nTo you about that when I talk to your listeners about your views about that there is a well established process of confidentiality on the committee\nDianne Feinstein could've showed that letter to Chuck Grassley and the two of them as the leaders of that committee could have shared it with the FBI who could have discreetly conducted\nThis inquiry in July and August without betraying misfortune confidence it and they have betrayed her\nThey pointed her lawyers Who Lied to her and did not tell her that the committee staff was willing to go to California to interview her all that now all that water under the bridge those lawyers are gonna have to face a D.C bar investigation and miss their misconduct Dianne Feinstein and her staff\nIs going to face an investigation for why they leak that all this could have been done discreetly it happens hundreds of hundreds of times every year\nAnd the Judiciary Committee doesn't have a rather having hundreds of times with it with the issues that are the sense that this is science issues that are their sense of ... and not going to get a chance to talk about\nYeah so there you go ...\nI Want to move away from that because that doesn't look good for the narrative are", "show_name": "Red Eye Radio", "station": "KABC", "day": "01", "state": "CA", "year": "2018", "month": "10", "city": "Los Angeles"}
