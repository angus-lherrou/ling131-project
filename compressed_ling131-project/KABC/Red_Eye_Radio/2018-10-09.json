I'm old enough to remember after two thousand eight one block Obama simply said to Republicans I Want\nAnd I have a memory I don't have short term memory loss not dory from finding Nemo like I remember all of this stuff happening and now we're told that that it's bad if you celebrate judge Kavanaugh being appointed to the Supreme Court but\nHere's the part that's hilarious though Scott Kelly isn't ripped up by the right for the sweet instead he's written up by the left why because you had the temerity to quote Winston Churchill\nEach weeded out did not mean to offend by quoting Churchill all my apologies I Will go and educate myself further on his atrocities racist views which I did not support my point it was we need to come together as one nation we're all Americans that should transcend partisan politics\nI Will not come together with anyone who says I cannot what Winston Churchill\nNot going to happen I Will not come together with anyone who says I cannot or Abraham Lincoln because Abraham Lincoln or most of his career was a guy who believed in colonization of black people in Africa from the United states\nHe was wrong about that that was a bad perspective I'm not going to live in a country where I Can't quote Abraham Lincoln and suggest that Abraham Lincoln was he was not a hero\nThat I'm not going to make common cause of people who say that I cannot quote Thomas Jefferson or George Washington or the wide variety of historical figures were shaped by their time and held opinions that are not within the mainstream up today and I considered a moral today you know why because that's idiotic\nThere are two visions of how life works vision on the west is based on certain fundamental good principles\nAnd those principles were held by people who simultaneously did not live up to those principles in the fullest way shaped as they were by the times in which they let this is called being historically accurate\nThat there are lots of good ideas embedded in times and lots of bad things are happening\nAt the same thing that folks say about that did very often use this with regard to biblical criticism ... the Bible is isn't a moral document because it contains things that we would not like today so for example it talks about slavery and the Bible\nAs like right because the Bible is directed towards people who are routinely inflating people and the Bible is attempting to curb them from slavery which is why overtime the greatest advocates for freeing slaves were actually biblical reminded people in the Eighteen or Nineteen centuries\nThe point is that neither you see the west as repository certain eternal truths that we have not lived up to or you see it as a repository of evil that must be torn down and the same people were saying you can't quote Churchill or the people who say we have to tear down the entire structure from the inside it has to be torn down\nRoute and branch and then when we finally done and we can a retinue system in its place\nAnd so they'll tell lies about Churchill\n... Churchill said some very nasty things during his career things we would consider now you know he keeps racial school and on a friday of groups ranging from the Indians to the like from India to the student needs to certain Asian tribes\nThe left has done is they've taken those comments out of context to suggest that he was complicit in genocide in Burma which is not true to suggest that you want it to a gas people which is also not true and you wanted to he suggested using tear gas against people just save their lives as opposed to using bullets actually a and a and you know the ... so they take all the stuff out of context\nThis has relevance today not only because it demonstrates the extremism of the left and we're now at the point where you're not allowed to quote Winston Churchill\nBut explain why there's this big fight that's now taking place over Columbus Day so I'm a left the perspective as the Columbus days ... western civilization is bad and so we must celebrate indigenous people's day on the day the Columbus discovered has been yellow\nAnd on the right to perspective is Christopher Columbus and the west have committed a lot of sense but it is an eminently good thing for the world that western civilization found the western hemisphere\nThat's the basic argument it's really not about Columbus is about the value of western civilization that's really a route that is what the argument is about we'll be back here tomorrow with all of\nThe latest I'm sure it will just be more insanity over here to break it down for you this is the bench bureau show [laughter]\nTalk\n\nThe jugular station [noise]\nABC News is live and local at ten o'clock on jumped whittled Dodgers beat the Braves six to ...\nDay in Atlanta when their National League divisional series three games to one and the clubhouse afterward Dodger out ... so that he's excited to be playing in the ... the U.S for the third straight year and the Dallas by champagne by his teammates\nI don't know why they ever use registered voters that would be in his next time we get to on um got red ... rash and we're gonna have to ask that question you know why do they do it why not just stick with the with the with the more accurate one right which would be\nWhich would be a ... likely voters unless the questions that they asked to make it so it's tougher to figure out who will likely voter is\nSix months before six months before an election right up and and I don't know what that would be that they don't that's a good point yeah right I Am so um you know we were looking at some of the different analysis out there what are the analysis that I was telling you about\nI'll bring it back up here coming up a little bit later on the show but it was really interesting saying\nThat in a normal election for example that you know and this was talking about Ted Cruz\nAnd uh uh Robert Francis or working here and also it on his fatal not in in the state of Texas and it said that and and you were talking about the R. C. P. average went from a toss up to [noise]\nUh yeah they well they had the ... the state this is our state Senate race went from toss up to a a leans Republican and it will it end if it if the polls keep trying to the way they're trying now it will likely go likely Republican before the election and messy\nAnd they the some of the analysis I was looking at said six percent of Republicans a will be in an average election\nWill either sit out the election or vote for the other candidate ... and they made the point that if that six percent of it was just a normal election and that six percent which is a huge amount mhm all decided to vote for a walk and he would still win by five hundred and fifty thousand votes cruise would still hurts would still witness\nYeah yeah I'm ... and looking at the the breakdown of it and the the uh the history of of those waters\nBecause you look in El Paso in his district um and and El Paso county ah it it he can run for that house seat and keep that house seats as long as he wanted Beto O'Rourke\nYou when you move out to the you know the the broader much broader state of course the demographics change drastically um\nDallas County All right you might win that ah there's in fact you if you looked at the polls\nI'm sure Dallas County would show going for him Travis County Harris County so those are Dallas ah Austin and Houston\nAre respectively if if you're if you're not familiar with the counties but that's those metro areas are tons of support tons of money coming in from\nUh the packs but he promised to or not ah except uh in terms of that and and and not he well he promised to reject the the the pac money I guess in in earnest but you really can't reject pac money pac money uh ultimately I guess\nBut the the point being is there's a ton of a liberal money coming from out of the state a ton of liberal press from out of the state\nUm and of course uh the the make up the demographics in those those areas that we talked about a ... county in San Antonio\nOr same thing so you've got all these are blue counties and these metro areas and and that's that's kind of the breakdown of it and he'll do well and and likely win and those that were that were mentioned are and some other counties in or districts\nIn the state but ultimately it comes down to the broader stay as it always does and uh right now it's got it according to our sleepy leaning Republican\nAnd looking at a Tennessee uh uh for example you know as as we look at how did the cabinet thing and uh how might it have you know change the way that that people are looking and you look at the CNN the tendency race ah Marsha Blackburn against a a Phil Bredesen a British thing was up\nBy five ... Democrat challenger back\nFrom the poll taken just from the eleventh of the September to the Fifteen\nHe was up by five ... uh from the twenty ninth to the second black burn up by five and from the second to the fifth which took us to Saturday and write a note took us to friday friday yeah Blackburn up eight ... that's a third team point movement\nIn a matter of a a matter of a month and that's why we've always said we don't really\nWhen you see plus or minus ... ah you know five or even six or even seven ... it doesn't give you an indication\nAs to you know how the polls may tightened and this is the time right now I mean I'm Talking about right now in the election fight is when you get a much better idea we always hear from our listeners that polls are never right mhm that is an incorrect analysis\nOr you know\nPresidential elections for example you and I really paid attention\nA front in two thousand eight two thousand twelve and two thousand sixteen ... after the election saying how many polls were close and normally you find\nUsually a a three or four of the polls were probably one or two we're almost dead on and three or four pretty close then you have the you know some of the outliers out there and we always bring that to you after a presidential election but the polls actually do do a good reading in the ... there were a couple of polls that were\nDead on they didn't have Trump winning ... because they just do the popular vote they don't do the electoral vote\nA but they were dead on us to the vote mhm what Hillary won by what two percentage points right uh and so there were a couple of polls that were dead on but they didn't figure out the electoral college so they didn't figure out in those states in those particular states because they weren't doing the electro electoral college\nAnalysis right so uh but they had the the actual vote count which again we come to presidential elections from now on if the Democrats if a case of Cortez doesn't succeed in getting rid of the electoral college and that's a sign of a you know or\nIf that will will they started trying to figure out are doing more detailed analysis and ah because you've had a you know a a Trump you have this had this victory so right it'll be interesting to see what what happens there will go be going over some of the polls but yeah the un says that we're doomed\nUnless we pay the amount by twenty Twenty one hundred\n... two hundred and forty dollars\nTax on a gallon of gas okay by Ani one hundred\nNo I Know I here's what I Will commit you would you I Am willing I I cannot speak\nMy children grandchildren great grandchildren or anyone else in my family that is present now or will be present in the future I if I Am I live in a year Twenty one hundred will will pay that tax\nYou know it's going to happen to under some scientist is totally totally gonna mess that up for me\nHey we found a way to make your lives six hundred years oh yeah yeah yeah ... ... ... oh okay I

Can't just sit there and then yeah beam up to something ... which I'm giving up at all but you're forgetting word where does the energy come from robots to disassemble and the Adams of a person and then put them back together that's got to be\nYou know it may take the energy that that a nuclear bomb would create in order to do that for a human being we're assuming that the energy source is there

John trout is with us of course every hour\nUm and we we look at that and but when you read the discussions the the discussions changed drastically and those reports from the national Hurricane Center on Monday morning and they started to show signs of that and that ah Michael strengthening\nA and having potential to strengthen greatly late Sunday and Monday morning but then they sought there's apparently a sheer that's involved here that they said typically would mean that it's not going to be such a powerful storm but they said despite that share and I I read the ten pm central\nDiscussion on and it said it defies all logic that the sheer is still in place or this this element essentially that would diminish the strength or keep the strength from growing I guess\nI'm despite that and they think maybe it's because of the size of the I thirty five mile high or is it is showing great potential for strengthening so for our friends there\nUh in in the Gulf Coast in on the panhandle of Florida listen to the authorities listen uh to keep your radios on uh make sure you were up to date on\nThe information because the storm again has the potential to be and most are calling it now or

it's had some guys that you'd be called upon to make some make some adjustments and really being criticized for letting the starter the we set of Reno in the game too long and not pulling him soon enough\nAnd look Severino got rock tonight and there's no way around it and I mean this is a potent potent Boston Red Sox ...\nI'll just say this do you know I'll watch the series and I watch the game on Saturday as parents we can't let me tell you so I just think that the the Yankees had a lot put a lot out are the best they possibly could on Saturday that they just didn't have enough steam for the game three and that's you know it they were totally out of sync\nEveryone there was a what I'm saying is there was a the team that we saw on Saturday was not the team that we saw today and and I and that happens sometimes there's a lot of great teams they end up dropping the ball and they end up getting ... we've seen that all throughout the season of\nCertain teams just out of their character I don't think the series is over man like a lot of people think it's over because just because they got sixteen runs and they\nDominate them look the dominant that game but look\nThe Yankees are capable of doing the same thing again for they're capable of doing it now the kids can they do it\nI don't know what I just think they were completely out of sync I mean look they would they for quite a position it should come in at the end because the ... was not\nThere at All right so that just shows you that they just weren't they were out of steam and they were out of gas they weren't ready for this game right here and they should have known that the the Boston Red Sox were going to jump on them after beating them they bring them up and embarrassing them sixty two so I mean look\nIs an hour or two for a school there man\nI don't think the series is over I just don't I think honestly I think the Yankees are gonna come back again for and I think they're going to give them a better run for the money now do I think they're going to win that game I don't know\nWe'll see what what type of a pace they said in the beginning but I don't think you're going to see that team come out who lost sixteen the war in the night that same exact things will come again for it I just don't believe it\nYeah Brock hold hit for the cycle tonight for the red Sox and where did you know that no one ever hit for the cycle before in the postseason I really didn't realize that and I mean that's obviously astounding and itself and over a hundred year history of major league baseball no one has ever done that before and the post season so again there's another example how deep\nThis Red Sox lineup is my thing about the Yankees the key is there is no edge to this team\nAnd it's a little surprising because now they are young but without putting in their lineup should be on paper it really just hasn't come through that way there's no edge this team at all and there's something missing I Do think the series is over\nA tomorrow ... it was probably going to start for the red Sox and they'll probably be opposed by cc is about the which may be his final start in his major league baseball career\nAnd I just I don't think there's much left in the tank there from the Yankees and one of their pitfalls this year has been\nThe starting rotation at times and that kind of came up again today so I I just I think believe it or not I think when it goes down I think last year is Yankees team under ... was better than the twenty eighth team version and that's obviously a very tough pill to swallow for a lot of Yankees fans based on how close they got last year to get into the world series\nIn that game seven against the asteroid nail cs but um [noise]\nThis if they do get finished off tomorrow this will be a tremendously disappointing for them and I'm for that entire front office and Brian cash many company a because we'll have to decide what they're going to do this off season yeah the better part of this team and I'm probably I Would imagine they'll go out and look for starting pitching you that's the biggest thing but yeah I\nThink yeah the Yankees them is gonna be sixteen and one again tomorrow I think we can all agree on that they'll probably make it a little more competitive but I I don't I don't see them by being able to force a game five I think this wraps up tomorrow I'm at Yankee Stadium some\nAgain the brewers will take on the dodging the ... the Houston Astros easily swept away the Cleveland Indians so Houston is awaiting the winner of this Boston New York\nUh divisional series a and um I Know maybe perhaps we'll see a rematch or maybe we'll see the two best teams in baseball record rice here in twenty Eighteen um when it comes to

week with the red Sox and the dream remember I told you the dream Dodgers verse Red Sox were step closer and the Dodgers regard tomorrow the red Sox would win and there'll be a step closer also to the dream\nI agree with you I think obsolete look I mean to know you saw throttle wing and like I explained before the best team usually comes out in the best the five best of seven series it doesn't matter the format like I said you started to see that tonight the red Sox are just a whole lot better than the Yankees right now Yankees good team look\nLet's give Aaron Boone a little bit of credit this year they did some good lately but he he look he's not Joe Jr already I mean all to be Frank with you I mean this team was a lot more competitive last year with ...\nProbably should have gotten in the world series came up short obviously again to use them but\nI really believe that this team would have been a little bit more farther along which are already this year and I look I mean the

will be there the official tailgate for the Caruso center will be there and ah\nYeah it'll be it'll be but we haven't done a whole lot of remote I'm from kind of like in the field per se so we're looking forward to going to be good times\nGood times and I enjoy it like you said Mitch is\nIs a great guy and also um he was back then he was known as one top quarter back like you said in when he was coming as he was a big deal I'm a lotta people talked about that so I'm really great to see him I'm also you know it's funny red is actually I uh\nI talked to him today and he said that he's excited economy he's like I Can't wait to do it will be if it will be great to get back home to see how that is awesome going so it's really fun\nI I Can't wait to ask him if he comes back often or does is first time back in a while I'm yeah I'm I'm sure ah things have changed obviously for him over the years and ah the campus has changed and in some regards and for the better obviously for the most part so\nYeah it's it's always great to uh to have the former players come back and and chat and see what's going on with them and get their thoughts on the current team as well so yeah beginning come out against buffalo we know the bus or undefeated and probably one of the surprises of the pack twelve so far this season yeah definitely\nYeah good stuff to come there on Saturday from right outside of the call\nSam let's get into an NFL talk now are we saw\nTonight at the same ... took care of the red skins on Monday Night I just came was all about Drew Brees obviously in breaking the all time passing yards mark surpasses Peyton Manning\nAnd a look and we heard this or to exhaustion on the broadcast tonight or for his height and a really from where he came from originally and even if you go back\nTo um the situation when he left the chargers and um it looked like that especially when the dolphins decided to pass on him in lieu of Don take coal pepper it looked like his career maybe was was somewhat over ... cause people to know coming off of\nAh the shoulder injury where he would be out where he would go a and obviously I'm his career has blossomed ever since so a big win and I'm curious to get your take on this because\nWhen I look at we hear a lot of comparisons quarterbacks have only one one Super Bowl right obviously the guys who won two or more and somewhat of a different league\nAnd when I think of breeze though compared to a whole bunch of other guys only won one Super Bowl as in Brett Farr or Aaron Rodgers only winning one Super Bowl to date um compare that to Drew Brees\nI actually think that breeze has gotten the maximum out of everything that the same could possibly do like yeah those teams that since he's been down there I Believe it's just about right that they've won one Super Bowl you think about they've had a tough time getting the defense\nTo be somewhat of a competitive level that won the championship to me it just feels like that he has accomplished that were to me it's a different feeling\nWell okay so under ... quarterback situation I can say this first off you know how certain people just belong in that city or in that state they just belong there\nAnd Drew Brees just belongs in New Orleans you know what I mean he's one of those guys remember post Katrina he was the guy that kind of like was the face of the whole entire stay at that time yeah really he was the one saying hey we can get this place back to where it needs to be\nAnd so the heart of New Orleans no loves Drew Brees everybody loves him because he kind of stuck there and he stuck in with them and he gave those people\nHe he's like the heart and soul of the new New Orleans the he is and so you know it's just a great fit for him to be there um on top of that I think his career more I think speaks more value\nUm then they did for Aaron Rodgers and Brett Farr why because he's been at this franchise with the devastation of what happened with this franchise and everything that was going on in the city of New Orleans\nIs his just ... it goes beyond football and I think that's why he's like he's like an American hero in a way you know what I mean like yeah that guy\nAnd and everybody's pulling for everybody loves him in the league and everybody pools form everybody's happy for him because he was the underdog he was the underdog\nAnd everything and he always said and he said it today last ah today on on on when he was interviewing and talking about his son and a and talking about what he said to his son he said\nThe bangles Cincinnati twenty seven to Seventeen over the dolphin I thought the dolphins are really good but now I'm not you know I mean there there is so much\nParity right now and so much that kind of up for grabs right now in this league um but I'll tell you the thing I'm most impressed with and that truly does rookie class so far you talked about Baker Mayfield Sam Darnell continues to play well Josh ... like I said there for the bills picking up the victory yesterday\nA cyclone Barclay looking like a beast for the giants and the thankfully that they drafted him 'cause that's really all that got going on right now there are New York paid all that money for bail back I'm In I'm\nNot doing nothing they don't ... them into season they don't win with that and that's really been the\nBottle winter is not a winter that's the problem they should of they should have traded audio and got a two for one for him but he's not a winner and what he came out and said earlier I'm you know I see while somebody he's getting a lot of slack back and things like that because\nIt's just you know it's all about a deal is never bought the team you always got to put he can't he can't put the team in front of himself\nAnd that's the biggest issue and and that's what's going to tarnish his career that's what many people have said before you know I mean it's interesting we talked to Tim brown I talked to have a conversation before\nAbout oh do back up and he said mental do Becker is a great talent but the ... is oh Delbanco hasn't matured yet as a player in terms of\nHis maturity level and the antics and things like that and hopefully we can get that together and to this day even the amount of money he's making he still has a mature yet I don't know if he never will\nThis whole drama session with him and whether or not he's willing to to publicly back\nPay are at you lie manning or not back in and it's just ridiculous and I am obviously the emotions are starting to spill over a little bit on the side they're patch armor we saw that in his press conference yesterday obviously getting frustrated there it's\nNot a good football team and I I I didn't expect them to be a good football team based off of the only one to games last year I thought that's who they were I didn't I didn't think that was an outlier last season I really didn't um yeah I mean there are probably a little better than they probably could have one maybe like five games you know what I mean but there are below five hundred football team\nThat says they are all ... you know ... like this I think they're ... I think they're on paper they're great football team I think really let me tell you why let me look country why because they didn't prove they're in line they did they to me on and this is on paper\nOn paper you have a sterling shepherd you have an old do back home who who's supposed to be promising of a great top three receiver in the league and then you have certainly Shepard who's a great receiver in the league ... a great comparable receiver and then you got the the\nBest uh best running back or let's say the best player in the draft there's this past drought let's say going by Barkley is the best\nTo to me in the draft so I mean the the ... to be honest with you date with a lot of people go off and say he lies going off his brother and this and that is really not that good of a quarterback you always want a Super Bowl\nHe's wanted to I ... I Believe you know like how but he has declined though he's not he's still he's still a couple of Super Bowl is still a comparable player in the NFL and so I look at them and they\nJust got their issues is is just like the Pittsburgh Steelers issues is is off the field issues\nBut the problem is ... the Steelers is a multiple players on the giants as just one and that has been the main player on the back\nIn addition to that I agree it is definitely the off the field stuff with the giants and you're right it's just one player in back in\nThe defense of ... I think they've got a long way to go I it's not a good unit on that side of the ball right now and ah they've struggled mightily to get stops in games and it it feels like consistently they're given up thirty points on a weekly basis so um that's one of the biggest problems right now I think is defense and\nUm yeah I just think that it's a football team that's a long way away I mean right now we're seeing\nA just about all the teams in the NFC East struggling I still think the eagles are the costs of the division I think they're going to win the division despite the struggles at the moment in Philly\nUh because I just I think this is one of the more weaker divisions right now in football um I think it's probably comparable to the AFC East for the most part\nUm and um yeah it in the giants just our our team that I think it's going to take it it's somewhat of a rebuilding process there and whether they're willing to admit that or not it's probably going to take a couple of seasons to get everything right to get back on track so\nUm that's the latest there and um yeah obviously big wins yesterday for the rams charges get a big victory as well over Oakland I mean I ... I Know it's not plaster bust his first year for ... but wow I mean it is really looking bleak right now I mean they have they've got nothing going on\nYeah they they don't uh I think ... kind of\nIn a way he's got to get back to you know trying to figure out some things because he's going to lose the team for sure I think right now they just are given up man I think that they are to me is is\nThere could be a great ... can be a great team you know on the personality wise the type of personnel wise would they have and I'm Talking a personality meaning like they got some guys that got\nYeah march John Lynch ah you know you got Doug Martin ... cargo Marty Cooper you got some guys there there are some some true like hogs they can play you know and then but the whole thing is when they just I don't know the system that they use run is just not working for um doesn't fit what they do\nMore football talk as we go along this week I Do cook that want to get to Connor Cape can be the recaps from Saturday Night it was wild key well I Know you saw it you watched the very closely we've got a clip now we're going to play this can be post game after everything went down Saturday Night\nThis is respect sport you know this is not ... this is supposed to like I told the guys I Want to change is um I don't want to people talk about like opponents talk about his father light\nLike religion you you cannot talk about the religion you cannot ... known as you can talk about this stuff and you know this is for me it's very important\nAnd uh [noise] huh [noise]\nI think so much for guys prefer waiting for me here I Know my my on I'm going to ... when I go home because I Know he's going to her and a Nevada so to Vegas soda and I'll humbling I understood that undefeated this licensure\nSo what does it say at the end there about his father\nYeah so you basically say his father is going to be pissed pretty pissed off of what he did it because it's out of his character what he does look you know the question is to me but it does that justify\nWhat he what ... what he did was justified and you know what I had to say that I sat back in the ... when I first saw this whole fight happened in ... um Saturday I was like wow you know what an idiot man you just lost in matter of five seconds everything\nBy you popping off but at the end of the day you know when you look back at it when you start attacking them is the religion when you start calling in what he said was pretty you F F ing bleeping rat Muslim rat that you don't that's going too far when you started talking to religion you're talking a family\nUm that's just going too far man there's only so much American take man in the back and ... and ... and it goes back Brad to what happened in New York where counter attack the Bush\nAttacked the fighters try to attack it'd be hurt the fighters which was arguably one of the most stupid things yeah in sport encounter now got banned from fighting in New York and then you come down to Vegas you fight and then you start chastising\nTalking about the man's family talking about his religion his country um you just don't do that I understand you're a great promoting you know to promote the fight\nBut it's so much someone can take so in that case I I just I can see why he went off on him and then went off on his camp\nBut you know it's sad to see that happen it is but man I I I is justified to me\nKind of ... again you and I were talking off the air like his promotional team is is really the image they want to portray like they wanting to be viewed as like the villain yeah I don't get it\nYeah I I I don't I don't think so I think they just know that he posed to promote fights but let me tell you man this could possibly lose some sponsorships for him and because this is do you really want this guy to be the face of the U.S see somebody\nI don't think Dana light does not anymore yeah wow sassy while all kinds of crazy fault they're from Saturday Night ah well what's the next big fight coming up by the way you have the ah\nI have no idea was on a city will ... will your day your career ...\nMaybe problems would be the next big fight

the post wrote it and lumber go writing that the UN a climate\nThat'll declared in its latest report that we're not seeing an increase in hurricanes current data sets indicate no significant observed trends in global tropical cycling frequency over the past century and\nMr lumber said we're seeing an increase in hurricane costs because we hear that all the time right well the warming I mean look at the hurricane costs hurricane costs are more than they've ever been before ...\nHe says we're seeing an increase in hurricane cost not because of climate change but because more people with more well live in harm's way and noting that the U.S population rose foreign pulled over the past\nCentury he said declined fifty fold in coastal areas\nThe areas hit by Hurricane Florence had fewer than

Facebook friends would do it I'm going to rise above all of this no you're not\nWell simply let me ask you Mr Redford I'm or was it rising above when the Democrats out at Dr Ford\nOr was it rising

divisive\nAh when Bernard Goldberg wrote the book by us he talked about the elites are in in the media in Hollywood and everything else that believe they're not part of either side they just believe that they are part of the absolute right ... you know that they just believe that they're right in everything than their opinion\nIs above everyone else that in essence that's why you called them the elite because they believe they're on a higher plane of consciousness\nWhere oh we just call for civility and the way that we think and just follow what we do and everything will be\nOkay so they don't provide Redford here for example doesn't have to get specific he\nJust puts out this general statement we know where he stands everything where he stands as is addressed you know is meant for the Republicans and he's not insulting the Democrats here and everybody knows that but he doesn't have the guts to say right\n\nWell because he talks in these generalities that are straight from
