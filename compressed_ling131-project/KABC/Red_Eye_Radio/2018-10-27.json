I read brave new world last year and found it to be hilarious what are your thoughts on it and what are some other book to point out the laws and left yet left his ideology you would recommend well Britain world is actually a very\nPrecious take on what exactly a technology center he had an effect society would look like and then the the basic premise of brave new world is that there's a group of people who have basically separated sex and procreation that they are are drug to be happy with the drug called ... that they are\nThey they're emotionally manipulated be happy and then there are these primitive to sort of live out in the middle of nowhere as people used to\nThe question and brave new world really is whether the brave new world is good or whether it's bad it's pretty obvious that it's bad for people who live in western civilization which means you have to ask yourself why as far as other books along those lines obviously wasn't George Orwell or along the lines animal farm in Nineteen eighty four a post apocalyptic fiction\nI was just one was actually a book I recommended this week a submission it sort of along these lines of product take on what is happening in Europe I mean the undercover story of the year is that the European human rights commission they ruled today that it is proper to find someone for speaking against the prophet Muhammad in Europe\nAnd that is that is indeed a brave new world powers have when I was curious if you're going to be on a strict parent a strict parent on who your children date when they're older are you gonna let your kids said or marry whoever they want huge fan of the joke or something just returned and an idiot\nYou think that I'm going to let my kids date whoever they want kids or stupid\nOr possibly that first of all my kids don't get the date until their marriage will age because I Am not in favor of dating just for fun I think that that is a temptation to that then and I think that it is a it like I don't think that you get anything out of it when you're sixteen years old\nA Spencers that tape and what are your thoughts on the worst of modern Jewish philosopher such as Martin Luther Emanuel designer and Hannah rent well I mean you'd have to ... the closest to an actual Jewish while I don't know if we're workable minded that welcome to leave them out a hundred or rent is not particularly a Jewish philosopher she's more of a philosopher who happened to be Jewish\nHer connection to Judaism is is pretty spring Martin ...\nIs the creator of sort of the I doubt binary he says that that religion is basically a\nA conversation between the divine and man I like a lot of that I don't like you know I signed isn't very much Jeffrey says um who do you think will run Republican in twenty twenty four you know there are a lot of candidates out there I Would be surprised if ... tried to make another run I Would be surprised if Nikki Haley doesn't try to make a run in twenty twenty four\nAh I'd be surprised my cat doesn't try to make a run in twenty twenty four there are a bunch of Republicans out there probably what\nDoes your husband do you think a lot actually believes argument I was wondering if you could help explain the hatred of Jews from the radical left at the parade around calling everyone else ... thanks to well I think that most people on the left are sincere but I don't know that they really thought through their own arguments which is why I spend a lot of my time when I talked to folks on the left trying to get\nPeople on the left to recognize the consequences of their own argument\nBy what do they actually believe that route\nAnd as far as anti Semitism on the left I'd suggest in the dirt really three main types of anti Semitism in the world right now there's kind of the ... right anti Semitism which is old style racial and religious anti Semitism\nJews are inferior or bad or corrupt or greedy or communist because they killed Jesus and all of this kind of stuff that's tied number one and that's pretty terrible an old school\nAnd number two is Muslim anti Semitism radical Muslim anti Semitism which sort of conflate religious anti Semitism with ethnic anti Semitism I and you see that throughout the world where hate crimes against a rising in Europe as the radical Islamic population of Europe rises and third type of anti Semitism is what the stereotypes of it as a\nWhere anti Semitism arises for two reasons one second will let them like religion very much into the secular ... very often believes that basic ... that the basic\nDistribution of resources that it's not even means that the person who's more prosperous somehow victimized the person who was prosperous just happened to be more prosperous uh they tend to achieve highly intellectual areas state of Israel is is a wealthy state\nAdults will get done and they say well they must have gotten wealthy by scoring somebody else and therefore they're the bad guys in this particular situation also state of Israel is a nationalistic institution left does not like national isn't they think that international wisdom and globalism is a is a better way of life I disagree we'll\nBe back here next week I should be appearing on NBC's Meet the press on Sunday Morning remote from California I'm looking forward to seeing event and be back here on Monday for all the way to measure of [laughter]\n\n...\n... [noise]\nHave you seen you live in local at ten\nThe department of justice has announced the arrest of fifty six year old\nPhase are ... Florida in connection with the pipe bomb packages that have been sent a political opponents of President Trump correspond ... says site has reportedly stopped talking to police\nMm I've always found that fascinating yeah that that to me is like I Am no interest in ten million dollars I got nothing but I Am now but ... billion yes or used to be four hundred million used to yeah right\nNow now I I don't know I don't know what the what the trigger is now ... uh before uh twenty Seventeen players picked five numbers between one and Seventy five\nAnd then one number between one and Fifteen right out each player pigs five numbers between one in Seventy and then one number between one and twenty five this increases someone's chances of matching five numbers and receiving some sort of prize wild decreasing the chance of winning the whole ship bank okay\nWhat's more the price of a ticket has doubled\nSo your chance of winning has gone down but if you lose and you will ... at least your money is going for a good cause or so you've been told in the middle of the twentieth century\nWhen a lottery first started in the United states that were sold the states as a way to benefit the American public by providing additional funding for education\nThat means as the jackpot get bigger and people spend more money on lotteries two hundred and twenty three dollars per year by the average American in fact there would be more money in state budgets to spend on education\nThat isn't happening most\nI just played jurors haven't been using lottery money for additional education funding instead they're using it to fund the basic education budget and using the money that would normally fund education on other things altogether\nWhat's that mean states are misusing funds\nWell no they're not there [laughter] are you kidding may know the the lottery isn't adding to the education uh you know ... they're taking money it's it's going into the education budget but then they're taking money that used to go to the education budget and shifting battles\nYes they're missing writing funds yes mhm\nWell they're not misusing because not breaking any law they're just\nThey're using your the original they're replacing funds that they're ... misusing\n[laughter] and they're missing out on that\nWhich is why that money's going into the Education Fund it doesn't mean more education money because the other education money is being taken somewhere else isn't that what you just said\nAnd I mean that's what I read earlier that there are misusing the ball on is that they have now and this this money is going into an education fund but it's not actually increasing the amount that they're spending on education right\nWhat they used to ... they're they're moving money around it doesn't mean you're using money misusing money to me means that you are using it for inappropriate purposes well that might be ... well I Know know how I ...\nIt's it's it's money that's not appropriate for that that to me is a misuse if it's not appropriated and they take it from one cough or to the other that's to me that in the ...\nBut that's like saying if you have if you open up a new tax ... and you say okay this tax money is going to fund education and this tax money that used to fund education is going to go elsewhere that isn't technically misusing anything\nYou're not almost you on the line ... well you may be in line\nYeah you may you may have it may not be the original intent of what you told people you were going to do those politicians back then sold you one thing and politicians today by the way we had said this way back when\nThat eventually they're going to move the money around we talk show host back then said this was going to happen in a ... and ... and it did happen so you can say is the did the system\nOverall uh not tell you the truth over that period of time you would be correct sir yeah could you pick one individual Who Lied about Ronald Lee not\nYeah well in my opinion that's the misuse of funds are objects actually because it's allocated for this and that's what you some of them that's that's you you bring something to the people and you tell them we want to introduce this way of raising funds for this purpose\nLow income because remember they'll still tell you it's going to education\nBut not in a plug it is it's not adding ...\nRight but as it was originally sold it would add to the educated without getting you agree she would make it so we would solve the problems did you also see what was that did you see the attorney\nGeneral of a a vote Colorado saying that ah you know that overall state coffers aren't benefiting from the marijuana sales right because it's recreational things that people would spend on ... ... and other things\nWell it's funny because you and I talked about this about sports venues or something and they they sell you know okay we're going to build his new sports venue and it will bring a lot of money to this area well it might bring money to that block that the vicinity [laughter] that um that neighborhood\nBut it's actually shifting it from somewhere else in that area in other words people were making that because there's only so much money they have to spend on entertainment right um you know unless unless with the exception of the Dallas Cowboys where you have people mortgaging\nThere [laughter]\nIn front of city license for this seat license and typically they wouldn't do that before so there is that but uh yeah it's just you're just taking entertainment money\nI don't know if you know what would be of great study now you've got me curious\nPeople who are spending money on legal marijuana and I guess we could only include the the people who\nI don't know who are smoking more marijuana or just started smoking marijuana because it's legal what did they change about their budget what did they give up in order to afford the marijuana [laughter] I Would I Would love to see that poll I'm just curious\nJust curious if not Netflix oh come on [laughter]\nBut if if you're heavy pot smoker you really worried about a budget\nWell the money has come from somewhere [laughter]\nRight [laughter] okay what is it that you're talking now what's in the pawn shop now not ... not you're you're not cutting back on\nMonday [laughter] well and see 'cause that's that's adding to the budget so you're Cheetos slash pot budget where where's that coming from\nBut the judge just seeing a little bit about a lot of their we thought we'd start the show out with a debt and speaking of ... coming up with a little bit we'll talk about Mr pot ... John painter did you ever think you'd call him Mr Potter\nYeah here's a guy who didn't like messy so he went to work for a tobacco [laughter]\nWell you remember he was completely against legalization of pot you know and now he makes his money off\nIt and you know what's interesting is this started a while back I mean this this\nIs the company that that is with right I mean he\nI remember when it first broke that this was I don't know either earlier this year last year where they were saying you know he's evolving grappling whatever that was that they you know with with the Obama and gay marriage um he's grappling he's evolving but he's changing\nOn his opinion on [noise] well yeah he's in the private sector working for a company who's going to benefit from it is going to get a paycheck from it so now he's for it\nWell you know the ... remember he he was one of the reasons that the term the swamp was calling a swamp that he's currently in yeah if the DEA flies over at Belden\nHey a swamp ... that that would be a good environment right lots of natural water\n[laughter] well no I'm I'm thinking about where I live and I don't think they found any big pot farms around there now but it's quite it's quite a swamp the area and so there's a lot of there used to be a lot of grow areas you know within like a ten mile radius illegal grow area illegally are not legal in our state yes illegal grow area\nI haven't seen one and a few years so I'm probably five or six years I haven't seen right where right where they have I don't know if the technology has got better but I mean they were quite sophisticated\nIn a row in some of these huge that boggles the mind that they\nThey just have these huge in the middle of a you know metroplex not middle but I mean how you deal but but still you would think somebody would discovered before it induced\nAnd helping right in the middle of extremely large suburb right there might be a lot of wild area right right yeah you know just a 'cause Dallas Fort Worth is quite spread out but I haven't seen that in a while but I remember they had like two or three ...

Ninety of red eyes [noise] ah you know I just I saw this article I I\nI bought it was worth bringing up 'cause we talked about the midterms and the the tax cuts and everything else when the president promising more tax cuts are coming up following a you know the the the election even in the lame duck session\nBut the the hill dot com or talked about\nLatest poll the American barometer survey and before you say look that's a big pool because everybody loves the tax cuts even if they won't ... let me first of all through the numbers a majority of Americans want President Trump's tax cut to be made permanent or left alone ... and allowed to expire according to a new American barometer survey\nThe poll a joint project of he'll TV and Harris ex bowling company found that twenty seven percent of respondents want the plan to remain permanent\nTwenty nine percent sort of should be left alone and allowed to expire forty four percent of the respondents said the plan should be rolled back and you're saying wait a minute forty four percent that seems pretty high doesn't it right want the tax cuts rolled back right\nWhen you have close to fifty percent of people that pay no income tax why would that be surprising right they saw no benefit out of the tax cutting and they're not paying mhm so that isn't surprising at all\nAs to other folks are there and and again we we always asked this question um and this is on on the tax cuts\nCertain districts and we if you listen to the show for a while you know we said this the danger this could cause especially in house races that are read in high property\nTax and income tax areas\nAnd this is the fact that I Know and and again I live in a I don't live in any extravagant mansion the my house is twenty three hundred and forty square feet not tiny not like the house I grew up in ... was you know with my parents the first house which was probably I dunno\nThousand square feet eleven hundred square feet ... was tiny a but still I live in a you know middle class or middle class section I Am with property taxes and sales tax I'm butter sheen off right against that ten thousand dollar limit\nRight and\nMy property taxes maybe a little higher but we have no income tax\nHere whether there is no state income tax and uh in in Texas\nBut we have always worried about the Republican tax plan not because Eric and I not for that reason but for other deductions of you and I can't take because of business interests were in not because you and I have to pay higher taxes because that's the even though you and I have to pay higher taxes that's not going to change the way that were voting\nRights not going to change the way that we plan on voting at all we're not talking about us we're talking about a significant portion of people out there that are having to pay higher taxes in that plan because they live in a high tax state and they may live in a Republican district\n\nBut if you see some of these districts in these in these blue states but even in in some even in Texas there are a ton of people that may be hit oh yeah because you because you have that cap on it mhm you could give tax rates\nVery\nYou know from you you can go just a from where I live to just ah you know several miles north and the tax rate varies greatly yeah and then of course the value of the home yeah that influences\nThe model now that I bought my tax rate in my town is higher than a quite a bit higher than yours I Believe I'm\nA yeah my my tax rate is is very low which is why it's one of the most attractive areas in terms of people moving to it um but even aside from that if you've got a a home that's worth more than ... your your taxes are higher\nAnd lower rate right so when when you see that and you see the number of of of people and and

dominating\nTheir their mindset as the Republicans are right now I still think the Republicans going stronger ... mid term when a party that has you know the the both branches of the legislature and

normally would lose a the seats and it looks like that you know there's still a ton of toss up what's two oh five two hundred and thirty toss up still two oh five for the Democrat right now we have

I I just I really do think it changes it a whole lot to and not saying this Boston team that is not ready for something like that but still it doesn't matter how good you are of a team you're going to be a little shaken by something like this a marathon gained like you said keep all the effort that being exhibited\nAt to come up short regardless of how things pan out the act it's still tough it's still tough to get over the next you know for a second so I just I really do think the Dodgers\nWould have a tremendous momentum if they're able to\nSomehow some way it's part of victory tonight\nWell look if they pull up to ... really all that counts they pull out the victory to me that's really what altogether I think that's where everybody's really focused on that's already got thousands still at the stadium right now because they were hoping they pull out this victory\nBut it's going to come down this game's going to come down to a man to one mistake even the infield right here they get it out which is great to see 'em but they just need to control these these lies I think it comes down to these wires\nAre two innings man I don't think it's going to go more than two innings I think just come down for the last two innings right here\nAnd I think it's really is just the will to win at this moment in time I think that it really is no strategy here no more so all the analytical crap that Robert ... been doing it earlier and all that a strategy is out the window now because right now is just really who could put the bat\nOn the ball that's really what it is about so hopefully the Dodgers you can do that in the next any man I mean I just got to\nJust say when they turn or where are you man like no sightings he's been held a jak like come on man Red Sox pitching as ... and\nThey have not allowed him to beat them and uh basically it's just been\nThey've got and Boston has had their way in this series with keeping the claims down on the Dodgers 'em up and which to me\nHas been a little surprising just because the Dodgers found ways to hit Milwaukee Indiana else yes and especially that Milwaukee bullpen they were able to come up with some ... I Am a little surprised at how much the we knew the red Sox Renee hitting the series we knew that could happen as well as the hedge because they had guys who\nAlthough they corrected some demons this postseason like David Price for example who pitched in game two um they still had guys who were in the including ... started this game tonight I've been impressed how dominant they've been I think that's been really wanted to stories\nOr has to be the main story of this World Series that the Dodgers had been such held in check so I'm with that being said though\nI think they have kind of showed their grid here tonight ten or they have scratched and called their way to make this a Fifteen any game negative mistake about that so we're often running on this Friday night here on KBC radio we're going to mix it a little football discussion tonight as well top of the fifteenth that's where we're at right now\nIt is too tied at two ... on the hill a runner all first base will keep you posted back with more after this\nHi it's Alan ... and I carry teeth and meet some legal moral or just common sense advice they can't even think there'll be faster than I did see when we open up the discussion tackled difficulty she's in late in life that's right you've heard of Murphy's law but have you heard of ... anything that can go wrong you can also go right and we go at it with\nSome of the greatest legal minds in the country it's the intersection of a lot in life I don't miss it Saturday he right here on TALK radio seven Ninety K.

periscope Facebook Live to live you name it we're covering the gamut on line bringing you all angles of the program right now so\nBack to some college talk for a moment obviously we keep it boasts of what's going on over a Dodger Stadium but we're talking about before the break the initial college football player and he's coming out on Tuesday Alabama her off this week\nSeemingly a lock for number one I clumps in I thought\nBest chance to lose keys was probably last week against North Carolina state\nOr because they were ranked and and the best thing they really had faced all year ah but they bloom out of the water forty one to seven so really at this point I clubs is going to run into I mean it really it is set by all accounts I mean unless you really believe that Ellis you can beat Alabama\nI'm madly so it's possible it's possible they got to puncture his chance at least on the game is in death valley so you don't know um but I just do continue to believe that um I I think that to a ton of a low is going to be the Heisman Trophy winner um and he is the difference\nBetween um this team being I you know a a very good football team was jailing hurts a quarterback in my opinion to a um you know a phenomenal football team with two\nAt under center that that's really the difference to me because ... um excuse me in jail and hertz is very good um but I just think that to act as an extra dimension to them\nAnd that's why they've just been over the top phenomenal and just blowing out everyone so far this year so that's obviously the game next week I mean everyone's going to be tuned into that um because of Alabama beats them we know you can pencil Alabama in\nTo the playoffs yeah no question about that Clemson I don't think anyone's going to beat them I mean the ACC is down look we've talked about so much and I think Notre Dame is going to run the table at this point because of ah they're fairly easy schedule coming down stretch here as well it just leaves one flight\nOr even among us see is a fairly easy game for them bread and says what you're telling me\nRight now yeah I Do at the moment [laughter] now that's a couple of weeks away about a month away actually November the twenty four things can change between now and then but I don't I still don't think at this point in time that you would see would have enough to take down the Irish but things can change a lot of\nTime maybe always plays Notre Dame to northwestern you just never know what that team floors they know let me tell you what that Syracuse team though Syracuse as as a potential to do something um they always play teams very tough\nUm I Believe a you know Syracuse\nThey played um they had a they play Clemson and actually lost a Clemson twenty seven and twenty three so you know I I don't want to but I'm not going to say they can't compete with a Notre Dame I think they definitely can and you never know what can happen in that game so I think ... gotta probably out of the top three\nTeams are the tougher road to go through um than the rest of the teams but a look\nAt LSU beat Alabama loses or wind beach Ehlers you then yes I think they're run the table I think the ... doesn't have enough I don't care what rivalry game that that's a rivalry game within itself and all that stuff\nThey just don't have enough to be in Alabama I'm the only team really in this game on their schedule right now they can actually compete with them and actually upset them Israel issue and that doesn't happen then yes pencil them into the playoffs\nAnd pencil them probably going into the national championship against murder de ... the team that I\nKnow I I I'm with you I mean it's definitely possible the team I'm watching it at the moment for that fourth playoff spot you actually do you think it's tax is really because taxes right now is in prime position had sex with just one loss and their schedule is\nBurn a Mars doing his thing once again a he's a phenomenal performer man for knowledge is amazing job um that the Dodgers trying to perform here in uh in the late stages if you will the very late stages of game three sixteenth\nEnding you have the big guns coming up once again ... week the reason why we're still playing at this point is is the ...\nLet me show you know when the ballpark I can tell you that I uh I'm I'm for making a\nPrediction right now a Dodger fans you are so pleased about to hit it over the fence he's going to do this anymore I hear talk to your bat yeah still my friend had it let's go\nLet's get into some NFL picks for this Sunday Coming up we'll start with the rams over the coliseum there are a host or hackers skied or coming off of a by no one embraced by probably more than Aaron Rodgers to let that need heal up a bit\nI'm at this point I just I mean we know he's that entire team I met she goes they will go a this is a tough spot for them to come into here against a rams Tina clicking on all cylinders they've shown no signs of slowing down over the past couple of weeks\nThere obviously the last team left undefeated in the NFL\nDoes the train keep rolling again this week\nMay I'll say this will be a tough task but obviously like I say um [noise] you got Aaron Rodgers reserves or her knee and man their defenses prolific uh I think ah I think it keeps rolling man I think they get it done\nUnless you are now and I just I I don't think I honestly I mean this team could probably started tend to do at this point yeah they are favorable on the schedule we're all circling\nThe chiefs rams match up in Mexico city yes in November I mean that is the one that everyone is paying attention to at this point in time as a it'll be the toughest task to date of the seats nothing to them\nI think they're probably going to start ten eleven or no I just see no nobody really on the schedule coming up in the next couple of weeks for this team that potentially\nCould knock them off I mean there's some teams you could give them a bit of a run obviously they got the saints coming up next week in the dome in New Orleans that's a tough task\nSeattle comes in this week or excuse me in a couple of weeks to the coliseum um but I I just don't see it I think they they'd be both those teams and then the chief snatch up on November the nineteenth and if they get past that Keith\nLookout because maybe we're talking about this team still undefeated at that point and we know the territory that it comes with that stuff but\nYou know nobody really wants to\nOne wants to relinquish shot you know a ... undefeated record as it's going well nobody wants to allow you know mercury in bars and the Miami Dolphins in Seventy two to to a crack open the champagne bottles no one wants to see that party they always want to keep those bottles stowed away yeah of\nCell but this is a special rams team and we see it right now I mean they have been the most solid team top to bottom all three phases of the game so far this season\nAnd uh like I said I think Sean McVeigh has really just risen through the coaching ranks as far as like I'm comparing him some of the top coaches in this week I mean he definitely cracked into a a a very select few list I think at this point he's regarded as one of the better coaches down the league and and that's impressive to do only in the second\nYeah the question is do do the rams needed drop again for the sake of knowing okay fine with a family\nFeet and how to bounce back from me there's something you know said for that\nMean if you're a good football team and you know you play to win the game not to sound like her mad words and all but you know you do and I I just I don't know it's like you certainly have to\nUm lose the game I mean there's something to that to you know kind of get you know the nerves ... to get out of you are a little bit but I think sometimes we just think too far into that we talk about trying to outsmart ourselves sometimes\nI think sometimes people think too much into that one well\nLook if if if that was the case I think if the rams were to lose the game is great that they lose early than later\nUm but this team right here like you said they they are going to be rolling man they they\nI think the rest is what they needed to heal some of the guys up um and I think are right now man they got a great situation um that they're in right now and hopefully they can they can really push forward and and get it done against or a Packers team that's really a banged up Packers team on top of that\nWho's also still trying to find their identity I mean really there are only identity is Aaron Rodgers right now and he's a he has a bank to me and you can move\nA you know side to side so I'm\nHopefully they can get it done where they can get it done and gives a her erasures um but it's going to be I must say this is gonna be a tough game that as long as Aaron Rodgers is on the field it will be a tough game he's not you can never count up the Packers\nChargers Rona by this week they get back at it next week against Seattle let's run through some of these games coming up on Sunday I Will start with the London game between the eagles and jaguars to teens desperate of a need to get done\nMan you know what I look at this game right here I'm going to say the eagles get it done\nA than the Jacksonville Jaguars why um Jacksonville got a ... who's on who's on\nBasically a choked chain right now and you got a them pleaded real and you gotta you gotta a defense that's calling each other out in the media and what not and and really you know it's just a disarray right now\nUm they honestly I got like Jacksonville should win but I just things have really W eagles would probably get it done they know it's a Muslim returning Superbowl champs and they know they need to win here to keep them in the running or even just getting into the playoffs so I'm gonna go with a Philadelphia Eagles\nI'm with you on that one key I and I think you can pretty much stick a fork in Jacksonville as far as having a serious shot it they're not winning this division I have three and five and she's not going to especially with the way Houston is playing right now I don't even know if the jaguars are going to make the playoffs\nReally I think that my I just I don't think they'll make the playoffs are they look I think it was my break borders and not playing well right\nNow but I think at the end of the day I think they'll put it together they need to really uh when they need the wind to get them going back up again I think they can definitely get them with their schedule and um\nI can see them getting a wild car raise the problem is with the scary thing about is do you want to play uh Jacksonville\nIn the first ... or you know first round for a Kansas senior league with the ... yeah I'll probably Jacksonville right now I mean right now very our and I'll take right now yes but if they get they get to a point where they're getting back you just never know you know what I'm saying ... back we are now all of them would ever going to be healthy\nAgain this year that's that's a big question mark Baltimore at Carolina a Baltimore coming off the top last last week against New Orleans do they bounce back\nYes of course they bounce back um one thing about Baltimore is there a veteran ...\nThey got Flaco they got even do edition of John Brown um they got some players on that team that\nHave lost before you know how to bounce back that's a beautiful thing about experience and veterans um but this team definitely bounce back there'll be right back where they're at 'em so they had a hiccup this last past week but I'm the Baltimore Ravens we'll be back for sure pick into\nThe game of the week is the saints at the Vikings a rematch of last year's divisional playoff game are we going to see any other miracles happen this time you know\nThe only miracle because he is a W we want to see a basically a W\nOn the same side in the last on the on the Vikings side why there this is a team that's going for redemption they know they ... the last game against the Vikings and uh I think they're going to come out there it really put it to them and let people know hey\nThat was really a fluke and for 'em and they know that look we're going to be facing the rounds in a in a final and we're looking to beat them so I'm going with the saints man I think they're going to be on the mission right now\nThe Monday Night game features the patriots and bills Derek Anderson is going to get to start again is there any life for the bills at this point\nNo there's no life for themselves and their lives in that game man come on\nThat's brutal Monday Night magic for ESPN on if you had that as a rough or off not over the last time they were actually in Buffalo for Monday and I can't yeah been quite a long time\nIs very long time and is very long time and there are bills which they've I won't be surprised they lose by for touchdowns\n[laughter] awesome week here on behind the my great job to everyone we're back at it better than ever next week Keith and Brad dad going strong and um yeah they'll have a great weekend

according to the United states attorney Jeff Berman\nBut I just can't stand mhm so we're not even talking about when you actually talk to you know Democrats out there it's it's like when I and I mentioned this on yesterday show when I talked to a a relative through marriage who is a professor over the summer\nAnd I knew that never been told me you know he's really liberal and everything else he knows a few people that I Know when they say you guys really liberal we had a great conversation for over an hour\nAnd he told me you know he the the the campus that he's on he said unbelievable 'cause I I'm not that kind of liberal and I had a discussion we actually sat down and I said the same thing we look at Trump's has done this\nThis and this and this and I went through all the different issues I said he's a moderate\nTo a moderate conservative and I said you know the tax cut you know\nProbably would make them the most conservative and so I mean uh I can see anger from a traditional liberal on the corporate tax I said but we've always do that as bogus and control maybe you know on on what border control well not not a border control from what from what Democrats how they didn't just ten years ago well and\nAnd really not a you know you have to walk that back not with where the majority of America stance\nOr Jordan America to control al stand with him so that would be ... well Trump was out yesterday promoting what Obama said in two thousand five ... ...\nWhich sounds exactly like Trump mhm exactly I mean there's no difference in how Democrats sounded ten to Fifteen Years ago mhm\nUh you know even as recently as six seven years ago then then Trump sounds that were exactly the same and and when I brought him down and comparing this to today's goal posts which has moved tall which moved lately yeah exactly but he is professor\n... said yeah I Know it goes his he's because he's not as bad he goes you know again I Can't stand how he talks but yeah he's really not that he's he's really not that bad I mean an end and I said I said you know and even a corporate\nTaxes as that come out on the liberals talk about it when you have someone you folks talk about it you know the corporate taxes or a a hidden tax on the poor and he goes yeah I Know I Know and and now this guy if you if you met him the the image that he portrays and people didn't know him that tell me he's portrayed as an elite liberal he knows what's going on\nAnd and so\nYou know the the ... when we look at\nAnd then we had talked about a President Obama speaking yesterday in in or two days to go into that and we said what did he say what is the issue for Democrats\nNow we know that the traditional conservative who is now come aboard if they were never Trump\nThey've come aboard you know because of of of ... I don't believe they left I Believe that they are motivated to vote based on\nWhat based\nOn any allergy and constitutional issues that are really really dear to them I'm Talking about the conservatives that have banned in Trump\nBack in twenty sixteen the never Trump ... the\nPeople that might have voted for him but we're still a little bit wishy washy might not have been as motivated to go out in the midterms\nCabinet change that completely I looked at Democrats and it's the hatred for Trump remember\n... you know I we talked earlier about uh about Trump exhaustion let's talk about Democrat exhaustion how many allegations that they made against Trump that have gone away\nIncluding rushing collusion that whoever thought that Russian collusion just six months ago would not even be a talking point at all from the Democrats going into the mid term well\nYou'd think about it we're about to go I I mean we're less than two weeks away from election day and they're not talking about\nCorruption in an election no and it was almost a sure thing given fat as as they presented it and have been for the better part of two years\n\nAnd so the the Democrat exhaustion that's been portrayed Trump is Hitler Trump is Hitler Trump as Hitler Trump is an authoritarian Trump is this Trump is well it's like the other day when Trump came out and and and I think that the the ... what oh there is okay he says he's a nationalized\nYou got to understand what Trump's definition of nationalist is\nYeah right that's the er at West of changing the definition of words because you're talking about somebody a president of the United states who would like to put the United states first that's his definition their definition has to do with hate groups\nRight and has to do it a hate group sent and Hitler yes and so if you use the same term even if your definition is different it doesn't matter the the the label sticks but even that fading away because people have experienced them and the thing is remember and we weren't going to be around in two years because of Trump ...\nThe whole world was going to be a huge mushroom cloud and when you throw up that incredibly heated rhetoric day in and day out and day in and day out there is also an exhaustion that you put\nOn your own party that every allegation that you throw out never goes anywhere right and you find out\nThat I and I think what may get Democrats more angry right now than anything is\nTrump has become normalized we're used to it now well that that's the other that's the other side of it uh in\nIn the political realm it is not really ... right now it it nothing has changed in well gosh since January twenty six teams at least\nI went back and I was I was looking at some old the videos were clips or news clips and then different videos on YouTube and coverage of Trump before he officially started you know ... or ... announced that he was going to run and twenty sixteen\nI'm going back to the a fight with Rosie back and forth there right\nAnd they certainly people pick sides but it wasn't really anything serious\nThe left really kind of in many ways adored him they may not have stood by his side during that back and forth with Rosie but they really didn't they weren't coming out you know and and it wasn't that kind of hatred until he became the threat and that's when he decided to run for president\nAnd if you think about it I Do wonder\nIn terms of the things that he promoted at at the core lower taxes fewer regulations are these pro business thinks I Wonder if they knew that threat was real and and the way to engage him and this is you know a certainly would be a strategy from the left\nKnowing that he's probably got the the skills in terms of negotiating if he's got the the uh the makeup on on the numbers on Capitol Hill he can get those things done to do away with Obamacare things he was promising and twenty sixteen\nAnd even before a lower regulation lower taxes the thing's all of these things that the left hey\nHe became the real threat because they knew he was going to be effective in those things and rolling back essentially the entire Obama agenda\nThat's the real threat so how do you start to unravel that threat you engage him and other things knowing that because of the history of going back and forth on social media with\nWith Rosie O'Donnell or whoever it is knowing he's going to engage in that way that that would hopefully derailed his campaign\nThe fact that it didn't\nAnd look at all the things that were said during that twenty sixteen campaign\nIs staggering\nIt really is it's it's totally unprecedented and it tells you where we were as a nation\nThis is why I think we can't underestimate you know the the silent majority or whatever you want to call I don't think you can call this race and say you know uh overstep the houses definitely go to will go to the Democrats I don't make productions\nBut there's this is this is anything but a normal election year because twenty sixteen wasn't and we've rented up while ... set\nAnd and the thing is as I mentioned earlier the danger of Trump's exhaustion was blown out of the water because of capital\nRight right and is it is\nAs it is it's about ... fire right on that I like how energize yeah is there are the Republicans yeah because I have never in in that time\nThat that happened I don't have a read right now because everything's basically gone silent we'll find out in two weeks\nBut I have not in a long time I don't know the last time I saw I'm trying to think of the last time I saw the Republicans so United\nAnd I really can't you know again going back to Reagan I really wasn't studying politics as much a back then I became a talk show host in eighty nine\nSo uh you know I wasn't as observant\nOr you know as to the unity of the Republican Party at a you know at that time I Know it was greatly United but over an issue I in my lifetime I just don't remember the Republican Party being as United when they were more fractured than I seen in a while and become this cohesive United group of people\nArrest record goes back in Nineteen Ninety One and

through may be the Nineteen nineties we were focused on better living through chemistry and the scientists were very good at what they did and they developed products and brought in many things

medical exams no blood tests and make it very simple on line two people can do know that they ever trusted party who cares about them and their families and they can purchase it ten minutes\nWhy is there an open enrollment\nOpen enrollment system that is designed from my understanding to prevent people from a\nPrevious existing conditions from just waiting to sign up for health insurance until they have it on that so it is sending people to be prepared to have insurance from\n...\nIt it seemed to me that if you know I was working for a company other than my own company and I joined that company can't get insurance boat life insurance health care insurance in January which is my starting date\nYeah so that's a qualifying of then when you change employers it's signaling that there's a legitimate reason or need to get health insurance\nOn and so that's a that's a that qualifies for getting covered through health insurance outside the normal open enrollment period\nAt at the ocean there are there are a number of companies that are selling a life insurance or are you still talk through an agent uh on on on radio you we hear those a lot this is different because you go online and do everything yourself\nYeah so what makes it a few makers one we're on the consumer side or first core values are customers families are treated like our families\nOn the second thing is really about how the wife and shirts purchase so like insurance is traditionally a very difficult process to go through your paper applications you got aggressive sales agents who\nWho want to maximize their own profit and then you've got medical exams and what nobody likes to think about it through\nAnd what we could get your life expectancy without ever meeting we're speaking with you just based on data and then we can give you licensure instantly why as a result of great\nSo all of it and you are going to just about to consumers\nSomebody is say forty five years old or works in the construction industry and uh on the top of eighty seven for buildings\nAnd says that his insurance might be a little bit more than a custodian in that same building same age\nYes that's correct um your occupation is a factor in your life insurance costs um and so you are in that particular scenario or your price might be a little bit more expensive\nA little bit would be fine you know I'm I'm it's hard I I it's funny a at one point I was fired from radio job and my father in law called me and said I don't want you to show my insurance\nAnd I said see Darryl can you imagine me selling life insurance no no I'm it's I'm\n... and he offered me his book he he was the c._e._o. you he is the CEO use cell alive doesn't sell insurance anymore but um\nAnd I just I I turned it down to me life insurance is a hard sell because me has the buyer will never see the benefit yes I understand I'm protecting my kids my wife's a in some cases my dog or cat\nCan you expand on that\nThere's a saying in the industry wishes life insurance is sold not bought and you've identified it it's really one of the few selfless purchases because it does no benefit to you it just\nCosts you money and that if someone who you love 'em which is a beautiful thing and another cell but we've always thought that they require\nThat you can agents to somebody because the product is so complex and that if we made the product football um and we have trust go with the consumer then people would buy it and that's what we found\nInteresting um ... ... what kind of savings is at those offer in other words if you go to a a major I don't know ah well my father in law so sold for a metropolitan life\nAre you are you using their policies are showing their policies as well as as others or John ... euro\nNo we saw one unique kind of policy we don't solve the large policy um and we wouldn't be cheaper than life but\nThe bigger savings is really between two different kinds of life insurance\nThere's trouble life which covers you for a certain amount of\nTime and it's really to prevent against a unkind read and then there's permanent life insurance which is the seasonings\nAlong with the ... a gallon and\nTuning in listening to us we heard somebody in the Midwest is way after listening to our ah show you weeks ago about the floods sisters foundation\nWe appreciate that a lot of Robert Hi Angie joins ... she is the co host of the mindset leash a TV show and you can find him at my ship reached a TV dot com [noise] today we're going to talk\nAbout enthusiasm show ladies and gentleman I present one of the most enthusiastic people I've ever met or offered clients\nDay today the bat enthusiasm and I actually looked it up in a doozy as and hence enjoyment or something and\nThe word was originally used to or to a person that by your or somebody\nIntense piety\nSo it's almost like it's tied to a understanding the big picture and and that there's more to life than just light itself\nSo my inspiration I thought it enthusiasm is a great catalyst remarkable change in your life it's like a streetlight guys you on the highway and this positive energy can direct new height and two places you never even dreamed up\nAnd there was a great organization I'm involved with it you Brian youth leadership and this three day seminar that we deal with high school sophomore as they come in pretty much a working down they just you know no that talking to anybody and when they're done with this three day seminar 'cause they are ... with\nThis enthusiasm for three solid of how um amazing life can be when you give people a place where it's going and they leave this seminar changed for their entire life that's what it\nWould you say that enthusiastic people are more apt to initiate change in the world for the better\nYeah it is having a positive outlook but it goes beyond that it's um it's like you just love the fact that you love\n[laughter] if they get to that level of\nGiving and positive energy\nAnd yourself for your self esteem belief in other people the amount of change that you can affect that one person can make it different fall comes from\n... um [noise]\nI guess there's a dictionary definition of an ... but we all meet people that have shown much I guess he gives us some right it's almost it it's a it's it's over well\nI'm ... ...\nThey've got energy and power and they do things and they ... and rubs off on you and you just feel I eat when you're near them\nYeah and that that's the thing it it it ripples out and they can make changes to your entire environment and all those around your effective like the ... when you drop a pebble in the in in a pond or in the ocean\nIt may seem insignificant but those ripples go out and they eventually touch every shore on the planet and\nThat the key to include them that you can make these changes from just starting with the simple positive energy and attitude [noise]\nHow do you get that because we talked about this today\nAh we've talked about this not today but in the past there is some people who are they ... they have no enthusiasm how do we in jak that in ... into these non enthusiastic people\nWell it's a whole lot of sugar that's what it is\nKelly people think when they either through um it is just reinforcing and sharing something positive about them\nBecause you know doing experiments when you go out and this is for everybody that I'm In for you as well that\nIf you go and say something positive about somebody\nAnd share that with them what you're feeling a positive way you're going to see the change in that other [noise]\nInteresting\nAnd I of course if you go out and you say and I was ... you say something negative to somebody he wants to see a reaction it may not be the one you're looking for right right\nI Am this morning somebody called me up and said how do I work with this person and I said in ... but back\nOff at the same time don't ask for the whole world has for maybe Twenty years

I realized in my life I cannot live a life of crime mhm because number one I have you know I've I've got the the whole uh what location stuff in in in my vehicle and and all that which again the authorities don't look at but if they want it to they could get a warrant look at it and\nUh then I realized that when I take my bike rides or hikes mhm you don't have the app that you know that and after you're done you can see exactly where you've gone well that's I heard somewhere that the police could also use may get a warrant for that and I realized mine almost my entire life and I have a toll tag\n[laughter] [laughter] ah so I have a I have a toll tag I ah I'm\nTrying to think what else is is there any place that no because every white guy even if I go shopping they've got cameras that they got cameras monitoring them on you and I and in many people now have cameras is very common to have cameras in your home oh you do that I just got walking down the street going for a walk every\nDay oh yeah there's there's there's a there's cameras in the home and then what is my job everybody can monitor every word I'd say on my job they can monitor or I guess I'm Talking into this microphone well I Am general privacy now [laughter] I'm not sure that as proactive\nIn that we engage in that yeah you know we run that voluntarily um you could uh I'm I'm sure the hearing in the hearings or the back and forth and and the debate on this whole thing with the license plates scanners in Florida\nA on this case will be okay but you also that's kind of a voluntary uh you know process uh you\nCan choose to not be in a vehicle or you know you could take public transit ah depending I guess on the availability of that well if that were and right and I are using a bicycle or walking or whatever\nAnd I guess you would start at this particular point many police officer if you're in front of them for any reason from on your license\nMhm yeah they don't\nWrite right but they could run your license and make a judgment on you right at that point ... just based on the information that they have that you have unpaid park and the question becoming a is your you've got a warrant out yeah you know what on that\nAnd what the what the complaint is is that because this is where it gets interesting is that you're developing\nA pattern to it would be like the police following you as opposed to a police officer just by happen happenstance you know a ... patrol right you know I'm you know pulling that up\nNow an officer can also followed you I mean if they if they suspect something now they're not going to follow you for days and store all that information for three years outside of an investigation but they legally could they would not need or hang war it's a four or most of of you know for just following you in a vehicle\nSo I guess what is the difference between that and do you why road blocks\nWhere they stop everybody who goes through if the\nIf if their claim is if their argument is by the way folks were just having a discussion here [laughter] I realize we're on the radio right right [laughter] it was like oh we're on the radio here\n[laughter] but well I think it's an it's letting the days just based on right technology and the world's hanging out you know you ... a DUI now some states like Texas in Oregon and as far as I Know I don't know about organ anymore but when I was there\nNo robots aren't allowed they find that unconstitutional by the state constitution right so we don't have road blocks here we don't have so you can have more rights in a particular state you just can't have fewer rights and uh but across the country do you I road blocks are are fine mhm so with the with the same\nA premise behind a or that or\nCould they would that I I'm assuming somebody would try to use it that look worse scanning every body it's not that we're picking out one individual worst scanning everybody if we got one individual by race or one individual by you know\nI I think the the difference comes with with the the data and storing it only and and what it can be used for beyond any given day or moment right so in the moment of a a DUI road block or like a a when they set up a\nWe call them speed traps are our apologies to officers but that's what they call them speech rats [laughter] radar gun well that's why they they call them that you will get a caller [laughter] yeah right [laughter] you know the the whole um you know what\nI resent that a policy [laughter] ... you know I hit my break you know I had my breaks but the but you know when they so when they do that it's kind of the same\nThing right it's just at random they're going to be in a particular spot whoever passes that spot is going to be subject to that uh action or level of enforcement by that particular uh an enforcement agency well now what's different is you're getting a you're you're taking this data and the\n... what\nWhat that data base now becomes right if it were just scanning\nAnd let's say they kept it for\nForty eight hours Seventy two hours uh thirty days\nBut didn't keep it for three years because three years would be a pattern or you know I mean thirty days could be questionable I mean you could have the same argument\nBut it's but the DUI data isn't necessarily stored on any given I I mean the deal I wrote stop right a isn't necessarily stored on any given individual I mean unless there is a pattern of behavior just by happenstance but but\nBecause of a person engages in certain and we all do we all have our certain areas and we go to shop at the same store we'd go to the same places maybe a you know whatever it is a you know nightclub movie theater or whatever it might be for entertainment or job and everything else\nAll of that become something different when you could say okay here's what that person or engages in or where he visits or she visits it doesn't necessarily prove anything but it backs other circumstantial evidence\nOr or a support other hard evidence well in the case and then the question is you know do you what would be needed to get that data\nAnd the other thing to get anything and the other thing I Would differentiate that from you know the the the cell phone met a dead or whatever you at the end those points you're dealing with the private company and the

supplement education it does it have been talked about the states where it doesn't even go to education ah anymore that hey taxpayer you were sold them sold a bill of goods and also since twenty Seventeen they've made it harder to win the big prize yeah so the purposely the the they said no the cost has\nDoubled over a period of time and the chance if you went in the big money now has gone up

Seventy nine wanting somebody odds are are they are much labor and and whites more expensive\nRight you can still when some of the smaller price has made it very hard\nThey made it harder to win the real big prize for it and and uh it really just to go to supplement education anymore because the state's even that use it for education and taken other education money that was targeted for education

know someone who won I say I did because they did the right thing while they were forced to do the right thing this is in the early nineties\nOr when our state first got the uh the lottery um and it was I think it was either I was six or seven million dollars and they want and but the they didn't keep quiet about it and the phone started ringing before cellphones or off the wall\nAnd they

tonight at eight PM my mother was the undercover named rather ... wrote this agent right Corey texted Gillum on August ten twenty sixteen Gillum text message reply awesome news about Hamilton\nYeah so he acknowledged where the tickets were coming from right so\nThat's and and that's a again\nAs we said many times it's not the ... it's necessarily that a crime has been committed they are you a proven it it's the perception that you're hiding something right\nSo there's where that is a right now\nOr yesterday I mean I'm just looking at your real clear politics with two weeks ago Republicans are increasingly bullish\nOn a on a ... a prospects a you know other uh headlines reading up\nUh in fact I was reading ... earlier or the other at the headlines were favoring a Democrats and uh let me see a silver eighty five percent Dems now take the house well [noise]\nYou know okay well that's that's Nate Silver is ripe thirty eight and cook cook Charlie cooks yes eight more house or you know a racist ... for again it's depending oh and you were\nAnd it may be it may be too complicated to to go through on the air but you were telling me before about when you look at uh five thirty eight yeah and the Nate Silver website and and and ... and ... well wait a minute you were you were talking about one district and you said all they're doing is looking at the population\nWell they they look at the population and they look at their expectation of forecast of a you know this is the the website forecasts of how many people in that district are going to vote it was Texas thirty to Pete Sessions\nAnd then a based on you know again the leading of that uh the makeup of voter makeup of that district which is nine points in favor of the Republican and then they go\nTo the pole and the most recent poll goes back a long time I mean it's it's pre Kevin on I think it's a mid September September\nThirteenth or something and then again but what they're what they're trying to what they're trying to give some certainty to win and again it will be proven on election day whether he was right or not right but what you're trying to do is in a very uncertain time\nWith variables that have not existed that I have not seen in mid term right right I that I've not seen since I've been covering politics is really the late eighties yeah which is really Kavanaugh and the uniqueness of Trump\nI think you throw everything out the water because what the pollsters are attempting to figure out is not where people stand\nYou know not not in it but who is more excited and you know you quoted to me on that particular district the number of people they say we're going to come out and vote and I'm thinking to myself that's a complete guess how do they know how do you measure\nAnd and this is the the hardest thing here when you're talking about these house races\nIs how do you measure you can look at presidential elections and you can have an idea\nBased on other presidential elections and that's all right how many people might come out and vote you know in this particular of an election but when you start talking about these particular districts and the uniqueness number one of the whole Kavanaugh hearings which I think is unprecedented\nAs a late September surprise he's right [laughter] right um it it's just an\nUnprecedented and Trump himself is an unprecedented president and has broken all the rules of trying to figure out what's going to happen right you know in in a in a race\nI just I don't see the certainty that they claimed to be making I don't know where they come out with right certainty that yeah or or anybody is buying the certainly the that they're attempting to suck 'cause I\nWould still say and again I'm not a pollster\nAnd I don't have my own methodology and I by the way I give a lot of credibility to five thirty eight on many things in terms of like election coverage\nAnd things they've done in the past ah it it's just that I don't know that you can blend all of these formulas which they have\nTo make their own centrally proprietary blend of of production models I don't know how you know again I Would love to sit down with them and say okay tell me why you believe this works and why this is a better model if they may be right on\nNow again this is about the overall you know eighty five percent chance that Democrats will win the house that's an overall that they will get right you know at least a a you know to uh you know that magic number and\nAnd have more than a more seats ultimately the and the Republicans and and that could\nBe the case but I here's what I question is\nWe're not seeing recent poll even in some of those high profile Senate races like Ted Cruz and and uh and back to work I mean you have to go back it's it's been a week I Would think you would have\nPoll that would have come out or you know where to Wednesday morning and maybe we'll ... we'll see one today or tomorrow but I Would I Would like to see one I mean I for you know for measuring this I think if you're going to get into accuracy and get closer to accuracy I Would expect to see one every few\nDays on the house races I mean it becomes on some of these races you got it it's ... it's impossible because you go it's all pre Kavanaugh all\nPre caravan and right now what they they've got a thirty seats as toss up at our see pie in the house and you look at those and and again I think there are too many factors I'm not saying\nAnyone is wrong I'm just saying that that we're not seeing the polls I Would love to see some more Daley pulls a or at least you know twice weekly but we're not seeing those and what we do have and many of those races is pre Kavanaugh polls and pre\nCaravan polls and I think those two elements are changing ah right now the\nThe the sentiment coming up next um I Believe that last night and that President Trump put out one of the greatest tweet suffer ... he had one of the greatest trolling moments\nIn Twitter history ... he has been criticized for his tweets mhm we have always said he could use it in a much better way\nYeah yesterday he did\nYou don't want to miss it coming up next
