Clinton for exposing national security secrets to prying eyes outside\nIt's not quite the same thing Hillary Clinton actively attempted to conceal documents from government discovery\nSpecifically for our own political motives and in the process ended up exposing secret maybe foreign adversary President Trump however appears\nTo have been using his cell phone in ways that exposed secret to America's enemies as well maybe there is a story from the New York times on President Trump calls old friends on one of his life on the gossip right or listen to the latest take on how he's doing\nAmerican intelligence reports indicate Chinese spies are often listening and put into use invaluable insights into how to best work the president and effect administration policy current and former American officials said\nMr Trump aides repeatedly warned him cell phone calls are not secure they told him Russian Spies are routinely eavesdropping on the calls but aides say that the president who's been pressured into using his White House landline more often these days has still refuse to give up\nHis eyes on White House officials say they can only hope you refrain from discussing classified information when he's on the president should not be doing it now the president has denied the account\nThe president said that he has not done any of this\nThat you know this is all fake news again it's all fake news maybe it's big news and maybe it's not if it's not that the president please stop doing this okay like really it's not good and if we really believe that it's bad to expose America's national security secrets to prying eyes and we probably shouldn't be doing it on our side either in other news and\nThe stock market has taken a massive hit this month is now at eight fold last for the year remember Rodney in October so that means that all the games and laughed and laws where basically a race\nOver the course of of October the Dow Jones industrial average crop six hundred and eight point twenty four thousand five hundred eighty three and ... all with gains for twenty Eighteen yes and the five hundred prop frequent one percent to two thousand six hundred fifty second term negative for the year\nWhy while the earnings are down so a lot of the tech earnings are down and also there are a lot of fears about the idea that the economy was overheated in advance of the of the terrorists that President Trump has put in place against China so people basically stocked up on products before the terrorists were set to hit and that means that there are a lot of forecasts at the economy is actually not going to grow as much\nNext quarter we have yet to see whether that is the case also the housing numbers are down there's a lot of uncertainty heading into the end of year according to Jay Jay Cunningham chief market strategist at ... genie America ...\nAnd just ... it feels like people feel more comfortable spending short term rather than long term now is quite possible some of this has to do with the midterm elections the feeling that Democrats could get into power and then start signing every possibility of deregulation that they could be looking to raise taxes again\nThen you could look to cut a deal President Trump's you raise deficit and to blow out the spending\nThat's going to have some impact on the market as well that's why it's imperative that if you like if you like ... if you want to keep their economy if you like you're at home you can keep their economy but only if you keep electing the people who brought you that economy namely the Republicans\nIn Congress even more so than the president the Republicans in Congress responsible for President Obama not getting through his worst\nHis worst legislative proposals and they had been effects awaiting President Trump's economic policy for the last couple of years\nAs well now what are the chances that the Republicans retained how well they've been moving in the wrong direction and house there's according to five thirty five and six chance that Democrats win control of the house and Senate however is a little bit different so therefore casting that the Senate is going to be held by the Republicans in all likelihood\nAnd they say that right now the the Senate is about Seventy five percent likely or that the Senate is is I got yeah five and six chance Republicans keep control of the Senate and they may gain up to to see two three four seats they say that\nThere is a a Seventeen point eight percent chance that everything remains salad there is a\n... basically what was in the bell curve that Republicans pick up anywhere from three ... three to four seats to enforcing so that seems the most likely outcome at this point\nYou know all of that has led people on the rights jets that maybe this latest bomb scare in some sort of democratic attempts to gin up voter rage just before the election but again in the absence of evidence I'm not going to go there and I don't think anybody else you can go there either we should not be moving based on\nAgain no evidence let allegations at this point I'm perfectly fine with waiting another twenty four hours to find out what the hell is going on and I think everybody else should be too if you want to have a stronger and better country we'll be back here tomorrow with all the latest plus the mail that this is a measure of [laughter]\nTalk\nShow the true religion [noise]\nTalk radio seven Ninety ... bc news alive and local at ten o'clock I'm\nJoe Myers with the country on edge over a widening pipe bomb scare President Trump is casting blame on the media for creating suicidal anger while some candidates across the country are trading part is that attacks Republican Louisiana Congressman Steve ... joins those calling for unity\nRate uh we had mentioned on yesterday show because we had gone through different media out there and we're looking at the wall Street Journal he said well Wall Street journal or calling them bombs right and then I went to the wall Street Journal today and used to\nGo go to the ... the first a sentence investigators were hunting for the terrorists behind ten suspected bombs so now they're back to suspected bombs and you know and and there it is ah investigators believe some of the ten suspicious packages center prominent Democrats and Trump were mailed\nFrom Florida so that information is coming out there were mailed from ah from Florida I saw the story that that the uh sources are saying that the whole uh ISIS flag thing that authorities believe was to throw them off and they don't believe it had anything to do with\nA a a a ISIS they belong or the cable guy or alerted the cable guy right I think it was something just to to throw them off and so we're getting all these different stories and meanwhile all day yesterday my question is\nWhere they live bombs where they ready to go off right not rise that makes that makes a difference if you're given up all this other information all this other information is being leaked out there why isn't\nWhy ... why isn't any media outlet in really insistent in asking those questions for me\nQuite frustrating yesterday and then ah was ah was busy a lot of the day uh yesterday and and went to sleep and and woke up late\nAnd when I woke up late that's the first thing and I slept like five hours I woke up right just about two hours ago and\nAnd as soon as I woke up I ... you know okay there's got to be the new story out there whether it was a lie bomb or not and the same thing right like wait a minute this is about four days since the first you know since the first bomb right you know what what is it why can't why can't we get a straight answer when you when you talk about Austin\nAustin a bomb went off mhm so at that point you knew that they were lied bomb here no bomb has gone off to the question would rain just for public safety republic knowledge are the bombs live or not\nAnd still referring to them as you know suspected of you know the devices potentially dangerous devices potentially dangerous devices that are you know that are dangerous mhm well why would they be dangerous does that mean because this will be the question I Would have\nDoes that mean that some contain gunpowder right et cetera and tainted explosive device but there was no detonator and then right so they would be a potentially suspected of you know a bomb\nA with a you know explosive material but the explosive material\nWasn't going to go off and it wasn't a danger to anybody unless you took a match and put it to the gunpowder\nRight right yeah just simply by handling the package itself it wouldn't be necessarily a dangerous in the way that a live bomb would be but but but again\nAh you know that this is something where you know not not fearing at all or it has been\nAnd and there's nothing wrong with an over abundance of caution by anyone in you know in this scenario except for the fact that you don't have something for I guess the the public if they were armed\nAh those bombs were ready to go off in transit that's something I think that would be warnings all over from authorities saying that you wherever you might be anyone could potentially encounter one of these devices\nAnd that kind of warning I'm not I'm not hearing so\nWhen you get to the press coverage of calling them bombs yeah which is if you know if the Saudis have not said that they were lied bombs why are we calling them bombs right what is the purpose of of doing that is that accurate reporting if they are not bombs were telling you in real time the frustration that we have right\nRight and we think it's important to point out the frustration unless there's a reason for you know unless there's eight investigative reason for for doing so except the fact is the people that\nAre the person or people that mail the bomb they know whether they were alive or not and they know the authorities already know right so what what would be the investigative purpose for doing it is beyond\nIs is beyond me and so when I finally saw some frustration because it got to be a little frustrating yesterday when you're trying to figure it out or they like bombs or not and would they have gone off which is just some explosive material but they wouldn't have gone off right because that that one of the reasons that ... the leaks are happening and they give out information\nBecause you see it all over the place I saw the the the ... people re tweeting it if you know anything about it\nAnd now here's some of the information some of the information we believe you know it's it's the authorities now or be directed to Florida well leaks come out for a reason links from investigative agencies come out for a reason\nSo why are all these other things leaking and being told to the public by the media but not the one question that I think most people would want to know with with with the er they live where they live or were they not lie bomb right right\nSo there's where we are so we'll get to that like a more of that coming up here I Chelsea Clinton I'd consider running for office\nMhm I just had to throw that in there yeah it's a friday why not anybody's shock no\nWell you know she has experienced that NBC so\n[laughter] [noise] who was it who wasn't on NBC\nI Can't remember who was the thinking was Brian Williams wasn't Brian Williams okay she's well traveled that's how he described ... ... ... ...\nThe you mean she's been on a plane I that was the first daughter of course she's well traveled you know when I Will never forget him that night we I Know we played it on the air yeah but that was just unbelievable yeah it was like gushing over the fact right the Chelsea Clinton was not working for NBC right and they\nDo that when when when uh George Bush's daughter went to work for NBC not so much that there were a couple of articles you know but yeah but but not no gushing no no you're not using is what I was referring\nTo did you did that caused the news ... white out\nAnd said it was like OK we'll let her in for now [laughter] [noise] um did a great job\nIt's like Megan Kelly exits stage left but once the entire contract\nAnd I looked at you and I don't appreciate meeting and said and does it seem like that NBC went oh wait a minute oh we can make this cause it not Bayer up a God or she's already making too much for what she hasn't made that kind of money she hasn't pulled in that kind of revenue\nYeah or so this is an opportunity to get rid of her now right well because\nThe ratings I'm I'm guessing weren't stellar\nUm and ... in any good excuse right ah yeah we're going to let you go so\nUh Megan Kelly and who knows will she be back on friday but it looks like she's going to be off the air for at least a wild and she lost so here's here's how it went down she made the blackface comment I I don't know when that was Monday or Tuesday\nAnd then by Wednesday she had lost her agent yes they parted ways\nAnd now it's basically it looks like there won't be any any you know coming back to to say goodbye or or sign off or anything else it looks like it's pretty much done and you wonder if you you just wonder okay that's\nThe old saying that escalated quickly\nUm she came out on Wednesday and did some kind of apology and they said the audience you know that was their gave her a standing ovation I I'm not sure why an apology it deserves the tenth no fishing [laughter]\nNot like some kind of great performance that social side of that we live well yeah yeah\nUh but they gave her a standing ovation ah and then later on that day and just kind of went down from there and that's when the agency that she was with the talent agency\nI decided to part ways whether there was some celebrities that we're going to appear on the show that after the comments on black face they weren't going to appear and they decided you know the cancelled so ah\nBut the likely comes down to the fact that the ratings weren't great you know is that the worst thing ... anybody has ever said\nAh no no but ... but asked Roseanne Barr how much you have to say ... probably Roseanne Barr that situation was much more serious in terms of of how it was viewed in Hollywood than what Megan Kelly said I I don't know I ... I don't know my my two\nMy two conspiracy theories and then once you know initially they weren't going to initially they weren't going to fire that wasn't in their plans or at least initially just for that for what she said they weren't going to do it as you said in our personal meaning you\nOut they'd suspended until after Halloween yeah come back after Halloween but but then they went on wait a minute hold it she's not producing yeah oh wait a minute rating we can get out of his contract we can we wow one of the lawyer said you know this could be caused and if we get it for cause we don't have to pay off or contract\nThat's one side of it the other side of it as my other conspiracy theories making Kelly was thinking I don't want to be doing this is just totally sucks\nBut I don't want to be able to collect my contract let me say something that's maybe a little bit controversial but not far enough for them to justify all the fire me for cause [laughter]\nWell but I mean and if they try I can still collect here's the difference Megan Kelly\nShow on Fox News would have just been another night of making ...\nA lot of work being done a nationwide effort or with these bombs being found everywhere from Delaware New York DC of Florida and all the way out in California\nLos Angeles city prosecutors declined to file any criminal charges over an alleged scuffle between accurate Tom Arnold and producer part mark Burnett citing insufficient evidence Arnold alleged that he was assaulted by Burnett during the pre Emmy Awards charity event in century city on September sixteenth KBC so county\nWhether it's a night mostly clear lives in the upper fifty to the mid sixties it's sixty five in Santa Fe springs sixty four in Santa Ana sixty three degrees in woodland hills\nOf course will vote on November sixth then count on smart election coverage with John Phillips in Lawrence Yvonne to break it all down I'm Joe Myers KBC news\nNow how does a homeowner discovered that his or her home insurance policy is outdated well when something breaks and their policy doesn't cover it right\nSixty four percent of American households are under insured with outdated coverage that is what hit both set out to solve with smart home insurance for the modern home for up to twenty five percent less right now when you switch to hippo they'll give you a smart home starter care\nWould too smart sensors that help prevent break ins water leagues and fires and you also get a smart home discount offering coverage for all the items that run your home like everything that plugs into the wall for up to twenty five percent less or takes seconds and all policies are backed by hit both top rated distress partners with over two hundred\nBillion in assets go to my hip boat dot com HI PPO my hip ... dot com slash true\nLet's see if you can save up to twenty five percent plus getting smart home started ...\nThat is my hip boat dot com slash through go there today in sixty seconds you could say twenty five percent my hippo dot com HI PPO my hip out dot com slash drew\nI'm Nick ... a select quote agent with the true story that can save you hundreds of dollars a year a woman named Linda just called her husband re has a three hundred thousand dollar group life insurance policy but\nIt's changing jobs and can't take it with him well I shocked the many highly rated term life insurance companies we represent\nAnd found re who was forty one and takes medication to control his cholesterol a ten year five hundred thousand dollar policy for under twenty seven dollars a month that's almost twice the coverage for less than half of what he had paid if select quota hasn't shot for your life insurance you're probably paying too much\nFor your free quote called eight hundred for four or five sixty three sixty three bands eight hundred for four or five sixty three sixty three eight hundred for four or five sixty three sixty three or go to select quote dot com since Nineteen eighty five we shop you save\nGet full details on the example policy is local dot com slash commercials or ... depending on your health issues company another family not to be able\nTo show live anywhere anytime on demand to catch up on Eric and Gary's topics of the day that it red eye radio show dot com and click on demand that red eye radio show dot com boom\nI'm here with a unit royal truck tires engineer to talk about the unit royal LD tend Dr ...\nYes the long lasting L.

telling me I'm very McNamara\nEight six six Ninety red eyes [noise]\nPostal markings on packages\nWith explosive materials sent two prominent Democrats and I just this is from Fox News so I just wanted to throw that Catherine Harris wrote that with explosive material so that's another thing that we have heard right which is and we mentioned this uh in the last segment\nThat we've heard explosive material and we've heard\nA pipe bomb potentially wrote dangerous potentially explosive devices\nA but we haven't heard actually lied bombs and so we're we're that's the question that we are asking that would they have it all from what we know all ten of the explosive devices and uh went to the u._s. postal system right which means they were handled\nSo it wasn't us a question that it wasn't\nTouching it mhm or in in any way that it seems would have shut off the bomb so were they timers and would they have gone off at any time or where they just ... did you have some explosive materials but they would have never detonated unless they might have been in a fire right\nUh and so those are the questions to understand the motivation of the person who is sending it that's why you like to get to that point but now four days into this and we still don't know whether they rely bombs are not authorities have been set and so you ask the question why but postal markings on those packages sent\nA two prominent Democrats have helped federal investigators were find their focus of your investigation with Florida described as a region of interest to sources told Fox News on Thursday the investigators have not said whether they believe the suspect or suspects are in Florida or fall\nI could just were mailed from the state New York and Maryland are also in focus Fox learned a government official noted what appeared to be thick dark electricians tape on the pipe bomb sent to former CIA director John Brennan now that's where they use the term pipe bomb there\nMhm so Fox uses the term pipe bomb was at a pipe bomb right because what's the definition of a bomb bomb is something that will go off\nMhm right\nThat you have a detonator in it which is going to set it off one way or another number be various ways to set it up so was it a pipe bomb or nobody has said it was alive pipe bomb at this moment for a ... the official sudden investigators are hopeful that the black tape capture DNA fibers and fingerprints\nOn the mock ISIS style logo on the one mailing to government officials sudden investigators believed\nIt was designed to create confusion not to indicate a connection to a known terrorist group right\nA Miami Dade police announced it was working with investigators as a precautionary measure bomb squad and canine units are currently providing assistance to our federal partners and the United States Postal service\nFor there's where we are at this point here we go let's go to Mike in New York Mike Hi you're on Radio Welcome to the show Hi Mike\nHow you doing very good\nYeah my comment about the mail bombs and also in a way how it relates in an odd way to the concept of like interest that will that mean there's the where the people on the left day there's all different status of the victims well we've always known that if someone on the right gets injured by somewhat on the lap while it's not nearly as important as the other way around\nBut now we know it's also not nearly as important as if someone on the left\nUp here is like they might have been injured you know by someone or wherever they want it was almost all the like but nobody really knows and so I guess in the colleges they could start teaching something like that that's actually quite but that is so they can help straighten us all out and were you\nOn that [laughter] well you know my hair Eric you were talking about was that the tweet was a\nDonald Trump junior that put it out earlier yeah Donald Trump junior making some a very good points on social media or yesterday Thursday and and I think on Wednesday as well saying well where was the call for civility when someone sent fake rice and to his residence and and\nIt was you know that got ultimately close to to his wife it was intended for him Donald Trump junior and the same thing happened to his brother he was asking uh I forget who was he was asking\nUh in in that tweet or he was responding to somebody else's tweet um but that's that's the whole thing is that there was no call for civility when that happened I mean you see a number of things that happened or that\nAnd with any

brought in bomb sniffing dogs they brought in the bomb squad they took all the the bomb gear up into them all move everybody off the top floors down below and then we're able to clear the incident very quickly\nAnd Mike said to me he said man and you can finally watching Laker game and it's just great to see like you can enjoy it and it's fun to see the I'm a little loving Simon out there man so\nYeah it was there were a little hard on the eyes yeah it it was I was ... years there's been a little rough but hey it's no secret\nWe got a caller in here so let let's get them on uh we got Solomon from lake by boy who was our special guest Solomon you're on the line\nThanks so much guys I have to call in because I had thank you personally and I want to let the listeners know what a novel experience it was the night I had the absolute greatest time you remember what I couldn't eat I told you what I got\nMan that's like we had this great spread of food right keep an eye and a salad and then he was just all in his glory and and who wouldn't read is like\nThe game as the best and we we really appreciate yeah any out there tonight Solomon\nWill end and listen guys I appreciate it wasn't just a Laker game I mean you get it you get a suite at a lake or\nGet what they do ... what a ... you know yeah yeah yeah it\nIt it was I so I so appreciate and want to make a point to you know let the listeners know that you were great guys had we had a really good time together and I want to thank you you know publicly\nWhat we love to ... we we were happy when you were there today Solomon was a great well deserved for you and all you know we love our we love our our listeners man and and you know ... what do they continue to call in and and just talk sports with us because we enjoy it so\nWell I Am out on the Harlem in Solomon ... had it had a debate tonight during the game oh how was that you know inside the sweet about how you know\nWho's who's been who's maybe the most dominant Laker in history now those people in you know who are a little bit younger like you know keep you and I are we go is shock as far as probably the most dominant Laker we seen since we do watch it\nNow I'm obviously Solomon has watch Lakers basketball for decades ... he says that it's wilt Chamberlain and I know kids you've probably seen highly to wilt Chamberlain harmful is\nThe highlights right and there's no doubt about that will still he was amazing um but it's interesting because song made the point that he had shot would have maybe even you know worked on let's say for example like his free throws you know it was a little bit of struggle sometimes a shot\nAt the charities striped if you're going to be worked on something like that are different aspects of his game he could have been even more so\nDominant independence is one of the interesting debates that rolls on top of the course of time here you know some of the most dominant Lakers but uh no doubt both players were were great or in their day cells\nThey definitely were greatly I and we I definitely remember those you know I looked at some type of a you know a wilt Chamberlain and\nMan he used to really I mean no one could stop him at one point I think you they couldn't even dunk the ball anymore because of him when he started when they first started so here's\nHere's the thing guys about well first of all I'm I'm Glad I water deliberate soldier the caviar do about ... you said you said show you said will was more dominant than Shaq and I said if Shaq would have had Kobe's work ethic he would've been the greatest of all time\nMan that is true now you did you did say are you did say that I I didn't want to do that you know I didn't want to I don't want to I don't want to rip on shock now I don't know\nA little boy cloud a little bit of a cloud and I think it affected his legacy but I'm I'm\nGoing back to uh I lost my train of thought with which will\nUm [noise] and being unstoppable old ... broad as\nKind of a modern day will live in a sense like the wheelchair but we can then there was no there was no center\nThat could do what he did wilt Chamberlain came to people who are not used to that size strength and ability similar to blow up what brought I don't think there's another player since and we may never see it again with that side that string and data ability in every aspect of the game he's a freak that\nIsn't he either Rick he's afraid but there's one guy that I can and I and I and I said this I was just said it on the show earlier was a Magic Johnson Magic Johnson six nine who can play center who can play who did play center matter of fact when green went down\nAnd he had to play center and the championship year they won the Boston is up they beat the Boston Celtics\nAnd um you know his that line it was pretty much the same Magic Johnson was one guy who can win again without scorn a bucket and have a three\nAnd so and so you know when we go into that I think that LeBron is more similar to a Magic Johnson magic jobs in the past is magic conduct the ball as well he probably in having as much as\nA upset with LeBron James has but you know everything else was there so I Would have to say more and compare of a Magic Johnson I'm thin wilt Chamberlain Solomon I can probably go all day with you on that one\nThough no no no no and I understand your point I was saying more like a like a will as far as physical you know\nJust just a just decides and strengthen that position\nBut yeah the type of player he is by the way which I like see I like that that life I don't I'm not in love with I so basketball you know coke Coby fans mandate just love this guy because he was the shooter Gail\nAnd I'm not like that I like all abroad I like a Magic Johnson titled player that balanced outline usually ends up in war wins for your team than that even just starts score huh\nAnd you know some sometimes you pull it off for your team sometimes you do that if you can have those\nGot that skill set across um you know rebels assist as scoring that that's a that's a great combination that sell abroad and James\n... thanks Solomon are pretty weak I I've definitely take your point um you know in hand and I thank you for the call and thank you for coming to man it was great in the home and it was a great pleasure\nYou two guys were great thank you so much\nThere you go Solomon and lake bell dog one eight hundred\nTo two to five to to to a quick break and we're back for more after this\nAre you prepared for the upcoming season

Stevenson beginning in twenty five minutes tonight for rebounds forces twelve points overall was really nailed it from downtown keys and I just one of his players that you know if you kinda get rolling you're going to be hot for that they're going to ...\nOne play I have to say that he did was it was incredible he got the ball he's pushing up the floor and actually got abroad I mean you hit Lubrano for break the broad came in with a slam dunk it was a nice beautiful passed two nights chest passed right on the money the\nBride cottage dry bone knocked it in and it was like time out after that but that was a beautiful place them look he's a spark on the bench you know he ... he reminds me of art you reminded me of\nExcuse me metal war peace AK run run run I guess like I Love the way he plays he gets the crowd and going out to them on this show ... matter\nI you know I've been trying to you know what I'm calling them out right now metal world peace 'cause I Know you listen to the show I Know you listen we weren't you in Studio we want to talk to you met her come on\nTake to get out here man let's go a lot to say that's for sure yeah he already has a lot to say he's ... he's a great guy man he's a great guy but I Will also love to hear him talk about last even because he he reminds me of reminds me of that they can\nGet up in your face that yes Roger you they can get you off your game and out there that type of like pit ball player you want on your team yes paying it forward on your side if he's not in your team by but he's already made your Lebanon you're loving that effort yeah you're on the ground up\nYes ... exactly you you love 'em on them that's the thing about um so um it was great to see what he did tonight and he was very impressive to me um so it was a great game all in one man it was you can just feel the Laker\nAtmosphere and how was it is really that you feel that spirit back into like LeBron rejuvenate the lake or\nThe lake or nation you think he did yeah yeah it's a it's what\nIt really you know you kind of reflect on that sometimes and just seeing while the just the impacts superstars back when they go to not just a team the Lakers the team that that's that is small compared to your whole brand of LA cut of liberal and coming out\nExactly and just a side note to performance they put on the front of the Coby was impressive that's interesting\nIt's very neutral to that I was kind of watching them on the bench who's kind of on his phone he really didn't clap as much I guess he's trying to you know like I say I play a neutral\nClaiming neutral but you know he worked out a lot of these guys too you said I Know yeah he's worked um rallies checking them out and see what they're doing and stuff like that and I think he was at ESPN next door so he is promoting his book out and running is Vernon telling us book\nUm and then he a good one across the street talked to a leg as I'm sure you talk to them and inside the locker room and things like that before they went out there but it was a great time it was so funny because\nUh when I sit next Thomas cause Thomas coast Kobe Bryant that's right a Laker he say he's hilarious man he goes Kobe can't stay after he got to be doing something the whole\nTime and are they going to go say they're still pretty go out of the fact I just felt pretty close and he said\n'cause we always got to be doing something that's just one thing about him he's always I'd be doing so he has a little if she keeps going so and you can see that too you could tell he wasn't there with his family today I can see them on the bench me on the on the floor with as or did I Am [noise] but uh it was great but it's great to see things he's doing to like he's coaching his daughter\nUm has gotten a Bush he's got his story telling thing going on so\nIt's good to see him do other things as well so it was well the Laker fever was going to night though when they saw him did you see the elevation they gave a standing ovation they gave when he was there I mean while it was incredible\nRightfully so obviously one of the all time Laker grades and em the all time greats overall and you're always good to see him in the\n... as a Magic Johnson says and I agree with you the best like of ever put on like a Jersey\nThat's debatable and I and I debate about what I Love ... and you know I'd like you can't tell you who to who who's next uh who were actually who I Would say maybe above code number wilt Chamberlain ... hall I\nTo me when I went in my ear and sales and\n... yeah I mean I was just great isn't enough credit that he deserved I think that's a big part of it Jerry West\nJerry whereas the logo yeah he had\nThe all time Laker though to me will always be Magic Johnson\nThat's always the Magic Johnson but you can make the case for a lot of these guys some if that's the thing about when you come to I had this discussion with someone earlier tonight about when you come to a team like the Lakers so\nHistorical and they've had so much successor championships and such I mean you can be an all time great player and you're going to be you know considering maybe like one a one beat and some of these other guys that that is what ... kind of facing coming in here now as well but\nI think the broadest point just kind of he he embraces just being a part of the family of like you know Laker grades that he will probably go down to to\nBe hard to say there's all you LA fans are locals out here today you got a caller on the show I Want to hear from the fans to who is the greatest Laker to ever put on the Jersey I I Want to hear I'm averaging do that's a great ball to put up to be honest with your breath because you'd make a great point yeah\nJerry West Elgin Baylor but man I don't know like Kobe Bryant was just some he was just a dynamic player\nThat you saw him and I say not taking it away from Jerry West and all those either logo you still he was exceptional with himself you know or we'll ... we'll check her spend enough time at the Lakers to be a lake to to get\nTo be that guy though you get what I'm saying like fair like putting called ... here let's just imprint del regardless I assure me\nBig game coming up tomorrow night in the NFL as we tease earlier Houston all over Miami Keith forty two twenty three you know tannahill once again also asked why there gets to start in uses even though we were just talking about a stat went off the air here but\nThose interception not good enough is really the bottom line was able to present\nAnd Houston starting to find themselves a little bit now this is how we thought they would play at the beginning of the season to the first couple of weeks not so much here towards the middle of the season so they're starting to get something going especially offensively shot watching just went bonkers down\nWhere where we've been looking for this and it and I mean bill O'Brian is like finally I've got a quarterback\nThat can that can consistently throw touchdowns I got injured healthy good quarterback good decisions in the pocket or scrambling as as watching it really comes across as a high IQ football team\nGuy let's call it what it is ... is a play maker and he gets that he gets that off is going you know one thing about him and that's why the ... loves him\nBecause not only I mean the long balls at Heathrow you as a rocket on you know and I have to say this I think he's struggling a little bit because I think he just didn't have enough confidence in his knee and\nThat happens when you got to you know you had as a CEO chair last year and he's out for the season\nAnd I think the shower and watching 'em you know felt like look my knees you know it's just new mobility and things like that he was a little nervous about that that plays games with your mind sometimes when you're\nYou know you just coming off of a seal tear you come back we'll get nervous at all you hear all the time just don't trust it yet and I think after a while you just say you know what\nI get hurt I get hurt again but I think right now what is going on with him and he just plain exceptionally well and it goes down the list look the defense is starting to wake up\nYou know your JJ water's getting back there like he always does and getting to the quarterback and they're just making plays it right now you look at the agency solve their ticket they've taken a commanding lead in in terms of standings you know sold and\nBother to place a wager on this division at this point yeah ... I mean if anything maybe the Houston team now\nBut you get where I'm going with it I mean whether it's between Tennessee my rebel decided to go for two verses one at the end of the game\nJacksonville just laying eggs all over the place and then you never know with India you never know what the Colts at all 'cause sometimes luck and for what out of his back pocket and you are but mostly that's just a bad roster right now so you don't mean placing a wager on his division is probably not the smartest\nThing at the moment to do a but this Texans team is the outlier at the moment for the better of this division and uh yeah in an air see that right now are everyone's talking about Kansas City they are the hot new shiny toy everyone wants to talk about everyone's kind of play with\nAnd uh yeah you know ... watching kind of probably not getting as much love is taxable homes right now so maybe they're feeling that a little bit maybe he's been feeling that\nHe doesn't strike me as someone who really reads into like the news clippings and and the media and all that kinda stuff um hard worker type of guy by all accounts and\nUh but my biggest thing is that it's just I think you really have to feel good for like I said bill Brian because this is the guy who I always thought it's been a good coach Europe she's been in this league but again because they've been decimated by injuries for so many years now it's either like it's been either they have the guys are fence when they're down on defense or vice versa with injuries but now\nThey seemingly can put it all together at the moment em I think this is like at least a year from yeah absolutely and and you can be to\nThis is the year for I mean below bars that matters\nIt was simple fact that looked ever since he's been in every since he's been the ... like you said injuries is always taking the play and he's really it's really unfair to judges ... for the simple fact that he doesn't have a star players you have to walk goes down the clown he goes there\nYou know you have so many players that go down to your huge play makers\nIt's really tough into judging your star quarterback goes down who to be honest with you\nUm is the future he reminds me of became Newt and you know yeah I just saw watching like a like a ... he's a dangerous dangerous ... a quarterback we saw what he did to the patron before he was injured and last year\nAnd he was a tough guy to stop you know he's a play maker so if if you got to look out for them you know the people in there she got to really watch and see what the Texans are doing right now they're on a little road right now on a wave and they make you do need to make it going but let me tell you some\nIf they get it together they're going to be a dangerous team they're going to their defense is going to remind me of the super bowl defense of the Denver Broncos when they had to mark is where they have on Miller\nA key was achieved leave they had those guys I'm that's what it reminds me of so um you got to be you gotta be careful of them if they're if they keep on rolling and look the pages gotta look out even the Kansas City chiefs will have to look watch out you know if if they if they get keep it rolling\nYeah there are dangerous team no question and maybe tonight performance when we're thinking here will help to kind of bring them back into the national spotlight for a team you you think well\nComing up here in the middle of the season we need to reassess where the Texans are and how good to hear him his potential allies because like you said they've always had to Russia just a matter of everyone kind of staying healthy overall\nLet's talk about Miami for a second yes the dolphins I think it's kind of always the same song and dance every year they get off to a hot start whether it be that when the first couple of games they started three you know foreign or whatever it is a and similar to this year they do that same thing again and then they lose a couple of games that you know a couple of consecutive ones are three out of four\nAnd they just seem like they're lost right now I don't think it has anything to do with the starting quarterback um I don't think ... broadcast Wyler is really a starting quarterback in his league anymore he's a backup probably in in my estimation ah I don't think Ryan tannahill is a really great quarterback and this is kind of been a problem for them down here because\nThe dolphins had been married to him with the contract they given him over the past couple of years and and going forward um while these under contract\nAnd I don't know if they just to me it's just so hard to assess because I don't think tannahill was very ... I don't think is the best quarterback for the steam bought all the while I don't know if they've done a great job with surrounding him with a whole bunch of people\nI mean Kenya and drink it is a good back for them they still have Frank or on the ... toilet of his career I'm you know they brought to broaden Danny ... to play as well in addition to live on tape park there but I don't know if this team\nIs is really um it's just really kind of like all all around really made to play you know to to really help the steam sixty there's just something missing\nWell I'll look ranch you got your best\nYour your best a defensive player a camera weight comes out and says that the ... the deepest accountable for the loss and that's really where I look at it as just like look they're divas struggling but Miami make the mistake by giving away J uh jog well let's just call what it is that was their best running back\nAt the time he was there I think they gave they they made a mistake they gave him away he went to Philadelphia and won the Superbowl now look yes he's injured now the snap but that's not the ... I'm not thinking about the arms are saying\nThey were building something there and this is the problem with Miami when Miami starts to build a team and they really start to get going again of training pieces away\nAnd I never understood that about them like they'll get some good visas are good players on their team and then they'll train them away to other teams and just wait for ... pigs they don't let anything just kind of set in and molded ... none of the players really get a chance to really get to\nPlay with each other you know what I'm saying like they got the jail or anything like that they kind of like they keep them for maybe a couple of months and then they get rid of them they don't really that's the thing about\nThe ads a fair point they just can't seem to really put a a good foot forward down there like you said to take the next step in the division obviously they look up to a giant with the patriots have just dominated damages for so long right now but they shouldn't be better than what they've been they really seriously should've challenged New England for the past couple of years they should've challenged them and\nThey're just at the end of the day they're really not much better than the bills and jets and then he goes to be honest with you I I've always thought those three I've kind of always\nBeen the same around the same for the past couple of years or so so and and and none of the three can kind of separate themselves from the pack\nAlthough at this point I think it's clear\nOut of those three who's got the better quarterback situation going forward long term I think it's a jet with Sam darn it I think he's better than we obviously know it's a train wreck in Buffalo at that position a but I think that same Dharma is already proven

United States Department of transportation OK\nDOT I G I G DOT\nI don't know which go first so there you have it you have somebody who um is well versed in investigating that type of investigation that was the first question almost as if it were a possibility the entertaining of the uh you know all the different ideas\nThe fact is that we don't the the motive of the person or persons responsible\nPlease leave on known the whole false flag thing okay one possibility that's one possibility also possible that it is somebody who just\nFlat out hates Democrats and is is a wants to make a a wants to send a message and make a point about all of the\nPeople who hate Trump\nWe have no idea yet and won't know that until that person is known\nIf ever right and and and both sides are involved in my narrative just you know my narrative is what justifies the conclusion we saw it on social media yesterday you and I talked about that in our pre show meeting ... that you see well Trump needs were apologized because we know it's somebody that you know who supports him\nWho did this and then we saw the false flag it's the false flag thing you saw the means out they're Democrats are now sending bombs to themselves and everything else on social media\nAnd nobody knows but this is the nation that we live in and and that's part of the discussion that we had last hour we've had a significant discussion on it the ... this week\nWe want to believe the narrative before we even know what the truth was you and I dealt with this also because we talk of other instances of last hour that we dealt with this we dealt with the dough with Trayvon Martin ... to this day I have no idea what happened now because you have that you have that time span\nOf I forgot the exact types between two and four minutes where nobody knows what happened right\nWe don't know what happened nobody and people were taking sides on that we criticize former President Obama for taking sides remember the beer summit he had no idea the ... the former president when it came to police officers are involved in suspects shootings always took the side of\nThe alleged victim not knowing whether the alleged victim was actually a victim or not that's wrong to do so we set it and purchased and it was wrong for the president and the former attorney general Eric Holder to take sides in that\nAnd they took sides early on and then hold his own Justice Department found out\nThat the whole hands up don't shoot was ally when the FBI did the investigation or are there and they talked about the conspiracy in the neighborhood to keep the truth from coming out hands up don't shoot is still used today mhm\nWhen neither side does that it's wrong we should be basing our opinions on facts not speculation but we don't do that there is something I don't know what it is maybe it's social media where people believe that okay I have an audience now\nAnd so just like the media there's this third that I'm going to be first\nAnd if I get the right conspiracy theory if I can guess what happened before the facts comes out somehow that gives me some type of journalistic legitimacy\nYeah it's um you know it it because it would be one thing if you had sources right and you were putting together a puzzle but then that's not what this says it's speculation pure speculation pure speculation based on zero evidence based on nothing\nYou know if a Catherine heritage or says look what it is possible based on the leaks that are coming out or that it is but that somebody who would put pieces of a puzzle together\nA I think she's done some still work on a number of stories\nOr over the years but what are you doing you're going to people that have something for you\nAnd then ultimately you see if that peace that send to the puzzle or how the narrative starts to build out or how the how the truth I guess starts to come together that's all that is called journalism for those under sixty journalism\nWas very important you go to our nation and its rarely practice true journalism today\nBecause what you have is people wanting to\n'em and they believe they're right in doing so having opinion and have their work justify their opinion\nOr their behavior their words they believe that they're right we talked about this earlier this week about how the the biased media you know operates because they believe they're right they don't believe that they're biased they believe it's the right thing to do\nActivism in place of journalism is what we see today more often than not and\nYou when you look at a story especially one like this and still unfolding in in the public we don't we simply don't know all we know it was one has been found\nThat's it they have no idea\nAnd we're ... and what the mode and we're still not sure what has been found\nAnd we're still not sure whether the nature of what's been fired\n\nLet's how do you go to George in New York George welcome you're on Radio Welcome to the show Hi George\nHey how's it going guys good show um yeah I was calling about um [noise]\nIt seems like there's a lot of ah [noise]\nAre are going around about um\n[noise] ... sweeping in terms of the last I heard Newt Gingrich I think there's a report I judge report I\nGot where it gets on a panel some network I don't know which [noise] saying that the Democrats had two or three chance of winning the house terms I'm just wondering if\nYou build up this gateway independent voters no maybe not as serious gambling but it's hard and then there were just say well you know the law so why\nAre you saying that's why he would use and that's why Newt Gingrich did that\nFor sure I'm not sure about specifically but in general I mean I think she was first of\nAll why or how do you know that that would scare independence from voting if independence right now are leaning more conservative as the polls sense that they do that would actually encourage independence who leave conservative to me to actually go out and vote\nMaybe well that can be a to point to maybe that was as you point 'cause\nI look I when when you're talking about political operatives who you know you'd have to ask them what their motivation wasn't they'd probably be more willing to tell you after election you know why they're what why they did what they what they did and again we have looked at some of the polls out there and we of question you don't need silver for example we still question\nYou know how how legitimate you know how you can look at all these house races\nMake these determinations we still have a ton of of questions but when you look at it overall I think the consensus is more than the republic or the Democrats have a chance of taking back the house in a greater chance than Republicans keeping it but in the Senate\nI think you almost have universal agreement that the Senate is going to stay with with republic\nYeah in fact I saw something today uh that that basically just had you know that everyone all but it was it was the headline was directed more at the Republican candidates\nIn those races or republic Republicans in in general believing that they were going to keep the Senate or where the houses going I think that's still up in the air because there are some things that we can't misery even\nThrough pools but if you do it strictly by the polls right now than there is a better than decent chance that the Democrats would take the house that would not be shocking a when you talk about a first term president\nAre often that first midterm\nIs is something where the that shift a power happens that happened with a ... bomber in two thousand ten\nRight and so you could look at at at history that dictates says now\nDo we look at all anomalies that didn't exist before yeah trend in that area yeah Trump yet cabinet and that's what I was saying about the polls\nHave you go by the balls in history and then you could look out and go okay about Democrats take the house and and the Republicans keep the Senate\nAnd then you look in Nineteen Ninety four and say I did that happen right I was only a talk show host for a couple of years I still remember it how shocked everybody was\nAnd said whoa really except for his albino ... nobody really got that one did that and I wouldn't really came out of nowhere out of the Republicans take so many seats mhm well there was this underlying you know a underlying passion that existed and voting excitement from Republicans to go out\nThat somehow nobody saw now with the technology today\nAnd with the way that we do polling today have we improved it I don't know well and I will know a little over a little under two weeks from now call outs\nIs the only way you're going to get an answer for I'm a Republican or conservative in many cases you're not going to see them at protests you're not going to see them at at you might see them at a presidential or the ... the president's rallies but you're not going to see them doing these grassroots rallies that the weapons doing right now but the whole get out the vote make sure you out that kind of thing\nMembers ready for reporting Tom Arnold claims against

G.\nAnd ... women everything else is like from the ... what would stop this because it would be\nIf we think it's ... that just assume that it is beneficial to the president potentially that would be a good ... let me backtrack that many things have leaked from the White House I [laughter] don't say every so many things when you look at the nature of something that if if the White House believed it was going to help or\nIt wouldn't be the position of the chief of staff and advisors to the president that look\nHand this over to the guy gee allow him to do what he does and don't say well\nThe everybody speculating in the media everybody\nMhm uh about the bombs and then what the motivation is\nNeither speculating ... nobody's even nobody's speculating nobody's analyzing nobody's saying what I haven't seen one story\nAnywhere but maybe one existed I haven't seen I Would love to see mhm where somebody has made the same points that we have oh wow why did you give it to the inspector general there's only ... the whole thing was framed the story was initially framed that uh we had foreign allies that didn't want us to release this information\nOr we heard one story said it was the British Government because of Christopher Steele and we said well wait a minute why would you pay attention to them they don't know what the top secret information is I don't know what the president now I don't know what you have they don't know what's in the Pfizer warned so why would you pay attention to them\nAnd if you were going to not release it because things were top secret you would have gone\nTo probably your secretary of state who would be dealing with those governments and and there's also an ex director of the CIA and you'd be going to Dan Coats your own director of national intelligence you wouldn't be giving it to the inspector general who only looks for one thing\nAnd that's corruption and therefore once it was declassified\nAnd people saw what was declassified in the White House they looked in said there are probably possible crimes here and before we release just we need to first give it to the inspector general of the United states to go after the corruption that we see how come nobody has written that story\nRight and if somebody has I haven't seen it I've not seen any major publication right the possibility of that story and why this all went to the inspector general why would you give it to the inspector general you saw something\nThat you believe warranted his offices action\n\nAnd what his office deals with is corruption so you're giving him the only the only path that you can go down is you're giving him evidence of corruption in the FBI and the department of justice there is no other path to go down right\nAnd nothing on the story right\nBecause if you didn't believe if if the president looked at that and\nDidn't believe there was some kind of wrongdoing\nThan there would be no reason to contact or was it would be only if you believe if you saw it and said wow this looks like there's a possible wrongdoing within the department of justice\nThat's up to ... to write to report let's handed over because that's what the inspector general does\n... and by the way we'd be bringing this up and thanks to many of our listeners who I get a few a week ... people running an email saying what's going on right\nWhich would you guys ... round thing you hear anything I mean we haven't seen any stories on it either of what's going on I mean that shouldn't be one of the biggest stories right now and\nWho should be reporting this ... story who should be encouraging that Republicans are they\nNo no no no\nAnd I would think that that the media would be curious I Would think\nThat are Katherine heritage or or someone else like that would be curious you know anyone that that is a not in the mainstream media but ... but you know someone who has done some really great work in ...

most is the uh the economy\nOr the show you know are going back in different incarnations all the way back to Nineteen sixty nine or and and our dealings with the transportation industry as always uh had that particular issue bent on economics\nAnd so when I saw this today I said okay this is something that we have to bring up so people can understand about the economy at large it was the wall Street Journal's analysis of Commerce Department statistics out on why we're doing better what is driving the increase\nIn the gross and the GDP in the increase in economic growth what is you know what is driving it and their analysis is almost half of the increase\nFrom April of twenty Seventeen from last year so this year now new numbers are coming out this morning but based on the numbers that are that came out from last month\nAlmost half of the increase in our economy is due to increased government spending\nAnd they looked at you know really from the majority of the Obama administration where the uh economic uh growth was the average GDP was to point two percent\nAnd compared it to the two point nine percent economic growth that we've had since April twenty Seventeen just under three percent\nWhich is as you know we know is it is a good thing a defense spending has increased drastically that's one of the major reasons and increased government spending that has helped the the GDP a\nDefense\nSpending was contracted at an annual rate get this Eric a to point one percent from two thousand nine to twenty Seventy ... ... and they really go back to you know the

most accurate way it's the way that we use and it's become the accepted way\nIt's never been the most uh uh accurate way we believe to truly a show the indication of economic growth\nBecause money being transferred back and forth or government spending is viewed the exact same way as private sector profits and sales and we believe that that distorts\nThe actual growth rate of any economy but
