the streets\nQuite frankly in Manhattan I give us thirty minutes before someone knocks it over and then just strip it down for parts\nOr when you consider all the bad drivers on the road imagine for just a moment that all those drivers now have a drone accessible to them that's right\nAnd twenty six Tina drone came within two hundred feet of a plane that was approaching LAX but what if that collusion has actually occurred All right Kevin poor\nHe's with the University of Dayton research Institute impact physics division he said I Want to find this out\nThe answer they he arrived at isn't

quit\nThe ... to point one pounds and then he had the biggest there can in his lab could actually handle so the banter wasn't certain says forty foot cannon released at a speed up two hundred and thirty eight miles per hour it hit point zero three seconds later\nAnd although the drone was obliterated it held together long enough to strike the wing is one object and that's key here rather than multiple fragments\nNow wired magazine describes a slow motion video the drone entering the wing as like US Foods for chocolate moose than if you're a kids club member and you're watching the video

Pennsylvania Hi there Jim\nEither Kim nice to talk with you again\nYou know what's going on well wait wait wait well we'll we'll use that nice to talk to you again so you've been a caller before\nA long time ago I got a long time listener and I'm a ... called the number\nOh well thank you Jim I appreciate that very faith I have\nA list every weekend so I actually watch\nWell good way of the high there [laughter] so ah so how can I help you today\nWell I should've minding my own business but you didn't\nI didn't have an acquaintance too recently\nUh reconnected with a a daughter he had it in a marriage when he was in the military and Europe okay ah and that was a\nWell Nineteen Ninety eight she was born and they recently reconnected and the people in his family are pretty concerned\nUh so I thought I did that old easy button and just do a background search on her and she would I could play a no avail us failed miserably\n... wait whoa wait so so you put so she's what Nineteen she's Twenty years old okay All right so she's Twenty years old\nAnd that's right because you said Nineteen Ninety eight um\nYou couldn't really find anything about her leg on Instagram or Facebook or anything like that oh I did\nI did I found a a Facebook account that looked like it had the origin or January twenty Eighteen oh but that's not very much of a\nYou know not in Iraq\n\nAnd so so you are trying to do a background check on this young woman so that this way you can tell your friend more about her or are you afraid that she's not really the daughter or that she's going to scam ham or what all\nAll of the above okay uh she does for for money or they're not rich by any means uh uh the family just to spend a lot of concerns over this and it's causing trouble in the family so\nOh I'm sure and then all of a sudden you have a kid coming out of the blue right and you're like okay I\nJust the body standard all the [noise]\nWell here are good friend I mean you're worried about right and you want to make sure I was\nI was concerned and a ... so uh I don't like she anybody get hurt\nA ... and and I heard you talk about the the big four and a different sites for to get a lot but I used to ... dot com yeah the book to go up and um come up with nothing\nYou know there's also family trained now\nWhere okay\nYou might be able to find something in your family tree now it's supposed to be like where you put your family tree together but it really there's a lot of information there\nUh and of course much like any other site Jim you have to be careful especially when you look at people searching sites is that what appears to be an actual box that is going to help you find somebody is nothing other than an ad so you really need to\nKeep your wits about you and don't do this if you're having a beer glass of wine because Germany click and other places\nAre and then of course there's Dava search which is another place for you to check but I mean if you are really trying to to find information about this young woman\nIs that you know I'm surprised that that\nYou know he can't friend her on social media or somebody that he knows could friend her on social media\nBecause that would be the easiest way you know especially if this is his daughter and so you know what how can and then you could then he can share his credentials with you if you want but he if he wants and then you can start snooping around and see if there's anything else out there\nYeah I don't think he wants anybody ... thinks oh he doesn't want to know I don't think he wants to know oh why\nYou have a you have an uphill battle all around\nRight what does your gut telling you\nA might get is telling me that she is his daughter and I don't think she's got a very good background and I think she's just out to get what she can get\n... well maybe you know you can do your background search you can see what you can\nFind online and you know maybe you're just counting your friend on the warning signs things to look out for a\nYou know as far as you know first she's going to ask for ten dollars then it's going to be a hundred dollars you know whatever it may be\nYou know as it goes on I\nAnd maybe you know he needs to text you every time that she asked for money so that this where you have a record of it because he's not going to want to remember or it sounds like he's probably not even gonna tally and now that I think about that\nWell we're we're not that close I like I said I'm just a a a bystander and all of this so there's a connection to uh [noise] uh other people uh that I'm associated with a ... and everybody's concerned ... uh and it's taken a toll on his own current family\nChris how you doing I'm good what's going on for a well a personal\nFor you the question I shall which no I wouldn't say thank you for keeping your company and my drive home from work you're awesome [laughter] a big question is my brother just went through a pretty nasty divorce and he's got a young son who has an end or throw my brother is an apple so he does a window Android\nAnd he asked for me to research a\nTractor so he knows where his son his when he doesn't have custody\nUm 'cause he each he's a little concerned that his white white before the\nI don't know do various ... okay I get what you want your website and there's a tracker on there it's a free one that is a\nQuarter the website it up to ... hours and there was a notation saying that if you wanted to pay for one there are the ones out there but I couldn't find the other ones that you might recommend well here's ... good\nOh no I was gonna say you know so here's the deal is that you know he ... the the sun is going to know about the tracker okay\nAnd at twelve years old it's probably not a bad idea that the sun does know that there's a track or you know there's really no way to unless unless he could actually get the phone and install this tracker on and not have the kid no right\n[noise] and then that sort of issue okay alright that's sad when there's a a depending on the carriers of rising are age ... do you know who the carrier is a\n... to ... okay if the mobile has it to 'em because he's probably play paying for the kids' cell phone plan right\nI'm Sorry if he paid for the kids phone uh yes okay\nIs that the carriers and they also they have something like family low care packages and the ... and it's like ten dollars a month but\nWhat I like if it's from the carrier is that not only can he see where the boys that but the boy can see where he's at an okay and if the if\nHe had you know his grandparents where he want to even to normally you can have up to ten people on a plan\nOr a you know and you know there's also glimpse which is also something you might want to look at that but not through the carrier and that's G. L. Y. M. P. S. glimpse\nAnd Clinton glimpse works a lot like find my friends but it works across platforms okay and so I Would look at the team of a Web site looked at their family locate or like I said normally it's like ten dollars a month for up to ten phones or whatever\nAnd then you know the boy can also you know the sun can actually have a sense of security that he knows if something does happen with his mom\nThen everybody's close by and he can see exactly in paying somebody and it's not look at that glimpse program that glimpse at rather because I think that'll do the trick to and thanks for

Tony how can she will be following wherever I went you\nKnow but then I was an executive with a major studio and there were times 'cause I think about I've said it before I Want to say it fast so I Want to take away from her experts is that one gal I use the story of her she was a great friend of mine equal level executive and we talk to each other and I knew her husband you know conferences and all that you take your wives or significant others and you get to know\nSo she was telling me we're trying to have a baby so why is\nHe offered a health names or\nWhat do you have any [laughter] I said look\nHer name was ... actually I go Renee if you need to put more men on the job I'm your guy along a lot of kids in his day and age I'm Out of their God you're fine\nGot it or not unwelcome if she truly language right if she should have to contact you guys\nAre so do you find that more is it a different type of person that has well I think it takes a lot for some people to finally get offended right at sometimes not right away or if somebody's really like a jerk\nYeah yeah I mean you got to look at subjectively and objectively says some by says something like hey look really nice today\nUm you know than reasonable person would say that's not offense and all that you know whatever but the person you're saying to maybe they're super high percentage of their head and they don't like it yeah yeah and they don't like it\nBut you gotta look at both of those situations and that you know the whole circumstance\nAnd if you're a woman and someone says how nice you luck but their eyes and not a thing at your face out right now\nSo you're saying that you can't say a woman looks nice today while you're looking at her breath\nWell is it a hand to hand and I don't know I actually got away with that question [laughter] no no no no they're not germane your I was not to have some show to women\nToo I mean it has a Mormon or okay with that you have women think men will be men and women of course men are attracted to women and you're like I've heard of that and you know you just gotta keep it kind of a parameter ... that's not a big you know but then there are some people that are very sensitive you at\nThe compliment with looking at a body part is not cool yeah no even from the old school days right right you got an discipline yourself to look that I have a question for both of our expert\nAny and that is if if a client wants to hire either of you do they need to have a ton of money to get things started or other alternative arrangements\nI think that's what the misconception is everyone thinks as soon as you hear attorney or a lawyer you're thinking oh my God I'm gonna have to spend a pretty penny but the reality is a contingency feet you don't pay anything out of pocket and or if there's no recovery and you're not paying anything the attorneys are the ones that are\nYou know advancing the costs and a third time\nI agree and the great thing about a civil rights law that area I practice important ally is that you get your attorney fees if you prevails at the end so I'm the employee does not have to come out of pocket substantially initially um and if you prevail then we get paid\nYou know listeners will your listeners really understand this because especially you know\nTony and Matthew they are out laying money to protect you as the plaintiffs you don't pay a penny until they get an get an award or a positive result and if there's no positive result you still don't pay a penny but please understand when you call every of\nThese attorneys cannot just take every case right because they're making an investment in your case so I let Matthew ... last time I asked you a question let me ask toning down hard on me or Tony ... perfect hotter mia dot com\nJ. A. R. A. M. I. L. L. A. dot com\nOkay so uh so Tony you get ... assume you get a lot of calls from you know the employee work\nSo you have to spend time and decide because you're going to be investing money right ... as well correct yeah and you ... you know it's not going to if it's not a case it's just going to be time consuming if you also listeners but it's not going to cost you any money yeah\nSo that's why a you know if you've been in an accident and you feel like you're harassed you get in touch with especially with our attorneys here today and if you're having a little difficult you know marriage isn't going to well child custody you know you could\nTalk to a mat rap artist [laughter]\nI don't have the first one I Do\nTony how to me because I completely butchered her name the whole night [laughter] ah no hot on me uh it's J.
