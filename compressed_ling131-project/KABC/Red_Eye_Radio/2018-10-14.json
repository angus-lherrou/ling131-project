could recommend a website or a resource that folks in something like Consumer Reports for applications [noise]\nAh so you are tired of downloading apps that promise and don't deliver is that what's happening\nYou that's part of it yeah or I I ended up using a nap or using a program to accomplish the task I get done and I go visit their an easier way to do that\nBy having an example okay we'd babysit our grandchildren for the summer on Tuesday Spanish so I thought it would be cool to make a little book at the end of the summer that said here's what I did at grandma's house on Tuesday for fact\nI ended up using Microsoft Word and importing a bunch of photos and putting in touch it ended up being thirty five pages long about fifty to sixty photos but it was a short it was really hard you know what I thought it was that there are publishing program that maybe could help me do that better\nWell you know unfortunately with close to one and a half million apps right now\nThere it's really difficult to find any type of authentic reviews site\nA there are sites like ours that will do round up so say you know here at ten great photo apps but we would only hit ten out of maybe two thousand or five thousand that could be available\nOr icy if you're looking for a particular app you can always read the the reviews people are brutally honest\nAbout what they liked about it what they didn't like about it but Andrew a you used a particular site to put together a photo book did you not yes we're shuttle flight you shutter flies look at\nAnd because you know important fortunately Tom says it was a thirty five page word document that you've got these but you know making photo books as a sense whether on Yahoo Photos Google Photos wherever it may be\nIn one of the great things was I misspelled the word in the book no yes and we got it and cause I created a birth story of my son and I misspelled the word I called them up and they're like oh we'll just we'll just fix it and send you know and no charge\nAnd so you so before you look for a particular app that only does one task is that you might want to look at okay\nUh what is it there's John ready to work with and work with photos maybe the photo sites will make a photo book because you're right putting it into Microsoft Word trying to form at those pages and getting that done\nThat's a complete nightmare but the other thing that might be kind of fun for you to do is Andrew what you did with the gentleman on fiber where you created the animated book that that your kids really love\nYes and we I sent them real pictures they we communicated back and forth on five or ... I think it was in the end it was nine original illustrations based on photos and I mean I Know the websites called fire but it's still only ended up costing like a hundred and sixty dollars for someone to ... to take months to make those animation\nAnd so so and so the next time you have a task foot in front of you Tom\nYes uh-huh call us\nOkay okay [laughter] okay I mean that's why we're here and or drop me a note\nThrough the website and I know this sounds crazy and a lot of people don't believe me but I Do I read every single know that you send me through the website\nAnd I've got a system I've done it for many years and when you send me your question things that you want to accomplish we will use that as content\nOr for a tip or a cool site or an app review or whatever it may be over a commander dot com or you could just call and give a call to the show and if you're a Kim's club member by the way you always get priority calling and you can join comes club right now\nOver and get Kim Dotcom stay right where you are big security alert I Need to tell you about what's Web cams that's spreading like crazy across the United states you're on the came commando show [noise]\nWith more and more of our lives and moving on line\nIntrusion into our privacy can have devastating consequences one great way to secure your privacy so you can have their freedom to be anonymous and on traceable on line is to use what's called a VPN it stands for virtual private network when choosing a VPN you really need to trust the company running it\nAnd I recommend F seek to our freedom VPN secure as a publicly lifted company they have the thirty years' spotless track record of protecting its customer security and privacy\nIt's so easy to use and it's really easy to set up you'll be up and running in just a few minutes\nActually care even let you try for free for five days no sign up no credit card details required\nYou can trust as the cure to protect your privacy and to keep you anonymous and untraceable online\nOr to your freedom VPN now and get twenty percent off when you use discount go camp visit EFF staff secure dot com slash camp that's F dash secure dot com slash camp\nI'm working two jobs and my husband and I tell\nMy kids go to school with your kids I sit next to you know ... we live right next door\nNeighbors for years you know my family and me pretty well but here's one thing you don't know\nI'm a line on every American [noise]\nAnd my family is struggling with hunger I\nLike him ... country\nWas hard to believe and then the land of milk and honey how many hardworking Americans have to choose between hang down and feeding our family has a problem with isolation please visit Feeding America that are today\nAnd find your local food bank for ways to help and free Donahue Downey helps provide seven meals for those around you quietly traveling together and we're Feeding America\n... by Feeding America and the\n[noise]\nThey are the worst thing shes and brought you buy be prepared dot com slash cam you're one step solution for emergency food water gear and resources\nAnd be prepared dot com slash Kim it'd be ready for anything once again that's be prepared dot com slash Ken [noise] All right there about nine million Web cams and security cans that are just wide open to attack and I want you to make sure that yours is not on the list okay there's a company called ... among guy\nThat's the that's the company who makes all these Web devices and security cameras the guess way\nThat's not going to me the name on the Web cam or their security can because they make tons of Web cams for all kinds of companies but basically what's happening\nIs that these Web cams and security cams are\nSo accessible that if you change in the past where\nSomebody can still break in and if in case you want to see if your webcam security cameras on the list it over to commanded outcome of course that's K.

pain about three weeks ago I was in a well\nKnown ... store grocery our market yeah and I was wearing tennis shoes you know fancy high heels stilettos and I have good balance and I thought it might help\nAnd ah you know that the employees came over and you know they determined that it does it for ... ... ... and\nAnd if I did it go to the hospital and I would want beret and everything I jumped up and finished my shopping allows\nSo you didn't do what we were with teaching you to do go to the hospital\nWell I'll go ahead you know so you you're you sound you jumped up go ahead\nSo it's been three weeks later uh-huh and I was wondering what I said\nWell what's happening in three weeks later you have any well let me get mail please take over\nI never it and I'm kind of an art deal in a very painful and and I I have a Q A poppy seed medical advice\nOr an attorney first actually so heavy heavy senior doctor and and you find out figure out what the injuries are\nAh no I have not take anyone yet and that's ... that's probably what I Need to do\nWhat are you feeling what are your symptoms what you're paying\nA you know eight extant aches and pains and all that\nLike I mean usually this is what we hear we we hear people that had an incident at a grocery store supermarket and you know it's important if you you reported the incident if someone who took her record that's one way of proving that this incident did really happen you know after that the\nOther issues are are you know what you've done for your medical care who you've seen and what the diagnosis is with respect to your current injuries and you're you know any lingering issues that you have so that definitely needs to be addressed but you know associated with components\nA with these types of cases of it all cases when it's proving liability that they are liable\nThat there was something on the floor and then the other portion of it is the injuries and damages so the liability on slip and fall type cases are incredibly difficult\nSo we would definitely have to show that they either had actual notice of what was on the floor or there was constructive or knowledge of it so meaning that they knew or should have known that there was something on the floor so it's definitely needs a lot of investigative work as far as the liability\nPortion of it is concerned but I'm more concerned about you getting better and are making sure that you are seen by the right doctors and and providers\nTo identify the injuries\nSo what I'm hearing also ... and I think Matthew was thing I'm hearing this correctly you probably she go to the doctor and do the X rays the MRIs and all that stuff to find out the extent of your injuries to begin with Matthew ...\nBecause if they have like you know one of those yellow not placard but you know what I mean then we do have no ... it says be where slippery floor\nThat doesn't mean that doesn't mean okay I mean the fact that they know it's wet and they put a sign there they may have to do oh more than what they did to notify the consumer that there are a lot out so\nThat could work against the market in this case possibly is interesting to see when you

your problems but particularly if you've been in some type of accident of sexual abuse may have a child has suffered a birth defect or like myself I just my parents at all I was a birth defect premise liability and all that\nSo ... what is a is there any place you working on now worth case that you and your client got us a particularly good outcome or some or anything you working on now that it's kind of you\nKnow one one of the cave there's plenty of cases that are very interesting and and the outcome has been pretty good significant because we really go all the way we do what needs to be done to maximize it for the or a client right but one of the cases that's\nAlways been an interesting case and then I always talk about it but people is that we got a case from another attorney that this lady was standing on a corner streets I'm ready to be picked up by her husband\nAnd a two cars collide and one veers off and pins her between you know my God car and the K rail and that was placed on the sidewalk\nAnd what is a K real forgive the concrete barriers that at some point they would put on the sidewalk okay for a security purposes and so unfortunately she sustained some catastrophic injuries and eventually ended up losing a or a lack of a horrific issues\nUh but the reason why I bring it up is because it was handled in a way not to talk bad about anyone but it was handled in a way where they said it doesn't matter what your injuries are the insurance policy on this as just a hundred thousand dollars\nTake it or leave it but who she's suing who to she's suing the drawn to cars that collided whoever is responsible she's going after her previous attorney was going after whoever was responsible for that access so why is it a maximum of a hundred thousand because the only a policy they are they how hungry okay got it\nThat explains a we we took over the case and ah make a long story short we identified a lot more defendants individuals with deep pockets that we could go after\nWhich one of the cars I wanted to\nBuy a business that had a million dollar policy okay and then uh the other defendants were property owners across the street that had put the chaos that shouldn't have been put the way they did it wasn't installed and and\nAnd the business owners do to protect their storefronts or something\nThey did it to protect the executives that we're sitting right behind the K rails so they want it to make sure that there is no cars in LA\nWe just had to call it a very sad events happen wearing ... involved his wife and a botched back surgery spinal surgery so let me ask Matt somebody's in an accident you know you leaving work you leaving home whatever in car accidents bad car accident\nAnd your driving you know you're you're right no fault they contact your office what happens next\nAfter we get some detailed information about the facts of the accident and and um\nIf there was a police report witnesses I'm assuming if it was a major accident there was a police report a but\nThen we start asking questions with respect to the injuries and how they've been hurt and what body parts and if they have their medical provided that they've seen if they've been to the hospital if they haven't they should go see their primary care physician immediately okay and uh get an idea as to what they need to do for the injuries\nAnd a lot of times we get calls that people don't have a primary care and and they don't know where to go\nAnd uh one of the things that we do as we say okay we're going to figure out what area are you in and trying to locate a medical provider for you okay that that would render services on a lean basis meaning you don't have to pay out of pocket right um and\nIt would rented the services and and make sure they identify the issues and the injuries and and treat that\nAnd you know and then we take over and handle the case and do all the fact finding an investigative work and manage the medical care as to what's being down what needs to be done and you know what the the client doesn't really have any uh thing to worry about as far as costs are concerned\nI'm its contingency fee so they don't pay us anything until we\nAnd yeah and for the listener like what exactly is what his contingency fits contingent upon us recovering and collecting for you so if we don't collect for you know oh it's a dime and all the costs are you may be ally money\nI have all the Concorde even as a you know as a penny yeah if if it's ...\nOkay so listeners out there you know please I mean many of you know this but some of you don't if you're in any kind of accident whatever it is and you know there are many personal injury attorneys and Matthew we'll vet your case who want to hear what it's about but I think the advice first is to\nGo to a doctor or even nine one one if\nNecessary if it's a bad accident he didn't want to call nine one one right on one may have already called nine one one then you want to make sure you're treated at the scene and ... if you can go to the hospital and get checked out that's very important\nSo when you say the victim or the I'm Andrea argue injured party there's no see out of pocket whatsoever now for uh any cost related you pay your from ...\nAll ... all of the costs and you don't pay us anything on\nThe last ... Saddam at yeah those are our listeners are you hearing this so this is Matthew ... is a great guy the ... law firm dot com oaks law firm dot com ... wow so that's good I mean that's good because a lot of listeners don't understand that you know pick up the phone call or you may not have a case you may\nReally have a ... and and you may just have questions for not objective with all due to pick up his faith are sufficient at all I have a ... tough question you've been in a really bad accident\nAnd let's say you went on a motorcycle and you know what's the bus God Forbid\nWhy pick ... from what do you do that's different what am I going to get and listen what are they going to get with your from\nWhile you're you want the attorney to handle the case to us okay that's as you heard of firms out there and a lot of them are mills and fortunately ride out so you know you don't have the attorney that's handling it we're bright type setting where we pick and choose our cases so you actually have attorneys they're handling a case yeah\nI yeah I I kind of had an idea that that that that's the answer and you want to have somebody up some confidence in and I think\nAh my wife was when it once in a bad accident ex wife um she married me [laughter] and believe me and my mother in law who's gone would admit that that was a big mistake that I gave her a great life by what the hell no but um yeah I think she\nJust called a couple of attorneys and one was very gung ho you need an attorney that's I I hate the word enthusiastic but feels confident\nThat I even have a real case you need someone who is aggressive who knows what they're doing yeah and ah you said it best if if you feel comfortable with that individual that's per se going to go it\nYeah it's and it's funny like in life we like to think let's say you need a surgery and you want to go to the best as I have had a couple of minor surgery is you know in the shoulder and all that stuff [noise]\nBecause I'm ... I'm kind of friendly warm guy I like to talk to people invariably I did get good surgeons but a couple of guys that I met ... I just hated their personalities is you know I didn't get a good vibes from now\nThat's very yeah yeah it is that's the same thing with the hiring a lawyer you know I don't want to go with someone who is very distant and doesn't want to talk right 'cause right now I might say you want to have someone was personable knows what they're doing but you got to feel comfortable\nYeah I Want a guy that I could you know Hey Matt so what's going on I'm not going to do your thing call me if you need anything you know I'm On the ... tell me what's going on and all that [noise] yeah it's funny I think in ... you know in most professions I even an accountant whomever you want somebody that you could be comfortable with that and trust the course\nOr the year they last year and the boss you're hiring that individual you might want to make sure that you're able to communicate with it and\nYou know like I didn't even want to ask Peter the question and Pete if you're still listening\nUm I Would have asked the ... with a spinal cord injury in surgery did you get more than one or two opinions and listeners you know be the wiser and do that you don't have to just get one opinion whether\nIt's a doctor or lawyer accountant you guys want to get a second opinion that's you know why\nAlways always educated hey I hire a plumber I Need a second yeah last year and I don't need the guy with the uh you know the crack in the back of his pants and who's the company that advertises that the cameras smell our good\nKenny fix the pipes and it's great you know it's the smells good [laughter] yeah maybe you're right but here's the funniest thing and I don't think we'll get sued for this I don't remember the name of the\nThe serve at the company they that's their advertisements smell good plumbers [laughter]\nSo in other words you get hired as a plumber by that that was a plug that some ... hello out there with other from his home or your your your well as fuel if money let's talk a little bit of 'cause this is really um you know it's in the air in today's world\nA sexual abuse and molestation so you 'cause a lot of times um give us a case it's definitely because you're nodding so yeah\nYeah very very ah difficult to handle these kinds of cases very sad part of what we do is especially if you're dealing with kids kids who are in a ... on my caregiver or even I have a care to a family member\nAnd uh this horrific horrific stories and there's multiple cases that we've had that our heart wrenching just being in the midst of it and handling it um\nYou know at the end they think you know I have a seven year old and I have a four year old guy you know now I'm I'm very it's very scary I Want to make sure that I Know where they're going who they're with even more than before because I Know what can happen and it's when you least expect that\nYou know a lot of times you leave your kids have these daycares and are you thinking okay they're ... from the wrong person you really haven't vetted or done a background search you and you're leaving your kid there and God Knows what can happen in there\nYou know it ... it and what it does to the whole environment the culture of being we'll talk about just being around children right now\nI'm my former wife she was like a second grade teacher and this I mean do you remember your kind of a younger do you remember the ... Martin case yeah of course yeah so that was kind of would you say that really that was a witch hunt the leading the kids on to say things and all I\nKnow I mean that that was that was one of the worst uh\nBut those kind of things happen on a regular basis you just don't hear about all the time yeah and um you know a lot of these places looks perfectly All right you go in and you talk to them and you're like oh my God this looks like a ... grade yeah but you don't know what's going on in there you don't know if they're you know and I don't want to say this now\nYou yeah you don't know if they're beating your kid\nOut or if they're you know feeding them properly and so there's a lot of vetting that\nShows are so you have your kids ... sounds like they went to some kind of pre schooler I care for love\nAnd are you allowed to ... you should be allowed to just pop in absolute I mean that's gonna make you feel you know you would say look just coming anytime you want to sit in on the class and all that if there are any restriction got an a you know I had all the effort they are yeah yeah that\nThat's a bad sign for and how 'bout now with adult cases like the sexual abuse is it usually against an lawyer you know have you handling a case like in the ... they usually in the in the workplace\nI mean at work but you've got workplace you've got a you know the one that's in the news a lot is the church and you know so it just depends on what you're dealing with if it was a family member\nUm you're definitely going to want to help that individual in that family and try and get some sort of a therapy in some sort of help for that individual\nBut you really not going to be able to get them anything for what they've gone through\nYeah thanks a lot for taking my call All right hey Barry how are you I'm good I'm good\nWhere are you listening to the show a little bit Yes sir\nOkay sir I've very hey Barry I meet ... personal injury attorney and what's your story what's your question what's your problem\nI had an employee a question\nOkay well he's ... he were personal injury attorneys did the employee slip and fall of the work that's going on [laughter] well tell us I'm no I'm I'm sure maps you could give you some guidance on it\nOkay well my uh cousin yeah was in a grocery store shopping okay and hello\nYeah we're here oh so I get it now she was she was an employee but she was off duty\nShot yeah okay well that's a separate question okay go ahead and and\nUh she there was some liquid on the floor\nOkay and she fell and broke her leg leg yeah well I'm going to lead an\nOdd fall so she slipped some liquid\nRight in a grocery store you know near a a where they serve as a broken leg and they call you know gun and\nYou know they called nine one one and they brought it to the hospital and she needed her leg fix\nThan for last February or did you come out with a caster ... yeah a pseudo a yes or so anyway she used to work and\nUh she was trying to get a hold of cherry to take the case and um uh\nShe was given a hard time because they said you know there's no real proof that anybody see it she didn't take pictures\nI'm you know what was on the floor and you know but anyway\nGo ahead and injuries seemed to be significant enough that any attorney would want to anyone that knows what they're doing\nWould want to delve into it and and probably litigated and within litigation and discovery kind of figure out what they can obtain as far as evidence\nAnd see what was on the floor and you know how long it had been on the floor so and so forth so even if there is no witness I mean if there was would have been great but if there isn't a witness that shouldn't really\nAre you a reason why you wouldn't want to pursue act that this surgery and the yeah the\nInjuries are pretty significant so you definitely want to make sure he taught I haven't really significant\nInjuries and uh would store um have to if they had surveillance video turn that over to the plate\nSo if you ask them they're not going to give it to you uh but you would want to make sure that you put them on notice that you watch the video and in ah once the lawsuit was filed in discovery you request that tape and you also do an inspection of the site um so that you can kind of figure out and put two and two together\nAs far as where it happened how it happened but you you put them on notice and you get the video a lot of times you get get get the uh um a place\nYou know the security or the management they'll tell you look we lost that we don't have every recorded over ... but there's ways of going about it to prove that they're lying about this whole thing and they either habit and they don't want to show it to you because that's going to show what was on the\nFloor and ... and then the employees that were there\nThey have to let that go to court that the verify that you know something was on the\nFloor on yes ... I mean they came right over and sorrow\nYeah unfortunately you're not going to get too much out of the employees that are still working there because\nThey want to stay there and so they're not going to say to me when I uh they are\nBut then again with the right type of questions and and depositions you may be able to get some\nKind of your lawyer like Matthew knows how to give depositions to get the information or look we're up against that there's the our flew by it really did math has been a great guess\nAnd I really want to thank a Matthew when the people is from for allowing him to get away to spend an hour with us so ... great guy and he's he ate shade the oaks law firms dot com\nOaks law firms outcome we're going to go and have a couple of beers because he's the guy to guy out here with my appreciate it All right out of here with great having you're\nAll right so ah come back next Saturday Night and if you missed any part of the show we will be a on podcast the end of the week\nAnd Matthew is going to be there for a year [laughter] so ah yeah come back next week and that's a wrap thank you [noise]\nOh okay how [noise]\nHonestly censored okay a lazy as we were saying podcast from\nGet to enjoy the case and into the wild and\nWhat happened with Harry Kroto\nDownload and Barbary see that sources say honey okay I'm late potash support free worth every penny have said he got common man hand on audio\nAudio ... show British by than ... ...\nYou were shot if one thousand dollars four times a day for K.
