something okay\nBut we need to have at least some basic facts that we can use to piece this together and say whether it's even plausible that it happens and those basic facts involved need to be at the very least where it happened and when it happened which we still don't have for this\nUm you know after engaging in public conduct with Andrea how he's offering to bring a mother back here or

a few articles and one of them that I stumbled upon was why there are no it was titled something along the lines of why there are no cell recommendations and uh the the thing that was the kind of hit me with that is we have that bullish bias that we've been talking about\nBut it really hit me and it's one of the things I've been talking a lot about in my classes is we really have to recognize that we are customers\nOf Wall Street right and their job is to sell us products they selves mutual funds they still ... and they sell us they sell us stocks now\nWhen you go back through time that they had a broken down in this article when they showed\nWhere they ... they showed that even in the worst financial market conditions the S. and P. five hundred stocks didn't even reach eight ten percent so recommendation over Ninety percent of all the stocks even during the financial crisis even during the tech boom still had by and or hold recommendations on it and my credit question to you to be\nHow is that how is that uh uh how is that recommendation\nThat we can trust as far as consumers as far as investors go when we know the market goes down and the only way to make money is to buy low\nSell high yet there's never a recommendation to sell\nWell not only is Wall Street in the business of making money when they sell you a product or service\nThey basically are also acting as the custodian of your assets and they make most of their money not off transaction fees mulatto people misunderstand how Wall Street really makes money they make money banking your assets when they are the custodian of your assets for instance let's assume you own\nTen thousand shares of Akron me\nThey have and you give them the right to loan those shares out to third parties are two individuals are institutions that would like to short those shares\nAnd that's where they make their money there is a banking fees that they earn so Wall Street makes most of their money not in what are called dark daily average revenue trades they make their money being the custodian of your assets including being custodian of your cash\nBut Wall Street always want you to be long equities\nThey never I mean rarely I shouldn't say never but they rarely get a cell recommendation because it's bad PR and you'll notice if you watch most of the financial media out there\nThey have that same message out there that buying hold works and we have shown data has shown perpetually that buying whole does not work if we're in a bull market buying whole works pretty good until the next bear market comes along and then we're looking at a potential forty to fifty percent haircut on the price of equities\nYeah absolutely and when you look back at the the financial institutions they don't own the island of Manhattan because they charge five dollars a trade\nYou know not only are they the custodians but they also use are investing our investments and our capital as leverage for their own investments so we're like they're collateral that they use right have a whole lot of buying power out there but it's one of the reasons why they can influence the markets so much\nI was well if we are coming up

the financial markets that's right I said John O'Donnell so if you guys have been listening to the show for a while\nYou're saying right or the heck's Larry you usually Larry's with you today\nLarry is out today and so we are we are blessed to have these great visitor the chief knowledge officer training academy here Mr John O'Donnell I like to call them the rain maker if you're just tuning in don't worry the best is yet to come\nJohn when I'm Talking to our listeners in classes sometimes it's via social media and I know you have a huge social media presence\nMany of them are saying they don't have enough money to retire and those who do have enough money or not quite sure really even what to do with it especially given the volatility the all time highs everything like that one of the things I'd like to do is just kind of kick a question over to you and see where see where your brilliance actually takes this because I'm excited to hear what you have to say on this topic\nWith us being at these all time highs and having that kind of volatility that can come in where in any day we know we can have that four hundred point down or that four hundred point up\nWhat's what some of the things that you're really talking to students about or what are some of the things that you're having individuals' focus on the instructor teams the new students out here to really protect their retirement accounts from the volatility wall still allowing them to generate more retirement income inside of them\nWell I think the most important thing to do is to do the same thing you you did for your automobile do the same thing you did for your home\nAnd maybe even for your life for member when you buy life insurance you're basically buying a replacement income source of something happens to you for your show the income source will take care of your wife and children I think it's appropriate would markets being in an all time high\nA and that includes the bond market you know a treasury yields today tenure ... or three percent\nIs that we basically need to buy some insurance\nOne of the ways to buy some insurance in the stock market could be a couple of strategies one maybe you start to sell down part of your portfolio maybe it's time to take some off the table that doesn't mean it's an all or nothing nothing decision\nBut what if you were to sell Fifteen twenty percent of your portfolio and just go to cash\nWhat if you were to take part of those cash proceeds and buy some put options on the S. and P. as you know the general stock market marks very well marked the market\nTo the price volatility BS in pig\nSo I think it's appropriate especially for somebody heading into retirement I mean let's face it\nMay be twenty percent of the retirement baby boomer community\nThose of U.S born between Nineteen forty six in Nineteen sixty three have properly funded or on pace to fund\nOur retirement vehicle all of us sooner or later issues so are are well aware Ryan will sooner or later either voluntarily or involuntarily be forced to live out of that retirement bucket\nWe will ... may be a help to vent it may be who knows what you know stuff happens in life we need to be prudent at this time especially with the market being an all time highs and the appropriate thing to do if you have some nice capital gains\nHope you have them in a tax deferred vehicle or like a self directed IRA where you don't have to pay the taxes you get the tax differ into your ultimately start to live out of that bucket but I think it's appropriate with Marcus at or near an all time high\nAnd economic challenges on the horizon with the threat of trade wars which I don't see it going away or I don't see too many parties backing down right now the uncertainty is going to continue what if one was to\nBe proved it and just go to cash or use a derivative of put option to buy some insurance let's call it portfolio insurance no different than the fire insurance you talked about on your home you\nKnow one of the interesting things about fire insurance and portfolio insurance that they have in common is right now we you know markets are overall going higher and higher which means our portfolio is not on fire\nRight and and saying that we can go to my house right now my house is not on fire now I I imagine the market starts to fall apart essentially that means our portfolios are now on fire\nHow much more expensive is fire insurance when the portfolio is on fire\nAnd they always you know or when the house is on fire if the insurance company comes over and they're like it's on fire or the flood insurance on the east coast absolutely during the time when we need it we have to buy it my point with this as we have to purchase the insurance before we need it\nYou have to buy a life insurance before you die you know to be proactive absolutely and that's something I Can't stress more and I love that you went down that kind of path on this\nIt is so important that we set this stuff up ahead of time and it's just like the insurance on my car I didn't buy insurance on my car because I plan on wrecking it\nIt's they're just in case one of the things that we can do that help a few people get started with this is where you can really we've got a few more sets the tickets here what if we do another give away a few more individuals out there really get rolling on

how\nDoes it have to classes where you're going to see exactly what it takes really protect that portfolio but not limit the upside and that's really what John was touching on in their how can we buy insurance on this but not put a cap on the upside of it as well so we can still grow if the market continues to move higher imagine how well you would sleep knowing that\nIncluded with your passes is

about that hit us up at three O T H class dot com and see if you can scores and passes there\nAt John you touched on a little bit about tax deferred right tax deferred these tax deferred accounts and all over the world we have different tax deferred kind of vehicles that people can use we've got the IRA there's RSP there's there's all sorts of different accounts you get into\nNow one of the things that we spend a lot of time on what the students is really building out inappropriate plan for them and everybody has\nTrading is really the cornerstone and foundation of the development of civilization we need traders we need producers of goods and services we need consumers of goods and services somewhere in the middle of that transaction is the trader so trading is more than just making money\nI I don't want to get to philosophical here but I think it's an important point to make an ... talking about Hollywood they would never take the time to build a movie around that me\nBut in fact trading is a very very important part of our life where would you be if you couldn't trade your skills with your employer right where where would you be if you didn't have the flexibility and\nAvailability of the capital markets to participate buying selling riding options\nWould your capital you choose to come to the market and\nProvide for your family this is a skill and boy you hit it right on the head when you talked about skilled development earlier\nThis is not about knowing what to do it's about knowing what to do and then executing your strategy in a sustainable way but trading is part and parcel to development of civilization where would we be Ryan and we had all had to go back to barter what do you think your life would be like\nYou know it's an interesting point that you bring up and I love how you take that back to work you know because we do we trade we're constantly trading we trade time for money and then we trade money for those goods and services right we trade money for that loaf of bread\nBut initially it all starts with us going out and doing something to generate that capital trading time trading now trading skills so that we can generate the money just to go train it to somebody else now\nOne of the things that one of my mentors told me a long time ago as he always said I always want you to use this phrase and I've used it thousands and thousands maybe millions of times hard earned investments dollar and that was a phrase he told me to use every time I'm Talking about my money and Everytime I pondering should I make this decision should I make this investment\nAnd he said at the end of your analysis you should always you should always end with\nThis trade is or is not worthy of my hard earned investments dollar and he would always take me back and and have me kind of paint a picture of the hardest day I had at work\nAnd he said that dollar are you willing to put that dollar into that trade and it just goes back to that trading time for money now trading money for those goods and services or those or those investment opportunities and how do we know\nIs this investment worthy of our harder and investment dollar cars and you know we go back in time we are we go back across the nation would go back across the globe and we ask you know I've asked thousands of people this millions of people really when we started when we do all of our online workshops\nAnd say how much time as the average person put in to being educated how much time we invested into ourselves so that we can have the confidence to say yes\nThis is worthy of my heart or an investment dollar and unfortunately the answer that echoes across ... echoes across workshops is near zero which is one of the reasons why we don't have the confidence of what we're doing it's one of the reasons why we don't generally have the returns\nThat we want as well but I Would love to tilt the scale right now I'd love to tilt the scale and get that zero number climbing as high as we possibly can\nBy getting as many people educated so at the end of the day they can look at their investments and say yes or no this is or is not worthy of my heart or an investment dog but one of the things we have to do to get that process started John we got to give away these tickets most do it\nRight now we've got to have to class coming up in your area that date classes where you'll see exactly what it takes to analyze investment opportunities so you can determine whether or not they are appropriate for you or not in the end it's all about

weight right those are the two most common with and there's a simple step by step process\nIn losing weight and it is burned more calories than you take in and one of the things I Love about this is there's a simple step by step process that we covered the half the class on how to generate more income and it's what we call her padded course strategy but I'd love to hear some of your thoughts around really generating that income and really creating\nThat financial freedom or even if you have a story or two I Know you've got one or two in there as far as individuals who really have started at that point a in a very very beginning and now have reached that kind of a packs of their financial freedom you could squeeze in one of these little segments there\nWell let me share your story a guy who came or one of our ... about ten years ago he was a fifty six year old pilot\nUm and I asked him I said why are you hear what what inspired you to come to our event today\nAnd they said well

ago now Brett Kavanaugh has been sworn in as the Supreme Court's one hundred fourteenth justice in a private ceremony inside the court building as demonstrations continue outside there are\nAnd one of the first questions that we always going to have to do anything really gonna happen to this officer a if he ever going to deal with any kind of a 'cause it's a bad shooting I mean I talked about it later details it's an unarmed shooting it's a bad one but now you know I'm so jaded now and I've been around for so long I say it's up to the department that I really as a civil litigation I don't have the power\nTo put a criminal prosecution place I don't have a power to get the FBI\nA department of justice involved I don't have the power even get them demoted the power to get them and I can do nothing so does anything really happened I mean saying officers involved in the shooting that pop up three point five million dollar verdict there's anything happened to this office\nDepends on the situation and I understand where you're coming from I think if I was on your site and see the same frustration looking at from my side not only do I deal from my side but remember we also have union attorneys involved there's a variety of ah of laws that are in favor of the officers what makes it a little more difficult when he talks about union turning she's talking about police unions who are very powerful\nLiterally as well as well they're they're a political force let's just say to keep going\nAnd there's a lot of truth to that so they have some laws that benefit the law enforcement officers writers obviously legislation of foot trying to change that right so putting that aside I have seen probably more discipline meted out the last few years than previously so I Will grant you way back when maybe something would happen now\nI think because there's so much public comment and so much transparency being spoken about by local politicians I think we're seeing more things happening officers\nThere either being retrained they're going to be disciplined maybe not for the shooting the south because maybe the circumstances that presented themselves for the author even though it may look like a bad shooting to the officer\nIt was just ... but maybe we need some more training maybe we need some training uh tactics they do we need to change the policies and procedures of the\nEight when you say discipline I mean I I almost never seen one of these guys get fired I can count on one hand so discipline doesn't really mean termination it could mean a suspension or at worst a suspension without pay or retraining but would you agree with me that when we talk about discipline we're not usually talking about loss of someone's job would you agree with me\nGenerally yes it is difficult to terminate also but disciplined\nIt can mean that officer can be removed from it covered position and moved to another position to very good point and that believe me that officer will suffer but\nThey maybe changed completely different assign a different shift whatever they may receive days off they may be prevented from becoming a a a higher positions so there are things going on behind saying that you may not see and you're thinking of that person has to be terminated there were other ways to deal with that officer and make sure they're properly trained before they go back out\nAnd I think that's what I think the protests is of law enforcement can we retrain this person of so we have a lot of money invested in that person let's see what we can do\nAnd I have to agree with you because you just never saw any form of discipline at all like in the nineties when I started didn't matter what the circumstances surrounding the shooting\nUnless it was a sex crime which they're Marshall is at officers and sex crimes but or something that involves like rampart wherever you know this is an overt criminal enterprise undertaken we never saw anything\nAnd now we are starting to see forms of discipline do you think that the emergence of civilian review boards uh specifically groups of individuals that are not law enforcement such as the border police commissioner or the sheriff's department just got the citizens of what is it the feel see\nDo you think that those are having any impact and the increasing what we've talked about in terms of the level of accountability\nI think there's another layer of accountability now primarily most of the members of these review boards are law enforcement yes and it's so hard to talk in the abstract to someone who has never been there at three AM in the morning\nI can see the frustration coming later you're faced out talking about the fact that law enforcement officers may actually have someone that is not a cop looking at them and talking about what they're doing what you want to non\nLawyer criticizing you do and you're trials are handling your cases it's about\nThe same thing for an off a criticism on all fronts on like the president in that regard but anyway let's go they're typically we're not we're not going to go there at any rate we're going to come back okay\nWe get back we're going to talk about some of the ways that these shootings play out on the street because you have a unique perspective\nAnd we're going to talk about how an incident that captures the public imagination such as an officer involved shooting actually affect that officer that officers department and the brass within that department we are fortunate to have\nTrial or extraordinary gene Ramirez with us defender of

actually affecting the social fabric of our nation today we're talking about officer\nInvolved litigation a officer involved shooting litigation have been blessed to have\nThe premier or at least in the very short list premier attorneys who defends law enforcement officers who are accused of a legend acts of excessive force and specifically we're going to talk about something that I Believe no one really knows about and that is what happens from the perspective of the officer\nAnd before we actually get there I I got to tell you one myth that I came into the profession with that has been dispelled and that messes that these are bad officers that get involved in these situations and that their militias people or they're they're violent spirits or that they're generally angry malicious\nIndividuals and I can tell you that having represented over two hundred victims of officer involved shootings on several levels I'd say Ninety percent of the cases that I've been involved in when I actually get to\nConfront the officer they've never had another shooting\nThey some of these guys have been on the force for Fifteen sixteen years\nAnd this is for sure and I also can dispel the myth that these are angry individuals are bad or mean spirited individuals because if you actually look in the real world real world what really happens the impression that I get is that they would rather be anywhere else them involved in a litigation of the sword\nBut you've got even at a more broad perspective chain because you're pretty much involved almost right after it happened so tell us what what do these men and sometimes when it but mostly been what are what are they going through\nDon't think the public appreciates just how much stress an officer deputy goes through in these situations\nI think back to my day I think it was like Nineteen Ninety my brand new rookie I'm working with a training officer three in the morning we arrive at a at a gas station at the time so over there but at the time it was and we see a one of those dumpsters askew and my partner says that looks a little weird 'cause I'm a check to back out once you go check out the front gene\nSo I go around and I remember a come around the corner of the of the building and there was one of those glass counter where you could go up to the person working inside the gas station and ask for cigarettes or pay for gas\nAnd I remember looking in and I thought I saw something that pulled back asking myself that I really see what I thought I saw my partner is still in the back just me at this point I'd go back like closely look around the corner sure enough\nAt that point there is a guy coming out the front door and he has his hands filled with thinks it's the old days I had a six inch three fifty seven Smith Wesson model Nineteen revolver\nI've got one of those Clint Eastwood movie said as soon as I said earlier that\nBy the way so I pulled my cannon out and I started screaming don't move don't move or I'll shoot you and I remember thinking I don't know who's more scared me or the guy I'm facing 'cause he broke out in a sweat Campbell looking at his hands and I remember my training looked his hands is he going for weapon he gets so much he had cartons\nAnd he dropped them and I said do not go for that waistband and then the next thing I Know my partner comes around my back says don't move in the background I could hear the sirens of the of the calvary arriving I felt a little better eventually took him into custody I\nRemember thinking a couple of days later how scared I was and I did not want to shoot that gentleman fortunately I didn't have to\nNow let's bring it up to nowadays when I talk with my officers after a shooting the psychological distress they go through I don't think can be discounted I don't think I have yet to find an officer that I have defended I've been doing this as you said for Thirty years have handled hundreds of these cases never has one ever said God I woke up this morning I went to shoot someone right\nI Hope I never hear that but no one has ever said that in one in particular a relatively recently they're told after the shooting you can talk about this to anybody but your lawyer or the investigators you could talk to your spouse but that's about it\nSo when I come in and I finally meet with them for the first time it may have been six months seven months maybe a year and they haven't talked about this and when I met this one person recently he broke down crying really I was moved and he goes gene I was thinking this guy's going for a weapon turns out he was armed um because I'm just thinking I'm not going to go home and see my wife and daughter at night and he goes I Can't let that happen\nAnd I fired five times he goes I now want to go back and talk\nTo other officers in her other stations let him know what I went through this is not something you ever want to get involved in because now I'm getting investigated by the da's office and he goes I feel confident what I did not know still gonna get investigated by these officers so there's that anxiety nowadays am I going to be prosecuted plus I Know\nA little hole you on hold on hold on hold on I'm\nNobody ever gets prosecuted now now you know that gene it's rare it is rare but it\nWas it was it happened when I can think of doing this I can think of like twice important to down to to have not have an officer involved shooting and it's happening more recent than it has in years past I'll grant you that I I Can't think I still can't think of it actually happening but again you don't want to cut you off because we're on a roll their\nI mean things aren't going to happen but criminal prosecutions not caught but that also doesn't know that he just knows where they said great point great point I got you know we may know it may not happen it will not\n[laughter] pending upon the shooting if it's justifiable it may not have a right but he does not er she does not know that and they're scared so\nThis is an interesting point so again I'm looking at it from the family I I don't really talk to the office I talked to the family now you said that the officer would want to talk to other officers have you ever encountered or do you think it's even possible see you flip it and it's not a person that had a weapon or it's just someone that it's a mistake and there's this is this is my life\nIf the person is an arm of the officers saying that they thought the person\nWas going for a weapon and that that is might exist\nHave you ever heard an officer say that he wants to reach out to the family members of the person that lost their life have you ever heard I mean\nThey may say I want to reach out to other officers so that they don't have you ever encountered an officer say listen I just orphaned three children I just widowed a woman have you ever heard them say maybe I Want to talk to these people or do you think that that's something that's just in comprehensive\nYou and I had a case together Brian a few years ago we have what did you ever years right you weren't opposing my deputy sheriff\nAnd after the deposition 'cause you learn some things that you did not know before you ask them\nWould you be willing to meet with the family which I thought okay now it's it's coming back to me is coming back I'll tell you the name later but you will remember is that my office and he said just meet with the family and talk to them ever men tell them in this conversation I'll never uses against you it's not going to be recorded and my deputy said yes\nI Will write and I remember she started crying along with the rest of us yet I talked I remember it was kind of right back to me yes and yet it said that the\nIt's ugly and it's deadly it can be and the words are being said that may not be used in a\nIn church during Sunday services and some people are offended by that and so that's my only concern is can members of the public when they sit in judgment of what it's occurring understand and appreciate what that officer is going through during the tendency to get us on the ice just feel like their hands or being packed some of them welcome that\nThey really want to be accused of doing something\nWrong as I can tell you about two cases right offhand where the shooting happened after a protracted stand off or they were at the house for Fifteen twenty minutes and then the shooting happened at\nAfter the shooting the body camera came on and I'm like well why wasn't this thing on before so we could have seen the shooting and I was so I'm kinda wondering is this scene is something that's kind of a handicap because you hear we had a shooting and they turned on the camera afterwards to interview the the person who's writing and pain after being shot\nAnd you know I was wondering should it be mandatory or or their departments have you had experience where it has to be on all the time I think LAPD requires it to be on\nWell it has to be on whenever you have contacts cause them to be taken to its natural extent when you use the restroom this thing's going to be run your concern right of course of course absolutely when you're sitting in your car and just talking to your partner about your marital problems or your dating life doesn't need to hear the ...\nWe have to have some limits on it now are we talking about a twenty five year veterans subtleties being told you got to wear body weren't camera you know there may be some resistance now I teach at one of the local police academies so these youngsters coming through all ready believing we're going to be wearing Audi records were going to body cameras are all into social media\nThey get it and I think they welcome it because they don't want to have to be accused of doing something when they know they did everything right so I take a look at where they are in their career a great point and sold them particular like that some are going to be much more accepting\nNow the other problem with body weren't cameras at the public may not recognize is the storage costs are exorbitant leap expensive most departments can't afford the storage and when you say the storage ... what what do you mean in terms of video\nWhat do you do with that video because you've got to download it you have to put it on a server or you've got to put it in the cloud are you going to maintain your own servers off expensive and LAPD has vast resources they have hundreds of people devoted to deal with the body cameras a small agency is not going to be able to do that\nAnd that is one reason why some agencies are not going to by the way it's just cost prohibitive\nThe only thing that a lot of people do now is that the that doesn't always give you you know it's not Steven Spielberg taking the picture oh a lot of ... and you've got people running and it's shaky and you're you're moving in the if the buddies twist one way you're going to be completely out of focus and\nThe the things moving around all the time and you have people tumbling them it's just like what did he have a camera on it was like yeah he had it on yeah but you're just looking at what his chest is doing so there's some limitations there but\nAbsolutely are looking right my cameras look you left as you just know that you're not going to pick up on that or someone else's body camera may pick up more of it of mine did it for whatever reason but yet I saw the ... what's your verdict if you were if you were the chief of police for the whole world\nOkay and money was not an object would you recommend them and not for every department I Would use audio recorders would pick up everything\nThat has said which is what's crucial I'm worried about the ... being able to accept what they're going to see on that video\nAlright the second thing that I really wanted to get into this because what we're starting to see is that I'm going to try to off the cuff I'd say
