kindly stay with us this last\nPart of the show we got a few more minutes left and before the break you were trying to respond to the issue about the factories in Albuquerque the point is that there was a collective sort of a story we're hearing and I'm sure you've heard of not just of Albuquerque but all of a choice\nYeah I mean I mean listen I get I get the point I Know we're in a gotcha world and I know we're trying to a fact check each other and call each other out for ... and I got all that from the last call in but\nAgain I'm just going off of what I learned while I was walking around in the civic center and so whether there was manufacturing or factories or however you wanted to find that the point being is that there was a level of economic desperation in that civic center\nAnd for me it was like an epiphany because it was like wait a minute these are the people I grew up with these are the people um that are hurting now and this is absolutely factual I price my dad's\nTwenty Fifteen wages so I looked at as Nineteen Seventy five wages I said OK person doing the same exact job as my father in twenty Fifteen what are they making on Long Island down thirty two and a half percent in real economic order resumes approaches the answer here\nSo the bad news is that there's no short term answer I mean the answer is eight twenty five year policy initiative and one of the biggest problems that we have in our society right now is in our\nPublic servants were not willing to talk like that you know the Chinese have a twenty five and a fifth year plan their way long term they are they may go hundreds you clear but I submit to everybody that's listening and nice Mitt to you two guys tell me the politician that you've met that says okay I've got a twenty five year plan for America\nThis is how I'm going to fix the manufacturing crisis in America the wage crisis the infrastructure issues the deficit spending we have to right size these entitlements and we have to re format our military\nNone of this is going to happen in a two minute radio segment or a two year old ... cycle in the Congress this is a twenty five year\nOr a generational issue until we start talking about it that way and we dial down the polemic from both sides and say okay forget the left in the rye what is the right thing to do for America right now Hank anybody to agree or why why why can't we do it\nI mean so so so skinny I feel like they're ... even a good idea ... whatever side you're on your go against it yes cutting back on the president did say that\nOnce I mean I was again

about the relationship that I had with him I mean I'm not going\nTo hear the one that you hold them what the hell are you gonna run for president for it you have our ally value them gorgeous ... part of our ... was it how are you guys have the same\nFinger he was the day after The Apprentice finale I was in his office having breakfast with them and I look them in are you nuts I mean you've got a

here in this triplex in Trump Tower you're going to be moving in six thousand square feet in the White House residence ... sure that I mean you know if I was a public yeah a lot like have them but my point is he was like very dead set on it and he was very committed to it and he said something to me which I Do share in the book\nBecause I ... were you watching The Apprentice last and I said no she was the only one not watching the you know you watch I I was watching Fox News where you are two percent in the polls\nAnd he said yeah I'm at two percent of the polls because those people would just like you Anthony once they realize I'm Serious and I'm running for president I'm going to shoot right up to the top of the polls and I'm a stay at the top of the polls I've had some that's what he did a lot of soul mumps after the nomination by the Access Hollywood tape but he was right\nThere it wasn't the first time he's run for president that's why in nature and no one really took them seriously\nYeah it was a threatened to run an eighty eighty threatened to run in two thousand you got to go back\nI remember that first president a residential president Republican presidential debate there was just all about him and there was forever since it was that we're and say like you have a great honor to be here privileges are as a budding gives you a blue collar president go get it now and Lawrence von ... has been alive [noise]\nWith a thousand dollars you could buy groceries for weeks\nBut isn't it more fun to see how much you can spend on one dinner jak place\nFrom second

pictures of MA doesn't seem like he had\nYeah you don't need ... ride he didn't seem like he's some sort of mastermind and the second thing he said was that they know a lot\nMore information than they were releasing to the public and clearly they were on to this guy longer or long before this morning when the arrest was made when we became aware of this guy's identity but would more bombs started showing up in the new or in the ah to the post office\nThat's when they probably thought All right we've got to nip this in the bud right now and not spend their time collecting evidence and not spend their time doing that thing they had to put a stop to it right then\nWell right 'cause I mean but there is fourteen that we know ... none of them detonated right but there could be in the bay are out there\nYeah so the arrest was made this morning and I don't know if he'd been he's been arraigned in court yet do you know that answer\nI Do not yeah it's just not even taken and\nSo the president this morning was tweeting I guess at three o'clock in the morning\nThat the Republicans had great momentum going into the mid term elections and that the bomb and then that was thrown in quotes because we re ordered yesterday that some of the bombs were incapable of detonating although the FBI saying that certainly some of them are today\nHe just wasn't bad bomb maker\n[laughter] yes she was a ... and apparently not a very good speller because misspelled Debbie Wasserman Schultz frame on on some of the packages that he he mailed and a President Trump has has wrapped up his criticism of the news media and the news media this morning was was in part blaming him for all of this\nWell he's certainly uses a lot of rhetoric inflammatory granted\nThat's not to say that you have not thought that I mean look at the guy that shot at that the congressional baseball and basically ... I mean there's just a lot of jobs out there but I I definitely think sometimes his rhetoric and doesn't how bad I don't I don't see how I I mean it's on both sides as the craziness\nAnd do things the nuts can get motivated into doing something like this because of the rhetoric and I say that because if you look at American history\nThere have been a lot of American presidents would have been pretty easygoing guys I'd put Gerry Ford in that category and they tried to assassinate Gerry Ford right here in Sacramento\nAnd Jerry Ford's critic main critic at the time was Jimmy Carter another guy who was a pretty mild mild mannered dude and I don't think you could blame that assassination attempt on Jimmy Carter or typical deal or this\nGuy obviously you know he has a record he has a prior for making these kind of threat so it seemed like it Ben part and has\nYou know it's been on his mind parent lame but now I think yeah you get people like that you can kind of latch onto and you do crazy stuff\nWell in two thousand and two let's try to go back into the time machine when he first started making threats with bombs\nThat was after nine eleven after nine eleven that's one of the few times in our lifetimes I can think of where everyone pretty much came together yes where you had critics of President George W.

Bush and they were singing the national anthem at America the beautiful and all of those things and his approval ratings were sky high because everyone rallied around the flag they rallied around the president they rallied around the country\nSo it was not a time when people were running around getting ... up to do and say crazy things which is exactly when this guy decided that he would make his first bomb threat\nRight now I mean that definitely shows and he's got a screw loose for sure that we are\nOften feel like we're in such a polarized climate right now where anybody you know you make any sort of disagreement with anyone at escalates so quickly and I think\nYou know certainly the rhetoric coming out in the White House doesn't really set a good example sometimes I think you can just turn on any cable news network it's on both sides it's just crazy everywhere\nAnd if you look at just take away the the violence and and the allusions to violence because Eric Holder said we've got to kick the Republicans recently a Hillary Clinton was talking about being in civil uncivil to Republicans\nBut if you just talk about how we we speak to one another when we're not talking about violence when you call someone a Nazi when you call someone a killer when you call someone or something like that\nIt's very ... yeah it's very inflammatory and I I mean you've been I mean you can go out here you know we see people getting yelled down at restaurants getting chased out just for having a different political beliefs there's really ... it just feels like everything is heightened and people are very combative\nBut I almost feel the same way towards these guys that I Do about people who commit suicide\nIf you commit suicide than that's already in you and that the ability to do something that horrendous to yourself as something and I don't know if it's biological I don't know if it's chemical\nBut it's something that has to be a new and there can be factors you could lose your job your spouse could leave you in January ... yeah that someone could say something nasty about you on social media\nBut a a an psychologically healthy person would not kill themselves over something like that\nSo it with or without whatever it was that would be the internal motivating factor that individual wouldn't kill themselves and if something bad happens to them by some other person I don't think you can necessarily blame that other person if a person\nTo signing a lot of factors that go into that and this guy obviously had a propensity for making these kind of threat for violence he's got a long record and he somehow found a you know being a Trump supporter as an outlet for some of this and I think he just escalated it way too far and\nYou did and they should spend the rest of his life as I said before in prison for doing this because these are terrorist threats he's really absolutely and terrorists belong in prison let's go to Steve Moore retired special agent for the FBI who can pass himself on the back\nBecause pretty much everything that he predicted went on this program earlier this week came to be true Steve thanks so much for joining us\nThank you for having me and sorry about the background noise on ... lounge out in Florida\nYeah no problem so what is your immediate reaction to news of this arrest\nWell you know it was\nIt was going to be one of two things that was going to be somebody who was extremely brilliant and doing something a ... you know just doing them this direction that through everybody off or it was going to be somebody so dumb you were going to catch them within a twenty four Seventy two hours and I was kind of banking on the second one and\nUh I think it came true I mean he's exactly the uh\nAs as everybody patterns his is\nHaving to be a a a not a who just happens to claim right wing it says particular brand of insanity or not that sit right isn't saying I'm just saying he has to have an excuse to do what he wants to do it and a ... that's just you know the he was very he was almost predictable in that way\n[noise] was it the DNA that he left on the bombs what caused them to catch catch them was that the big piece of evidence\nThere was a ... I think it was a fingerprint the fingerprints are much easier to grab a and you know he's had some trouble with the law and um it it's going to be very hard to work with Cape I'm In it he says if any type or without leaving a fingerprint so I mean\nUh they're just fingerprint magnets and so I I think that's what got him\nYesterday we were told to the point of origin nation for these packages was ... Florida when they made that public announcement when the FBI pulled the news media that's where these packages were\n... they had on me on to him by then\nDo you believe they knew who it was back then\nYes yes I I Believe that uh\nThey were probably doing surveillance on and by that time and uh once they've got 'em under surveillance the reason they let out over locker was likely to see what his reaction would be I mean when you're following somebody like that and you want to see what they're going to do if all of a sudden they think\nYou're on to them you want to see if they go to another place where you might be storing a the the precursors for this you want to see if he goes to a storage locker he goes home or if he starts making calls to other people\nBecause then you have the numbers and names of other people who might be part of it a plot I I think that was probably a a strategic\nWhy do you think they arrested him this morning was because they found more packages in the mail and they've thought okay if we don't do it right now this guy's going to continue to send these packages and maybe the next bomb my\nWork I I think\nIt was very little chance of him never once they were on to sending other package I think they got what they want it I think the only reason you wait at that point once you're on to him is to determine if if there are a accomplices and once they found out that there weren't\nI think they they just said let's let's shut this down real quick\nHow soon do you think they found out it was um [noise]\nI Would guess within a within five to ten hours of the package is getting to the lab\nWow you have to be that fast\nYeah because you know get a hold on their calling [laughter] you know ... you do it ... and you find a um although you\nAnd a second package bomb was intercepted this morning in northern California it was addressed to senator Kamala Harris and discovered in Sacramento going on below carrying the ad explosive device address to Los Angeles congresswoman Maxine Waters help lead to the suspects arrest FBI\nDirector Christopher Wray says they recovered a fingerprint from the package intended for the Democratic lawmakers that's what helped lead to the arrest of Florida resident and suspected bomb makers Caesar saying\nThere is also possible DNA connection between shambles for like two pieces of different varieties mental suffering envelope fake\nFaces five charges including illegal mailing of explosives and making threats to political figures he could face up to fifty eight years in prison if convicted and James Rojas KABC news and\nTo LAPD officers were taken to the hospital for an examination today following a chemical spill at the Los Angeles police department central station in downtown LA happened around nine o'clock this morning though it's not immediately known what spilled but part of the first floor was evacuated as a precaution\nThan a hazardous materials team was sent into investigate now the one officer was treated for respiratory irritation and the second officer who's a member of LAPD Z hazmat team was treated for possible dehydration both men and fair condition talk radio seven\nNinety KABC for the world series shifts the Chavez Ravine for game three tonight when the Dodgers host Boston starting at five or Ninety I'm\nA Walker Mueller is going to start for the boys in blue game for also tomorrow afternoon at five o nine hopefully Sunday\nGame five will be at five o nine that Chavez Ravine now the clippers will play in Houston at five o'clock this afternoon the Lakers visit San Antonio tomorrow and that sports on seven Ninety K.

of theaters is just the hunter killer an innocent movie but Gerard Butler and as a submarine trailer that would've been really great it's a year was Nineteen eighty four\nInstead it's two thousand

pornographic image or a girl in a bathing suit or whatever and so he stands up from his cubicle and he turns to the guy who's sitting to cubicles down from him and he goes hey Bob why don't you come over here and look at the who ... on this one\nSo Bob gift shop walks over and stands behind them and they're making all kinds of like animal noises and sounds and they're just drooling over these

abusive\nA forty three year old appeared in court on Tuesday on charges of allegedly insulting to female flight attendants on a flight from London to Washington\nThe woman who lives in North London allegedly became so intoxicated that she began swearing at our flight that are in flight seat back screen and they're the reports of land that an hour in the flight the woman began making his scene and was scored it to the back of the plane where she attack to flight attendants\nThe flights return cost more than five thousand dollars in fuel according to a new show but wants to plan to return to London the plane crew had exceeded they're legally permitted work hours and all passengers were forced to the plane and wait until the next day to catch a flight to the United states the woman's is not entered a plea\nYeah and when you're at does then find entertainment things don't work I guess people can get angry\nOh yeah yeah to scream obscenities at those things to get them to work you know who I blame for this I blame the gate agents because\nThere's no way in our industry why you're around it on the plane if you're\nNot trying I what what do you look for when you're boarding these people well I think it will be on the ...\nThey're suppose if you're sitting in an emergency exit out for example\nAnd you have a broken leg\nThe gate agent is the one that's supposed to move you it's not the flight attendant they're supposed to make sure that only people who are able bodied and understand English sit in those seats\nBut sometimes they slip through the cracks if you're drunk they're not even supposed to let you on the plane because if you have an incident up there they may have to land they may have to come back to the gate and it's a pain and they asked for the airline it's a period of the ads\nAnd all that he will not have their fight ran oh yeah you ever see any drunks on planes I've seen a ... it has not been printing and how belligerent were there do they just fall asleep\nAnd some of them are ... ... that's ... before the plane had left the gate so on and got scoring it off but yeah it's just as a passenger you're just sitting there like what's going on like you know it's it's pretty much like the planes like the one place where you can't really lose your mind and\nI was flying to New York one time and it was anything ... or anything but I was sitting in in first class I was going back to do a red eye the late night show on Fox News that no longer exists\nAnd seated across the aisle for me was a woman who was a flight attendant for the airline and I guess\nWhen you're a flight attendant or a pilot or some kind of airline personnel you can fly for free\nIf if the the plane has open seats and so they happen to have open seats in first class so they put this flight attendant in first class and she was traveling with her husband and she was very well put together looked like she was probably a mom may be a grandma\nAnd she was drinking white wine when we sat down because they give you a pre departure beverage and then they come by and they do another round of drinks and then they have the meal and you get more drinks and then after meal the mail you get an after dinner drink\nAnd if you want to continue to drink you can go ahead and continue to be served and I guess they work with this woman so it was just more wind more wind more one more one I thought to myself\nShe's not that big and she's having a lot to drink but she seem perfectly fine so you know all's well that ends well All right\nWe landed in New York City and it's time to be playing the woman stands up and then goes down like a bowling pin oh now yes falls flat on her face and was so embarrassed her husband had to like carrier off the plane\nAnd uh she could tell what was going on she wasn't bad drunk where she was blackout drunk but she went down\nOh boy I mean at least then I mean that's one of them but it's fighting flight attendant\nAnd apparently the entertainment computers\nMaine will help you pay off your student loans if you move there the pine tree state uh leads the charts with the oldest population of the nation the median age in Maine is forty four or five years older than the median age across the rest of us so state lawmakers decided they needed a way to start bringing in young minds to the workforce\nSo when you moved to Maine the money you spend towards paying your student loan debt each year is subcontracted from your state income taxes for instance if you pay Eighteen hundred dollars towards your loan and oh the state two thousand dollars in taxes you'll only end up paying main two hundred dollars\nStem majors are those who study science technology engineering and math couldn't even get a check back from the government if their loan pay off amount outweighs their taxes\nNonstop majors fall under a non refundable tax credit program which means they owe zero dollars in state taxes under the same scenario those people are the ones that should move because guess what\nYour unemployable without our history degree you don't have to worry because there are no jobs in Maine anyway\n[laughter] [noise] now it sounds like an interesting program that's one of these states where it's got to be just to [noise]\nTo tourists who would actually go and live and work in Maine yeah and we're going to have your ... your your your vacation house uh that's where you go to ski or you go to eat lobster\nAs an ally to get lobster it's a resort area though\nYeah you know it's not too far from Boston you know like you're saying if you're in that in that field that it might be worth it if you move out there for a little bit until your loans or pay off\nA lot of areas to the resort areas are like this the
