A. B. C. one eight hundred to two to five to two to\nThis very expensive painting it went from one point four million dollars was destroyed it was destroyed on purpose or at least part of it was by Banksy after the auction at southern cities what's the most expensive thing that you've destroyed my guess is\nBy accident [laughter] but uh car act [laughter] I mean my parents cottage went up on a fire a couple of months ago a definitely an accident\nUm at least that's what you're told the insurance I think Jim told them yup yup [laughter] but uh I think he's going to end up making more money with this now I er he whoever bought it\nIs it they just it just doubled devalue because Banksy put out on his Instagram the shredding happening and everyone's faces like what what the heck is going on a and the aftermath\nSo he's all part of it and he's all about art installations and stuff so this is just made the value go up there's no doubt about it have you ever accidentally\nAnd destroyed a painting or a car or expensive clothes or jewelry\nRight is look at that's his Instagram he wrote going going gone and look at the lady's face [laughter] oh yeah she can't believe what she's saying she's got her hand over ... miles like watch\nI Love they ever identify who bought it\nNo I I don't think so I don't ... areas to find out what they thought about it I Know me too but if you're a Banksy collector you're going to love this that's why I'm saying I Love Banksy this is genius I Love it I Would hang it up because that's what he intended it to look like I think it's great and I think it's going to double in value\nDo remember there was a story out of Europe I think it was Italy yeah where there was a church that had a very expensive painting but with the idea of Jesus\nAnd there is a wash woman who was in there who is clearly with church at night and thought that there was a smudge on the painting so she decided that she was going to fix it with her ... her age ... or whatever and ruined the painting\nSo here's what happened this is hysterical she panicked because she was trying to fix it and it made it worse for she painted over oh no and she sells interview I thought it I made him look better and\nIf you were I cry I laughed so hard I cried for days 'cause it looked like a a kid over a master and just was like with Crayola ... it was so sad I'm going to say the picture do you remember the picture I Do what did they end up doing with her\nBecause she was old I they didn't charge or her or anything\nBut she's awesome [laughter] dollars in damage oh ... oh yeah ... um oh John is there a picture of her oh my God look what she did to him [laughter]\nOh my God [laughter]\n[laughter]\nIt just rained Jesus painting ruined it's the funniest said he got\nRid of his beard is about [noise]\nShe looks like it has an ear right below shares knows [laughter] [laughter]\nI Can't make those up it is [laughter]\nHow was\n... years later she was an elderly woman ruins nineteenth century fresco\nIn Italy does it say how much it was worth a\nIt's quite another attempt to repair repair job and I wonder what kind of Nineteen century fresco by the Spanish painter alias Garcia Martinez with a few broad brush strokes this was a lesson a learned by an elderly member of the church in northeastern Spain her handiwork or lack there of\nWas discovered after the painters granddaughter donated the work\nTo the archives the photo was taken of the artwork before and then after when she [laughter]\n\nIt doesn't say what they did there were there is no figure given on the value of [laughter] send to hold more sentimental and art then artistic value because of the Martinez family known to the local community I mean it was a beautiful painting before it's interesting afterwards looks like an Andy Warhol bell [laughter]\nShe also yes she got rid of his beard gave him more of an afro and then his\nMouth [laughter]\nOh yeah he's got across and now he's got what are these got Bill Cosby I returned Jesus and the causes she's been\nMore she was inspired maybe maybe she was inspired so yeah that you didn't go up not a surprise but um it actually might because whoever wrote about painting before this there you go\nThere you go [laughter] I'm Sorry I Can't I Can't stop looking at it yeah I don't think she was not arrested or anything I think they thought they felt bad for her she was this little old lady trying to help\n[noise] they had to fire her minimum [laughter] you can't leave her in there anymore [laughter] who knows what else will do it oh God right she'll be rearrange and everything that search\nYou know what this is it this is what insurance is for that's what I think you have women but go to the original question about have you ever you know ruin something that is that your book and it I think you know you can't get too attached to unless it's a family like I have certain\nMy father my birth father was an artist and he was really fantastic so I have some of his paintings and drawings and those are I mean there are invaluable to me um but if it's a piece of jewelry or a car that Iraq or you know you're ... like at the end of the day you just have to have your yourself if you had some\nHouse if you had a painting or a piece of art that was very expensive you inherited it from a relative them one gave it to you what have you and you knew was highly desirable you write something that that\nPeople outside of you and your friends' circle would want to see mhm would you keep it for yourself or would you donated to a museum\n[noise] um I it depends on my house I mean there's so many wealthy people that can donate and not miss stuff they can you know if you go downtown here in Los Angeles to the road he lived road owns a magnificent art collection and he\nRotates it um he has his own museum and then there are some that go on loan it depends if you're a philanthropist and your super loaded yeah I loaned it out

get on as your partying celebrating your sister's thirtieth birthday to go this is a rink at age ... vehicle you guys like\nAnd then to ... vocally expressed that in a tax about how bad this vehicle must have looked because usually when you're all in a party spirit the last thing you're looking at is the vehicle going okay well what ... you mean like how bad must in a lot\nWell and if you get a driver in a private car you're doing the responsible thing running around drinking how's your celebrating right you're not supposed to be behind the wheel someone right job or is supposed to be behind the wheel and they're supposed to make sure that the cars will maintain them an everyone on board is safe and this company\nClearly failed to do that and no doubt\nJoining us to weigh in on all of this is ABC News legal analyst royal oaks royal thanks so much for joining us say while\nA good afternoon and then of course you guys have covered the human element so world there but when you turn to the illegal in the mechanical ankles you started to get into the John I mean it's it's so bad this limo had been ... apart and links and which violated federal law and\nThere was no federal certificate as Governor Cuomo noted the driver was not properly licensed of the company that twenty two violations in the last two years and when they failed the state inspection last month\nA break a malfunction was one of the problems that were those violations of the owner companies said oh well there were minor things or windshield wipers we stretched it and so on now people are wondering about this owner allegedly the owner\nShot head Hussein used to be an FBI you form it why was he in an informant well when he was working for the DMV back in New York she was arrested on fraud for helping immigrants\nOr cheat on their driver's test rubble he ended up testifying to terrorism cases he cooperated with the feds to avoid deportation to Pakistan so this is the whole thing is really really low\nAs he wanted for murder in Pakistan which is why he left Pakistan and\nThe first came on our government or heart rate and handle harboring him saying look ... you would deal you don't have to go back if you give us a sense which is just hogwash but [noise]\nUm oh that's interesting now when you talk about uh you know this car that had been ... by Senator John yesterday as I saw it and I said I've never seen an after market car this has got to be a chop chop the ... got to be\nYou know something that was custom made where they take one end of a lemon they'll add in the middle part of another body of another car and they'll put it to the beginning and they welded altogether and then they buffet out in the sand it down and the orange you know they thought the orange bill and they make a sense of offensively\nOn new vehicle and I've seen these things and and and they're not at ... they don't\nIt's not like they go through the government to get approved and they're you know in a Ford or I don't think it'd be a hybrid of anything and so the fact that this guy was operating at\nAnd allowed to do so how about this family in the ... the mother and father of these four dollars let's just look at them not even looking at the remaining or others that\nPerished in this horrible tragedy if they want and what could they legally do loyal to hold this owner responsible\nWell there are any number of legal options of course based on what happened but we don't know for sure but\nWe we take that seat belts were provided we don't know who was using them if any we we have the speed estimated by witnesses sixty miles an hour down hill ran a stop sign she had it on a occupied vehicle there were no skid marks apparently so it sounds like it could well have been\nA flaw in the vehicle maybe there was operator error so when you go to to recover for wrongful death and and money that the kids in the in the family\nMembers of course there are any number of defendants the driver a who apparently died you to the extent he has made legal responsibility made it because the state would be responsible the limo company of course the one to talk about windshield wipers the state department of transportation and New York uh apparently\nCited some violations but there's an argument apparently that they cleared the vehicle in some sense maybe they said well yeah you got a month to fix it and so on so they could go after them bottom line is there are lots of potential deep pockets and you can bet that they're going to be plenty of lawyers are very experienced field that are going to\nTake a look at every conceivable defended and look looking for the insurance coverage looking for the deep pockets goes I mean what a tragedy for twenty people to be killed all at once and the human toll at all of the financial problems left behind is just mind boggling\nWell and I hope they sued them and I hope they win because you now have a bunch of orphans who don't have parents around to take care of them\nAnd they have no means to support themselves outside of the grandparents and this is I'm sure of the last thing that they were planning on\nAnd when you got a young family and young kids they probably have no savings so this is going to be catastrophic for all of those people but what about the the criminal liability here well because I Would say if you're that reckless with your company\nAnd you're doing all of these things that are illegal and all these things that aren't up to code\nYou know that by cutting those corners you're putting lives at risk and that's exactly what happened people die because of their negligence will they go to prison\nManslaughter is of course a a distinct possibility it's rare that the government goes after companies and owners uh after you you have accidents 'cause it's hard\nTo to win in court you can't build for murder because that requires intent to kill and nobody's going to prove that you can't go for murder in the second degree because even though that doesn't require is kept to kill it ... it requires a situation where you knew for sure that the high\nRisk of death was so Peyton to you but you just didn't care that would be almost impossible to prove\nSo you're left with manslaughter and that really boils down to depending on the situation recklessness gross negligence and how much evidence was there that the owner of the people involved with the company new darn well that this thing was rolling death trap and yet for profit reasons or whatever right\nGo ahead you know one more ... you know we'll get in the shop next week yeah there's evidence like that yeah somebody could go\nPrison that of course up to the government's we're sending a message to a taxi companies over et cetera that are you better be careful about safety because you're the survivors you're going to be the ones go to jail if something tragic happens\nHow long would they go to jail in that instance because Eighteen people were killed so if they are they're negligence led to these deaths and the jury and a judge says All right this is manslaughter or involuntary manslaughter or however you want to call it would then be Eighteen counts\nOh yeah you you can multiply it out a deal in general is in California the number of years behind bars for manslaughter is not that big a deal you remember Conrad Murray\nIs doing that and he was only a behind bars for about two years but bottom line is that yeah a bit whether it's three six nine years for manslaughter kind of course it matters whether it's voluntary or involuntary uh yeah you multiply it by the the number of victims and you could be looking at many decades behind bars\nWell maybe that's what it's going to take you know this guy would be in jail and you know what the problem they had killed that person in Pakistan which is why he fled the country and if he was committing acts of fraud at the DMV and he wasn't wasn't bringing his cars up on already convicted of kill the guy in Pakistan we've got to\nWait for Bob Woodward's next book on that\nWell why would you leave the country and why would you is that everybody wants to leave Pakistan ... not saying come on at but then if you're coming over here and then you're\nYou're going to be a career criminal then you're not you're not acting like a like a\nWell we'd all ... to ... to me that he possibly did kill I mean I come on when we know that he committed fraud at the DMV right yeah\nYeah he was arrested for fraud and then he became an FBI informant they said okay we got your pal so what do you do for us and so now he's a stormy or the FBI cooperating with if you didn't go back to Pakistan and that is you say John ... no idea what was going to Pakistan flock to\nThey say forensic
