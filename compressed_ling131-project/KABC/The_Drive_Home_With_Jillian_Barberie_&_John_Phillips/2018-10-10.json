very excited about this because [noise] my favorite movie franchise James Bond\nA ... the producer who is ... ... died she's taken over her father her father's rains and she has guaranteed everyone that drum roll please\nJames Bond [noise] we'll go to a gym you can be played by a man baby he was quote\nWritten as a male and he will say a male he's a male character what if he has a sex change that I mentioned bond as males not going to happen\nThat's how Barbara put it when she was interviewed for the guardian that he has quote a male character listen he was written as a male I think he'll probably sell male not stand male and that's fine we don't have\nTo turn male characters into women let's just create more female characters that make a story to fit those female characters AA men Barbara Broccoli\nWait so does this mean we're not going to have a male Wonder Woman\nWell let's not get crazy I mean we could just I don't know I just think you know in funding wrote him as a man it's a man and and this is where the women need to back off and if you're a feminist then why when you jump onto a male character that's probably the laziest thing you can do create your own amazing females fi you can be calling yourself\nA true feminist but for you you didn't want James Bond a character that's already been established for over fifty years to make it a woman that's lazy writing and that's not feminine if you have a male wonder\nWoman he'd bring his own rope [noise]\nWell there's one more hour coming up\nWars have six nine three here the national key word and ... and I'm five eight one\nNo your stories are exactly why I don't ask Alexa anything I'd just rather ask Julian\nWell thank you for that and you know John as probably the right answer just unplug when not using but I Can't stand unplugging plugging in all the time so I'm like well if she wants to listen in desperately I have a question about these uh victims and the case where we're starting to learn a lot about the thirty four\nPlease do we have agents I Do these alter boys are there any girls involved with these pretty much school middle school aged kids that were abused\nAnd that's what it appears to to be like yeah so right now we are we are learning that not only were these priests are also working in churches as well as Catholic schools and San Bernardino county or we also had a majority of them also working in riverside county so this band you know several jurisdictions and and the releasing\nOf this list of in response to this so to what we saw in Pennsylvania after a grand jury over there they need more than three hundred priests accused of sexual abuse\nInvolving over a thousand children across the state if states\nThousand can't imagine if it were across every state that that's really frightening or on ... and I said\nWell yeah and this uh this new transparency is something that that we're really seeing recently all over the country again beginning with that grand jury in Pennsylvania not only here in Southern California\nBut we have other states like Kentucky archdiocese older they're uh they're releasing names of of priests who have faced years of allegations some going back forty years\nAnd so yeah this is a a a an interesting time for victims because as as John mentioned before and when it comes to the San Bernardino cases many of these individuals have passed away and so unless and any actions were taken by the victims ah you know when when those crimes occurred\nThe chance of any form of justice is you know practically as down to zero\nShouldn't they really get credit for being transparent if they're telling us about a bunch of dead trees that posted the ones that are still alive harassed\nAnd and should they get credit for that in the sense that there were decades and decades of shuffling these files to different archdiocese so now that they're doing the right thing are we supposed to give them credit I mean this is the thing you're supposed to do\nI mean yeah it's about Thirty years too late ... yeah exactly\nYeah we had a a bishop Gerald bar and he actually released a video statement apologizing to the victims even though he admits himself that the apology may seem hello at this point but in a video he did urge people to come forward if they have been victimized in the past\nMy Victor victims that I've you know essentially ruined on foreign you might as well at this point I'm really sorry I mean it's just so shallow is the greatest is a great word yeah\nAnd have you seen the reaction or or backlash that Pope Francis himself has been receiving yeah or the day if\nI had the duty talk about that a little bit because it's been quite swift\nYeah so he recently came out saying you know the reason behind the sex abuse scandals end the divisions and the church he says the reason behind that is the devil and he's asking Catholics to pray\nA a ... as a way to fight against the devil and then we saw you know on social media people blessing the pope saying no it was the clergy members themselves and the churches\nCold or the downloading of hiding the behavior that that is to blame\nExactly so if you want to blame the devil look in the mirror because yeah I I just that was a horrible thing to say I'm\nA ... year you know when the crimes against children occur you have to take off any club be at a church or if you're upstanding quote upstanding citizen a in society a judge a law enforcement all that and he's your naked and you need to drop all that and they need to be charged as such and I hate when they can hide behind\nEspecially when they can hide behind a the cross\nYou know ... and and it's because of that of that cloth of that power that many of the victims were afraid to coming forward that they'd come forward a lot of them were were told that they were either lying or they're ... they were mistaken because how could somebody uh you know of a man of God\nOr do do something like that but those who did come forward and they were they were chastised or even a harassed themselves\nHave the victims weighed in on any of this because we've we've ... frequently speak two representatives from the group snap which\nIs a group that represents the victims of priest sex abuse and they're very critical typically of how the church responds to these antics what are are victims saying about the specific release\nMore you know what we are right now I I personally haven't seen too many people commenting we've seen a lot of this coming out from the church you know with their statements and what they've been\nReleasing but you know you can bet that this is going to open up the conversations for people who do currently go to church and a kind of have that uh are kind of battling their own you know their own a morality or or er nurse battling you know whether or not to continue to go to church or\nYou know this clergy thing is this something that is based on religion and so that's one of those conversations that you could imagine a becoming more\nAnd now and and as a member of the Catholic Church I Will say this I'm and I'm not practicing but my kids do you go to Catholic school it's a lot like bad things happen it's like let's let's use the Trump stuff some people say well okay he like my girlfriend who was a big Trump supporter at\nWhen I talk about Stormy Daniels she goes before he was president I said but while he was married let's talk about morality his wife just had a baby doesn't matter to them there are people that are going to be Catholic Catholic doing through that this is that's a bad person those were bad people that doesn't reflect the entire church\nAnd that's that and they they're not going to be a they're going to say not every priest is bad and that they're going to use that analogy and that's just the way it goes\nWell okay well look at the brighter side let's remove ourselves from the church for a second you know back to the list of the\nOf the priests that they mentioned all but one were removed from the priesthood permanently banned from the ministry or or dead why isn't there a separate category for in prison because if the if you're the cops out there you're the district attorney\nYou may be a practicing Catholic but you're wearing a lay hat in your role as we're going to sell them believe ... child abuse case right it doesn't look like giving of these people are in prison no and that's a failure of but they never president failure of the district attorney that's a failure\nThat's our failure we can't control what the church does unless you're a Catholic and then you have a say so\nBut as a non Catholic I have no control over what they do I don't have the da\nVinci control over what they do I can have my son is an altar boy and he could be if you how to how how do I know if he doesn't tell you we frightened during very powerful organization right so\nThat's why nothing gets done they fall under the coke and and nobody goes after the umbrella of religion and people are afraid look at the family I forget which ones they they they were charged with the kids deaths and because they were a certain religion that sacrifice to\nAll right let me rephrase any as a member of the congregation you probably don't have the power you have the power to write them ... ... when I was the only director of the church the pope have the power yeah cardinal vat of our current were people in that church that did have the power to do something that is we have no control over their actions\nBut the d._a. James the cops they're supposed to look out for these kids\nYeah that's absolutely right and when you don't have a ... that that accountability it does not only make that the church look bad for not reporting it sooner or or taking further action but also yeah on a local law enforcement so that you know this one of the things that I'm not sure if you saw the movie I think it was a based in Boston where they came out with\nA story about sorry spotlight\nOh yeah ... yeah and so when we heard a actual stories of that where you know people would would go towards a report things to the police of but because of the person's high status in the church or it would be questioned and so\nI ... a long story short you know this is a good thing that at least where you are getting the names now\nI'm hopefully more archdiocese in the country\nFollow suits and and try to fix something that's been wrong for so many decades but yeah this is a you know recently with the with the younger generation you see fewer and fewer people identifying or or saying that they belong with any certain religion in particular and this is one of those things that you know that doesn't\nUh definitely win people over\nOr we expected to get lists like this\nChristians that those pastures can get married and I'm curious if they get a study\nOn what the not that they're going to tell the truth but it is rampant like it is in in the Catholic Church that we've seen in the past few decades I don't think so well the different ride likely be there's a bigger bureaucratic structure that can protect them [noise] that would be my ... well not they've been protected for decades\nAll right if you want to see broad white at the growth on January the twenty fifth three days before my birthday gift right now are we talking about the month of January all already holy month of jolted Augie what oh my\nGosh we that's that's like a few months away and we're already talking about your birthday\nRight okay go ahead\nBe lucky caller number seven right now at eight hundred to two two K.
