{"content": "And I've seen what they were doing some shots and you know he was showing off the tools of his trade gotta as somebody called the police police department and said they'd seen an individual pointing a rifle out of one of the windows at the hotel man is this a listed as you would imagine quite a response from the Mesa police department and you had a number of individuals\nHigh ranking officers and patrol officers respond in you know in in full on tactical gear I mean these are fast I mean any you know this isn't your average your average officer who was just in you know normally uniform or used to saying this is why you're right so they come out you know and they're they're in the hallway of this a hotel where Mr shaver staying and he's\nVoted out of his roam along with the woman that he's with and they both come out and compliance with those commands\nAnd the Shavers very clearly intoxicated oh this was on videotape could all be seen um\nYou know Mr shaver was intoxicated the police were yelling at him screaming commands at him he tried his best to do what they were telling him to do and what ultimately and he he didn't have any weapons you know those that pilot down within the hotel room he didn't have anything on him and the police didn't see anything on him but he was eventually told\nA crowd towards the officers and so he does that and you can see all of this ... nearly crawls towards them on his hands on his knees and he's crying and he's begging for them not to shoot and and at some point while he's crawling he stops\nAh he reaches back with with his right arm I Believe it is and I'm an officer named Phillip ... open fire with an AR Fifteen a are Fifteen and a are Fifteen little Las\nVegas shooting frame of Orlando nightclub shooting fame\nAnd incredibly high powered rifle military grade rifle ... shot you know Mr officer Brelo spreadsheets shaver five times a he said he thought Mr shaver was reaching for a gun you know one of the interesting things about that case was officer Brelo spreads rifle the A R Fifteen that he fired actually had the phrase your ask etched into\nA it was and I actually action too and they are Fifteen\nActually ... ... okay now he was charged ... trade with second degree murder and manslaughter charges\nAnd one of the interesting things is that the jury and this criminal prosecution of officer browse for it did not see the video footage that captured the events leading up to the shooting in the shooting and there were some issues with it being sealed I'm not exactly sure why that would not have been shown and the prosecution like this uh but that jury um acquitted of ... um\nSo we could probably have another show entirely on why they didn't see the video but but the issue is is that this was a prosecution\nThat was well founded of a white man who'd been I Would have to just say murdered by law enforcement and not only did justice nuggets or by the fact that the jury wasn't able to see the incriminating evidence but not only that but his family now has to live with the fact\nThat the officer that day this is not going to face any kind of a criminal a repercussion so folks we're we're out of time I want to thank you for tuning in ah this is obviously a subject that\nUh has ripped the fabric uh out of our hearts as a nation we have had so many instances of this happening and we wanted to devote to show to it simply to talk about the dynamics involved\nThe good news is that we're turning a corner on some level a because\nWhat we've seen out of Chicago represents the first case out of what may be more uh where a jury and a prosecutor are actually willing to risk their professional lives their personal lives to pursue a concept of truth in the courtroom\nAs it relates to the dynamics of an officer involved shooting a once again I'd like to thank you so much for taking the time to sit with us in Studio\nOr we are going to have to wrap it up

guy that had his car impounded did he have a driver's license does\nInsurance you can't drive in the state without insurance\nBut you have to understand Frank and um you're lucky to live in Ventura County but there are so many people that moved to Los Angeles that do not have a home they live out of their cars\nBut because they can live out of their cars they go to work and they managed to get by and eventually they don't live in their cars anymore so to penalize these people that are still trying to hold down a job well not having a place to live by living in their car it does seem unfair to\nTo to constantly rack up tickets and you know and prevent these people from going to work by an pounding their vehicle and giving them no place to live I I can understand that you have to be able to prove that though\nI think he's right about the results were though Amy go ahead\n[noise] [noise] yeah I think that is the goal is to allow these people who were but I keep them accountable for what they did they can take a little tornadoes like community service other things that's really needed\nWas paying what about that\nI mean I think I'm fine with that but some of these people are are holding down multiple jobs you know I I don't and I think that's the whole reason for this that they can't keep their jobs if their cars getting pounded they don't have the money to pay these tickets so I'm not sure that they have a whole lot of free time for community service but nah maybe I'm wrong enrolling\nCall your somewhere commas go ahead\n[noise] [noise] yeah I was just a community services actually the solution to this is for people who are unable to make a famous or have money to pay or or something to that effect and even if they have limited time that can be something that can be\nA ... and and the court the judge to say okay well you're working two jobs and you're making this All right well then you only work for three hours on Saturday picking up garbage\nOr something to that effect that's better than just saying oh well you can't afford it so then we'll just let you up because when you're doing that and there's no accountability for your well\nYour behavior that's not what it should be then that doesn't keep you from doing it because the reason for the fun is supposed to be as a deterrent\nRight the true it is supposed to be in a cavity actually thank you Carl could've Chevy you actually got some sort of community service correct\nYes I have a full time job and I was on disability and the judge was asking people who could afford and who couldn't and I told your luggage or Asian and I got thirty hours of community service and you know\nThe community needs a lot of services you're not just picking up wonderfully\nWell yes yes you are so right so so in a way we're sort of forcing their dad ... a year we ought to be subjected to any way\nRight right thank you very much for taking my call\nMango down you are the things for the comment a no not quite sure where Kelly is going to go here Kelly go ahead\nYeah I think you know eventually it's going to be like downtown Bangladesh or yeah or people lied on his sphere and the guy across\nThe road we'll just go in gridlock everywhere roof by the way I'm Sorry your co hosts the female Loren Loren\nWhy do why do you lock your doors every day you just put a sign on and say hey I'm working come on and make yourself at all but gone by which is when I get home\nI'm not I don't understand why a term for your logic I met her or go make make that point\nIf you will if you want it to make it easy for everybody if you really have some passionate he personally have compassion when you leave every day and your house is empty why don't you just make it available to you the homeless people are so concerned\nAbout I'm not talking about for me\nI'm not talking about the people living on Skid Row that have multiple problems I'm Talking about the working poor\nThat the only difference from them living in shelters is living in their cars and a lot of those people get hit with the finder get their cars impounded which not only prevent them from from working which we want them to do but they have no place to live and no way of paying off the science that was my point\nOf it even better for you leave them a list of things to do and then that will accomplish that will compensate them or you letting them use your house or the day when you're not there I mean if you're really really into compassion do something that's meaningful rather than just make everybody else you\nReally don't know how and making everybody else do it for me but I I yes that would be wonderful if I have household chores they can provide for me I don't know if the county of Los Angeles would be okay with that but I'm up for\nIt to ... interesting model maybe we could have ways of people apply that's\nRight you need to go and fold Lawrence of on the laundry for two weeks or care medical ...\nVery it'd be very careful that I have a feeling that our water [laughter] I couldn't have been in the indentured situation a rush to go ahead\nI agree with law and a hundred percent um are you still live in a red controlled apartment in downtown San Francisco I'm a professional musician I drive all over the place for work luckily my family was there to help me out it is impossible to live in a city with our that could go ridiculous parking tickets\nAnd yeah\nIt ... it would have been ruined it if I didn't have my family to help me at the time they would have ruined me to take care of all the parties I guess it's just inevitable you cannot live you can't have a car in the city if you live in the city\nAnd not rack up parking tickets and I think to to empower somebody's car for something that is a very low impact\nIn terms of society crime interest will be ruined it to someone's\nLife and you're like you you liked the idea of\nA community service of individual Lawrence house hundred to two to three writers right\nDo they set that up on purpose if you go to Korea time to go to downtown LA there is not enough parking spaces and they do that on purpose\nThey have this city so that they can give out tickets and gain revenue\nSo so Russ you do bring observers you point though which is we we don't rarely talk about which is the support a family and friends when you hit hard times I mean\nThat's how you keep people off the streets that's how you keep people afloat that's how people are very propelled forward to solve problems so they can get through whatever tough time they've got it it's the ones in our lives that we should be relying on do you agree with that\nTotally we're not we're not everybody has died or yeah aren't saying look you know what\nI understand into but I just I just want to emphasize that that that is something we should all be thinking about if you have some of your life was struggling your do your job is to support those people are Theresa you disagree with all this\nUh first of all as let's say like Dr ... thank God he's got one on the voice of absolute\nA pragmatic and since the ... because everything including you you just said there is all wonderful I think the days of whole both people those people were not getting help from their families so they wouldn't help them to say that until the end of ties everybody's smart enough to know that but it just doesn't happen a lot of times\nIt's definitely if they go all the extra cost that they want to charge people it's a waste of money and time they'll ever fill up with bloody and and the situations there is so I think it's ridiculous\nThey often don't she's right I mean they just go unpaid so they're trying to figure out a way to get to make a lot of heavy and you'll find so that they can\nYou know hey I'm the the issue always may only drill into the family thing or a single oftentimes only members had people that are very sick amongst them drug addicts ... and they burn them out and I'm saying they don't want the family's help and I'm saying just re emphasizing it's incumbent on each\nOther you said multiple times on this show that when you have a family member that is resistant to treatment that refuses to get healthy you have to take off of a hard line and in fact in your life you have to cut that person off\nThe hook them off and then I Would personally hunting them off for personally I I Would not give up on them I Would I Would create consequences\nWill how do you cut them off and then I give up and we've got 'em off in a in a different city living homeless Lee I don't know how I Would\nGet them arrested or whatever it might I I thought I Would set them up for a crime it's don't do it and say I'm with more in civil onto\nYour nearest says she

path for many people showing today shows that we're going to explore what it takes to be an influence your ... thinking about that as a career path and then if you have a vision is a restaurant a fashion line\nAnd you haven't talked to influence voters and ask them to work with you they learned some things about that today our first guest is Kayla herbicides who she is work with us it Frasier communications with\nOne of our valuable clients for many years we've had Jonathan Lewis there a national furniture manufacturer and Kayla has been great in terms of sharing her experience with their products she has over two hundred and Seventy three thousand followers on her blog welcome cameras so happy to have you on the show\nThanks for having me let's talk about how you got started as an influence or and your background\nWell sometimes I kind of question whether or not I am an influence or not I think it's something that five years ago when I started it it didn't exist up so I just started out as blogging at a hobby\nRight and you were blogging about things that were of interest you write was decorating your home is that right is that how\nWe had just purchased a new home and so I had started documenting the process\nThat's great and I'm prior to that you work in an ad agencies that correct\nI did in fact I was still working at an ad agency while I started my blog I'm an Internet coming to me and said you know when I came back from maternity leave out of business page on Facebook and this and that and I had no idea what you're talking about so I taught myself\nRight right well that's what that is true in a lot of these folks are a lot of bloggers and people actually come to me it\nFrasier communications talking about how they can make themselves into at us or a chain of brand and blogging and blogging you know using video is certainly one way to do that what's great about your work ... as you genuinely are interested in home decor right that's so you're you're you have a passion for this and that's why you have to block\nCorrect I sometimes talk about other things just to keep it interesting I'll throw in at the Y. crafting kind of idea or maybe a drink recipe but for the most part my niche is in home to court\nAnd that's great and how how did you work to get that many followers when does it take\nOh I don't really know exactly uh he just kind of throw your heart on on the Internet and hope that sticks\nAnd I like that show which organic right you're not buying cars there are some bloggers who by a viewers and this one of the reasons that frankly my agency Frasier communications where she was last we've asked them to make sure it's organic is genuine because they really want to hear your opinion right and see what you're doing it with your life\nExactly if you're honest in your opening talking to basically virtual stranger if people are going to listen to that and they want to talk to you\nAnd I like that I like that now to tell me a little bit about working with my company Frasier communications how has that been\nI've worked with you guys have couple of times and it's actually been absolutely amazing you guys have a great open line of communication approval process is really prompt um it's just been a pleasure\nAnd that is great right so this is talk about the show for promotion that you did for Jonathan Lewis 'cause um I think you even went to the show her and then you saw different selfish can you walk us through the process\nI did I did um well with Jonathan Lewis I mean because you and I had worked together before you had known from my blood that I was looking for a sea\nLion yeah now let me show that's Melissa Melissa who was on my ... my ... and we had her on the previous week so she was not only are block she was following you and having a dialogue with you right\nExactly exactly so she said hey you need a social we have a sofa for you or she also knew that I was\nI'd be attending high point market so because she was watching my Instagram\nAnd let me tell everybody what I point and so that she had a big trade show\nThat occurs in North Carolina and it's an opportunity for buyers from a a a department stores as well as furniture chain like CSI gallery and living spaces to visit different show Rome's your area and they showed a uh the the production and they have in these wonderful kind of a\nEnsemble settings and it's a great opportunity to see various products you are going to visit as a blogger to see different uh manufacturers\nCorrect correct and Melissa said hey as long as you're out there why don't you stop at the Jonathan step into the Jonathan Lewis show room and you can see the entire line which of course you know I'm going to put that on my stories on Instagram and say hey check this all out the guys\nRight my my followers loved\nThat they love it if you don't want so cool about it I had the opportunity to go to high point and they have these miniature settings\nAnd then they always have the one year it was like the fifties and I had like monopoly games and M. and m's and things from the fifties but they have different settings so they have a modern traditional and there are so wonderfully decorate is you've got to wander among all the different vignettes right\nExactly exactly and they had a personal tour from Jonathan though if it was it was fabulous\nHow cool is that yeah so you you they tell you and you know all that um most of their furniture's made in the United states they also have some uh uh assembly manufacturing in Mexico but I ... in Los Angeles they have the factory is great because you have people who's\nSpent thirty five years helping to assemble or make furniture and Jonathan Lewis has a family run business as a great story but anyway you ended up than wandering walkie trees out a person to or how did you choose your sofa\n[noise] you know I went in thinking that I wanted one cell phone and I walked out with it totally completely different\nSo [laughter] I'm a sofa\nThat I was looking at it had been out a couple of years and I said you know something rather than taking something that you guys have already had out on your floor why don't look at something new which was great because I got to see everything that was new and up and coming\nVery cool and and ... what's the name of your blog is at houses hipsters that's correct right out of hipsters because I read the blog when I liked was your personality way you brought it in his and when did you call this the sofa big mama I Wish I had was how did you [laughter]\nWhat it is kind of a big chunky mama [laughter] yeah yeah yeah it has those low slung\nThe number one mistake than most people make with their money is they think they can do this on their own and then they'll go to the education later well that's the wrong thing to do one creates bad habits and number two they never do go back to do the education because they've blown up the money that they had\nSo what do good students do I talk to them all the time number one\nThey realized in the twenty first century that they could take a laptop anywhere in this world right now it doesn't matter because as long as they have an Internet connection and their laptop\nThey can trade all over the world in fact we had a student named B or and he's in San Diego in a lot of times are students feel it's too hard they can't do it well not only is beyond done this and has left his job which is exactly what everybody wants to do right we want to quit a job you don't love to do something we do love\nHe's become a excellent trader and he's also now started funding as whites real estate business\nSo the two of them are doing something together\nSpending more time together spending more time on vacations and family but the important thing here Ryan is it they're loving what they're doing and there's so many people out there and if you're one of those people hopefully you can see how you can benefit from just learning new skills that can give you the freedom that you desire\nYeah absolutely and it's it's kind of interesting as we're as we're sitting here talking about the lifestyle of a traitor I'd just literally receive a text message from a dear friend of mine and it just popped up on my phone and he was actually somebody who got me started in trading he was one of the first people who said this is how you open an account these are the steps that you go through\nIt very very first conversations these just become a lifelong dear friend of mine and he's a huge ski bum he lives up in Salt lake he ... he travels around it as a great time\nHe just texted me with a picture of snow skis saying hey can you use these this season or should I take him to the ... because\nIf I go to Salt Lake ... bum a pair of skis from him rather than a hall in mind around\nBut it it's just there's just so much freedom that can come with it and it and it really ends up just pulling down to a couple of basic steps a couple of basic as you were saying changes or actions that need to be taking because I think it's very critical it's very important it's it's very powerful once we do understand\nThat that that poor is just the state of mind right that passing over opportunities repeatedly and it's something that can be really easily changed just by stepping out of our comfort zone right just by stepping out of our comfort zone and doing something different we talk a lot about\nKind of cliche statements on the show here but it's because they're so true and they're so useful and and it goes back to if we've always done if we always do what we've done will always get what we got in and if we're completely satisfied with where we are then then great let's continue to do what made us so happy and the first place\nBut if we want a little bit more for trying to cook it created a little more income if we're trying to create a little more freedoms we have a specific goal\nThat we're trying to accomplish that we haven't been able to get to we have to make the necessary changes and that's one of the life lessons that my grandfather share with me my whole life growing up he would hold up his five fingers I Would have to name all of them\nThe first one is no your business the second one is be converted and that converted one as a youngster I honestly didn't understand what it meant and as I got involved with trading and I really started to go kind of soul searching down this is this something that's gonna work for me am I going to be able to do this\nThat converted when I started to realize was make the necessary changes the necessary metamorphosis do what's necessary and and and in the beginning and that was the one I always kind of didn't put as much emphasis on when I was like ten eleven twelve even Eighteen Nineteen twenty you know but then as I really started into my my grown up years I started realizing\nHow be converted that pointer finger of the five to me became the most valuable because if we don't make the necessary changes we're never going to accomplish that kind of outlier goal\nThat were after that one of the things we can do there is to help a few people get started with this as we still got a few tickets we can give away let's change some lives right now we've got a half day class coming up in your area\nThey have to classes where you see exactly where it takes to really take control of the finances really taking surely a retirement account generate more income inside of the market's really

you have two dollars or two million dollars it's all about getting that money working for you and really getting it to generate that income so you can live the lifestyle you can reach that financial freedom goal that you're after\n... what are some of the things are what are some of the other kind of examples I Know you have you have bags in bags loads of view of these examples of our students that you've talked to that we're in one place there now and another well the first thing we always understand here is that with\nTrading it's simply a transfer money from people who don't know what they're doing to people who do know what they're doing and what's really sad as people will get themselves stuck to think about just time right now\nPeople can sit in front of a television for hours versus going out there and learning a skill that can help them and every year and you were coming after the holiday season again we're gonna start seeing all these Jim commercials again right 'cause here comes resolution time and one of the things I hear a students say over and over again is beside wishing having had more time was\nThis is the year I Want to get out of debt and I want to turn my finances around and what's amazing is how many students\nCome in through the classes that we're doing right now and simply imagine what their life would be like if they can learn a skill to help them generate more money\nAnd that's the key it's about doing something taking action and getting out there to change your current situation again if your coach shovel and something that you are really interested in learning how to do there is no limitations here in fact one of my students June\nShe actually came in my class and she said all she wanted to do is play golf and coaster Rica and so she started realizing that by learning how to trade gave her the time to do that I said it's great to send me a postcard and she did and she said she was trading 'cause that's a whole nother piece of it\nPeople go on vacation Ryan right and they decorate the vacation they're making money to pay for it and so I asked you or your training before or after college she goes\nBefore of course and I love that of course\nYeah we're talking with a group of students just a little while ago that did a big trip through Europe and I remember him saying\nYou know where we were trading out in Europe and we made as much money out on our trip as we actually spent on the trip and so it's kind of fun to come back from a trip with a with a with a flat balance or even being up after having a great after having a great time\nAnd that's the thing is it doesn't matter where you are you just have to have an Internet connection doesn't matter where you are and it doesn't matter where you're from it doesn't matter what your background is it's all about just proactively identifying good opportunities and that's really what we introduced you to show you exactly what it takes how to do that\nInside

I I think it was by design okay so on my Facebook page I simply posed a question and people were tearing into each\nOther the question was how in the ... just before of course the vote went through and he became the uh a Supreme Court judge\nBy a slim narrow margin but the question was how do you vote caffeine and sugar or barley and hops and set off a firestorm of comments I didn't mean for it to turn political I was just talking about the caffeine in the sugar in the can of coke did she sat on the table my opinion by design\nAnd the a discussion about love of barley and hops [laughter] tracking it it it it uh it was more barley and hop\nSo uh by the way they sort of one out but man oh man the caffeine in the sugar crowd wet for the juggler [laughter] it was nasty\nBut it wasn't designed for that it's really a health oriented or a you know Facebook page but I just I it was just an observation them you know call me strange but when I saw that coke in there and they'll come on you're gotta be kidding me here\nI'd say any of that that's how we're going to be talking about today we're going to be joined by special gas coming up\nAnd we're also going to be talking about diet drinks\nAnd I don't know if she had regular or sugar free or artificial sweeteners in that coke and I you know it was sitting there and then I saw another frame of another picture she was thrown back hard\nAnd cameras were snapping away and I went over everywhere and the the the ah executives at Coca Cola\nWere doing some high Malians not high fives high hundreds of millions of dollars as a result of seeing\nToday on the show we're going to be talking about researchers add add allied medical school in Australia there they're talking about how diet drinks and artificial sweeteners increase the risk of diabetes\nJust the opposite of what you would think people\nGravitate to\nAnd they utilize these diet drinks and artificial sweeteners because they think they can fool Mother Nature they think they can get away from the shoe gar\nAnd get over there to the artificial aspartame nutrasweet and the sugar loaf and all of that thing that okay I get my sweetness and eat it and drink a Jew and yet when you go into the supermarket next time take a look see if I'm telling you something that's for sure for real\nAnd that is looking in the car it's just kind of you know keep your eye out and you're going to see people who are overweight and obese these are all the people who have all the diet drinking their cards they have three cans hanging out three cans in\nAnd they're the ones who are on the diet drinks now we know why\nWell we know why because they don't work and they increase weight not decrease way and they increase the risk of diabetes or not decreased the risk and we'll talk about that a little bit later in the show\nOr if we have time or else you got to be talking about how\nHot dogs and burgers and this was going to break the hearts of many but hotdogs and burgers\nAccording to Harvard University researchers eating a dog and a burger increases the risk of breast cancer\nIt's true\nNow I got to tell you I used to go to the ball games and I still do but I don't eat the hotdogs there anymore but uh and I'm sure that this is related to a pretty substantial on a regular consumption of a burgers and dogs but most Americans eat processed foods they fast foods all the time it doesn't matter if it's salami hotdogs bacon ham\nAnd it ratcheted soft the increased risk of breast cancer in women that according to Harvard researchers know getting a does\nSo we have that on the docket today and we have a health poll question too I don't know if you've\nEver visited somebody in the hospital and you're sitting in there and you're chatting with the person that's in the hospital trying to recover income the beagles\nYeah there's the beagles their end of the dogs\nHospitals are perpetuating a theory that if you bring dogs into the hospital they now call them therapy

A. B. C. after after I talk about these artificial sweeteners drinking diet drinks or using artificial sweeteners could increase your risk of type two diabetes scientists found\nThat just in two weeks of high intake of low calorie sweeteners these artificial sweeteners or no calorie sweeteners was enough to significantly altered the makeup of\nThe bacteria in the guts this changes the way the body absorbs and regulates blood sugar\nThat's what the researchers are talking about some of these low calorie sweeteners and the diet Pepsi the Diet Coke all of that which are used by a lot of people are linked to changes in the gut bacteria\nAnd that could increase your risk of diabetes and are people who have already they're overweight or they have diabetes are much much more prone to this if they're using a much more more prone to getting worse if they're using these artificial sweeteners and diet drinks just the opposite of what you think\nSo if this is what you're using you need to switch over you have a lot of options you have the options of using a monk fruit which is zero calories as no glycemic index she had a very sweet about a hundred and fifty times sweeter than cane sugar\nYou've got Steve via is an option you've God's Iowa tall as an option anything get off these artificial sweeteners because when you mess with Mother Nature you fool Mother Nature you get burned and in this case you'll be burned in the case of diabetes type two diabetes All right back to the phones\nHere he is a Cathy and west LA welcome to the doctor Bob margin show catty hello\nOh hi Dr von thank you so much for your show um I have a high end it there really painful how do you get rid of these\nHow long they've been there a catty okay ah about two days now\nOkay it's going to be difficult because it's hard to know because whatever it was that you set them into motion hide or you to carry it is an allergic reaction to something and that you you have a histamine reaction you have these these blood cells called ... and they go crazy\nWhen you expose yourself to something that your body didn't like in in\nIn this high it's sort of protective mechanism your body is basically sending ... violated in some way and it's wanting to tell you on the surface the problem is internally though\nUsually it's something that you've considered my first case of hives I was at the Dairy Queen and had this ah slurp anything that was real red and they had all kinds of artificial costs is when I was a kid\nAt are all kinds of artificial coloring agent said it was just pure junk and I went home with a bunch of hives and my parents said okay so uh what did you eat or drink in the last six hours and finally we tend to down to the Dairy Queen or drink that I was so it can happen\nSo now they have it what do you do well it's got to be difficult traced back and see if you could figure out when they first started and what you ate and keep a diary because you don't want to repeat that each and every time you want to learn from the experience and avoid it\nBut meanwhile what do you do well the best thing to do when you have hives as fast where you go on and water and lemon for a whole day\nThe second day you drink nothing but beet juice and carrot juice with little salary and then you get these uses that the Jews trees and the health food stores and health grocery stores and what you're trying to do is you're trying to purge the toxic reaction\nFrom the body by taking away stress off that the justice system so a day of nothing but water and lemon and a day of carrot juice a beet juice and maybe some salaries just whatever that'll clear it up and you'll lose about uh six pounds in the process which is good\nYou can also use things to a as naturally into his means like in a sea Anna said all Sistine which is a supplement you getting any health food stores and sulfur containing amino acids\nYou can use that are called metal stinging that'll works really well for hides as does a type of slave annoyed vitamin C. called ... these are all available to health food stores they're phenomenal at helping\nTo get rid of or hastened the healing process with a high for reaction which is an allergic reaction and that's that's what you need to focus a\nFocusing on All right before time gets away from us here I'm going to let you know that eating burgers and hotdogs increases a woman's risk of breast cancer that according to Harvard a Harvard study process it's all about the processed meats\nThe world cancer research fund recommends cutting out red meat altogether and I just read a study by the way\nThat taking extra vitamin D and getting your vitamin D levels up where they need to be touched breast cancer risk by Ninety percent that's a ... latest ... uh information about breast cancer and you should look it up just type in vitamin D breast cancer but\nAre you if you eat hotdogs or if you eat these hotdogs and burgers or real regular basis that's when the risk goes up once in a while no big deal right\nAnd lastly guys out there who are struggling with prostate problems I had a guy calling them I ... a national radio show this morning which by the way IRS from six to nine AM you can really listen to it right on my Web site at Dr Bob dot com [noise]\nAll right so he calls and he says okay so I'm urinating four or five six times a night what do I do and of course what I told him to do will solve his problem\nHe probably has a prostate that is a bulging a prostate that's bloated prostate the swelling and of course he can't get rid of all the Europe so I recommend it to him and this will work it's guaranteed to work and I've seen it work on thousands of men peachy nine to ...\nIt's a subtle than it has nine different ingredients in it\nIt's all natural it's based on the science that says that these ingredients help prostate tissue and help to interfere with the diameter of testosterone so if you're inclined at your getting up more than once a night\nAnd you are or not sleep and well and not fully emptying the ladder or you're having trouble with intimacy that can also be related to your processing you're having to take all those ... by agora give 'em up and give up all the potential side effects that could happen ... works or you get your money back\nAnd if you want to get a hold of eating nine call this toll free number eight hundred three one seven\nNine eight six three for ... all met over the age of forty whether they want to prevent a prostate or solve a prostate prom ought to be on PTA not eight hundred three one seven nine eight six rate should be also walking one two three miles eating less fat and drinking less alcohol\nPG nine eight hundred three one seven nine eight six three last time eight hundred three one seven nine eight six three\nFor ... [noise] All right we've run out of time so next week be back right after the voter has shown intel and make it a healthy Dana healthy we've been listening to the doctor mom artsy right here\nOn TALK radio seven Ninety KABC the well [noise]\nThis show furnished by Dr Robert Martin [noise]\n\nHave easy [noise]\nThe cumulus teachers [noise]\n[noise]\nTrouble in Florida I'm Evan Handler and I think it's sort of a Democrat if you want to know the truth in an interview airing on sixty minutes tonight President Trump said he is I'm sure how long defense secretary Jim Mattis plan to stay in his administration\nYou need to have a third part to that which is you need to have a cell strategy and that's why you know as I said we told our clients to sell the November of ... to stay out for all of two thousand and eight and then even half of all night and we didn't say to buy until June up all night\nSo we're we're we're by holding cell\nThis week I Want to talk given to drop that we saw last week and how dramatically it happened and how quickly um I Want to address the hey you don't have to worry about it because you're a long term investor everything takes care of itself over time time heals all wounds and all that good stuff your long term investor by whole through thick and thin\nWell I Want to talk about that one with you because I think that is one of the most dangerous things that people tell you if you are the aforementioned retired retiring so now most shows jak would stop right there most of those who say you know what if we did just that we have done more than our listening audience could possibly want from a financial show\nSomebody don't you dare stopped me because on this show do we stop there no we don't we boldly go where no financial show has gone before\nAnd therefore at about ten till we all have our state tip of the week this is the part of the show leaves Jim on where we talked about how to pass onto your greedy and washed undeserving airs the fruits of your labor and this week we're going to talk about my favorite trust is called a dynasty trust\nAnd this is where you can protect what you leave your heirs from lawsuits divorce and the state taxes for potentially one hundred years it's a terrific thing and we'll talk about that at about ten ...\nSo we've got a ton of get to but I Want to just quickly give a shout out\nTo a ... a listener Laura if you're listening to 'em out you\nI'm I mentioned last week that we have a a puppy and the puppy uh she had this submissive pink thing that she does you know it's like the mom and she sees me you know when I first come home from work or in the morning or whatever it is first time she sees me bam a gallon a pie right there she just squats and peace and it's like oh my gosh\nAnd so the lord I heard this and she\nSent me an email to ... we had the best\nI can tell you it's it's awesome thank you Laura a she's a ... a retired veterinarian so if anybody knows it's her right [noise]\nWell I don't know I have to call her she gave me a phone numbers you said call me and Laura I'm going to call you okay I just haven't had time this week but I'll tell you this weekend if if that's OK anyway let's talk about is this a thousand and eight all over again okay so\nYou know I Want to go back to a you know two thousand and seven the end of two thousand seven October issue and all that\nAnd at that time\nYou know there were some clouds there were some dark clouds or the unemployment numbers were starting to get weaker or there was a inflation was picking up the economy was slowing down a little bit I mean there was no signs of what was to calm\nBut there were signs there were some dark cloud let's say that it wasn't raining but they were dark clouds\nAnd uh and there was a lot of volatility the market was dropping dramatically and then a rising dramatically than dropping dramatically\nAnd at that time people are saying this is a buying opportunity you know when the market fell and by the way that's almost exactly what happened in Y. two K. in October of two thousand August through October same thing the market was going up and down the same way before it finally of fell off a cliff\nSo is this like that\nI'm no in my view okay first of all the economy right now is not showing signs of weakening in fact it's the opposite is showing signs of strength unemployment is showing signs of strength inflation is is is in good shape so we got a lot of signs\nThat no this is not two thousand and eight all over again so what is it well basically it's a re calibration okay so in other words the Federal Reserve raised interest rates the market finally has come to terms with that and said oh my gosh interest rates are going up if interest rates go up people buy fewer houses pure cars\nCompanies it costs more to borrow money profits go down so it's a re calibration is just adjusting to the new paradigm that's all so I don't think what happened last week was the beginning of the new bear market recession all that kind of stuff but you know what it does do\nIn my view it should be a wakeup call to you\nBecause did you did you see how fast it fell\nI mean it was like what eleven hundred points and two days I mean that's fast the market when it goes down it goes down very fast\nAnd you can lose your retirement very quickly I mean you can you if you if you're about to retire and it goes down thirty or forty percent like it did in Y. two K. or and two thousand eight and you'd write it down like that\nWhat would that do to your ability to retire or if you are retired what would that do to your ability to generate income your from your investments so that's why you know as I said we don't believe that by and hold is sufficient okay it's great you should do that you should buy you should hold you should diversify all those things we believe that but it's not sufficient\nYou need to have a third part of that which is a protection mechanism and if if you're over fifty and your contemplating your retirement or you are retired\nWe want you to be a client of ours we want to help you plan your retirement make those decisions all the stuff that it takes we want to be there with you that there's no doubt so here's what I recommend\nIf you go to our website at our website is money matters dot net okay and when you go there money

proud of it as bad as it was I take full responsibility [noise] um\nAnd you about this I Know to the zoning\nWell how it is very silly incredibly silly so uh as I was saying I have been a a certified financial planner professional now for the last twenty marvelous wonderful and very exciting years at all of the idea that we talk about on this show these are the same ideas we talked about with our beloved and most valued clients\nWe not work with over a thousand four hundred beautiful families\nAnd we specialize in working with people who are retired or retiring soon\nSo that's where our focus

advisor for money matters one of the top one hundred wealth managers\nAnd uh once again without our clients we would be nowhere so you guys thank you thank you thank you I'm\nOne of the views that we have philosophically of how we help our clients so when it comes to financial advising you know you you you invest money obviously that's part of what you do is you want to help your clients with their investments diversification risk profiles all that kind of stuff but then that's that's a a component of it\nBut there's more okay because there's also you want to help to build a cash flow plan right you want to look at how you're going to get income when you're retired\nAnd then you want to have a risk assessment\nAnd all the idea that we talk about on this show these are the same ideas that we talk about with our beloved and most valued clients and we not work with over a thousand\nFour hundred families are in in forty three states oh and you know what it never ceases to our and me and in and and actually it it gives me enthusiasm and makes me want to go to work every day\nAnd do my best because uh you know it's such a wonderful thing and Financial Times named uh our financial advisory for money matters one of the top three hundred\nRegistered investment advisors for the second time this year okay so that's and that's quite an honor and we're very proud of that but you know what without our clients we would be nowhere so I give that to them and we are affirmed that specializes in working with people who are over the age of fifty who are retired or retiring soon so we we look at retirement planning is our primary focus\nAnd so if that's you we love to help you if we could and you can go to our website to find out all about us and we have tons of stuff on there for you we have podcasts and videos and articles all about the topics of a retirement planning\nAnd ah the website is money matters dot net okay so you can find it there so let's talk about Social Security and one of the areas the probably the most\nImportant of decision that you make when it comes to Social Security is\nWhen do you apply for benefits okay and if not sixty five anymore full retirement age for baby boomers now is sixty six or sixty seven but Social Security benefits can be claimed any time between the ages of sixty two in Seventy\nSo it's crucial for you baby boomers out there to understand how claiming early benefits will reduce your benefits for life\nAnd how delaying benefits will increase it and how to coordinate spousal benefits as well and that's an area all by itself that requires a lot of studying knowledge and all that and so let me answer some questions that are that are the\nThat was looking at here so first of all why would you delay claiming your benefits if the average person will get the same amount from Social Security regardless of when they claim\nSo the way Social Security is designed just so you know is that they're going to pay out the same dollar amount to you regardless of when you start okay so if you start at sixty two they're going to pay you a lower amount for a longer period of time\nYou start when you're sixty six they'll pay you a higher amount of money but for a shorter period of time to wait you're Seventy they'll do that even again so what happens is they actually end up paying you the same total amount\nOkay it's just depending on the time zone so therefore why would you want to take a ... why would you want to delay it why would you take when you're sixty to\nThe problem is that most people will not outlive the will not live out an average life okay so uh you have to look at your life expectancy\nSo an average life means you live to be ... eighty six currently I think is the uh is is it is the life expectancy\nSo you know I was talking to a client just the other day who whose mother is Ninety eight years old and she still drives her own car I mean she's healthy and his his brother is a eighty you know and he's healthy and fine so so in his case you know we got to look at longevity and how long it's going to be\nSo the first thing you want to look is is a is longevity\nAnd by delaying you lock up\nPermanently increased benefits for the remainder of your life and your spouse's life the second reason is if you're married as I said because then your spouse will get that higher benefit because they have the choice of whether to take their own or yours whichever is higher okay so if you delay does a higher amount that will be paid to you're surviving spouse\nSo there are reasons why you might want to delay even though the amount that you'll get in total dollars if you lived a life expectancy is the same\nOkay so something for you to consider now as I mentioned uh we do specialize in in in working with people who are retired or retiring soon and we look at ah we we primarily do work in the area of retirement planning so if you are over fifty if you are retired or you are retiring soon [laughter]\nAnd we're here\nFor you and our goal is to help more people in retirement than anybody else that's what we want to do [laughter]\nSo uh if you go to our website is money

Kenmore\nRay [noise]\nThank you Jack I've been a certified financial planner professional now for the last twenty marvelous wonderful and very exciting years and all of the ideas that we talk about on this show these are the very same ideas that we talk about with our love it and most valued clients\nAnd now we we work with over eight thousand four hundred families in forty three states it is a a just a an honor and privilege\nAnd we specialize in working with people who are retired or retiring soon so most of our focus is on a retirement planning and so is this show\nAnd so that's you then we're here for you and for the second year in a row now money matters or with Ken ... that would be our firm is a finalist where finalists or ... or the two thousand Eighteen north central Texas better Business Bureau torch awards for ethics which is a mouthful\nBut basically uh we are up for it for the second year in a row as an award winner for the better Business Bureau toward toward for ethics [noise]\nYes and the winters will be announced November first at the awards ceremony and I'll tell you whether we win it or not but we're\nUm I think honored just to be in the running to win it which is a a good thing because you know in our business I think ethics in in all businesses but particularly in our business I think ethics are very very important [noise]\nAnyway um we're going to talk now about the foundational philosophy that we have when we manage our clients money because we are financial advisors as I mentioned and one of the functions that we perform for our clients as we manage their money for him and\nWhat we tell them is you know that uh we're going to take care of we're going to manage your money for your job is to go and take a cruise okay we love you but get outta here [laughter] she let her take off go go be be gone and\nI Know I\n\nWould only say use\nMy good may be\n\nAnd\nOf course it is Tony Bennett with rags to riches and you know the estate taxes in probate and all that kind of stuff it's actually designed to do the exact opposite and we don't want that to happen to you so therefore every week at this time we have our state tip of the week now this we were going to talk about the dynasty trust which is a kind of trust\nThat will hold the inheritance that you lead to the aforementioned greedy and washed undeserving airs for up to a hundred years\nAnd not only that it'll protected from lawsuits divorce and state taxes during that entire time so [laughter] wow Mr Spock it is also very logical thing to do I think so let me describe to you the way it works a dynasty trust basically\nIs in its own separate entity okay so it has its own tax id you have to create it\nAnd you can created during your lifetime while you're living or it can be tested ... which means that it is in your will upon your dad they read the will and it says create the trust so it can be done that way as well now the dynasty trust is what you put money into okay now once it's in the trust\nNow what happens is it can stay in that trust as I said for up to a hundred years and during that time it will be protected from lawsuits and and divorce and the state taxes why\nWell because for example let's say that ah you know your your daughter gets a divorce\nWell your ex son in law is not divorcing to trust he's divorcing your daughter\nAnd so therefore the trust the money that's in the trust inheritance that you left behind is not available to the former son in law or because\nThere's no no no liability they're also in a lawsuit if your child goes bankrupt same thing they're suing your child or not so into trust therefore the trust is immune from that\nAnd then also you have a state taxes estate taxes in the in the dynasty trust a ... it's called the generations giving tax stress because it skips generations when it comes to taxes so it's a very powerful document in that regard\nNow while they're living they have access to the money has trustees your children or whoever you've named as the beneficiaries can receive that money from there and it and therefore they can choose the investments that they want to use and they have access to the money for what's called health education maintenance and support hams H. E. N. S.\nAnd you know hams is basically covers I mean what what does that not cover health education maintenance of sport is pretty much everything right\nSo it is a very powerful document I think it's one that uh anyone who has let's say over a million dollars in in assets\nThat they want to leave behind to they're greedy and watch the undeserving air should be thinking about but even if you have less than that it might be of interest to you if they're real estate or something like that so talk to you or a financial people talk to your attorneys before you do any of this stuff but I think it's something for you to consider\n\nWell Dorothy I've got something else that's two wonderful to be true and that is", "show_name": "The Drive Home With Jillian Barberie & John Phillips", "station": "KABC", "day": "14", "state": "CA", "year": "2018", "month": "10", "city": "Los Angeles"}
