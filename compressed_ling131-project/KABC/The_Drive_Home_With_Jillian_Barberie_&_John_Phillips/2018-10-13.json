I agree [noise]\nContrary to a common cultural narrative the poll finds large majorities of Americans of all ages income levels and racial backgrounds opposed political correctness [laughter]\nTo be more fun when we weren't so politically correct a microphone you know what I mean oh yeah like it was just fun and free and you could say anything and insult anybody and it was just\nGood times and I you\nRoast this is what I Need to me I've been to roast I've been roasted you ... you go in with an open attitude and you just have fun and you don't know about what everyone is you you were there to get lamb base it and just dragged across the coals\nThat's what you sign up for and there are various go back to the Don Rickles days Steve a dean Martin uh Jerry Lewis Frank Sinatra dumb do Louis Burt Reynolds they were brutal and they were awesome\nPeople love those roast how long did they sell those tapes in the middle of the night on TV for\nEver those are the dean Martin once they were those are my favorites with Don Rickles and the rat pack I said it's just fun and you had a six getting you didn't even have a thick skin and just said okay this is the night where I'm going to get attacked endlessly\nEven William Shatner Justin Bieber is on Comedy Central central was hilarious David off they were me\nSince Roseanne these were really funny and mean spirited oh awesome\nAlthough I Will tell you that it was like and it was brutal and it was awesome I think they've gotten less funny overtime uh-huh because it becomes less about the person who's being roasted than it does about the panelists who were there and it seems to be the same people over and over and over again they have\nYou're right they had I mean to me the best roaster I Love Jeffrey Ross but Greg Geraldo was my all time favorite roaster because he didn't really know the people who were just get up there and he would research and then kill with his job killing bill for the jugular juggler China\nAnd funny and then he passed away and so I I still watch them and I'll watch Jeffrey ... I think he's really funny but I Know what you're talking about the camaraderie they used to have because you know that they hung out went for drinks they were friends\nAnd so it was kind of done it was cruel but it was the knowledge and a wink nowadays they hire a professional roasters and they don't necessarily know you they don't necessarily hang out with you\nThey just are hired to roast you and so they'll go do their Laird Henry in there\nAnd yes verbal hit men [laughter] no\nBut if not to do a roast Pamela Anderson which they did I Love yeah I Want to see Pam's friends up there are several that she's worked with apple and her certainly go up there and raised here they had that too but they hired you know they had a lot of the professionals come in for the for the ...\nSo um yeah I Love those days I don't know we're so politically correct now it's boring didn't Trump to one probably\nIt I think Mike Tyson was one of his roasters is that right [laughter] 'cause I'm sure Mike Tyson fought in a bunch of science yeah hotels for sure All right now if you were to narrow it down by racial group yeah which racial group do you think is the most politically correct\nWhich ratio of white people white people by far yeah although worried about offending everybody Seventy nine percent of them think that we've gone too far a political correctness\nWhy see those women on a YouTube every week they're always going after some black kids selling lemonade or black guy that brushed up against them at the grocery I saw ...\nAlways those old ugly white women going nuts on these people they're the most politically correct but wanting the ladies aha OK guess who's the most politically incorrect\nIncorrect got to be Asians just getting [laughter] I Am going to say politically incorrect or\nThe Indian population you're right I Am\nThe American Indians earning least politically correct group love entry and think about this how often do they make universities change their mascot or professional sports teams changed their mascot\nYeah because they say oh it's going to offend me Indians according to this Paul ... or or wine with it\nYes oh come on I I said that when I visited Canada last time and I have one person say no they like to be called indigenous up in Canada\nBut I'll tell you when we went to one of my absolute favorite um six nations Indian reservation and I was talking to the woman that all come from you know they're either sue or a Ojibwe law and\nCreed and they said no we are proud Indians and I said gosh you know it's weird because everything in the states right now you can't say Indian they're like well I don't I don't know where people\nWell everything is such a minefield where you say something that you were taught and it wasn't even supposed to be a pejorative as I say it as an adult and everyone looks at you like ...\nI told you the day I said stewardess and the record\nScratched eyes on my gosh I'm Sorry flight attendant now I Can't keep up\nDid you say that on the plane\nNo I said it on the air and I think oh ... yeah maybe first started and then um what was the other one that offended and like I don't understand what going\nUp I have an ... an hour with Down syndrome now you're not supposed to be Down syndrome but we used to call her ... and my mom's a nurse and that was what she called us the proper term right but then you're not allowed to say that any more than I had to say what ... what the Down syndrome\nBut you're not supposed to say that either by the way almost killed me she tried to strengthen [laughter] very what'd you do to preserve wrong strong hand some woman\nUh I was being a kid yeah probably running around I was like ten or they just lean and tried to kill me she thought All right that's enough of your supplies she scare the hell out of me but um but you know when you're a kid stuff like that can scare you sure she's very strong woman you know but I'm\nWondering what they do to call off the dogs what do you know they let her go for a\nWhile there like she's only kidding just wrestling [laughter] she camps trading places [laughter] anyway\nUm so what's the proper terminology now you say someone with Down syndrome around got well it used to be special needs but no I don't know that someone\nWith Down syndrome is a specific you can't say ... anymore but that was the terminology that was my mother was a nurse and they were called ... was among the lawyer ... or something like that and maybe\nIt's intellectually disabled\nYeah but that could encompass a lot of people have our staff you [laughter] I Know I mean you've got to make the does I honestly don't know between right so I don't know the post high had\nDown syndrome and then somebody said oh no you can't see that anymore I said what oh my gosh what you don't know I didn't get the memo what am I supposed to say\n[laughter] I Can't keep up but that's the problem if you're trying to not be offensive right you still don't know if you're going to make something that's going to get my ... my son the other day was asking about\nThis he has his crush and he said something about he goes and I go what's her name and he goes blah blah blah and then he goes she's [noise] and I go why are we with spring we're in the car and he goes is that race is I go\nTo face somebody's black [laughter] but

want to talk about Nike right now but I Know you have your opinions on what they did with calling ... making him a hero or\nLook a a I'm a [laughter] somebody had a line\nI Know it was a comedian who had a a a line that uh the economy is so good that even Colin Kaepernick could\nGet a job [laughter] it really did on yeah it's pretty but look at the the point is that the stuff that\nWe argue about today a A N and one of the things that drives me crazy Thursday I did a disagreement day which we have every Thursday\nOn the show and all of this agreement was about the fact that I hate this narrative that a lot of people on the Republican side of things and braced which is we're in the midst of a new civil war\nIt's brother against brother were divided as a country where in the midst of a new civil war\nCivil war was about something big was about the survival of the union it was about slavery what are we arguing about right now we're arguing about whether people\nKneel during the national national anthem at NFL games were arguing about whether they show Neal Armstrong planting a flag\nOn the moon or they just do the flag on the moon already the level of our the intensity of our political disagreements I think I'm a runs an inverse relationship to their significance as the disagreements or less and less significant they become more and more passionate\nDoesn't that I faced something about who we are as people the human condition or what may be this technology era has turned us into yeah well yes I eat out without Alice\nIn and this is you would ask before about the books that my wife and I wrote together and it's the only one of my Thirteen books um ah that ah I've written with my wife and the only one of her seven books that she's\nWritten with saving childhood\nAnd and saving childhood the idea was that childhood innocence is worth protecting and one of the things that that I think we we advance in that book that's very important and people should still keep in mind the book was written in Nineteen Ninety seven\nAnd but it's still very much the case\nPeople are so immersed in media today and with the Internet and social media and the cable news and the general news and entertainment television and movies and all of it people who are immersed in media get get an impression of America\nThat is much more negative than the real lives\nThat we lead isn't right you're right\nThat the the the idea that we can get along I you know um I I don't know what the politics of my mailman is the the guy who delivers\nThe I think it's a male person of around ... thanks for the correct now my my mail delivery have I'd say that\n[laughter] but hey shores and again we have\nThis whole even that has been corrupted I mean I remember as a little kid\nIn Philadelphia a we had a mailman and my grandmother would always come out and say hello to him and he's friendly it was like Nineteen fifties stuff\nAnd the the the point the point over here is that most people get along we live our lives they're very few families where there is a very few conservative families where there isn't at least one or two\nA liberal members of the family they're very few liberal families\nThat don't have some kind of ... conservative there somewhere\nBut even if they're in the closet [laughter] well again\nSome ... ... it shouldn't be that way\nRight it should not be were just talking about policies here\nChoose the opinions why does it have to get so personal that's what that's what we've devolved into\nWell this is this is the point of this whole civil war narrative one of the things that I've pointed out a lot on the air is that uh the purpose of war when you talk about war is to destroy your enemy it's to kill him into break is stuff of the purpose of politics is not\nTo destroy your enemy is to persuade people and maybe even you persuade your opponent and your opponent is not necessarily your enemy in other words I don't want to ... in in terms of my approach to American politics I don't want to destroy anybody I'd like to persuade everybody right\nRight and it seems like that's what it it's about now\nI've got enough of most of the social media outpost here and there but I Can't go through Facebook anymore I Would probably have no friends laughed I Can't I Can't deal with it I I'm also in a world that I'm sick of people just being angry over nothing because they're not doing anything about it\nIf they want to see change go out go out and you know or whatever it is you want to protest or go out in the lobby or go out and do something but these people don't do anything except complain and that there there is no action steps towards doing anything\nAbout what they're talking about that really bothers me so I just I've had to get off of all that it's very upsetting because the what you're saying about war it's like ... and and politics it seems like it has they have come together\nNo and that's exactly right and that's why I think some people were so sick and by the whole Kavanaugh Irene yeah a spectacle is it was just a pure hostility and and after all we were talking about what people allegedly did when they were Seventeen years old lady six yeah I was\n... I always hearken back to evidence being a trial lawyer it's all about evidence you went to law school you know what that's about so it's really hard to spend a lot of time just focusing on hyperbole rhetoric had opinions\nRight now that that's exactly right and\nAnd look the the the other the other problem about the United states is I remember and I know a lot of people made fun of it but not at the time of the time it was inspiring\nIs right after September eleventh happened uh the people gathered at the steps of the Capitol building it wasn't just Republicans was Republicans and Democrats\nAnd they saying God Bless America together and no one from the ACLU had a connection\nFifth [laughter] God Bless America [noise] and Barney\nFrank was there was singing out of key but still I hate it and and really you know at the at the end of the day we are so blessed to live in this country\nYes we are absolutely and that you know what a wonderful way to end the show you at the end of the day we're at the end of the show it's a positive positive note to end on and maybe that will carry on into the future Michael medicated and we want to thank you so much for coming on ... today it's really been a pleasure to talk to you for the last of our\nAh it's Michael med dot com at Medford show listen to Michael mad mid everyday twelve to three Salem Radio network Michael you'll have

their whole lives when the markets go down it's a bad thing will last February\nGoldman Sachs made two hundred million dollars in one day by simply shortening the market now that day imagined that we did a little piece of it I'm not going to be greedy her you know but if you start to learn how to treat like the banks do then it's amazing\nThat all of a sudden you could start learning a skill that can make your money and not have to sit there and think about a second job or to get into a little bit later\nBut one of the ways I look at this and I get this analogy all the time when people are just simply trading one direction or they're waiting for the market to always go up it's like a car imagine that you were told you can get in a car tomorrow and you can drive somewhere but you can't put the car and reverse\nYou're going to go on a lot of circles eventually going to get there but you know it's a lot of time energy and money getting to the same place if you simply had all the tools to get you there faster so a lot of what I'm seeing our students learning the first time is it they're becoming\nDirect ... they don't care if it goes up down or sideways as long as the markets are moving they can learn how to make money and what a lot of them are seeing right now is they can create more freedom for themselves because they're able to make money no matter where the markets go\nYeah absolutely and I love I Love the analogy of the car and there's so many so many other analogy that we could pull into this that in in I always say in real life you know outside of the are investing life in our normal everyday life we\nThere's no way we buy a car that didn't go in reverse right but so many times we find ourselves in investments that only have one direction or one avenue where they can profit you know it's it's the same thing you go back to our you know go back to high school education where was your stock picking class where was how to balance a checkbook class right the law to\nCheck it out for it\nI just dated myself victory over there but it is it's true though I mean we we really didn't have that stuff and so we're left to to rely on the quote unquote professional ... guide us through this process where unfortunately they make a commission off of these transactions and I say unfortunately kind of tongue in cheek there because that's okay with me that they make a commission that's\nWhat they do for a living your real estate brokers make a commission when they sell real estate so stockbrokers should naturally make a commission when they sell stocks\nBut when we buy a home it is up to is up to the individual to make sure they're buying the right home for them in the right market place in the right area that the right payment the right everything it's up to the person to do it\nThe broker just completes the transaction and unfortunately it's up to the person to also make sure that they're making the appropriate decision when it comes to their investing but when it really boils down to about Ninety nine percent of the world\nHasn't ... they they spend more time analyzing the menu when they go out to dinner than they do analyzing what investments to to select\nIt it just puts his behind the eight ball and it's something that I think if we did a quick give away with a few more of these passes we could probably make a dent in and help people start making better investment decision I think is a great idea let's do it All right well right now I've got a half the class coming up in your area\nThey have to take classes

development and ... structure it on line three and a heavy really shuts of life on this turns the market is one of my favorite topics low talking about consistency\nIn the market so many times I'll I'll run into different traders different investors and they've had some success they've had some success in the market but they really had a hard time duplicating it and that ends up being the key really in anything that we do is how can we make money consistently how can we make money\nOver and over and the financial markets are no different it's all about that consistent approach\nBeing able to make money as the markets are going up being able to make money as the markets are going down and also being able to make money as the markets are going sideways we need to be generating income whether it's income for today or income for tomorrow in this segment we're going to spend a little bit more time talking about the income side of things but whether you're just tuning in\nMaybe your first time listening or maybe you've been with us for the whole show get excited the best is yet to come and learn a lot of our listeners like we're talking about are are are looking to replace their income with trading investing some are looking to upgrade their lifestyles with a little additional income\nAnd and you could even call it maybe that's that supplemental side that you were talking about a few minutes ago and and some are looking for this to go kind of beyond that supplemental it'd be their primary source of income\nAnd I've even heard people say that they're number one goal is to be able to fire their boss now now whether they're going to or not you know being in that position where you can make that call you know that starts to be that primary source of income but what are some of the key things that you guys worked with students\nWho are looking to supplement or they're looking to even build this is a primary source of income that's a great\nRight you know what I find with a lot of our students they first come into the academy thinking they want to make a lot of money when reality what they're looking for is freedom we've been doing this for over Twenty years we have over forty and fifty thousand students now in the academy and what we find over and over again especially coming to this class\nIs that they are really looking for freedom as I'd mentioned that could be they want to leave a job they don't like they want to spend more time with their families\nThey really are looking to kick a vacation make people now are so nervous about going on vacation because they'd lose their jobs if they even took a day or two off shore living in this constant stream of stress right now and what I'm finding is a lot of our students who come in thinking they want to make a lot of money\nIt's really about that freedom and it's funny I got him Adam was one of my students\nAnd he actually did just what you said he wanted to come in here he was miserable at work and he finally got to a point we could trade and acts\nGo into his boss and say I have enough and I had enough think about that to be comfortable enough so if all this did right now is bring you one really profitable trade wouldn't it be worth just coming in and exploring the opportunities here\nAnother student says ... you can find happening at a career and training that's something that I had always wanted to death and so if I die for that had a chemical or start that changed my life\nLearn more visit us on line that free O T a class on Tom that's free OT a class dot com [noise]\nFor the

ABC News [noise]\nYou're listening to how we're trading radio [noise]\nWelcome back you're just shooting in us Larry Jacobs director of instructive element and Tom instructor it online trading shed some light on multiple streams of income we talk a little bit about\nPassive income we talked a little bit about active income and then specifically spent a lot of time on that multiple streams of income side of things in the financial freedom that that can really generated I Love the ... the the conversation about the the average millionaire having five plus streams of income\nAnd you can break that down into different directions but but even the whole conversation we're having a few minutes ago Larry about about building the skill first the skill comes first the income comes later in so many times we want the income\nWe want the income now without the skill right I mean how many times have you talked to a a a surgeon and they said oh you know what I'm going to do a little bit of surgery here I'm In a practice heart surgery so that I can pay for medical school and then develop the skill just doesn't really work that way we've got to have the skill first\nOtherwise that operating table can be a dangerous spot to be laying now unfortunately it ends up being that same ... that same conversation when it comes to our money and I had somebody say oh well this isn't life or death\nBut really when we're talking about our finances it is our financial life or death so we really want to take this\nJust as seriously we work too hard for this money to have it not heading in the right direction on a consistent basis and this retirement money that we want to talk about in this segment is exactly that it's in a situation where we're usually just buying every other friday right just because it's paid and we've been told every other friday we're just supposed to put some money in our retirement accounts\nAnd it will just slowly growing and all that is true in a polish marketing it bearish market which was what you were just touching on his right as we are going to break that kind of detrimental side of things we can continue to buy into assets that are deteriorating\nAnd it's a lot like lighting our retirement accounts on fire or at least a little portion of our paycheck\nWhen we're throwing it into a deteriorating assets oh just a few of the things that we want to want to keep in mind and one of the things I really love to have you Larry shed some light on in here because we do have a lot of our students\nWho are really out there trading they do have their retirement accounts and and when I talk to our students I'm hearing a lot of people say you know number one they either don't have enough money to retire on you know our number to those that do they're not quite sure really how to continue the growth\nAnd to protect the downside right and that's really that point you were getting at before we took the break and so I'd love to give you kind of give you a floor here to take that back over border some of the things you and your instructor team are doing with investors to help make sure they have income for retirement\nAnd the number one mistake that most people make you think you'd do this on their own then they wind up coming back and realizing they need the education so we start talking to our students about is how they can start creating a strategy for success when it comes to the retirement\nRight now you know it's funny when the market started to go down this week a lot of my friends call me and they started going what does this mean they started getting all nervous now one student emailed me and said Larry do you see this is a bad thing in fact\nMost people who know what they're doing they're elated that this is starting to happen most people waiting ten years\nFor another market correction why because statistically the markets always tend to correct about every ten years or so last major when we had was obviously in two thousand eight here we are in two thousand Eighteen so what's now becoming more important than ever\nIs it took people about six years to recover from the last correction\nPeople out there listening if you don't have six years right now or you're planning to retire\nYou don't have anything saved right now you need to figure out how to create a plan to help protect you and a lot of our students come in the door really nervous about I don't have enough money to start well you know what they're doing right it's pretty fascinating they're starting to learn how to trade\nOther asset types like futures in St Louis and they're saving that money from trading and they're starting to fund their retirement accounts so again a lot of people first thing they always say is what I got the mortgage that got the kids' college up on\nTheir retirement always comes last so we start to teach your students read out the gate\nThat if they can come up with a plan they understand most importantly\nWhat you need is because a lot of people the one size fits all does not work when it comes to retirement you can't just do this you first have to figure out what your needs are learn how to manage that need most importantly how to learn some really important risk management and how to protect that money\nAnd then at the end of the day you will have enough to retire on based on what you need not someone else who's telling you what you need\nYou and you're talking about the kind of the cycles with the markets go through the big us in the big downs and we do generally have a crash about every and we call them crashes but we do generally have a nice big drop in the markets about every ten years\nAnd one of the things about that if you go back and look at um how often they're forty fifty sixty percent drops and so kind of that average uh that we can expect is about a fifty percent if you go back into two thousand and eight new kind of measure that yet\nPercent dropped Becky ... about fifty eight percent you go back into their early to thousands fifty say the same thing and so if we come to here we say OK here's here that's kind of what we can expect again that's kind of the new normal but the thing that I went through with my father about uh we uh we had a conversation about this you know back in about two thousand and eight\nOr you know we're talking about drops in the market we're talking about dropping accounts and and one of the things that we're we're kind of walking through was\nIf somebody had a fifty dollar if somebody had a hundred thousand dollar account\nAnd they lost fifty thousand they lost fifty percent will they lost fifty thousand so now they're account value as a fifty thousand that happened in one year and that drop happened I think it was fourteen months total rights that happened in pretty much just a year it went down\nWhen they take the average rate of return on the way up and let's just be very very generous let's say somebody is averaging ten percent on the Web\nThat's ten years just to get back to break even 'cause when you take a hundred and you turn it into fifty\nTo take fifty and turn it into a one hundred requires a one hundred percent return on our money and so one of the conversation we were talking about was how long does it take the average person to really even get back to break even after going through a big catastrophic drop like that\nSo one of the scariest things right now is that people just don't have a plan that don't know what to do they haven't been educated and so unless you're really sitting there thinking about this and say to yourself fool me once shame on you fool me twice shame on me and\nAlbert Einstein had one of the greatest quotes was the definition of insanity is doing the same thing over and over again\nIt's amazing how many people are not willing to spend a little bit of money to get themselves educated to invest in themselves\nInstead of taking this big roller coaster ride and think about uh Ryan going back to two thousand and eight if you knew when to get out of the market and locked in profit\nAnd then in two thousand nine you were sitting in cash it could've been one of the greatest time of your life right now to leave it at three hundred percent increase since two thousand nine yet most people had no money because they lost it all in the correction\nYup absolutely one of the things we can do to help a few people really start to identify where to get in and where to get out where to protect where to grow is get them out to one of the half day classes you ready for a little give away let's do it right now we've got to have to class coming up in your area and a half the class where you can see exactly that how to generate more income how to keep their retirement account growing\nHow do I identify these turning points up down or sideways so you'll know when to buy and you could know when to sell you could\nYou could go back to the old know when to hold them know when to fold 'em type of a conversation will just second you have a chance to win a set of passes or one of these half day classes to get your phone's ready and if you are driving right now is a great time to pull over including ... year passes it's going to be our professional insiders kit that is packed with lessons from some of our top instructors\nThe professional insider kitten makes it so you can get started right now ... we need you to call now and reserved those seats the number is eight eight eight nine nine one\nEight seven to three that's eight nine nine one eight seven to three if you end up being colors nine or Twenty one sorry about that but his up at three O T H class dot com and see if you can scores of passes there\nNow Larry I always I always said everybody when and I tried to say it on the show as much as I can have two dollars or two million dollars adapted classes where you really get to see exactly what it takes to really get that money working for you and you were talking about it earlier as far as having our money working smarter for us and that's just doing the right things with our money\nThat will allow them not only to help themselves maybe their kids their grandkids and again\nWhat I find with our students Ryan is that are not from a certain way or education or background\nThere simply people that are ... and they're passionate about learning something new again I mentioned this earlier\nThe number one mistake than most people make with their money if they think they can do this on their own and then they'll go to the education later well that's the wrong thing to do one creates bad habits and number two they never do go back to the education 'cause they blown up the money they had\nSo what do good students do I talk to them all the time number one\nThey've realized in the twenty first century that they could take a laptop anywhere in this world right now it doesn't matter because as long as they have an Internet connection and their laptops\nThey can trade all over the world in fact we had a student named B or and he's in San Diego and a lot of times are students feel it's too hard they can't do it well not only is beyond done this and his left his job which is exactly what everybody wants to do right we want to quit a job you don't love to do something we do love\nHe's become a excellent trader and he's also now started funding his wife's real estate business\nSo the two of them are doing something together\nSpending more time together spending more time on vacations and family but the important thing here Ryan is it they're loving what they're doing and there's so many people out there and if you're one of those people hopefully you can see how you can benefit from just learning a skill that can give you the freedom that you desire\nYeah absolutely and it's it's kind of interesting as we're as we're sitting here talking about kind of the lifestyle of a traitor I'd just literally received a text message from a dear friend of mine\nAnd it just popped up on my phone and he was actually somebody who got me started in trading he was one of the first people who said this is how you open an account these are the steps that you go through it very very first conversations these just become a lifelong dear friend of mine and and he is a huge ski bum he lives up in Salt lake he just easy travels around it as a great time\nHe just texted me with a picture of snow skis saying hey can you use these the season or should I take him to the ... because if I go to Salt Lake users bum a pair of skis from him rather than the hall in mind around but it it's just there's\nSo much freedom that can come with it and it and it really ends up just pulling down to a couple of basic steps a couple of basic as you were saying changes or actions that need to be taking because I think it's very critical it's very important it's it's very powerful once we do understand\nThat that the poor is just a state of mind right that passing over opportunities repeatedly and it's something that can be really easily changed just by stepping out of our comfort zone right just by stepping out of our comfort zone and doing something different we talk a lot about\nKind of cliche statements on the show here but it's because they're so true and they're so useful and and it goes back to we've always done if we always do what we've done will always get what we got and hey for completely satisfied with where we are then then great let's continue to do what made us so happy and the first place\nBut if we want a little bit more for trying to create a little more income if we're trying to create a little more freedom if we have a specific goal\nThat we're trying to accomplish that we haven't been able to get to\nWe have to make the necessary changes and that's one of the life lessons that my grandfather shared with me my whole life growing up he would hold up his five fingers and I would have to name all of them\nThe first one is no your business the second one is be converted and that converted one as a youngster I honestly didn't understand what it meant and as I got involved with trading and I really started to go kind of soul searching down this is this something that's going to work for me am I going to be able to do this\nThat converted when I started to realize was make the necessary changes the necessary metamorphosis do what's necessary and and and in the beginning and that was the one I always kind of didn't put as much emphasis on when I was like ten eleven twelve even Eighteen Nineteen twenty you know but then as I really started into my my grown up years I started realizing\nI'll be converted that pointer finger of the five to me became\nThe most valuable because if we don't make the necessary changes we're never going to accomplish that kind of outlier goal that were after not one of the things we can do there is to help a few people get started with this as we still got a few tickets we can give away let's change some lives right now we've got a half day class coming up in your area\nThey have to classes where you see exactly where it takes to really take control of the finances really take it's really a retirement account generate more income inside of the market's really live that life drafter and just a second you're gonna have a chance to win a set of passes one of these half day classes to get your phone's writing if you are driving now is a good time to pulled over\nIncluded with your passes is going to be our professional insiders kit now this professional insider kitten makes it so you can get started right now ... century twenty when you get a call now and reserve those seats the number is\nEight eight eight nine nine one eight seven to three that's eight nine nine one eight seven to three if you end up being colors nine or Twenty one sorry about that but his up at three O T H class dot com and see if you can scores of passes there\nNow Larry one of the things that I always like to say and I said earlier on the shows doesn't matter if you have two dollars or two million dollars it's all about getting that money working for you and really getting it to generate\nThat income so you can live the lifestyle you can reach that financial freedom goal that you're after ... what are some of the things are what are some of the other kind of examples I Know you have your bags in bags loads of view of these examples of our students that you've talked to\nThat we're in one place there now and another well the first thing we always understand here is that with trading it's simply a transfer money from people who don't know what they're doing to people who do know what they're doing\nAnd what's really sad as people will get themselves stuck to think about just time right now\nPeople can sit in front of a television for hours versus going out there and learning a skill that can help them and every year and you were coming after the holiday season again we're gonna start seeing all these Jim commercials again right 'cause here comes resolution time and one of the things I hear a students say over and over again is beside wishing having had more time was\nThis is the year I Want to get out of debt and I want to turn my finances around and what's amazing is how many students\nCome in through the classes that we're doing right now and simply imagine what their life would be like if they can learn a skill to help them generate more money\nAnd that's the key it's about doing something taking action and getting out there to change your current situation again if your coach shovel and something that you are really interested in learning how to do there is no limitations here in fact one of my students June\nShe actually came in my class and she said all she wanted to do is play golf and coaster Rica and so she started realizing that by learning how to trade gave her the time to do that I said it's great to send me a postcard and she did and she said she was trading 'cause that's a whole nother piece of it\nPeople go on vacation Ryan right in the raid the vacation they're making money to pay for it and so I asked you or your training before or after college she goes\nBefore of course and I love that of course\nYeah we're talking with a group of students just a little while ago that did a big trip through Europe and I remember him saying\nYou know where we were trading out in Europe and we made as much money out on our trip was we actually spent on the trip and so it's kind of fun to come back from a trip with a with a with a flat balance or even being up after having a great after having a great time\nAnd that's the thing is it doesn't matter where you are you just have to have an Internet connection doesn't matter where you are and it doesn't matter where you're from it doesn't matter what your background is it's all about just proactively identifying good opportunities and that's really what we introduce you to show you exactly what it takes how to do that\nInside of the half the class and we are pretty much at the end of the show but before we end where you say we do another giveaway yeah let's give at least ten more people the opportunity to get some tickets here ah right right now we've got to have to class coming up in your area and a half day classes where you'll see exactly what it takes\nTo really reached that financial freedom generating more income in the markets like I always say if you're why is big

Ryan hopefully\nSome people out there are going to take on things up on this and changed their lives it'd be great if I Would like to say education appreciate possessions appreciate\nIt's been fun with your financial family on the radio airwaves this week we'll be back next week and look for speaking with you again but between now and then mail your trade [noise]\nThe preceding program was provided for entertainment and general information purposes opinions express were those are the present are only we make no promises are guarantees of investment performance online training academy is not a broker dealer certified financial planner or registered investment advisor\nABC\nShow furnished by fast forward ain't getting online trading academy\nHey is it isn't it six nine new three here the national key word and testing nine five eight one\nOr your shot guns thousand dollars\nYes you do when\nMore on the Los Angeles Orange County a\nCumulus station from both parties are demanding from action in response to the disappearance of Saudi critic and Washington Post journalist ... and the law allows Congress to block major foreign arms sales which many are considering following\nUp because the officer literally was faced with an contradicted evidence showing that he could not have been lunging so there's a situation where you have an inherent impossibility factual impossibility as to what the officer said more his reasons\nFor killing a man versus what actually occurred no have you seen that play out in your career before\nOh absolutely um we've seen that play out at you and I and a number of our cases but when it comes to mind was the shooting of Nicholas Robert send to who was killed in Linwood back in I Believe it was December of two thousand Thirteen mhm\nMr Roberts and he'd he'd discharge to fire him into the air and in Linwood neighborhood several times again midlife Mr McDonnell hadn't hurt anybody but definitely doing something a little bit more dangerous than I Am done um he had fired it and that's not a safe thing for anybody to be doing especially in a residential area but by the time the Los Angeles county sheriff's\nI haven't arrived at the location where he was they saw him he wasn't threatening anybody he was holding a gun down by his side he didn't pointed at anybody he didn't pointed at the police and he would walk across the street to a gas station and then they would open fire a in that case as in the McDonald's case um there was a both officers empty their firearms\nAnd the rabbits in case one of them actually reloaded and shoot it additional rounds so\nBack to me no yeah okay and the entire shooting of Mr Roberts and was also captured on video and it did show a number of shots being fired\nAt Mr Roberts backside as he was walking and then crawling\nAway from the officers towards a gas station\nSo back to the look on the whole verdict it appears as though there is a common denominator in these cases that we've been discussing that being video now specifically when I started back in Nineteen Ninety three videotaped depiction of any type of officer involved use of force was extremely rare the first time I ever really seen it happen with Rodney King\nAnd of course that definitely divided the nation to put it very mildly no doubt it was the first time anyone had seen anything like that you\nKnow these types of situations are becoming much more common place obviously these handheld devices that we all carry are capable of capturing video very quickly and not only that the surveillance cameras\nYou talked about the Roberts in case where we've had some absolutely pristine video from the article gas station where it occurred and then fast forward to ... the video is it coming from a body camera the desk hammer what does it come from\nIt was a dash cam I Believe that actually the vehicle that was carrying the officers who were bringing the taser to the scene that's my understanding\nOkay so fast forward to obviously we couldn't get in the minds of these jurors but we have never seen a second degree murder conviction in a criminal case after a criminal prosecution wasn't issued ever that just has not happened before\nNot in our careers and it's very rare generally in the nation\nYes and we're going to talk about some of the reasons why that's rare but let's get back to this verdict you had very unique components your\nNumber one and again I I kind of research this because we are going to talk about race a little bit later on this wasn't an all black jury in fact my understanding is there was only one African American on the ... we had a predominantly white shirt and one of the misconceptions that I really want to tackle is the concept of\nRacial divisions changing the way people will see the evidence it may affect it on certain levels but what we saw in this case is that right is right and wrong is wrong if you have a bunch of individuals who are just picked out of nowhere\nAnd they're in a room together and they say okay we're looking at this and that is only points one way\nIt doesn't always matter what the racial identity of the members of the jury is and that's very significant but what's more important is in addition to the second degree murder fight we had sixteen counts of aggravated battery with a firearm tell us why why sixteen house\nSixteen counts of battery represented one count of battery for each bullet that officer Van Dyke find\nSo sixteen bullets fired sixteen canceled batter sixteen ... better each which contains in a separate term that could be imposed when it comes to the sentencing phase of this and I believe it's three to six years for each count and that could run consecutively ... what do you think ... what is the significance of that deal\nI think the significance of it is a number one it's so rare to see this kind of a prosecution yes her at all ... and number two for it to to results are in these convictions is even rarer and\nYou know I think one of the key pieces of evidence that must have considered especially in light of the testimony that they heard from the officers what's that video which was the best evidence they had what actually occurred and it was objective it was neutral and it showed everything they needed to see add to reach this result\nBut on a deeper level something shifted and that's one of the reasons why we have to talk about this because essentially we can talk about the evidence we can talk about the video we can talk about ... we talked about costs fusion\nSomewhere along the line these people said we're tired of this this is not going to be business as usual for this type of situation we have had enough and we're actually going to make a statement with a verdict that we hope resonates than it did so when we come back\nWe're going to talk about these situations and how they play out in everyday cases and why we are starting to see the tide change\nA with regard to this particular concept thank you for tuning and we are to be see talk radio seven Ninety or listening to a nation divided with civil rights lawyer extraordinary making John just and myself

nation divided where we explore issues that are\nComing between the cultural fabric of our nation\nWith an eye towards how we can tear down the walls that separate us\nSpecifically now we're talking about one of the most cutting edge issues and that is the concept of a criminal prosecution\nInvolving law enforcement officer I represent over two hundred victims of issues are cases involving issues related to excessive force most of the wrongful death cases and when I'm In the living room with the family has lost a loved one they always ask the same question it doesn't matter where it happens it doesn't matter the cultural identity in the family they\nAlways ask that same question and that is will there be a criminal prosecution what can we do to ensure that it'd be a gets involved and all too often I have to tell them that don't get your hopes up for that in fact it's probably not going to happen because we just haven't seen it happen and most of the time the d._a. simply will neglect\nTo prosecute these cases and there's several reasons for that we're going to talk about the political reasons on the one hand but on another half has been very difficult to get jurors just that the average individuals that sign up for jury duty to come back was guilty verdicts no matter what\nThe circumstances are and even that we have videos we've seen this happen twenty something years ago in the in the seamy valley in a situation with Rodney King but we've seen that happened in other ways tell us about\nWhat really happened uh with Walter Scott\nScott was a fifty year old man he was fatally shot by a North Charleston police officer named Michael Slager back in April of two thousand Fifteen over three years ago now\nAnd that case was one in which we had very clear video of Mr Scott being shot and what happened in that case was officer Slager and pulled Mr Scott over for driving during the daylight hours with a broken brake light that just got stopped the vehicle but then he fled from the car when officers\nApproached it and during the foot pursuit there was a physical altercation of some sort of between officer Slager and Mr Scott captured on video or that I Do not believe was if it was it was so discombobulated that you could not really tell what was going on okay but the taser was taken out by officers later and\nOfficer Slager has said he tastes Mr Scott during this altercation after the ... damage just got continued to flee an officer Slager would fire eight shots of him shooting him in the back\nNext year and all of that was absolutely captured on video camera\nAnd what was the video does it come from the officers dashcam body camera was a I think it was a civilian a cell phone\nAnd if you or your child is struggling with acne Earl Daphne scars

talk radio some Ninety or listening to a nation divided when we discuss cutting edge issues that are dividing our nation and hope that we can tear them down or we're blessed to have a one of the great practitioners of civil rights litigation and are from President with us ah\nAnd thanks again for being here making John just thanks to them so we are going to talk about some of these issues just the concept of a district attorney bringing a case against the law enforcement officer is fought with a lot of political turmoil you know why that is a ...\nWell I think ... part of it is because we have official they're elected he sees ramifications and for their careers that you know it's something that they have to really address when they decide if they're going to bring this kind of action\nAnd specifically what ms Yon does is talking about is we have\nThe the district attorney's office which represents the people of the state of the of the county\nOr for whatever county their elected they have to work with law enforcement officers to get anything done\nAnd the da's office is a political position every politician wants first and foremost to get reelected and the concept of a da ... with law enforcement uh or the police union or a ... in whatever county had maybe the fraternal Brotherhood of this or the Brotherhood of whatever it is that that is that the police union\nVery strong political organizations and they are completely content with the way that things have been for the last several decades which is the police just are completely immune from prosecution uh the rationale as simple as we have a very tough job were out there risking their lives every day\nOr even if we make a mistake the remedy should be paying money to the family but we should never be held accountable uh with the threat of possible jail time\nThat's just something that shouldn't happen to us so if you as a district attorney make the decision to prosecute us we're going to make life hard for you but you're going to have a hard time getting re elected and not only that we might even do some other things were going to talk about that in the ... well before we go further there was a case that happened just locally it happened in Venice, California not far from where our studio is\nThis is the shooting of a of a homeless individual young man by the name of a friend and go in a believe he was African American shot by an African American or officer or by the name of Clifford Proctor\nBut one of the things that makes this case so unique is that the chief of police none of this event happened it happened back in two thousand of sixteen the chief of police who was then Charlie back\nSaw what happened saw the video and said I Can't live with this this is wrong\nI don't care that he's one of my officers the chief of police for the city of Los Angeles\nCame out publicly and said for everyone to hear this officer needs to be prosecuted I absolutely cannot stand by I Know it's not something that happens\nIn fact we only found one other case in LA county where it happened in the last twenty five years as specifically we're talking about a law enforcement officer\nNot selling drugs are doing some rampart thing prosecuted for a used excessive force while on duty charges that comes back and he says it and I was thinking wow I've never heard that before you and me both yes\nBut Mr Rogers was there a prosecution\nThere was no prosecution and the shooting of Mr Glenn now\nSo you got to ask why and we haven't been looking at these cases again as young as we've been looking at and we've done doesn't double anytime there's a shooting that result in death\nThere's a unit within the district attorney's office called the Public Integrity division\nAnd that will essentially make a decision as to whether that would be a criminal prosecution or not and it's a foregone conclusion that there's not I mean it's just always what region are you going to use and not to prosecute and we've seen those reports there are so similar that the same boilerplate language is used in every one\nIn fact the exact same font is used every single one of these reports if you've seen one you would have seen them all and they\nThey are usually what about eight nine pages maybe seven eight pages\nBut even then there's just a short discussion on the facts but the rest is just spam you know Jackie Lacey gave us an eighty three page report it was eighty three pages I mean that's the only thing that'll make your printer clogged up I think the space to it was eighty three as to why in this particular case with regard to the shootings\nOf Mr Brennan Glenn but there wouldn't be a criminal prosecution no I don't know it looks like someone wants to justify going against the chief of police and then even in that report she said she was the chief of police wouldn't come forward because it you know they don't want that type of scrutiny obviously\nBut even under the circumstances in which the chief of police said I Can't tolerate this would be a win prosecute bell for those of you who don't know and you can see the video on line the shooting and Britain Glenn happened\nA a scuffle that was captured on camera from one of the nearby establishment ... it was it was ... captured on video the officer obviously you know he was on video\nMr Glenn is lying on the ground and it's close to the ground he's trying to get up he was being restrained by two officers I Believe one of ... off to call her own one officer\nClifford Proctor had a kind of break free and you see officer Proctor who was African American as I said the bucks up any shoots into the person of Mr ... and he's a good five ten feet away from me just step back and shoots\nAnd issues of police report that literally says the guy's grabbing his gun he's running you know we've been hearing about this just impossible\nThis is kind of thing that's been going on for years is that these a fence civil justifications are are allowed to pass and they go over as all because there is no video and let's face it who is going to accept the word of a person charged with a crime over the word of a law enforcement officer\nIt's just not going to happen so why would they do have and get involved but here the da Vinci even attempt a prosecution other several degrees of murder you don't have to charge a first degree murder second degree murder you can charge was voluntary manslaughter which is the equivalent of the heat of passion\nYou're afraid you catch your significant other was another man you go crazy someone into getting killed that would be called the heat of passion but then you have an involuntary manslaughter which was I didn't even mean to do it I was driving drunk or whatever I don't even mean\nTissue dispersed so\nNone of those charges were even considered in this case despite the fact that the chief of police called for it\nAnd it's obviously were not born yesterday it has to be because of the political reality of what would face district attorney Jack ... she if she decided to move forward with this prosecution she's going to make someone upset\nAnd she's got the community on one hand and then she's got the police union on the other hand and she obviously chose her side based on what she wants her political future to be I'm not saying it's right or wrong but our listeners need to understand what happened so tell us about what happened in Baltimore\nBaltimore and another case one of the high profile ones that we saw coming out I'm Around the year two thousand Fifteen to thousands sixteen or Baltimore or the Baltimore case was Freddie Gray\nA Freddie Gray was uh twenty five year old individual who died in police custody um well he was arrested and taken into custody and died afterwards ... by Baltimore police officers is April two thousand Fifteen several officers who would eventually be charged um\nYou know ... they were out on patrol for Mr Gray fled from then there's no indication that they had any fishing he'd committed a crime with any sort at that point in time a after a brief case they did apprehend him and took him into custody they stated that they'd found a a knife that would have been illegal under Baltimore's ordinances clip to his pocket\nAnd that was going to be the charge they brought him in on\nA Mr Gray with placed into the back of a police van and approximately thirty minutes after he was placed into the back of that van paramedics recalled because he had fallen into a coma\nI was taken to the hospital it was determined that he suffered a spinal cord injury which later resulted in his death\nAnd and there was you know I mean outrage\nAt all for those of you who do not necessarily understand the physics of what happens to the human body to suffer a fatal spinal cord injury\nWould require a level of trauma so profound that it would be something that could not be explained from a fall unless you fell off a building anyway keep going\nPending so she deals with civil litigation possible stayed more complaints than all of these issues a better be direct result of her decision not to play ball and her decision to actually push this prosecution so if we were going to get into a crystal ball do you agree with her decision rags\nI think so I think uh you know I think\nIt's I think it's difficult a difficult decision for any prosecuted make obviously for the ... the things that we've been talking about earlier the political consequences to me with professional consequences of his work with law enforcement every single day and so you know that a lot of people would accuse mostly of of seating to political pressure to the protests that were raging through Baltimore at the time and\nYou know I think that I think she did a good thing and coming out and bringing charges for what she saw as being a criminal act you know David what's not to be forgotten about Freddie Gray is that his death was ruled a homicide\nHomicide by the by the coroner's office that his desk at the hands of another yes so when we talk about the political pressure and I'm Glad you brought that up next because we've been doing this for a long time and uh just just to go back a little bit when I started up from Nineteen Ninety three I was at the impression that\nThis is something that happened almost exclusively to men of color I was thinking of having a black man and letting them and and I kind of came into the profession thinking that that was what happened\nAnd that's a lot of what is motivating so much of these protests but having been doing this work on a very intense level for now twenty four years I have seen so many white men\nGet massacred so recently I have been in the living rooms of so many white families whose lives have been destroyed by police homicide I have seen the cheers of of so many white mothers that have lost their children that this is from my own\nIt has been characterized as something that is against a man of color but if you really big and look at it\nAnd you look at statistics every statistic that I have ever seen\nThat has compiled the numbers of officer involved shooting white men are killed more than twice there's more than twice the number of white men that are killed anyway by law enforcement and it's just a nobody really talks about it or if you're actually in the trenches doing work\nYou'll find out about it but the reality is this is an American problem but it's not necessarily a black problem or you know from or something that is is unduly focus now if you really want to look at the statistics\nAnd if you want to do the math you will see that based on the population density there is a greater percentage of the overall hole of African Americans that are killed as opposed to white simply because of the population numbers but we've seen a just in terms of the cases we worked on just incredibly vicious killings\nA white man that they just don't get talked about by law enforcement because it's just thought to be on something that affects blacks are you actually came across a high profile case I\nWon't date actually yeah my home state Arizona hum as we were up\nOne why don't you talk to us about this and it resulted in criminal prosecution wrapped\nIt in ... which unfortunately resulted in an acquittal you know this is Daniel Shaver shooting at us happened in Mesa, Arizona I which is a a you know at a community that's that's older generally in terms of population\nAnd Daniel Shaver I Believe he was from Texas He was passing through town he worked in pest control and he was in ... in in the Mesa area and he was having a good time you know he was he was doing some shots with a lady friend and he'd been showing off his pellets rifle that he used his pest control work and um you know somebody\nCoalition showing off a poet rifle with his girl from what the information", "show_name": "The Drive Home With Jillian
