I mean yeah there's no doubt you\nCan't calling yeah she she was on the you know when we did the Tempe in Prague she would get mad\nBecause they wouldn't allow her to drink a bottle of vodka you know before she went on like they wouldn't allow her her ... year really pissed off but you can also where John ... going back to the first time I met Chelsea I was on a plate in Chelsea with a nobody I was up to you know do the announcers for the Tonight Show to prove I could do it without stuttering right\nAnd there is Chelsea and I ... and she's like I didn't know she was she was like you know what was that I go on us as adults I said you know I don't I don't like flying cars give me one please [noise] I go sure and then she took it loved it so I think I'm going to\nPossibly I found settled for her alcoholism and drug addicts [laughter] we're talking to ...

I've lost track of it and ... we're up to probably close to two hundred teams right now\nUh my nephew in a when a pig of spirit that along with like ... like all yup and another woman who [noise] for the program from a coach in British Columbia and uh\nShe has her own merits and I'm Still a challenge as an outlet for her but she has three kids who play hockey and she has taken this to a huge number of change\nYou know you had one leader you had one little guy here uh last week when he played\nHockey between periods of the LA kings New York islanders game Hudson almost six years old and he had the green tape on his stick in fact we can put it up on the Web site um he skated around the staples center in front of Eighteen thousand people with the green tape and he knew exactly why you know he loves you and and your family and you and your boys\nAnd he made sure that he was representing or the people here in LA with green tape on a stick\n'em you know it hits home with so many hockey players football players basketball players baseball players and people who are not playing sports just to be able to connect with each other about mental challenges a depression um emotional issues I Know carry\nIt something that's been important to you in your life and you don't play hockey but if you did I'm sure you'd have green tape on your stick I mean we\nDefinitely have green tape on my stack and definitely mental health has been a huge important tonight that only for me I'm being misdiagnosis certain things um\nBut also what I deal with in in my everyday life for the elderly and the medication and that in the it's just I see it every day and what I Do and something needs to be done about it more awareness needs to be created and white and dealing is amazing kids need to be kinder to one another\nAnd that needs to be taught in schools do not see that\nThe that the it's when you had specially something that you can't as a kid like I remember I was always tend to therapists and always had like I don't know where it was raging this anger I don't know whether this is coming from I couldn't control it\nAnd I know I the worst thing in the world is going to school I Would cry every day because I was teased and bullied and it was the worst thing you\nKnow oil from the fact that you're opening up about that right now is just so important and that's what something like this will do still have you found out that people like carry talking about her challenges others now you you were\nYou know the emails from people people you've ... you've been coaching hockey almost your entire adult life um you've gotten some special emails from people notes from people kids you've coached talking about this have any\nI've ... I've received an enormous number of emails and text and testimonials and whatever you call them are from parents from kids I've coached before some kids who I don't even know from parents so I don't even know I'm from coaches uh\nUh people want to talk about this um [noise] and it it's it's I mean like charities discussing it doesn't spare anybody um it and\nThe idea behind all of this is to try and target you Tim Young adults and maybe in a unique way a plant a seed at a younger age that that will carry them to to adulthood and maybe it\nHelps help somebody and you know these many of these things are treatable\nA that's a very very important ... many mental health issues are treatable and if we can just do stigmatizing [noise] and and started at a young age or just to get just to just to get the message message there somehow maybe we can save some lives are approved the quality of lives of people\nAnd you know there's the offshoot of this as I've had many parents tell me that uh uh\nIt's open their eyes and make parents care about their children they love their children are met as parents we often can have blinders on a butter on children and\nAnd it's just they they people parents want resources they want to be able to talk about this they want help ah and what's interesting is Terrance I've had many parents told me just as I Can't believe how many parents who told me so far the part of the uniqueness of this program they say\nWell my kid listen some won't listen to me what was my teacher but this was the coach yeah yeah 'cause that very thing tells you that there will be important rule of responsibility that the coaches have and they need to realize that well I think coaches realize their own rule\nI think this helps and we only have a couple of minutes so I Want to make sure that we get the information out I'm so talk about you have a Facebook page or tell us where people can go I you provide green tape you can send posters to coaches wallet cards notes you have a number of sponsors who are helping with the initiative\nHow can people get involved because I'd love to see this\nReally catch fire in this country in the United states and make a lot of people playing hockey a lot of people playing baseball basketball and you know when when people when this is so meaningful how can we get this message out to help everyone who needs some body\nThere somebody in Canada I have to mention a man named Tony staffing Anthony staffing whose son committed suicide is life died and they were on medications and he created a company called true help\nAnd it is something that I think you know everybody should take a look at if they're dealing with this and that family he really helps people and helps families and that is based in Canada K stoop so he told a fan of\nThe ... the website is a buddy a check for Jessie Jessie J E S S.

can prove it out to be far less risky\nA down market with how margin and different things work but at the same time anything that we don't understand where usually afraid of and isn't it just mainly fear that holds people back from accomplishing their goal so absolutely you know when in fact\nI'll share a story I share with my students Jim the other day it was funny we were talking about this whole concept the fear of leaving a job and the worst thing\nThat ever happens to any of us especially if you're listening is it all of a sudden you start working for someone else and then your net worth is tied up and to what other people define it to be let me explain what I'm Talking about Ryan so yeah I remember the old story of the frog and the frog can jump as high as it possibly wants to\nBut if he would've frog in a box and you put a lid on top of that box and all of a sudden the fraud charge a couple of times to jump\nBut hits the lead even when you take the little way the frog still will not jump higher than it could be for and that's kind of most of us out there we start getting into these routes we're relying on a paycheck for somebody else we start to believe we can't make any more money and what's great what Jim is ... and a lot of other students\nAnd we've been doing this for over Twenty years right now is that feeling of when you first start making more money than you do at work because then all of the sunnier this frog again you can jump very very high and all of a sudden that cap\nThat you've been believing your whole life has gone away and that's the sad part right now 'cause most people out there are stressed out that they have to stand a job they have no other outcome or vehicle\nWhen reality you can go ahead and you can short the markets so great analogy like when I use is each week and I like using it as well I've said this over and over again when you're learning how to short the market meaning you're able to trade when the market goes down\nVery legal coach ... and the great part about it is I think of yourself in a car right now and you know you want to go somewhere but if the ... only one and drive and never went in reverse\nYou can eventually get there it's not going to be cost efficient for gas or time but you'll eventually get there where why would you want to do that people do that everyday Ryan what they're trading they're only looking in the markets to go higher\nAnd as you said when the markets go lower it could be an opportunity to buy at a discount it doesn't always mean there's a problem with the stock\nYeah absolutely right there there's opportunities all over the place and and I love what you're talking about what the frog because\n'cause it it you know I was teaching a class last night and I have another session with with the same group tonight and you know I was talking about how a lot of the the the obstacles that we have to overcome our mental right and and what you're talking about the frog hitting it's had on the boxing you move the box and all of a sudden they can jump up\nIs that it it is that feeling that we're putting on ourselves right and we we have the whole oh ... I Can't do that type of a conversation I have a five year old son who who over and over the the words I Can't or or just not even really allowed in our house because we do start to put\nThose uh we do start to put those binders on us and and make it so that we were like oh if I jump high it's gonna it's gonna hurt my head it's we stop even trying you know a while ago they are you know ... years and years ago they said it was physically impossible to run a four minute mile a vis the about a week ago there was a world championships for Iron Man and Kona\nAnd the the winter and about a six minute mile for twenty six miles after doing a hundred mile bike ride wow if you can't run a four minute mile you're you're not even on Olympic on Olympic track and field team anymore at least one for a minute mile not not to mention back to back to backs right\nSo so so these these these these restraints that we put on ourselves we also put on our finances and we ended up kind of\nPainting that our own picture that we ended up residing in it and if you're if you're willing to kind of challenge the norm and you're willing to put in a little more effort\nOr a lot can be granted to you and it really just does come from getting started and putting a little bit more effort in but we could help a few more people get started\nWe've got a stack of tickets here the show is just beginning what you say we do need to give away let's do it right now I've got to have their class coming up in your area and they have to classes where you see exactly what it takes to really generate that consistent income in the market whether the market's going up down or sideways\nNow in just a second you're gonna have a chance to win a set of passes the one of these classes and so if you're driving now is a good time to pull over and get that phone ready included with your passes who's going to be a professional insiders kit that is packed with lessons from some are top instructors now the professional insiders kid is critical because it makes it so you can get started\nNow ... century twenty when he did a call now and reserved those seats the number is eight eight eight nine nine one\nEight seven to three that's eight nine nine one eight seven to three if you end up being colors nine or Twenty one sorry about that but his up at free O T H class dot com and see if you can scores and passes there\nWe're up against the clock Larry when you have a force next\nYou know a lot of the students he's asking us all the time half I'm looking to make more income does that mean I have to get more jobs and the answer is absolutely no let's talk about that [noise] multiple streams of income on the other side of the breaking ...

the show [noise]\nWe'll come back if you're just tuning in humans Larry Jacobs director restructure development happens structure it online trading ketamine shed some light on consistency in the markets were talking about generating more money we're talking about generating more income\nWhether the market's going up down or sideways we're talking about how much the market dropped a little bit ago you know it's been about a week or so since we had the big drop in the markets\nBut when you look at those opportunities they are they are that they are opportunities to generate any given generate more income and essentially give yourself a raise and it really is important to remember that\nThe more that money has made on the way down just like the money has made on the way up and so really we wiped out number one we wiped out three months worth of games on this last market drop\nIf we didn't know how to make money as the markets were falling if you do know how to make money as the marks were going down if you have that skill you're able to generate as much money in a week as over the last three months combined and so it ends up being these great opportunities as one of the reasons why\nWhenever we have a market crashed there is a new wave of billionaires that come out of it yes billion with a B right billion with a B come out of it and a lot of times they are looked at as a\nA a not so that they are looked at with not such a pleasant light we could say because when they made all that money a lot of people were losing money no a lot of people were losing money and there and those are individuals though who look at a down market as a bad thing\nNow these individuals that were turning themselves in for millionaires and billionaires\nThey were looking at a down market as an opportunity they had that skill set they had that knowledge they knew how to approach that down market\nSo to think about a job if you had a job where you got laid off one third of the time that wouldn't be a very consistent stream of income but a lot of times with the Bush biased with only making money as the markets are going up that's\nKind of the situation our incoming our retirement accounts or in if we are reliant on just one simple direction the markets go up down or sideways and if we only make money when the market goes up well there's two thirds of the time two thirds of the direction where where especially laid off or we're not allowed to go to work and so that's one of the reasons why\nIt's very difficult to follow kind of that classic just simple bullish biased and have consistent growth you look over the last nine ten years we've had this great bullish move\nBut how much opportunity has been lost on those down opportunities how much opportunity was given back in two thousand eight when the market crashed and if we don't have that skill set going forward this could be the beginning of this next big downturn\nWhere we could give back fifty or sixty percent of our retirement account how 'bout instead of that and instead of going through that process again how about we understand how to make money at the market going down we started showing up on this stuff\nAbsolutely you know it's funny because one of the things that most people don't understand they tried trading on their own and they make mistakes all the time\nAnd here's why the number one mistake most people making their lives when it comes to trading if they want to try it on their own first and then maybe get some education a little bit later on well here's the problem that most people don't understand five percent of the wealth right now\nI was being shared by Ninety five percent of the population were Ninety five percent of the wealth is shared by five percent of the people so that means there was five percent of us who have understood the right way to trade how to make money and what's really scary right now and I talked to a lot of students as I ask them a simple question\nDo you work for more money or just money work for you and most people are working for more money they always believe that they're going to get ahead if they're going to find their freedom and let's face it people who start trading are people looking for multiple streams of income and most millionaires we discuss this right have a an average five income streams\nTalking a little bit about passive income we're talking about active and can we are talking about making money out of money not time is money money is money right and having our money working harder for us the average millionaire and we we were there and I both flip through this article a little while ago and there there was a report on how the average millionaire has\nFive or more streams of income out there those multiple streams of income\nI really would create that financial freedom that everybody's after right not just that one source and that one source of income when you have that sole source that's why job stance J. O. B. right stands for just over broke because if we're just relying on it we are just over broke because if it goes away we're in a world of hurt well in this segment here we want to spend a little bit of time on retirement accounts\nThe markets have been super volatile right we've had a big ups we've had big downs and so what can we do to protect those retirement accounts and whether\nYou're just tuning in maybe your first time listening or maybe been with us for the whole show get excited\nThe best is yet to come and Larry whenever I'm Talking with a lot of our listeners sometimes it via social media and a lot of them when it comes to retirement accounts are saying number one they're saying they don't have enough money to retire and those that do have enough money to retire\nOr just not quite sure really what they should be doing with it so it's kind of the consolidated message that you can or individual messages whichever direction you'd like to take it\nThat that you and your instructor team early giving to those people who are concerned about their retirement accounts especially with the with the big drop we had in the market the other day well the simple thing I Would share with our\nAudiences the cavalry ain't come and there's nobody here it's going to protect your capital better than you can right now and the way to do that with education I mean right now statistically about every ten years the market has corrected we saw fifty percent correction in two thousand uh fifty eight percent correction in two thousand eight\nWho's to say we might not see a sixty four sixty seven percent correction in the market and matching your four one K. becoming a one oh one K. and the reason for this this this is the first generation right now that it's been subjected to market fluctuations in your retirement accounts\nThink about it prior you had pensions that was completely outside of the market you're basically boss put aside their profits or payroll to make sure you had a retirement account and right now that's gone away you're completely dependent upon your four one K. and here's a scary\nThought Ryan you know I've talked about this all the time\nRight now people have been told and I've been doing this pretty\nPretty habitually of putting money into their retirement account every two weeks when they get paid but here's the big problem and I want everyone to listen to this 'cause it's kind of scary right now is that you've been putting money into this market the last three years at an all time highs\nNot when the market was low so imagine when there's another correction the first money that's going to come out is the most expensive amount of money that you've been saving towards retirement\nA lot of our students come in they want to learn the right way to be able to preserve capital how to make sure they're in the right funds when they're putting on their traits to be able to maximize for their retirement and well a lot of things that we hear right now is can you see or do you see how this can really help you pretty much preserve capital over the long term\nYeah it's always buy low so high it has been for a thousand years it will be for another thousand years that that has never changed and that was one of the topics are ahead of my class last night as as the markets don't change the marsh don't change we look at it on a phone\nInstead of looking at it on a on a on a ticker tape\nThat getting printed off right but the market still don't change it's all about by low and it's all about so high and somewhere along the lines\nWe kind of got distracted from that and I think the average investor is out there investing their money on payday and they plan to sell when they're sixty five and none of that has anything to do with price and so if we're not buying it a low price and we're not selling at a high price it's pretty much impossible forced to make any money now one of the fun things about the markets whether it's your retirement account or whether it's your income account\nIt's it's the same right it's it's all about just identifying a low price and buying and identify a high price and selling\nNow we get kind of caught up in this whole emotional back and forth of maybe stocks that we love her or or\nThings that we want to be invested in rather than being invested in the right things and and uh there's this guy Dan that uh when it first started trading I I I did a lot of work with Dan he was a a great friend ... you know acted as a mentor and many different kinds of aspects\nAnd Dan used to always say you can't live your stocks they're never going to have you back and he would talk about and he had a little story to help you remember it I Want to share it out there but it was just kind of funny ... you'd say you can't live or stocks they're not going to have you back\nAnd think about it if you're invested into a company right now it doesn't matter what it is if you called them up they wouldn't even know who you are right but for some reason we fall in love with potentially invest the end of this company who number one doesn't know who we are number two doesn't care about us they don't care about us at all and then honestly why would they write\nAnd Larry you're talking about you know taking care of our retirement accounts and how nobody's going to take better care of it than we are and and it's it is true and the reason that I firmly believe that is because nobody has to live off of our accounts except for us right nobody has to live off of your account except for you\nNobody has to live off of Mike accept for me and so in the end it's kind of courses that can sound\nNobody cares right there's there's not an institution out there that they that they stay up at night going man I Hope I Hope John and Mary have enough money in their retirement account\nYou know what they say that because they want to make sure they have enough fees being paid to them as long as their money's into retirement account but every day there's a new twenty two year old that opens a retirement account replaces somebody who's closing their retirement and they have this perpetual\nKind of ... income stream that comes from that anyway so at the same time though we stay up at night right the average person has many sleepless nights over money\nBut how much time as the average person spent getting educated on how to make sure their money is growing right I I find the financial markets very interesting because we go to a car dealership and there's a car salesman there and we really don't take his advice on what we should buy but yet we go to a car dealership\nThat has the uh financial institutions name on the front of it where they're selling mutual funds and we take the cells persons advice to heart we go well he's the professional and the situation\nNow with a lack of education that's kind of where we end up uh falling behind the eight ball in the financial world one of the things that we can do is we can help a few more people out with that because we still got some tickets we can give away let's do it\nRight now we've got to have to a class coming up in your area that the costs of where you see exactly what it takes to really take control those retirement accounts and have them growing generating more income whether the markets are going up down or sideways\nNow included with your half the class including with your past is going to be a professional insiders kit now this is packed with lessons from some of our top instructors the professional insiders kitten makes it so you can get started right now\nBecause tender twenty when he did a call now and reserved those seats the number is eight eight eight nine nine one eight seven\nStreet that's eight nine nine one eight seven to three if you end up being colors nine or Twenty one sorry about that hit us up at free O T H class dot com and see if you can score some passes there\nNow Larry still kind of on this retirement check I Know there are a lot of people concerned about growing their retirement how can somebody number one protect against this potential downside\nBut also inside of their retirement account is there a way for them to continue growth as the markets are going down\nAbsolutely a little a lot of our students have figured out they can use other type of leverage assets to actually start accumulating wealth well our stock market isn't a downturn so this great ways that students can protect their wealth that can hedge against it they're learning about options\nAnd that's why they can do this three hour session to understand what's possible in the marketplace I can tell you firsthand talking to our students students like myself and you too we've been waiting ten years for this correction think about that most people are dreading a correction we are\nFrantically waiting for it because it could be one of the best years of our lives and people don't understand that again the markets go down there is an opportunity to make money just as the markets go up so imagine learning a skill right now to preserve your capital where you can lock in profits imagine you did that back in two thousand eight\nAnd you had money sitting in cash waiting to buy those bargain basement prices of stocks when they got back to two thousand nine well this is going to happen again it's been happening over and over again\nBut most people continue to do nothing and wait for something that happened like I said again the cavalry ain't come in and the reason why so many people are poor P. O. R.\nIt's because they're passing over opportunities repeatedly so all this did right now by spending three hours of your time is help you learn how to preserve more capital so that you can retire and the lifestyle that you're interested would not be worth it you\nKnow we always look at things in the investing world is restored how what what do I have to risk and what's my potential reward\nWell your investment in this case is going to be about three hours worth of time or half day classes about three hours long so that's your investment that's your total investment is three hours worth of time so\nSo even if you were to say that's your total risk is three hours worth of time well what's the potential reward what if you ended up generating another source of income what have you ended up adding another couple of points of return to your to your portfolio every year because really your risk is the only time as far as you're investing three hours of your time to come out to this half the class\nBut the rewards are potentially limitless that's a pretty good ratio and imagine\nThat you learned for the first time that you've been in the wrong things in your mutual funds and your four one K. and you can learn how to reallocate to give you that rate of return that you that you really want that's what a lot of students are really excited about\nYou know it goes back to some of those are some of those unquote the way I always like to throw out and here as far as you don't have to be and I'm going to do this one wrong or you take it it's yours ... yeah ... I used to always say you don't have to be great to start but you got to start to be great and unless you do oh you just want to Ryan's as you don't want to spend your golden years at the golden arch absolutely I Love that one\nYou know and and it's all the wherever these fun cliches things that we love to throw around but they've been around forever 'cause they're true right we heard him so many times 'cause they're true no\nNobody ever says well no you you don't have to get started in order to be great you know you do you have to you'd have to be great you have to get started but you don't have to be great in order to get started right it's awesome and\nAnd I love doing uh I get involved with a lot of different races were actually doing a charity race in a in a couple of days\nIs they read a book to go on YouTube and they think they can do this on their own without getting educated or coaching\nWell I can tell you it's amazing that what I Believe here is that the average layman can most of the time is the only profession you can do this\nTrading where the layman can outperform the professional with some coaching and some education\nSo right now a lot of our students are realizing that excuses are kind of dwindling I mean in the twenty first century right now as long as you have a laptop and you have an Internet connection and you have a series of simple steps that's really what we teach is a simplified trading system of step by step investment strategy\nTo help define the way that people make money on Wall street there's no excuse not to and Sam ... this many times the architect of our core strategy that really what trading is is just the transfer money from people who don't know what they're doing to people who do know what they're doing\nAnd I think that's an important concept to remember because it's not like the money just grows on trees and all of a sudden it shows up in our account right what happens is there's a buyer and seller and there's a transaction that occurs and there's a winner and there's a loser and a lot of times we we forget about that side of the market but the markets are really just a conduit and this is one of the ways I explain it to my classes as\nThe markets are conduit that just hooks us all together that's really all the market places it's a meet up\nWe all go there to hang out and what do we do that well we buy and sell stocks and people who want to sell stocks\nShow up with their stocks and people who want to buy stocks go there to buy stocks it's just like a farmer's market but at the stock market or commodities market but it's just buyers and sellers and money transfers like a farmer's market when I buy tomatoes money transfers transfers from my account into somebody else's account is the same thing in the financial markets and\nLotta times we don't realize that as we're losing somebody else who made the right decision is actually out there making\nYeah and they're also living their lives most of us right now which jobs are stressed out we're worried about losing our job especially with a correction comes again\nMost people are just one paycheck away from poverty and so a lot of our students are figuring this out how do I go from being emotional to becoming strategic and the way they do that is to get the proper education learning how a three hour session can completely change your life and you know why and you know I've talked about this over and over again\nHolidays are coming up it's that time of year again\nEveryone's going to make their resolutions yeah right well that's kind of silly because the resolution is basically your intention to do something in the two biggest ones we hear what I'm going to lose weight this year round them out of ... you know out of out of debt and made our money\nBut the difference here right now is don't just make it a resolution make it a promise to yourself that you're going to figure out a way to get more financially secure\nYeah I remember my grandpa used to say this and I remember hearing somewhere else too but I'm just gonna give him credit for it but he used to always say uh the goal without a plan an executed will plan is this is a dream you know go without a plan is a dream and and that's one of the things that we spend a lot of time on an online training academy is that step by step plan that\nStep by step process on how to accomplish the goal because any and we are we're going to come up to the holidays here pretty quick\nAnd all of a sudden everybody's going to plan out their New Year's resolutions I don't remember all the statistics we went through it back in January on the show but it ended up being something like within four weeks eighty percent of the people have completely given up and I'm not even thought about their New Year's resolution and part of that is there wasn't an executed will plan\nThey didn't know exactly what to do tomorrow\nAnd the only attributed plan right now is the gyms knowing they're going to start running their commercials in\nThere and you know ... and they're going to make a killing thirty bucks a month but at the gym membership skyrocket but at the same time they putting our our best foot forward and giving us an opportunity to reach that financial goal is critical\nThey are as well and we have to do what we have to do what it takes to accomplish the goal we want to lose a little weight we gotta spend a little more time on the treadmill and we want to make a little more money we've got to get those skills and one of the places where we can really start bringing the knowledge that we can work our way up into that skill set is I don't want to have their classes and we've got this tack this stack of tickets is dwindling we must be towards the end of the show but\nWe got a few tickets left would you give away let's do it\nRight now I've got to have to classical up in your area and they have to classes where you'll see exactly what it takes\nTo really live that life that you won't get your money making money and and I always like to see what he got two dollars or two million dollars you'd be able to see exactly what it takes to get that money generating that income that can really sustain that lifestyle that you deserve now include with your passes it's going to be a professional insiders ticket and this is packed

one\nEight seven to three that's eight nine nine one eight seven to three if you end up being colors nine or Twenty one sorry about that but his up at three O T H class dot com and see if you could scores of passes there\nThere were some of the other things you guys are working on right now as far as your instructor team to really help people take control their lifestyle help people do the things they want to do\nTo help them get over procrastination Ryan I mean it's amazing how many people spent so much time watching TV procrastinating\nComing up with the reason why they can't do something and what have you only need it to take maybe a third of the time that you're doing right now he's a procrastinating of watching TV just to learn how to trade and make more money\nSo I asked you to solve the time you ever wondered what your life would be like if you can quit your job or if you could spend more time with your family a lot of our students now are starting to actually make money while they're on vacations I have June\nOne of my students recently and she sent me a postcard from Costa Rica and she said it's great I'm playing golf is has been my dream but I'm also trading on the trip and of course when she came back I asked you trade before after and she went\nBefore of course so she'd get up early in the morning because the one thing about having an education\nAnd being able to trade in any time with an Internet connection that computer is there are several markets to trade it's twenty four hour marketplace right now so the rules have changed and people are finding that they can take back their lives\nAnd actually start doing some of the things they want to do as opposed to working for someone else it which is what is the required to do of themselves\nYou know there was a there was a book I read a little while ago called the world is flat and it talked about a lot of outsourcing in a different kind of business strategies but it talks a lot about technology and how technology has really kind of level are made the playing field\nA very level and it makes ah it makes it difficult on some businesses to be competitive and it makes it easier on other businesses to get going and that's very true inside of the markets because with the with the Internet connections that we have with the data streams that we have\nIt really is this this this marketplace where it doesn't matter what your background is it doesn't matter where you from it doesn't matter even how much money really you're getting started with everybody has access to the same information inside of the markets and so it doesn't matter where we come from it only matters where we going and we stay focused\nKind of on that go hand in that we do everything necessary to accomplish it and that's kind of that great it's that great relief point where you you get to a point in life or you go you know what\nI can do whatever I whatever I Want to do I don't have to go and do this I can go and do that and that's what that financial freedom is\nThat's where your sleeping easy at night and there's really nothing to worry about and a drop in the market is just another opportunity to give yourself a raise now one of the things that we can do to help a few people get into this point to take that first step right getting started as the most critical step is it looks

that matters\nBut they also said with that as well western civilization is the superior civilization\nAnd you must become more like us\nOur culture now I Want to point out that at the time of the sixteenth century\nWestern Europe did not know very much about Confucianism or Chinese civilization they did not know anything about that or do civilization in India or about the Andes civilization sort of out the sub Saharan\nAfrica in Africa civilization so these two\nPoints of view one that ours is the only religion they didn't know anything about Hinduism or anti Semitism in Africa or the religion of the aspects so these two principles that ours is the only religion and our culture is just is these superior culture\nCame out of their own in a sense human illiteracy but also it came out in the sense that as a civilization we somehow have all the required for our civilization and everything else in Europe and\nEverything else they called the other that's a very concrete academic term that's not in public conversation but it is a term that came out of Fifteen sixteenth century Europe the other\nOtherness and by that they meant the ancestors are the Roma\nThey meant the mores who came over in the southern Europe and they meant the people they met around the world so it's that other than this\nNotion in concept that they had that to help to create the foundation for racism the point I Would make is that in many ways\nThe people who called the white nationalist or a Christian fundamentalist Christian nationalist are coming out of a religious stream that was extremely

well yeah about forty years before that they begin to black codes\nThat codified racism and criminalize the slave an ex slave and all people of African descent\nThis is the season of the year where the Ku Klux Klan is organizing the Eighteen sixties and teachers everywhere they went and more organized and they had even a unit to know Los Angeles police department at one time or they taught that\nUm it was only white people who are represented in the creation story of the first chapter of the book of genesis that people of color were not created by that guy\nAnd that were created by a demonic God or an idle God\nSo that was the theology that gave a spiritual and biblical under ... to racism in United States is perhaps no other group in the nation\nI got to stop you briefly there's nothing about race and the Bible there's nothing about white and black people in the ... that's correct how does how how does how do they come to this well\nAnd that is their reading into the Bible their point of view so their point of view is a nationalistic cultural European position of some kind\nIt's not rooted on the scripture themselves it's their cultural religion that is saying that this

ABC News [noise]\n\n\n\nBack once again we are KBC seven Ninety talk radio and you're listening to a nation divided I Am Brian I'm we're blessed to have [noise] comic Reverend James\nLawson or in the studio with us and before we broke you were talking a little bit about the unique definition of Christianity that you adopted\nCan you tell us a little bit about how it was that you came to formally study a divinity and Christianity or in a way that you would ultimately using your career\nWell the Bible was the first book I began to read before I went to school so the Bible has been a favorite book of mine\nRed sections of the Bible this morning as an example is I read for cover to cover which is one of the ways in which I read it\nSo I read the gospels over and over again for myself before I was in high school junior high school I was reading elementary school and out of my encounter with my mother over\nMy use of violence in my fist I discovered in rediscovered\nThe life of Jesus\nAnd I discovered that the life of Jesus was not how formal Christianity seemed to be teaching it [noise] um so that by the time I was in high school as I went to high school or two important things that were very critical to me one was\nAs I went to high school I knew was going to be a pastor\nI was sure of that [noise] and so I'm very lucky I knew that's what I was aiming for but secondly I'd made the decision that um I Would participate in no form of racism\nOr racial prejudice against anybody of any kind shape or form that it was a contradiction to Jesus and therefore I Would see not to be a part of it to the best of my ability\nEarly on in high school I decided that Jesus did not like bigotry I discovered in high school there was prejudice against Jewish students and there was also prejudice among the Protestants against Roman Catholics\nWhat was it about your understanding of the Bible that led you to that conclusion\nFundamentally ... calls for a life of love and compassion and truth there's no way to avoid that\nPeople don't talk like that most of the time now\nThat is true because a lot of religion in Christianity is cultural religion and also I find in more recent decades that a lot of the preaching here is dogmatic preaching yes\nIt's about our belief systems which I don't think I see\nBelief systems as the heart of how the Bible explains encounters human and the vine encounters so what are you merge for me in junior high and high school was a simple mantra that I Want my life to follow Jesus I wanted to follow Jesus and I would say to you that in the four\nGospels the major mantra that Jesus uses in connection with people is following me yes he doesn't talk about salvation or despising certain people or uses foul will be so it's out of that that early Christianity\nCertainly developed a notion that Jesus was a massive\nRevelation of the journal one yes and then the other part of Jesus is religion that I've become convinced of it throughout my life is where Jesus uses\nIs Jewish ness with Moses and the Torah to proclaim that the first principle of life\nIs to love God with all your heart and with all your soul and with all your mind in with all your strength and your neighbor as yourself\nAnd he actually says there's no other commandment greater than this those are his words to be found and the gospel the mark that it seems to me is the summary of the Hebrew Bible and all of the Christian Bible love at this very set their love God\nLove your own Life Love your neighbor as yourself anyone who differs with that\nIs therefore practicing a culture religion the Bible has the word hate in a number of occasions or hate those who hate to God then how I Wish the wicked good\nThe destroyed but where the Bible addresses things like that in the sun comes or in the book of Isaiah that means that the Bible is always demanded you make a choice to follow the way of God or you follow the way of of human race so\nMy religion as strongly shaped by the content at St James Church and content of my home then as I as I steady and read for myself the Bible and part of my own\nThesis is that a lot of what's going on in Christianity Today is really a lack of knowledge of the scriptures\nUse the term cultural or Christianity yeah can you elaborate a little bit on what you mean when you say that and why your approach has different\nOr maybe the way that the book of Isaiah and Jeremiah and ... especially the way they might put this is that you are worshipping idle God's false\nGods and not the God who created the heavens and the earth than all the does in them and spread humankind around the earth and gave them a warm spirit that a warm heart that's Isaiah\nSpeaking and then you do find that same thing in the New Testament where Paul rights it's the God who made the heavens and the earth and the sea and all that ... in them\nSo in other words the spirit or the energy that brought us on earth\nThat original energy is who God is\nWhich in the Hebrew tradition in the Jewish tradition is a God who's an affable and unknowable and yet a God who plants God himself in each of us energy has not as structured that in each of us\nSo that for me is very important the inside life and the cultivation of that inside life what the ancient Hebrew called the heart and soul and\nSpirit and the mind that work on the inside is really the main work that we human beings have to do because only out of that work do we tap the potential of this life energy this life force that is in us but\nThat energy it doesn't see race if he's humanity does not see sexual orientation of humanity it\nDoes say people because of the Bible is filled with all kinds of people of one blood has God made all the people of the earth that's what I was on one quote out of the book of acts that's right\nAnd it sees all these people in the image of God not in the image of their flaws or their plight or their circumstances so the encounters of God with\nThe human as described in the scriptures and the sixty seven books in different ways that encounter isn't counter which the love of God for humankind is the primary feature in the primary working energy of the universe\nThat's partially what's missing in Leviticus as a single verse it says you must not sleep with a man has usually with a woman you must outlay with the man as you lay with a woman while that's diverse that she used to say that homosexuality and all his sin but\nThe term homosexuality and the term heterosexuality our terms that came from medicine and social science at the end of the nineteenth century into the twentieth century those are not terms that are in the scriptures just as there is no determine the scripture the Salk vaccine\nRight so to put into the scriptures are thinking all the ways in which we human beings think that we have behaved is for lonely is unless it can be matched\nAnd as we exchange thoughts and ideas it was clear that we were on the same wavelength we were in the same community\nSo during a man who was later use in referring to you the quote un I I started with the sea he called you the greatest teacher of non violence in America or something like that [laughter] he did say that so you're in this environment you know the world knows about some of the\nParticular acts that you did sit ins protests all nonviolent can you kind of give us a framework\nAs to it's a very simple question but how did you know what to do\nWell I don't pretend that I did know what to do but I've been reading ... study non violence in Europe Africa Latin America United States because what is known about the literature of non violence is that ... called non violence but as an example of strike gundy sees as a non violent weapon\n... human beings are done stopping their labor because of grievances they've done that for thirty three hundred years various parts of the world for the strike is old yes yeah I Do it's never been written about in that long history you know it happens\nAnd people don't like it and so forth and so on but she'll ... called things like that a boycott of march strike a work stoppage community meetings that were aimed at resolving agreements gundy called all of that non violent work and he's the first one to have done that\nIn terms of what it is that you were seeing I mean you you're on the the American Landscape you're you you're in a situation where you're dealing with\nFlagrant acts of segregation you they've got separate lunch counters um the segregation is is so stark that you can't even go to the same bathroom that someone else can go to end the violence is everywhere how is it that you've formulated strategy in the wake of all of this I mean what\nWell I didn't begin to strategy I'm going to say that ... I think the slave began strategy and the theory\nYes but you got to follow up on that I as I agree with you but for those that\nWhat you mean by the slave on the plantations across the nation were forced to sing in order to be the kind of bell [laughter] so the master\nAnd the overseers would know where they were on the plantation and so the first music composed in United States except for Indian music already here was music composed by the slave\nThat we called negro song or the negro spiritual that song that black Tsongas won a researcher calls it is a huge library of music\nI have a couple of times gone to one book on my desk that has over eight thousand pieces of poetry from that music we no longer have the melodies but we have the lyrics or at least a portion of the lyrics I've\nGone to that list at least twice on my own line by line and you will find in that\nPoetry no word of hatred or revenge this is an astonishing I maintain an astonishing human development well piece of history", "show_name": "The Drive Home With Jillian Barberie & John Phillips", "station": "KABC", "day": "27", "state": "CA", "year": "2018", "month": "10", "city": "Los Angeles"}
