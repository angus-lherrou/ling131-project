[laughter] hey ... what's happening up there what's going on with the weather [laughter]\nKnow like you know what's going on with your life I miss you\nI we miss we miss you guys read I miss you guys very much that this is old school and so it's so good to hear about your um so the weather I Will tell you a ... it's changed a little bit the forecast task because it was teasing us all day and I was just looking at the latest model\nWhat was going to happen and it appears that the storm is going out on our ah\nWe don't it doesn't appear we're going to get the more significant ran that we thought we were going to get to um earlier on the week and even the morning so the story sort of stalled offshore to falling apart of the chapters at random drop the amounts are lowering as well as in terms of what we're expecting\nSo the burden Arizona that's the big concern at the whole the fire burn area that are wiped out of the backyard\nAnd all they all start area very steep slopes hillsides there and any type of significant right on the slopes will cause some problems\nThere are voluntary evacuations that are set for those areas no mandatory evacuation flash flood watches are in effect we don't think we're going to see the intensity bitter race that heavy rain is needed for those mud and debris flows\nWhen um when you put people on blessed about whether we are coming up and the weather isn't quite as bad as perhaps we thought it would be how do you feel\nI feel like I let them down and I really do it's it's one of those situations where we want to be as accurate as possible you want to prepare people and then when we don't come through with an accurate forecast we get hit pretty hard on instead\nOf hitting you hard on instead [laughter]\nYet or they he's ... he'll come strong always and he will say Rick where's the rain and so I Am getting a little bit of that and I'm and I'm On it then and I just say hey we look at numerical forecast models we have come a long way\nIn weather forecasting over the last several decades with technology but we're still we're still going to get some Mrs there\nI don't want to pull than not to warn people\nBut and then it's a syndrome Dorothy where you're crying wolf and they're like I have such a federal law out in the rain let you\nDo get into that kind of weather forecast fatigue or were people stop listening and that's when you have to be aware\nAnd I wonder if that happened with Hurricane Florence because that was very complacent and they stayed\nSo many people died\nAnd we had that conversation Garcia and when did his life and death is much different situation here in Southern California the majority of the reins as I as you both know I called them you know a lot of a nuisance rain the okay it's gonna rain and a half an inch in LA freeways are going to be a lot longer to get\nTo work and to get home from work there's going to be pounding of her out for the most part the majority of Southern California we're going to get through it despite those areas that are in the ... foot ... urban wild land interface that could see some mud and debris flows if those holes burn during\nWhat do you want to say to people and by the we've had this conversation someone who comes through the years people want to live in the hills they want to listen to use a fancy thing you said again the urban wildlife a\nInterface you like that you you saw that one\nI I Do I Do but I always I always say we're we're the houses read the words we beat the forest yes with the bears me back yard exactly that people love to live or there but we are asking for trouble are we not\nAbsolutely right in those areas are up against the handles national forests are saying gave her a mountain your elevated a bit of the Santa Monica mountains in the Atlanta light on the shore along the ... those are the most scenic are the most beautiful areas of Southern California but they're the most vulnerable to\nHigh surf to flooding wildfires school at all\nYou know what I always remember when I first came to LA for a job interview I Want to get channel too and I was having a job interview I got to the hotel I turned on the TV and I will never forget was Sylvia Lopez\nDoing a story about rain in the lead story was rain and I'm coming from New York and I thought these people are crazy what is wrong with his raining here lead me now I get it but I was like there was this\nYeah it's it it it it is something how we and we will have weather here in Southern California plenty we love our dry weather but we know we need rain and we do and getting back to the storm that or you know quote storm a this area of rain this or at least he's re which we desperately need if we can just get a quarter to half\nAn inch of rain states or the on the east coast side it's just a start to moisture mop it would really help us out\nRight now I think we will see some widely scattered some isolated showers\nThat throughout the evening hours ended tomorrow morning\nThe system all movies first pitch Dodger Stadium ... five thirty seven tomorrow it'll be dry\nBut then next week it looks like we're going to have a series of these weather systems that could produce some clouds the morning drizzle keeps ... which is great\nWe're not seeing any big time heat up or any strong offshore Santa Ana winds that would really elevate the fired in danger so that's encouraging as well so get ready for a little nuisance rain and spot don't anticipate much yes I think we've oversold it a little bit my apologies to everybody\nI being a little nuisance ... can I ask you something off topic because you're in the water much more than I Am have you ever seen a shark and are you at all freaked out about all the reports of sharks lately I I Know I'm being ... magna shark\nNo oh you're you're absolutely right the bottom line is the the marine life in the Santa Monica ... is our ally then it's been said as far as I\nCan remember that was good in\nThat water since I was I shouldn't say that uh there are so many\nThere's such a vast amount of real estate out there and we are seeing more sharks to answer a question I've never been physically in the water swimming circuit or paddling and seen a shark couple of my friends that I've seen sharp from up in the helicopter a number of times over the last few years which I never see years before when I first started\nThe job for Fox that I've been flying now a clear\nMind I Walk more now and then you see people in the water do you just want to like yellow yam a counter\nOh many many times you've flown over them and you show the more they are in people who are twenty feet away have no idea\nYou're exactly right and do you usually there is a great whites you know six to eight feet or so\nAnd they'll take the right idea if they don't quite belong there I Know but I like to go along their to their habitat so they're\nThey're part of the marine ecosystem and and as I was saying that Santa Monica based coming alive again and it's because of us are fighter foundation and killed a bag and because of our awareness about wearing the ocean I I think that I mean it is it's a wonderful thing but yes it is a dangerous\nWhat about the ocean temperature\nYes climate change the factor because the oceans barely won this summer I was in a lot\nIt was a record warm ... especially down in San Diego we're talking about water temperatures at eighty degrees or about that that's almost warm enough to stand our hurricane up the coast of Southern California and it wasn't\nAn El Nino that drove it there are definitely significant climate changes occurring there's those signatures that were saying that we were talking about years back\nMore extreme weather so to answer your question yes Seventy percent of our planet is covered by water so a big portion of our planet is warming it's going to be warmer in the ocean and and we saw that this summer\nAll right Rick ... it's great to hear your voice ... voice\nOnly hurting you guys so much I only heard fourteen times a day for Twenty years but it was okay if you're really bad I think you're ready to go to a doctor that you got to go to open [laughter] again\nWhy why do they do find that as the rest of that guy\nUm we have a running joke that's been going on I think for Seventeen years now isn't it funny one no just now that we would
