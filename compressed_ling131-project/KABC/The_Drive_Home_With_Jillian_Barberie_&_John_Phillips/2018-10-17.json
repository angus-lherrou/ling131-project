structures are threatened unfortunately there's little wind in the area at the moment but three helicopters into super scooper planes are helping to fight the flames from the air\nIn twenty fourteen the London based Saudi newspaper I'm not going to try to pronounce it was when I interviewed to buggy about a mobile clinics that allows corners to perform autopsies in seven minutes to determine the cause of death of he jumped pilgrims\nThe newspaper reported that the mobile clinic was partly designed by two buggy and could be used in security cases they require\nIntervention to perform an autopsy or examined a body at the place of a crime these are the first details to emerge of the Saudi journalist killing the show was laughing entering the Saudi consulate in Istanbul on October second to retrieve paperwork\nTo date Saudi officials have strongly denied any involvement in his disappearance and say that he left the conflict soon after arriving so bad they moved away from us and they reported this but there are in fact reporting that he was killed while still alive\nNow President Trump sent over a Mike Pompeo he's having dinner with um with the crown prince Mohammed bin Salman tonight I'm ... and\n... when they when they met today a upon green as secretary of state the crown prince said quote we are strong and old ally so we face are challenges together absolutely replied ... um he's in Riyadh right now it's\nInteresting because I think Donald Trump sending them over there but they're sitting there all smiles together like they are all getting I don't see you know right now like endeavor our friend her husband who owns Endeavour he pulled out of four hundred million dollars you know that yeah I'm\nRichard Branson a billionaire he's stopped he pulled out of deals like people are making statements and we're sending compel over like he's they're all jovial and they're having dinner I don't\nGet it's these things are very precarious because one of the things that is a reality is you don't pick who other countries puts in charge\nNow but you kind of like how you deal with that right okay and and you can make a statement like like endeavor is doing right now I'm Patrick White so statement as\nFour hundred million dollars is not worth it to us we don't care 'cause this is a journalist life if you start silencing journalists and come on and that's just not a western way\nWell that's true but this guy was more than a journalist he used to be heard of that government\nYes I get that but I mean maybe that's going to move freighter but I mean if he's reporting facts\nThey don't like you look at World War one and what caused World War one to begin and a lot of people lost their lives and the war I mean it was the first global war that the world would ever seen it was the killing of Archduke burden that there was one guy that was murdered\nAnd all of these deals all these countries were involved in all these deals were if this happened this is our response\nAnd everything just kind of kicked into high gear and the murder of one arts do cause the world to fall into a global war causing lots of people to lose their lives\nAnd when people look back at that and and political scientists and military professionals that academics and they looked at what went wrong and what can we do to prevent it they said you shouldn't be that quick to act because of one specific incidents\nThat have deals to tie you into it\n... thanks king Solomon for his commitment to supporting a thorough transparent and timely investigation of Jamal ... disappearance\nYeah and you know there are still details and again the the the news report alone\nWere here pretty bleak yeah so what happens I mean Trump said there'll be ... you know this we're going to be tough on them we find out it's turning out to be true I don't think I don't think we'll see if Trump is true to his word but\nI Know that ... thrown out there I mean I I don't know he talks tough but then when it comes to it he doesn't ... I don't know what I Would do if I was in charge of the situation well it seems like the world knows what to do but Trump doesn't want to give up his ah\nYou know there's a lot of reports that possibly cushion or and and Trump and family have have a lot of deals with the Saudis we we don't know 'cause he's not transparent we don't know I don't have a draft report really\nHotels all over the world you don't think he set on tape before that Saudi Arabia as good as is good for Trump that they've got um seven places saying it in fact Fox News reporting and tweeted today all the times that he's talked about his dealings with Saudi Arabia before he was\nPresident of the world Iran is the big problem and it was like when a rock was the country that we were warring with people who didn't want us to go to war with Iraq say said at the time don't do it they are the counterbalance to Iran they keep Iran and checked\nAnd so therefore even if you don't like Saddam guess what he's the only game in town if you're dumped Saddam then suddenly you're going to have a power vacuum that while we end it all that is going to become the big guy and\nWe ended up with the ISIS yeah All right but listen so Fox News who has verified their Fox News research with the check mark tweeted today\nThey've ... and I don't know how this person's not gonna get fired Trump and Saudi business in Nineteen Ninety One he sold a yacht to a Saudi prince big deal two thousand and one sold the forty fourth forty fifth floor to Trump world powers to all Saudis\nJune of two thousand Fifteen he said I Love the Saudis many of them living my Trump towers August two thousand Fifteen they buy apartments from me they spent forty to fifty million dollars okay two thousand Seventeen Saudi ... lobbyists spend two hundred and Seventy K\nUh for a weekend at the Trump D.C hotel so he makes he's profited off the Saudis before and this is why I have a problem with the president who gets to profit off of other nations that we might not that threatens westernized\nYou could either an argument about okay country okay because he does business globally you could say that the Israelis have them in their pocket or the ... are they are here to get off it personally from the Saudis so he's not going to honor them personally from a lot of different countries candid\nGloves that he does that mean so you're backing up my point I don't want a president who profit off of countries behind my back\nPersonally put America in ... but he's not in these er visits for him not for you not for me for money but I'm telling you if you are\nRepresenting America you should have our concerns first not your own personal profit which he does and which is why he did not released his taxes John I don't know how you can defend this way of saying this is the state of Israel\nOn state run you think that the ... were not pulling all of our deals with Saudi Arabia because she doesn't why does this this to the loo Saudi\nI'm reading that Fox News just set it today are not saying that what did they say and all those tweets than what we're all he sold the boat they're saying that or that I don't say wrong in from Saudi Americans gas so why are you going to jail for in Beverly Hills that\nThe president of the United states John oh my God how not make the distinction to bring in Beverly Hills give a crap they do I know they're not my idea this is what\nMy about Roger to overlook you did this business with Russia as well ... we'll see if you know what I'm just released his tax returns we know but he won't he now he's ... he's dirty dirty dog [noise] and I'm telling you if you you're in bed with the Saudis in any way for your own profit you're going to screw America because\nI'm telling you everyone else is going to be tough on them but him mark my words like ... listen to talk to a tough game then he goes beside him any kids his body screw up a relationship with the Saudis through it I think that's why we're asking them to do\nYou don't think a big deal murdering a journalist is not a big deal to you ... you just read to me that they caught him up when he was alive that's not a big deal I Would see us if if ... if I were in charge I wouldn't be upset about what happened [laughter]\nBut this guy is not an American citizen he was not an American citizen just like me he was waiting John he wants a legal residence it's not about us and there's a difference so you don't care if I when I was a legal resident of somebody raped and tortured me it's like she was in a resident who cares pretty heartless way\nOf looking at people lighting if a crime is committed in another country we're going to turn your back on this I can see you know if a crime is committed another country an American citizen was not killed in a marathon and very committed the crimes way to becoming one okay fine I'm not denying that\nBut I just don't think it's necessarily our place to be the judge jury and executioner okay so if Hitler was doing these crazy things you're like well it's not really our place\nI I the city's being ridiculous than they are put the money into it you know how much money the angels bring into

know it was like when she moves on another one another one another one I like that in reading yup so ha\nLand has had any number of incarnations yes so when they started out a chill and stood for headline news\nRight so do they do all of the news happening like CNN or what does it cause I Know distinguish what distinguish them was Nancy Grace after a while that was the second incarnation ... and what was the first\nOkay so when they first started out it was everything you need to know in the world in thirty minutes ... they did tell the stories food they could top business story they did the entertainment words segment they did entertainment I like\nThat other everything why did they say why did they stopped doing that that's interesting and probably got repetitious and they thought All right oh yeah we're only tuning in for a half hour because they just has already got the end again they've got the information they move on that makes sense yeah\nSo they did that for a long time and then at a certain point Nancy Grace was doing really good numbers as Harry kings filling on CNN\nThat's when I tried so they said we should give this lady her own show she's a lawyer she's had murder and her fiance was murdered and then she started did she started out doing those types of shows right away where it was the missing teenager who killed her children uh right so she she came out of the gains doing those\nPretty well she used to do a show on court t._v. with Johnny Cochrane it was called Cochran great\nOh are they came on good day LA to promote it I remember that and no one knew her everyone knew Johnny he was the star of the ...\nAnd then court t._v. went away and then she became Larry king's filling okay and then a chill and decided to offer her show and the numbers were huge she did great numbers it was when Natalie haul away went missing\nOf course the Casey Anthony thing was when Nancy was at her peak all of those shows and then they got shows that were similar to her like Jane fellows Mitchell actually banned feel last though right [noise]\nThere's a October Eighteenth of the double tree in Anaheim and Saturday October twenty at the ... golf club

lot of our sons are true eight hundred to two to five to to do is our phone number yeah Ali you know I I don't like that history and I was thinking about that history but you have to I don't like I say it makes me branch but it's our history\nIt is our his face and you have to you know it's not all glamour\nNo now and and I I wouldn't characterize it quite the way I did but I understand why he would\nBut it's interesting to think that there's a residual effect from that even today well think of it is so long ago on a tray ... two\nHundred year that easy and I and I are we got to have this conversation on a bigger platform of the bigger group of callers all but but we I think we re opted re ... off the trauma with the uh southern reconstruction and what happened after that of Jim Crow is just just be just kept going the trauma\nBut I mean today that you know we think that that's in the past and it's so and I was wondering like an average of ...\nI began the Republicans were painted if the races they into one thing to speak out about it they should be and they should be I don't know how they speak of how they find a language you speak up out of the people want to hear it 'cause they're largely seen as perpetrators\nWell it's hard to speak up about racism when you're all older white men rush it rings or will the\nGrand southern conservatives I'm learning for granted their conservatives out there that made him identify as Republican that you kind of go to to speak and learn from it look how much does our to our listeners teach us every day every day yeah we have a credible and and I wish that political parties would listen a little bit you you learn from your constituency and they they say they're listening but they're sort of listening for\nIt feels like they're listening for what can I Do for those people therefore get their vote\nWell they're listening to polls in their lives and they're kind of an echo chamber of their own you know\nUm yesterday I felt like today I feel sad uh eight hundred to two to five to ... to ... is our phone number the part of the conversation we appreciate the call and it would push it you're listening\nI'm and today we resolved lots of real problems don't know how we're going to go out and buy some mega million yeah we're going to participate in a mega million lottery because uh it's everyone knows that it's a smart thing to do it just it it's the stupidest bet you could make you have ... of course it's a one in what three hundred million problem but I feel\nThat with the cash and burning on these mega million tickets I get to a daydream about what I Would do with nine hundred million dollars until the John some buying and aging\nFor myself you'd also by the uh some of those riveter product of a military family that I was with that lots of free cash available and or anything else you're doing this week anything you've you've been at the met we really are better things are just fantastic it's\nThe best time to go for any of you planning to visit New York city right when it opens um get it's fantastic and New York in the fall you just can't beat it like a ...\nStory is one of them were ever to

to tell her I Would like doing the show so a plea supported and we will be here for a pessimist thoughts on Dr or their life\nYou\nKnow\nLike Nineteen months of Netflix and if you're lucky Jill what\nShot an brand is coming up in just seconds so even\nThe DC Los Angeles county Mueller station\nTo\n\nDollars right now just at the national C word check to nine five one night ... H. E. K. five one not\nFor a typical family of four if you have two cars to drivers average amount of commute six hundred fifty dollars a year is what the new taxes are going to cost you\nIf you're a super commuter which we have in the LA area on average emitters for 'em and then that's eight hundred dollars per year for that family of four with two cars a cost and how they do them\nLet's let's be clear about who we are talking about\nA lot of people I grew up with I'm a native Californian as art or you don't live here anymore because the costs of how we can't afford it much if you're a teacher or a firefighter or you own a dry cleaning shop you can't afford to buy a home in the three one oh\nYou can't afford any marine county or electricity rates are higher our gas prices are higher the cost of living in California is unsustainable and now this this is a gas tax in a car Texas progressive if you're working poor and if you hurt you more than if you are at the higher end of the ...\nWell a lot of those people live at the Inland Empire or they live in South Orange County the antelope valley the high desert and they commute Seventy five miles every day it kills them\nThey're the supercomputers that we're talking about so they're going to be more on the eight hundred dollar range\nAnd uh and again this is an independent study that does is it six hundred fifty dollars for average drivers eight hundred dollars per year so if you vote yes on prop six you're going to save that money six fifty eight hundred but more importantly you're going to send a message to the politicians that were on to your games we know that you have more than enough money to fix the roads we actually offered an alternative plan to the gas tax increase\nAnd that is if you dedicate a hundred percent of the old gas tax so we already pay\nThe lowered gas tax which would be the fourth highest in the country we're going to go from the second highest back to the fourth highest you would have to point three billion dollars more for roads and they're putting in right now\nPer year and we put even more money into infrastructure by allocating a hundred percent of the sales tax on cars so these are already moneys that you're already pay we should have the best infrastructure and the country are already paying for it what's the argument who's on the other side politicians in special interest in Sacramento that just want more of your money and they're using\nRoad repairs and congestion which we all agree the roads are crappy and congestion is awful\nBut they're using that as window dressing to try to get more of your money\nAnd they never expected the citizens to put something on the ballot to repeal it\nUm and ah now they're sitting there trying to scare the crap out of us they're saying if you vote yes on prop six you're going to die in a car accident\nYou're bridge is going to fall over and it's like no no no no you should have been fixing those roads you should have been affects you those bridges with the money we already gave you this is about an outcry but the cost of living John that you were talking about we can't afford to live in California anymore and John uh Jillian you probably have friends that have left California\nBecause they just can't make it any more and and most left because of us\nHave lame them around them out but no the cost of ... [laughter]\nI blame you John I'm On it but not right I Will need to answer if you call me Ken [laughter]\nI'm like oh this is going to be Jillian first time voting and I ... yeah that would you go through these props you have to be very careful with how you do it because sometimes they'll tricky they'll they'll make you think you're voting for whatever the way they worded like they did with prop fifty\nSeven prop forty seven where they said oh this is a public safety initiative and you think okay this is going to keep bad guys locked up and then it says oh if you're an arsonist that's no longer a violent crime oh if it's violent elder abuse that's do longer a violent crime rate but people legitimately got tricked\nWhen I was reading the title and summary of props six if you don't already go into it knowing that it's repeal the gas types do think that this is some sort of mass transit program where or this is where you're trying to to to fund the roads because you want people on buses or you wouldn't ... trains\nYou with us up to and so our initiative I just average people just read the initiative it's only three sentences\nSends one repeals the gas tax increase sentenced to repeal the car taxing physician sensory says politicians can never race car and gas taxes without a vote of the people very simple we had a million Californians signed the petition the petition said gas tax repeal initiative a money Eighteen\nMoments before the ballots went to print the politicians took out the red pen all wrong with that title and put on repeals road repairs and so they are great and go Jillian this is our point you can't trust the liars with another penny of your money if they are going to lie to you on the ballot to try to defraud you\nThey're going to lie to you or when they they go to spend the money and so we need to spread the word John you nailed it our big challenge in this campaign is we got to make sure that people knowing before they read the ballot\nThat the gas tax repeal initiative is actually not printed on the ballot but it is prop sex and voting yes on prop sex will repeal the gas tax so that's why we got the signs here we've got barbecue we got KBC\nKABC seven Ninety ... um and we're down\nHere and we want to give you the information and if you stop by um Robbins barbecue or off the two ten and the ... north rose made 'em you get you get barbecue and you get a free sign and so we just need to get the citizens engage this is good old fashioned grassroots activists yeah it really is it really is\nNow the polls have this neck and neck the yes side with the no side\nI'm sure you guys are doing your own and turtle pool are going to have an idea of where the public John Thomas\nNailed that this is John ... the John Thomas poll nails at the survey usa poll that came out yesterday showing that you know fifty eight percent want to repeal and only twenty nine percent on a vote no uh that's wrong it's right in one respect\nTwo thirds of Californians want to repeal the gas tax but when you actually read that the the crap sandwich title that they gave us a that's where we lose a bunch of voters 'cause there are so confused did they think they're voting a defined roads when in fact they are not\nUm and that's why this is a problem John Thomas is full actually is far more reflective of where the proposition is as it relates to the ballot\nThe survey usa poll is far more reflective of public sentiment what the people actually want that's how cancerous that's how toxic this a false and misleading ballot title is on your ballot\nAre you saying a so gather news some who is right now they've now this is usa usa is leading Cox is Cox for this he's four yes and he has four yes on ... and why would gather and be against it because\nHe likes having more money to spend on the various special interest I mean all these politicians want whatever ... that has like a government labor unions who want salaries and pension benefit increases that's all that they want and they want your tax dollars to do it with it's not going to fill the pothole it's going to feel the pinch\nWell you mentioned pensions and I think that's the underlying subject here that no one's talking about because the state of California has it has billions of dollars in unfunded pension liability right which they have no means to pay for\nSo they can't just raised taxes just generally so that way they can pay for the unfunded pension liability they have to say we need to raise this tax for police raise this tax for fire raise this tax for road ... ... ... yeah so that way they can shift everything\nPopular style window dressing John and it always is they dangle the little carrots like Lucy and the football but we never get the football so I got to jump on my show but I appreciate you guys out we're gonna have some barbecue and then we're going to stop by a those other guys and as I say I don't have spring cold barbecue out at all\nGood at you and good luck on your first time voting yes I'm excited about it thank you so much\nI'll write it is three Seventy or live in Pasadena and it is beautiful unpleasant you know what

showcased\nSo Saudi journalist Jamal could show the was a tortured and decapitated inside Riyadh consulate in Turkey\nUm this is the Turkish newspaper reporting it today saying they had heard the audio recordings of the slang or as you know cause showed he was a Washington Post columnist he vanished after visiting the consulate on October second to pick up paperwork ahead of his wedding\nUm so what they're saying now is there was no intention of of of information\nThat he walked in he was tackled his fingers were chopped off and he was beheaded\nThat quickly um during the actual tape the people who have listened to this tape or you can hear the Saudi council council Mohammed al ... hobby\nHe's heard on the tape saying during one of the during the torture quote do this outside you're going to get me in trouble according to the paper which did not reveal how it obtained the tapes but it said they had heard the tapes\nI Love that his big concern was creating a massive golf oh my\nGod and by the way he gave a tour of his office today I saw that on tape or in another tape an unknown person is telling oh Thai be if you want to live when you come to Saudi Arabia shut your mouth basically a tabby returned to Riyadh on Tuesday head of a plan search of his residence which is what is on tape\nAnd um\nThis Turkish sources saying that this team the Saudi hit team of fifty men had come to kill them they did not attempt to interrogate him at all now you a message or you mentioned yesterday rather that\nUm the forensic physician doctor salon Mohammed al type to Bobby listen to music as he began to cut ... body while he was still\nAlive\nAnd the Turkish government apparently has a copy of whatever tape which may\nWhatever yeah Charlotte said they need to put it out and an edited I don't know why they're going to put three minutes of it out\nThere what's that they they need to put the whole thing so that people have\nSaid that it's completely transparent that's what we need\nAnd um you know that's the whole thing is frightening by the way this man had four kids and they're all um US citizens\nAll of his children to choking jury member showed that used to err on the weekends in the nineties and I think the eighties it was something along the lines of a stupid criminals are dumb yeah ... yeah guys that would drive into the ATM machine with their license plates would offer the drive away\nIt doesn't matter who you're talking about whether it's\nA guy who who snacks and ended up murdering people or a planned event like this where it's been premeditated they always seem to slip up and do stupid things but allows the outside world to look at it and go oh I I Know exactly who did it and this is exactly how it happened\nTurkish officials have shared the audio recording with us and Saudi Arabia\nAnd they say that it proves that uh he was murdered by Saudi operatives the pro government paper ... has reported that could show he's apple watch was in fact\nWhat um [noise] had recorded this torture and killing some experts say it's unlikely that the watch could have recorded events in that manner I don't know why\nWhy would it be either she recorded it because\nShe thought something may go down\nOr an aunt that inside some turned on them and they recorded\nNow he knew member he told his girlfriend\nHe told his girlfriend if I'm not out in a you know a reasonable amount of time\nThen um you know\nBut if you think that there's even a slight possibility that you're going to get murdered\nBut yeah I Would go in there because he didn't think he is going to get murdered in Turkey maybe Saudi Arabia yeah but not and he didn't think would you if you went to the American consulate if you're American and you went to the American consulate in I don't care wherever you are pick a country would you feel a little somewhat safe\nWell there's a big difference though between going to hurt American consulate in a country that were on semi good relations with and go into a shouting cuts all those people don't play they aren't lean out of like gangsters here and this guy clearly knows I mean he came from that world became so what

a couple of months ago he's kicked off\nEverything by the way that it's not as is just lies he just spreads live\nI Will say this about Farrah Khan and I I obviously ... take issue with with the vast majority of what he has to say I like his cadence [laughter]\nFor the positive is that what you're saying that he's\nGot down and it's not a yeah I understand it's almost ...\nA very Red Sox very redneck if you're not paying attention to what he's saying you're just ... yeah it's very it's almost like put you on a trend is suing words it's very soothing yeah yeah and I hear ya [noise]\nLuis C K I I Do\nNot like this guy at all and by the way one of his victims is going to come on our show in Studio live in Studio in a few weeks\nOh really I Can't wait yeah Rebecca Corey great girl a he has started cracking jokes about his self shuttering scandal is your audience if the west side comedy club quote I lost thirty five million dollars is an in an hour ... adult in front of the devil\nWell listen he's feeling sorry for himself he's been to hell and back how about the victims does he care\nHe's fifty one years old he confessed to pleasure himself in front of several women jerk last year without their consent the comic report for standup routines of the west side comedy club Caroline's with the comedy cellar last week he opened up his shed at Caroline's with some self deprecating humor\nGood to be here even though some of you may not like you said some of us\nIs comments about the scandal came Wednesday the site reports at one point during a set CK joked about being in hell with Adolf Hitler he was much more confident of beige or\nWhat a baby so my attitude is is that he they booked him correct\nI Would imagine so I bet you these guys go way back\nSo the couple of the other comedy places he just sort of showed up and they allowed him to go on stage now is he at the point where he's confident enough to show up and he's on the marquee and who's going to see um I I Do know Rebecca Korea friend of mine who\nWas one of the women that he uh masturbate in front of a and was employed by him so he again she was a subordinate\nShe hates him and she said he's helped to ruin her career yet he gets to keep going and doing stand up and the end it to brag about losing thirty five million an hour you did that to yourself\nWell here's what I Would assume and I'm just making this up I have no information that's what we did access three hours a day statement\nBut a lot of these comedy clubs they have open door policy is for the ...\nYeah so injured Dave Chappelle if you want to go in there and work on your material yeah you don't have to be booked ahead of time yeah you just show up yeah because you're Dave Chappelle yeah to go on and work out your material yes Jerry Seinfeld will do that sometimes yeah\nAnd I bet you anything but Louis CK was part of that group\nYeah but he should he be allowed to be part of that group still\nI'd I'll ask the question I bet you he just shows up and the comedy club owners may or may not even know that he's showing yeah but he had those privileges yeah yeah so unless you've had some sort of formal conversation with him telling them that he doesn't have those privileges he just assumed that he's invited\nAnd you know he's treated\nWell so he's not wrong and assuming any continues to do what he does\nWell what are the reports that I read said that there was a huge difference in the reaction that he got\nFrom the men in the audience as opposed to the women of course the men were really happy that he was back unless it was ... his daughter or sister or their daughters or wife that he was masturbating in front of and\nThe women had a big problem with it yeah I mean I get it I I I understand why the breakdown is such were you a fan of his before all is not really no I mean I met him a few times I met him at\nHoward Stern's birthday I interviewed him um\nAnd uh I met him socially twice\nDidn't do anything for me and also I'm not really I didn't watch his show I didn't quite me either so I I don't I don't get it\nWe've got some bullets in that all the comics that have gone down are ones that were not fair and so yeah it him and Cosby except\nFor you Roseanne you like her yeah big fan of roses and last night the Connors got ten point five million which isn't too shabby but my thought is that it's curiosity and then it's gonna it's not going to if you're not going to be ten point five every week\nAnd we're going to have more on that by the way later on in the program right boxer canal oh All right yeah it was\nAbout to become a very very very rich man he was already rich by the way yeah and I love the fact that you're a huge boxing fan\nWell I Know canal Oh yes I Know very well because my friend Kate del Castillo so I've met a canal though I've been to dinner with him I've been the case house where he's been over and he doesn't speak a lick of English [laughter] so he and I we get
