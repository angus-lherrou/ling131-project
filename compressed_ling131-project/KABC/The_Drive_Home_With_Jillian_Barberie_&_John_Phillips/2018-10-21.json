{"content": "Changes our perspectives that changes our way of thinking there's a concept called looming and as for especially with vehicles especially large things\nThat are moving towards a while and looming is actually a big problem because you could say well I thought this car is going to hit me was going ten Fifteen miles an hour and it was five feet away and the evidence shows that it was going to miles an hour and ... feet away right\nBut our physical makeup than at that point when that stress hormone hits and that's it's controlling the way we it's affecting our vision the officers not lying if I just\nThat is what they see and that again that's just another concept that's out there and that is\nSomething that I didn't like I think it's something that's actually absolutely appropriate and and the thing is when we look at these cases one of the things is that we're looking at him years later and an air conditioned courtroom where we're not in that situation crime but still there has to be something\nCan you train officers to even though they're dealing with these increasing stressors looming as an incredible concept because it happens a lot of court cases to\nKind of forestall this point of no return or at least check it out a few minutes or second can something be done to train these men so that when they get in that situation the next time we're not going to see the same result\nI think so and I think there's a lot of other people out there to believe the same thing that you know you can and there was a again there's a big body of research now and stress resiliency\nOr mitigating the effects of stress and it's possible it's not easy and it's not something that you can just\nTeach somebody in ten minutes and then it works for the next five years of work that way in order to be effective it's gotta be something that is comprehensive and that it's ... the department buys into it and said this is of value to us and we want to make sure their officers are operating in that optimum area not where they're going over the cliff and it just becomes panic\nOkay we have a little bit of time left or give us your perspective on the future how do you think we're going to move in light of this do you think that it's just generally speaking your opinion matters you know this you've studied this are we going to moving in this direction your direction that you're you're taking the nation\nI Would love to see a movie in that direction because I think it's not only is it better for society but you know I mean a cop for three years you still maintain a connection right\nAnd I think it's better for the cops in in the in the end they're going to work better more efficiently they're going to they're going to have better respect from the public and the public is going to get a better product in the end whether we can get to that point it's unfortunately it's an industry that is resistant to change\nAnd um you have done many wonderful things to tear down that resistance messed us\nFolks uh this has been a nation divided one of the interesting things about the work that both of us do is the consciousness that underlies the approach to law enforcement will invariably impact the result and what we're seeing from ...

N. F. treaty\nThe agreement barred the U.S and Russia for making owning or testing round launch cruise missiles with a range of three hundred and thirty four hundred miles what President Trump says Moscow is not living up to the agreement so he's pulling out and the president says the U.S may start making those missiles\nSo again um you look for what is that right balance and how you approach policies and I I Will say when you got a super majority in Sacramento that never has to talk to the other side you end up with those extreme policy\nI I don't understand why we can't have a ...\nPrecision about legal versus illegal yeah we're not even allow and not even allowed to say the word\nThat well you know I I think it starts from where is it good use of our\n... a public safety dollars we have a limited amount of public safety dollars the poor use of time to go running around trying to round people up who are otherwise honorably living here we should be uniting and focusing on how can we keep those our community safe\nFrom anyone who's committing crimes regardless of how you got here\nAt you know if you're a a five generation Republican or Democrat Californian if you're breaking the law I watch our streets\nAnd that should be the common sense way of looking at this regardless of what your immigration status is how can we allow law enforcement to do their job and unfortunately was coming out of Sacramento is going to the opposite it's not a very victims centered approach is not a very public safety approach it just the opposite that's why you need people who are willing to be independent from that\nAlso as voters we feel a bit do you know with the to prop running for the Federal Reserve and a half now has arrived and crime they've cause all sorts of problems were letting people out of the jails um we're letting people know you know in California and giving them benefits that even taxpayers don't have\nA so we we really feel like we can't even trust the politicians that are putting this stuff out there because it's full of things that we definitely didn't want but didn't know any better wouldn't run all do\nIt so it's sold as something that sounds just wonderful magical like were suddenly going to make sure that a crime is not going to be happening to you again and then when you really look at what\nA lot of these propositions that done it's decriminalized what um tends to be the crime that we see all over and ... we've seen double digit increases in my district and property crimes and fast and break it you know you go to San Francisco and people are writing on their cars please don't break into my car there's nothing there and I can't afford to keep repairing it and so that's an extreme\nLike give me another one there was a bill that just passed and the governor signed it unfortunately that ends the felony murder law in California and retroactively now we're going to be having to recent it's people who participated in crimes where somebody died and to me that is not what California needs to be focusing on\nThat comes about because of the very big extremism at the at the state level you just need folks that are willing to listen to any good idea and not go to the extremes\n... I mean we've we've been down like you're making so much heck I'm waiting for the heck here [laughter] the who has no one's ... [laughter] so\nI actually I disagree with you there because I have the bipartisan record I have an image Republicans have terrific ideas about how we can make the state more affordable and more prosperous and people have better lives my democratic colleagues occasionally have some good ideas as well if you're just going to focus on the labels you're not going to get very good work done\nBecause I have that approach I've got\nThe most bipartisan record of any assembly member in the legislature just in my first term\nMy bills get signed by the governor I'm able to be at the table when you're actually making decision making because folks are ... you're going to listen to the idea is you don't have blinders on I think we need more of that and Sacramento is listening it does mean I Will tell you this right now that a whole world of hack comes down on\nYou and your election cycle because you disrupt what's happening in Sacramento and that's what's happening up and my assembly district would explain about what you mean oh well this is a um you know I go and I learn new things about me every time I go to the mailbox this time of oh or or yeah he\nIs so critical to that two thirds super majority for another decade and um and that kind of balance you know when you're the only Republican and within two hundred miles of downtown San Francisco that brings a lot of attention from the other side he would rather have the seat and\nUh I'm just proud to be fighting for what my constituents would like to get done that it's that get that job done party [laughter] and I think that's important\nAnd a cat and bigger what do your constituents saying the number one thing they want to get done there and the sixteenth districts\n[noise] so uh it's it's all the areas that I think probably apply across the state police focus on what will affect the quality of life in my area of like my kids to have a good classroom good teachers good principles\nA good environment in which to learn so they can have opportunity regardless of your family background your economic backgrounds so education they want it they want to see those doors of opportunity open for their kids they want to be able to have a commute\nTo and from work but that doesn't you know cause heartburn all day long they'd like to see solutions about that and really would like to see the cost of living in the state of California addressed\nIt seems like every solution that comes from Sacramento is how can we be taxing you more and sending more in order to address every problem when we really need to be more disciplined and they just want that they're not interested in can you be more Democrat\nCan you be more Republican I I'm In\nFact they turn away from that uh and it's important you know I'll tell you I've done twenty town halls\nWith members of the other side of the aisle sixteen with my overlapping state senator steep laser a Democrat\nI've done town halls with a democratic congressman and other democratic assembly numbers and at the end of those constituents will come up to us whether you're someone who is a lifelong Republican or a lifelong Democrat and they'll say I'm just glad you're working together\nBecause I'm sick of the decorating and um that's one of the choices that my constituents will have on the ballot weeks\nAre can you explain something to me can you explain bickering driving the train for training session going ... miles an hour by hour another another math problems from grade I mean how we spent so much money for nothing out of the added that how to get here and why only California\nWell you know it actually it wraps up a whole bunch of theme so it was sold as a baggage to California that it's only going to cost you know thirty billion dollars private money is going to come and invest everyone's going to have this two hour trip to hour and forty one minute trip from LA to San Francisco and it'll be done by now\nTwenty minutes off you're right there ... why do I need that are making fifty five minutes in an airport why why do I need betray\nWell look you know what I Would\nLove the way I'm going to fly I'm going to fly my drone there that are climbing through because of their own way of getting around Los Angeles is our wire drone so I'm going to be flying drones and why do we were we doing this\nWell look we're doing this because it's a project that one side of the aisle fervently wants to have\nAnd commonsense folks like myself say look you're throwing money at something that uh the head of the high speed rail authority came to testify that he has NO PLAN for how to complete this project and then the U.S already that said in testimony to as\nThere is no way it can be the promise high speed rail\nAnd so this is a perfect example of how leaders can even dig their heels in and just blindly keep following which is what's been happening in Sacramento and partisan lines or you can speak some truth about it which is we need to we need to end it reinvest those dollars into real transportation\nWater storage which actually benefits all of California how about we not spend it and go into the debt that comes from that so what you're going to need more people who are willing to stand up for that in high speed rail is probably one of the best examples of how partisan blinders will just make you follow instead of good policy\nBut what what it looks like a boondoggle it looks like somebody's ... somebody got a bunch of money and just pocketed it looks like that convinced me that it isn't\nI I mean we could all fly I G I care for them and I have to right now learn how to do our own you're up there\n[laughter] yeah you're asking the wrong person to try to convince you that high speed rail is good I actually taught my twins my young kids what the word boondoggle is by using high speed rail isn't\nIt [laughter] and we're also I don't go and day out and everything and they were\nGood policy do drugs there there are better things we can do and that's you just need more people\nWilling to to stand up for that and and it does mean voting against your party sometimes by democratic colleagues need to be willing to vote differently against their party on this issue if we ever want to see it go way\nGoing to be a few minutes we're going to grow up to want to ask you about if you don't ... you got to okay go first to somebody wanted to sixteen district doctored\nBomb [laughter] when\nLawrence Yvonne monitor our numbers of reviewers rigor nowhere\n[laughter] returned from overcoming breed 'em up north I'm\nSure let's go for it or ... you want to comment\nI was just I was just wondering who actually has the authority to stop the high speed\nRail [noise] so where should we applied pressure great at great cost you a maverick Russia absolutely\nAnd and uh the legislature has the authority to do it you just need more members up your who are really speak the truth about it\n[noise] still bring him

Frazier the CEO and founder of Frasier communications where the largest woman down in one of the last full service communications company in the Los Angeles\nArea and it Frasier we seek to change behavior grow brands impacts society and grow businesses that some of our national clients include Alexis new vision ... Ontario international airport Sunday Jonathan Lewis furniture east west bank\nAnd we do a statewide campaign for first five California which you may see on digital ... radio on television and it's all about talk ... say it changes everything\nThe show decider siders features CEOs and people who are leaders in their field and in their communities we like to feature people who are building their businesses and people who are change agents\nThat decided to show her interview very smart people to learn from them and today we're going to be talking with one of my ... one of my best friends and colleagues in the industry and smart sore markets the CEO's the Ontario international airport authority\nThat CEO of the Ontario international airport\nOut in the Inland Empire this airport is undergoing an expansion of flights services and it's only thirty five miles east of downtown Los Angeles\nI take great airport to go through if you haven't flown sure that I recommend that you try it it's a great experience very easy to get through and a wonderful environments Japan welcome march to love the show\nHi how are you are in a\nGreat happy to have you on the show ... wanted to ask you to tell us why set the the landscape by talking about why the airport is experiencing so much growth what's going on in the Inland Empire\nI think there's three reasons why we're starting to see the growth that ah we've experienced at the airport the last couple of years\nThe first is really just the strong demographic growth and the the two inland counties\nUm [noise] you know with Syria and riverside county being the fastest generators of of not only um you know economic growth of job growth but also there's population growth of population growth and\nAnd GDP or you know local and regional a domestic product or economic energy regional GDP essentially\nThose are the two drivers of air travel and so those are those are all really strong drivers out here and so you see demand growing here the second reason\nIs that you know there was a transfer ownership and control the airport from city of Los Angeles to\nJoin ... Twain the city of Ontario and the county San Bernardino two years ago and I think there's been a different kind of a focus of emphasis on trying to grow the airport and that's been a very positive wind behind the sales as well the third reason is there's only one airport in Southern California that can really accommodate significant growth from now and into the future\nAnd that's our airport in Ontario international airport so I think the combination of those three and the and the close convenient proximity of our airport to probably about ten million of the\nNineteen million that living in a greater Los Angeles area of the reasons why people like to use the airport and the more flights we add them or they've had reason to come to use the airport and that sort of\nCredit or a very righteous cycle of growth and an opportunity for more growth into the future\nExcellent excellent summary I Know that in the first half of two thousand Eighteen you've had two point four million passengers going through the airport so that's a big number of people that are reach out and that's part of that ten million who live closer to Ontario international airport than they do to LA that's right yeah yeah\nAnd and as you looked at the at the business and I know you've also been working very hard with your team to identify new airlines and new roots because we know besides convenience and fares the people really want to look at the airlines had her ... her options for them and the roots\nSo how many departures you have again now\nUh I think we're up I'm back pretty close to about eighty a day I Believe\nWow that's great and he didn't even have direct flights to Eighteen major airports right U.S Mexico and the newest one is China Airlines to Taiwan is that correct\nNow why China Airlines decide to go to Ontario international airport and a change some of their flights ended LAX\nWell when you look at where tickets are purchased in Southern California um air travel tickets obviously a what all for all the Asian markets about fifty four percent of all that demand originates in in other words tickets purchased originated codes closer this airport than LAX\nWhen you look at Taiwan it's about Seventy percent of the tickets purchases come from you know the region closer to Ontario than LAX and that's really you know north Orange County Gabriel valley in of course the two inland\nRiverside and San Bernardino when you look at mainland China it's about sixty five percent of the demand um and so you know the Philippines ... percent so China Airlines realize that the majority of their customers at least those in Southern California that are\nGenerating air travel live closer to the airport and we're close to the airport so so shifting one of the early X flights one of the two out here has has given their customer base a more convenient opportunity\nTo fly not just a Taipei but to all the points that China Airlines connects to beyond Taipei sixteen points and in Southeast Asia and you know that's that's a very attractive opportunity for you know people here that want to go to not just to get into one of the Philippines Vietnam\nSure um you know South Korea Japan um you know Indonesia so that that's a that's really why is justified that comes closer to where the where the people are that are looking to fly\nOn how smart move though I Know that as a business ... Ontario international airport you go out of your way to identify opportunities and meet with airlines to build the business case another airline that ... yeah just added a flight to New York is Jet Blue right\nYeah Jet Blue came back Ontario airport they'd been gone for for several years and\nAnd probably about ten years and came back with a with a return of the red eye to New York they used to fly and we really hope that that's the first of many new flights to many new destinations to to come from a from Jet Blue there'd been a great Arlen to work with them or really glad to him back\nYou know what I what I like about Ontario and we we often call it a when she just for the listeners and cheese the acronym\nAh and the designation when you're choosing an airport just like LAX and it's the one for\nLos Angeles world airport L. A. X. and I when I see about ... it's more like a boutique airport just like a boutique hotel\nWhere you feel kind of special when you're there and it's a customer experience is entirely different and that's part of the brand position that you folks have developed for Ontario can you tell us a little bit about that\nYeah I think you know what one of the phrases we like to use is you know so Cal so easy\nNow huh I think Frasier communications help come up with them in a matter of fact I Love that line\nShould give credit where it's due to a you know I think I think it's great because it really kind of established is for us as as you know the the folks running the airport the eagles we should have I mean there is a kind of laid back easy going um you know a calm patient tolerant Southern California you know\nA guy and then you are in fact that we want it to be an easy experience but we also want it to be a very personal and and memorable one for people I'd have staff today that's helping a traveler who lost her identification TSA help there may help them make their way through the next airport they're connecting through without identification you know\nYou know look Albert Einstein had one of the greatest quotes ever about insanity and you know it's definitional insanity is doing the same thing over and over again expecting a different outcome most people\nLimited very negative comfort zone they fear everything and I get it made people may have tried on their own like I said earlier in the show the number one mistake people do when they first start learning how to trade\nIs they read a book to go on YouTube and they think they can do this on their own without getting educated or coaching\nWell I can tell you it's amazing that what I Believe here is that the average layman can most of the time as the only profession you can do this\nTrading where the layman can outperform the professional with some coaching and some education\nSo right now a lot of our students are realizing that the excuses are kind of dwindling I mean in the twenty first century right now as long as you have a laptop and you have an Internet connection and you have a series of simple steps that's really what we teach is a simplified trading system of step by step investment strategy\nTo help define the way that people make money on Wall street there's no excuse not to and Sam ... this many times the architect of our core strategy that really what trading is is just the transfer money from people who don't know what they're doing to people who do know what they're doing\nI think that's an important concept to remember because it's not like the money just grows on trees and all of a sudden it shows up in our county right what happens is there's a buyer and seller and there's a transaction that occurs and there's a winner and there's a loser and a lot of times we we forget about that side of the market but the markets are really just a conduit and this is one of the ways I explain it to my classes as\nThe markets are a conduit that just hooks us all together that's really all the marketplaces it's a meet up\nWe all go there to hang out and what do we do that well we buy and sell stocks and people who want to sell stocks\nShow up with their stocks and people who want to buy stocks go there to buy stocks it's just like a farmer's market but at the stock market or commodities market but it's just buyers and sellers and money transfers like a farmer's market when I buy tomatoes money transfers transfers from my account in somebody else's account is the same thing in the financial markets and\nLotta times we don't realize that as we're losing somebody else who made the right decision is actually out there making\nYeah and they're also living their lives most of us right now which jobs are stressed out we're worried about losing our job especially with a correction comes again\nMost people are just one paycheck away from poverty and so a lot of our students are figuring this out how do I go from being emotional to becoming strategic and the way they do that is to get the proper education learning how a three hour session can completely change your life and you know Ryan you know I've talked about this over and over again\nHolidays are coming up it's that time of year again\nEveryone's going to make their resolutions yeah right well that's kind of silly because the resolution is basically your intention to do something in the two biggest ones we hear what\nI'm going to lose weight this year ... out of ... you know out of out of debt and made our money but the difference here right now is don't just make it a resolution make it a promise to yourself that you're going to figure out a way to get more financially secure\nYeah I remember my grandpa used to say this and I remember hearing somewhere else too but I'm going to give him credit for it but he used to always say\nUh the goal without a plan an executed will plan is this is a dream you know go without a plan is a dream and and that's one of the things that we spend a lot of time on an online training academy is that step by step plan that step by step process on how to accomplish that goal because in the end we are we're going to come up to the holidays here pretty quick\nAnd all of a sudden everybody's going to plan out their New Year's resolutions I don't remember all the statistics we went through it back in January on the show but it ends up being something like within four weeks eighty percent of the people have completely given up and I'm not even thought about their New Year's resolution and part of that is there wasn't an executed will plan\nThey didn't know exactly what to do tomorrow\nAnd the only attributed plan right now is the gyms knowing they're going to start running their commercials in there and you know\n... and they're going to make a killing thirty bucks a month but at the gym memberships skyrocket but at the same time\nThey're putting our our best foot forward and giving us an opportunity to reach that financial goal is critical out there as well and we have to do\nWhat we have to do what it takes to accomplish the Gulf we want to lose a little weight we got to spend a little more time on the treadmill\nAnd we want to make a little more money we've got to get those skills and one of the places where we can really start bringing the knowledge that we can work our way up into that skill set is I don't want to have to classes and we've got this stack the deck a ticket to dwindle and we must be towards the end of the show but we got a few tickets left we do do they give away let's do it\nRight now I've got to have to class coming up in your area and they have their classes where you'll see

com and see if you can scores and passes there\nWhat are some of the other things you guys are working on right now as far as your instructor team Julie help people take control their lifestyle how people do the things they want to do\nTo help them get over procrastination right I mean it's amazing how many people spent so much time watching TV procrastinating\nComing up with the reason why they can't do something and what if you only need it to take maybe a third of the time that you're doing right now either procrastinating of watching TV just to learn how to trade and make more money so I asked you to solve the time you ever wondered what your life would be like if you can quit your job or if you could spend more time with your family a lot of our students now are starting to actually\nMake money while they're on vacations I have June\nOne of my students recently and she sent me a postcard from Costa Rica and she said it's great I'm playing golf this has been my dream but I'm also trading on the trip and of course when she came back I asked you trade before after and she went\nBefore of course as you get up early in the morning because the one thing about having an education and being able to trade in any time\nWith an Internet connection that computer is there are several markets to trade it's twenty four hour marketplace right now so the rules have changed and people are finding that they can take back their lives and actually start doing some of the things they want to do as opposed to\nWorking for someone else which is what is the required to do of themselves\nYou know there was a there was a book I read a little while ago called the world is flat and it talked about a lot of outsourcing in a different kind of business strategies but it talks a lot about technology and how technology has really kind of level are made the playing field\nA very level and it makes a it makes it difficult on some businesses to be competitive and it makes it easier on other businesses to get going and that's very true inside of the markets because with the with the Internet connections that we have with the data streams that we have it it really is this this this marketplace where it doesn't matter what your background is\nIt doesn't matter where you're from it doesn't matter even how much money really you're getting started with\nEverybody has access to the same information inside of the markets and so it doesn't matter where we come from it only matters where we're going and that we stay focused\nKind of on that go hand in that we do

the market is just another opportunity to give yourself\nA raise now one of the things that we can do to help a few people get into this point to take that first step right getting started as the most critical step is it looks like we've got ten tickets left this must be the end of the show so before we in the show before we before we before we sign off Larry what about doing another give away\nIf

there\nBut Dr Ford there it was the can of colored fizzy sugar water right in plain sight\nI mean that's that was an amazing prop somebody's going to get paid for that somewhere along the line because I I don't think it was ... I I think it was by design okay so on my Facebook page I simply posed a question and people were tearing into each other\nThe question was how this is before of course the vote went through and he became the uh a Supreme Court judge\nBy a slim narrow margin but the question was how do you vote caffeine and sugar or barley and hops than it set off a firestorm of comments I didn't mean for it to turn political I was just talking about the caffeine in the sugar in the can of hope that she sat on the table my opinion by design\nAnd the a discussion about love of barley in hops [laughter] is tracking it it it's a it was more barley and hops a by the\nWay they sort of one out but man a man the caffeine in the sugar crowd wet for the judge [laughter] it was nasty but it wasn't designed for that it's really a health oriented uh uh you know Facebook page\nBut I just I it was just an observation them you know call me strange but when I saw that coke in there and they'll come on you're gotta be kidding me here\nI'd say any of that that's how we're going to be talking about today we're going to be joined by special gas coming up\nAnd we're also going to be talking about diet drinks and I don't know if she\nHad regular or sugar free or artificial sweeteners in that coke and I you know it was sitting there and I saw another frame of another picture she was thrown at back\nHard and cameras were snapping away and it went over everywhere and the the the executives at Coca Cola were doing some high millions not high fives high hundreds of millions of dollars as a result of seeing\nToday on the show we're going to be talking about researchers at allied medical school in Australia there they're talking about how diet drinks and artificial sweeteners increase the risk of diabetes just the opposite of what you would think people\nGravitate to\nAnd they utilize these diet drinks and artificial sweeteners because they think they can fool Mother Nature they think they can get away from the shoe gar\nAnd get over there to the artificial aspartame nutrasweet and the sugar loaf and all of that thinking okay I get my sweetness and eat it and drink a Jew\nAnd yet when you go into the supermarket next time take a look see if I'm telling you something that's for sure for real\nAnd that is looking in the cards just got a you know keep your eye out and you're going to see people who are overweight and obese these are all the people who have all the diet drinking their cards they have three cans hanging out\nThree cans in and they're the ones who are on the diet drinks now we know why well we know why because they don't work and they increase weight not decrease way and they increase the risk of diabetes\nOr not decreased the risk and we'll talk about that a little bit later in the show\nOr if we have time or else you got to be talking about how\nHot dogs and burgers and this was going to break the hearts of many but hotdogs and burgers\nAccording to Harvard University researchers eating a dog a burger increases the risk of breast cancer it's true\nNow I got to tell you I used to go to the ball games and I still do but I don't eat the hotdogs there anymore but and I'm sure that this was related to a pretty\nSubstantial on a regular consumption of a burgers and dogs but most Americans eat processed foods they fast foods all the time it doesn't matter if it's alarming hotdogs bacon ham\nAnd it ratcheted up the increased risk of breast cancer in women\nThat according to Harvard researchers know getting a does\nSo we have that on the docket

A. B. C. after after I talk about these artificial sweeteners\nDrinking diet drinks or using artificial sweeteners could increase your risk of type two diabetes scientist found\nThat just in two weeks of high intake of low calorie sweeteners these artificial sweeteners or no calories sweeteners was enough to significantly altered the makeup of\nThe bacteria in the guts this changes the way the body absorbs and regulates blood sugar\nThat's what the researchers are talking about some of these low calorie sweeteners and the diet Pepsi the Diet Coke all of that which are used by a lot of people are linked to changes in the gut bacteria\nAnd that could increase your risk of diabetes and people who have already they're overweight or they have diabetes are much much more prone to this if they're using a much more prone to getting worse if they're using these artificial sweeteners and diet drinks just the opposite of what you think\nSo if this is what you're using you need to switch over you have a lot of options you have the options of using a monk fruit which is zero calories as noble I see making actually had a very sweet about a hundred and fifty times sweeter than cane sugar\nYou've got Steve via as an option you've got ... as an option anything get off these artificial sweeteners because when you mess with Mother Nature you fool Mother Nature get burned and in this case\nYou'll be burned in the case of diabetes type two diabetes All right back to the phones here he is a Cathy and west LA welcome to the doctor by march and show catty hello\nOh hi Dr von thank you so much for your show um I have hide and they're really painful how'd you get rid of these\nWell how long they've been there a catty\nOkay ah about two days now\nOkay it's going to be difficult because it's hard to know because whatever it was that you set them into motion hyper you to carry it is an allergic reaction to something and that you you have a histamine reaction you have these these blood cells called ... and they go crazy\nWhen you expose yourself to something that your body didn't like in in\nIn this high it's sort of a protective mechanism your body is basically sending you an idiot lights and you violated in some way and it's wanting to tell you on the surface the problem is internally though\nUsually it's something that you've consumed my first case of hives I was at the Dairy Queen and had this ... thing that was real red and had all kinds of artificial caught this when I was a kid\nAt are all kinds of artificial coloring agent said it was just pure junk and I went home with a bunch of hives and my parents said okay so ah what did you eat or drink in the last six hours and finally we tend to down to the Dairy Queen a drink that I was so it can happen\nSo now they have it what do you do well it's got to be difficult traced back and see if you can figure out when they first started and what you ate and keep a diary because you don't want to repeat that each and every time you want to learn from the experience and avoid it\nBut meanwhile what do you do well the best thing to do when you have hives as fast where you go on and water and lemon for a whole day\nThe second day you drink nothing but beet juice and carrot juice with a little salary and then you get these uses that the juice reason the health food stores and health grocery stores\nAnd what you're trying to do is you try to purge the toxic reaction from the body by taking away stress off the justice system so a day of nothing but water and lemon and a day of carrot juice a beet juice or maybe some salaries just whatever that'll clear it up and you'll lose about uh six pounds in the process which is good\nYou can also use things to a as naturally in the history means like in a sea NFC it'll Sistine which is a supplement in getting any health food stores and sulfur containing amino acid\nYou can use in her called net ... metal works really well for hives as does a type of flavor annoyed vitamin C. called ... these are all available to health food stores they're phenomenal at helping\nTo get rid of or hastened the healing process with a high for reaction which is an allergic reaction and that's that's what you need to focus a\nFocusing on [noise] All right before time gets away from us here I'm going to let you know that eating burgers and hotdogs increases a woman's risk of breast cancer that according to Harvard a Harvard study process it's all about the processed meats\nAnd the world cancer research fund recommends\nCutting out red meat altogether and I just read a study by the way that taking extra vitamin D and getting your vitamin D levels up where they need to be cuts breast cancer risk by Ninety percent that is the latest\n... uh information about breast cancer and you should look it up just type in vitamin D breast cancer but\nUh you if you eat hotdogs or if you eat these hotdogs and burgers on a real regular basis that's when the risk goes up once in a while no big deal right\nTo show for nice by Dr\nRobert Martin\nScorsese isn't a six minute injury here the national key word and testing nine five one\nNight or your shot one thousand dollars\nMuch\nMore hands on ABC Los Angeles born toning\nCumulus station\nThe migrants war continues I'm having a ... now that the Saudis admit journalist ... died in their Istanbul consulate Saudi Arabian foreign minister Ali ... Fox News finding answers as to why will take time\nThat's number one we want him to relax we call your retirement your second childhood without parental supervision okay so we want to make sure that a ... you have financial peace of mind but then secondly we want your money to last as long as you do\nOkay so our financial goal there is that an philosophically how that would apply to you\nIs that\nYou retire we specialize to work with people who are retired retiring soon so when you retire it it's it's easy to be in the same mode that you've been for the last Thirty years as you've been accumulating which is growth mode and while growing is important keeping the grill\nThat you have accumulated is now even more important okay because if you suddenly take a huge loss like in a bear market or something like that or you make a bad business or a financial decision you make a mistake you do something you invest badly then what could happen is that you will not achieve the goals that we have right one is\nPeace of mind financially if you just lost your money you you're you're done financially uh have peace of mind and then secondly that your money last as long as you do to be hard to do that if you take large losses\nSo that ties directly into our whole philosophy of managing money for clients and I think it should be your so if you're retired or retiring suits you should be thinking in that mode so how do you build a company that's going to last a hundred years how you build something that had ... and and and in your life it could be how do you build a legacy that indoors\nWell the important thing is that you need to have what ... what are what what I've called core values what are the things that you scan for\nYou know what are the things that you say these are ... and they stand the test of time in other words a hundred years from now they will be as true then as they are today\nAnd in your family what I Would say is these are your morals these are what you your your values you know what what what makes what what are your beliefs what are the things that you teach your kids your grandchildren that are important if they're going to have a successful life\nOkay so in our for our we have ten core values and I just want to tell you about core value number one first and then a core value number six of core value number one is\nThe right thing to do is always the right thing to do this one was taught to me by my mom\nAnd uh every time I talked to my mom and I had a moral dilemma or I had a you know a question like that her answer was Kenny the right thing to do is always the right thing to do and I hated her for doing that because\nI wanted her to give me the answer and she would say if if you have to ask you already know what the answer is you already know what the right thing to do is just do that and you'll always be okay so that's the first thing always do the right thing to do is always the right thing to do\nThis the core value number six is never sacrificed honesty for growth\nAnd what I mean by that is you know everybody wants to grow everybody wants to succeed everybody wants to you know have more money or had more prestige or you know I have a successful family or whatever it may be but never ever ever since the sacrifice honesty in the pursuit of that\nNow in our world is a financial advisory firm you know I think it's all about your ethics it's about ... never putting somebody else in front of you it's about what helps somebody else eventually will help you in the in the process and not disclosing everything\nOffice skating the truth promising returns that you can't deliver all those kinds of things are not telling somebody about the downside of what their their investment strategy is all those kinds of things are sacrificing honesty for growth and if you do that will happen is eventually it'll come back to get you\nYou know so in in your life when you're looking at\nHow how do I get from one place to another you want to you want to improve your career you want to do something you know ... if you if you sacrifice honesty and the pursuit of whatever that is it will eventually catch up with you and you and you know if it's for example just if you lied on your resume to get a job\nAnd you did get the job eventually they'll figure out that you lied on the resume and they'll fire you for it so sacrificing honesty to get the growth that you want\nNever works in the long run I mean it it just doesn't and it doesn't in our world either so we have a very strict policy that you will never sacrificed honesty\nTo to get a new client or to keep a client or whatever we disclose everything warts and all we want you to know everything about us we want to know all the fees involved we want to know what's wrong with what we do what's right with what we do so you make a fully informed decision and we never have to apologize for anything\nNow one of the things that uh I Am not going

business now for twenty\nNine years and I've been a certified financial planner for the last Nineteen marvelous wonderful and very exciting years and boy how has this year Ben and exciting one\nWith all the stuff that's been going on and all of the idea that we talk about on this show these are the same ideas that we talk about with our beloved and most valued clients we not work with over a thousand families in forty three states\nAnd that we cherish them we value them we just enjoy the responsibility that we have to to help them with their finances to be there to guide\nAnd a recently uh the barons named him walk your paypal host one of the top one hundred financial advisors in the United states [noise]\nYes and actually for the sixth year in a row and that again is all because of our clients so thank you guys I Hope those if you listen to show or having a fantastic weekend I Hope everything is just coming up roses for you and I this week a I'm a I'm Talking about\nSo [laughter]\nYeah yes and in forty three states which is a insane and also a you know recently uh barons named Moran you're faithful host one of the top one hundred financial advisors in the United states actually for the sixth year in a row\nAnd uh I Know for a fact that if it wasn't for our clients they wouldn't even know who I Am barons\nAnd so therefore all your clients are listening right now thank you and those of you who are not clients I appreciate you listening also now on this program where we are talking about\nOur philosophy of a of a business and I think that are the philosophy of of running a business is the same philosophy that you can apply in your own life\nAnd so I think that this week that this week's show was a little bit different than what I normally do but I thought it would be beneficial for those of you listening to kind of get some some some of my thoughts of of uh of how you do that and and to kind of frame it\nAs I mentioned we we work with a thousand families and if you think about how many people that is\nYou know when you think of a family of grandparents children grandchildren and great grandchildren I mean it and and spouses of all those people and and all of a sudden you're talking about a lot of people that we are responsible for helping with their finances and helping guide them and all those kinds of things\nAnd so it it dawned on me a few years ago that I just didn't grows we had the responsibility to make sure that our firm stays around you know the old thing is you don't want your financial adviser for him to die before you do so [laughter]\nSo therefore uh we create it will be called vision one hundred which is we want our firm to be as strong or stronger than it is today a hundred years from now and if that's the case then uh\nYou know our clients that we are currently serving will be taken care of and so well they're down line family members et cetera et cetera so how do you do that well you have to build a company that has enduring core values just as a result of my studying of lots of companies that have succeeded to last over a hundred years\nAnd I think family so to apply this to you personally\nFamilies that have succeeded that have been healthy and have endured as well over the years are ones that have very strong morals and values that they all it here too\nAnd those are taught from one generation to the next parent teachers child child teaches a grant or their child et cetera et cetera\nAnd so I Want to share with you core value number nine okay so core value number nine is make a client every day that is our noble obligation\nSo what does that mean well that sounds kind of like okay we'll go out and sell something and and it is I Do believe that we do need to have new clients obviously and and the reason why I Do that is because I think what we do is noble if we help people to be financially secure I think that's very noble what we do but in the broader context and how would you would apply to in your life\nYou know uh my wife and I are about to celebrate our thirty third year of marriage\nAnd I believe in making my wife\nMy wife all over again\nEvery time I every time with her\nOkay I make her a client every day my goal is to make her my wife again every day I never take for granted that because we're married you know the old song that you know I don't need to keep telling you I Love you all the time I told you that back then if it changes I'll tell you\nOkay so now you got to keep keep doing that making a client every day so we visit with a client when they come in to visit with us we want them to leave feeling like you know what I made the right decision in choosing money matters\nWe want anybody that comes to a talked with it is not inclined to say you know what I Want to be a client\nSo in your life with your family with your friends your business associates make them a client every time it's your noble obligation what you do is noble and therefore you should take the time to have that person understand that every single time\nDon't ever take anybody for granted anything for granted because the moment you do as in a marriage you take a marriage for granted guess what that marriage will go way you take your children for granted your children will go away\nYou take your health for granted it'll go away All right so you don't take anything for granted make yourself healthy everyday strengthen your relationships everyday everything and that's why we believe is our noble obligation to make a client every day so that's our core value number not\nNow one of the things I'd like to invite you to do is to become a client of money matters if you are not and what you can do is you can go to our website is money matters dot
