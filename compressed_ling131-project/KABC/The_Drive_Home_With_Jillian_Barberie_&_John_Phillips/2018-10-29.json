three if you end up being colors nine or Twenty one sorry about that hit us up at free O T H class dot com and see if you can scores passes there\nThere is we stay on kind of this consistency track because of this this consistency conversation I should say\nYou know you talked a little bit of a a little bit about shorting and that is a great opportunity to make to make money as the markets are going down what are some of the other ways that people can diverse into different directions you know we hear diversification as far as I Do have a little commodities have little stocks have little bonds but how 'bout diversification as far as different directional vehicles go\nWell you could always sit here and say we know that when the markets go down there's usually people pulling out of the markets are the Martin he's going somewhere either can go into gold it can go into bonds the cool thing that our students learn here as it doesn't matter your background your age what you've done before\nWe teach them how to read a chart so it's a stock chard bond chart gold shark\nThey're able to start learning how to trade in the beauty of learning what shorting is is that again a lot of people been told their whole lives when the markets go down it's a bad thing will last February\nGoldman Sachs made two hundred million dollars in one day by simply shortening the market now that imagine that we had a little piece of I'm not going to be greedy right you know what if you start to learn how to treat like the banks do then it's amazing\nThat all of a sudden you can start learning a skill that can make you money and not have to sit there and think about a second job or to get into a bit later but\nOne of the ways I look at this and I get this analogy all the time when people are just simply trading one direction or they're waiting for the market to always go up it's like a car imagine that you were told you can get in a car tomorrow and you can drive somewhere but you can't put the car and reverse\nYou got to go on a lot of circles eventually going to get there but you can wait till a lot of time energy and money getting to the same place if you simply had all the tools to get you there faster so a lot of what I'm seeing our students learning the first time is it they're becoming\nDirection early ... they don't care if it goes up down sideways as long as the markets are moving they can learn how to make money and what a lot of them are seeing right now is they could create more freedom for themselves because they're able to make money no matter where the markets go\nYeah absolutely and I love I Love the analogy of the car there's so many so many other analogies that we could pull into this that in in I always say in real life you know outside of the are investing life in our normal everyday life we there's no way we buy a car that didn't go in reverse right but so many times we find ourselves in investments that only have one direction or one avenue where they can profit\nYou know it's it's the same thing you go back to our you know go back to high school education where was your stock picking class where was how to balance a checkbook class writes a lot of the check but\nI just dated myself victory over there but it is it's true though I mean we we really didn't have that stuff and so we're left to to rely on the quote unquote professionals truly guide us through this process\nWhere unfortunately they make a commission off of these transactions and I say unfortunately kind of tongue in cheek there because that's okay with me that they make a commission that's that's what they do for a living your real estate brokers make a commission when they sell real estate so stockbrokers should naturally make a commission when they sell stocks\nBut when we buy a home it is up to is up to the individual to make sure they're buying the right home for them in the right market place in the right area that the right payment the right everything is up to the person to do it\nThe broker just completes the transaction and unfortunately it's up to the person to also make sure that they're making the appropriate decision when it comes to their investing but when it really boils down to about Ninety nine percent of the world\nHasn't ... they they spend more time analyzing the menu when they go out to dinner than they do analyzing what investments to to select\nIt it just put this behind the eight ball and it's something that I think if we did a quick give away with a few more these passes we could probably make a dent in and help people start making better investment decision I think it's a great idea let's do it All right well right now I've got a half the class coming up in your area\nThey have to take

Jacobs director of instructor development and ... structure it online training academy really shuts of life on earth can return to the market is one of my favorite topics low talking about consistency in the market\nSo many times I'll run into different traders different investors and they've had some success they've had some success in the market but they really had a hard time duplicating it and that ends up being the key\nReally in anything that we do is how can we make money consistently how can we make money over and over and the financial markets are no different it's all about that consistent approach\nBeing able to make money as the markets are going up being able to make money as the markets are going down\nAnd also being able to make money as the markets are going sideways we need to be generating income whether it's income for today or income for tomorrow in this segment we're going to spend a little bit more time\nTalking about the income side of things but whether you're just tuning in maybe your first time listening or maybe you've been with us for the whole show get excited the best is yet to come I learned a lot of our listeners like we're talking about are are are looking to replace their income with trading investing some are looking to upgrade their lifestyles with a little additional income\nAnd and you could even call it maybe that that supplemental side that you were talking about a few minutes ago and and some are looking for this to go kind of beyond that supplemental and be their primary source of income\nAnd I've even heard people say that they're number one goal is to be able to fire their boss now now whether they're going to or not you know being in that position where you can make that call you know that starts to be that primary source of income but what are some of the key things that you guys work with students who are looking to supplement or they're looking to even build this was a primary source of income is a great\nRight you know what I find with a lot of our students they first come into the academy taking they want to make a lot of money when reality what they're looking for is freedom we've been doing this for over twenty\nFor Christmas and she abruptly passed away and that's when I you know I knew I needed to do something different of needed time I needed my life\nAnother student says ...\nYou can

ABC News [noise]\nYou're listening to how we're trading radio [noise] welcome back if you're just tuning in you miss Larry Jacobs director of and structure of element instructor it online trading shed some light on multiple streams of income we talked\nA little bit about passive income we talked a little bit about active income and then specifically spent a lot of time on that multiple streams of income side of things in the financial freedom to that can really generated I Love the ... the the conversation about the the average millionaire having five plus streams of income\nAnd you can break that down into different directions but but even the whole conversation we're having a few minutes ago Larry about about building the skill first the skill comes first the income comes later and so many times we want the income\nWe want the income now without the skill right I mean how many times have you talked to a ... a a surgeon and they said oh you know what I'm going to do a little bit of surgery here I'm In a practice heart surgery so that I can pay for medical school and then develop the skill it just doesn't really work that way we've got to have the skill first\nOtherwise that operating table can be a dangerous spot to be laying now unfortunately it ends up being that same ... that same conversation when it comes to our money and I had somebody say oh well this isn't life or death\nBut really when we're talking about our finances it is our financial life or death so we really want to take this\nJust as seriously we work too hard for this money to have it not heading in the right direction on a consistent basis and this retirement money that we want to talk about in this segment is exactly that it's in a situation where we're usually just buying every other friday right just because it's payday and we've been told every other friday we're just supposed to put some money in our retirement accounts\nAnd it will just slowly growing and all that is true in a polish marketing a bearish market which was what you were just touching on his right as we are going to break that\nKind of detrimental side of things we can continue to buy into assets that are deteriorating and it's a lot like lighting our retirement accounts on fire or at least a little portion of our paycheck\nWhen we're throwing it into a deteriorating asset so just a few of the things that we want to want to keep in mind and one of the things I really love to have you Larry shed some light on in here because we do have a lot of our students\nWho are really out there trading they do have their retirement accounts and and when I talked to our students I'm hearing a lot of people say you know number one they either don't have enough money to retire on you know our number to those that do they're not quite sure really how to continue the growth\nAnd to protect the downside right and that's really that point you were getting at a before he took the break and so I'd love to give you kind of give you a floor here to take that back over voter some of the things you and your instructor team are doing with investors to help make sure they have income for retirement\nRight and the number one mistake that most people may cause they think they can do this on their own then they wind up coming back and realizing they need the education so we start talking to our students about is how they can start creating a strategy for success when it comes to the retirement\nRight now you know it's funny when the market started to go down this week a lot of my friends call me and they started going what does this mean they started getting all nervous now one student emailed me and said Larry do you see this is a bad thing in fact\nMost people who know what they're doing they're elated that this is starting to happen most people waiting ten years for another market correction why because historically the markets always tend to correct about every ten years or so last major when we had was obviously in two thousand eight here we are in two thousand Eighteen\nWhat's now becoming more important than ever is it took people about six years to recover from the last correction people out there listening if you don't have six years right now well you're planning to retire\nYou don't have anything saved right now you need to figure out how to create a plan to help protect you and a lot of our students come in the door really nervous about I don't have enough money to start well you know what they're doing right it's pretty fascinating they're starting to learn how to trade\nOther asset types like futures in St Louis and they're saving that money from trading and they're starting to fund their retirement accounts so again a lot of people first thing they always say is what I got the mortgage I got the kids' college up on\nTheir retirement always comes last so we start to teach her students read out of the gate\nThat they can come up with a plan they understand most importantly what you need is because a lot of people the one size fits all does not work when it comes to retirement you can't just do this you first have to figure out what your needs are\nLearning how to manage that need most importantly how to learn some really important risk management and how to protect that money\nAnd then at the end of the day you will have enough to retire on based on what you need not someone else just telling you what you need\nYou you're talking about the kind of the cycles with the markets go through the big us in the big dams and we do generally have a crash about every and we call 'em crashes but we do generally have a nice big drop in the markets about every ten years\nAnd one of the things about that is if you go back and look at um how often\nThey're forty fifty sixty percent drops and so\nKind of that average uh that we can expect is about a fifty percent if you go back into two thousand and eight and you kind of measure that yet about fifty percent dropped Becky ... about fifty eight percent you go back into their early to thousands fifty say the same thing and so if we come to here we say OK here's here that's kind of what we can expect again that's kind of the new normal\nBut the thing that I went through with my father about uh we uh we had a conversation about this you know back in about two thousand and eight\nOr you know we're talking about drops in the market we're talking about drops and accounts and and one of the things that we're we're kind of walking through was\nIf somebody had a fifty dollar if somebody had a hundred thousand dollar account\nThey lost fifty thousand they lost fifty percent will they lost fifty thousand so now they're account value of that fifty thousand that happened in one year it ... happened I think it was fourteen months total riots that happened in pretty much just a year it went down when\nThey take the average rate of return on the way up and let's just be very very generous let's say somebody is averaging ten percent on the Web that's ten years just to get back to break even 'cause when you take a hundred and you turn it into fifty to take fifty\nTurn it into a one hundred requires a one hundred percent return on our money and so one of the conversation we were talking about was how long does it take the average person to really even get back to break even after going through it'd be a catastrophic drop like that\nSo one of the scariest things right now is that people just don't have a plan that don't know what to do they haven't been educated and so unless you're really sitting there thinking about this and saying yourself fool me once shame on you fool me twice shame on me and\nAlbert Einstein had one of the greatest quotes was the definition of insanity is doing the same thing over and over again\nIt's amazing how many people are not willing to spend a little bit of money to get themselves educated to invest in themselves\nInstead of taking his big roller coaster ride and think about it Ryan going back to two thousand and eight if you knew when to get out of the market and locked in profit\nAnd then in two thousand nine you were sitting in cash it could've been one of the greatest time of your life right now to leave it at three hundred percent increase since two thousand nine yet most people had no money because they lost it all in the correction\nYup absolutely one of the things we can do to help a few people really start to identify where to get in and where to get out where to protect where to grow as you get 'em out to one of the half day classes you ready for a little give away let's do it right now we've got to have to class coming up in your area and a half the costs are we going to see exactly that how to generate more income how to keep their retirement account growing\nHow do I identify these turning points up down or sideways\nSo you'll know when to buy and you could know when to sell you could you could go back to the old know when to hold them know when to fold 'em type of a conversation on just a second you have a chance to win a set of passes or one of these half day classes to get your phone's ready and if you are driving right now is a great time to pull over including ... year passes is going to be our professional insiders kit that is packed\nWith lessons from some of our top

there\nNow Larry I always I always said everybody when and I tried to said on the show as much as I can well you have two dollars or two million dollars that the classes were you really get to see exactly what it takes to really get that money working for you and you were talking about it earlier as far as having our money working smarter for us and that's just doing the right things with our money\nYou know we've always also been talking about the market's being an all time highs and the risks that we have in there and then my dentist office I bring this up a lot on the show but it just it's so true inside of the financial markets\nThat my dentist offices a kid shout out to Dr are buckle there's a plaque on the wall and every examination room where it says\nIs one is not enough for you need more incentive for you to believe that he is in in that direction liberating violence against women is\nSaid now I think I think the I think they need to call out\nOr they won't do the same thing when you an example you say about that but that but that's the only one well there was only then rational share\nA story it went away pretty sad\nYou know why because Bernie Sanders immediately came out and condemned and condemned anyone will violent act\nForgiven just argue that you know Trump came out to give the death penalty sky media leave finally know immediately said that but\nThen he also had to say but I'm the media outlets\nPlaying both sides I think that's a safe place for us to remain became ... but I also think that we should hold the president's to a higher stand okay that

she was so proud of it but she mocked up the deployment was not a real diploma from the school\nAnd then she said that it's fake news and her husband and had a cardiac event\nI don't know if that's a

responsibility\nFor what I did it's a bad trend well\nThe Republican candidate for office in Florida Melissa Howard she's apologizing and the headline is she admitted she lied about her educational background and frankly a diploma\nBecause the school came out and explain that they don't even give a degree in which he claims to have gotten to the foreman degree and so here's her apology\nI Would like to apologize to my family and my supporters for this situation it was not my intent to deceive or mislead anyone I made a mistake in saying that I completed my degree\nWhat I did was wrong and so

was long for her to do All right it was a really long if\nWe what we would agree with you but it but it's interesting that he brings up that point thank you Larry is that Maxine didn't continue the rhetoric and you're asking Mr Trump to stop the rent those continue rats rabbits and yeah so that they tend to get your point a little bit yeah right\nRight after a shooting just pull it together like just take a land phone something\n[laughter] something about um like they're ... I'm Sorry in June of reasonable aren't very strong\nOne very much so on everything\nDo I mean I just usually put up\nThe most benign like little sort of lovely will comment on was it was a\nTwitter Instagram yeah Rahm manager there and when she got ... teams of horror I've just said hey can we all the Americans and come together and all along that I'll be affected by that\nSo the three of them were were vice people on the plane yes yes\nYes and so now you're hearing all the personal stories and they're so it's just heartbreaking\nI'm running people were killed in the ... shooting the shooters forty six year old Robert Bowers joining us with more details on what happened in the Keystone State over the weekend is ABC News correspond a jury bold lander who's actually live in ... ... do much for joining us\n[noise] my pleasure actually ... ... when a call ... their Jerry\n[noise] a part of me wants to say it might be shot him\nYeah that was an all girls' college okay Adam ...\nA big one you know I'm happen to see it while I was little by little you know being able to get his church downtown it's set up a monumental campus or a entitled little so the school as well as well as University of Pittsburgh Medical off the end of a lot of other\nA higher education so\n[noise] so walk us through just exactly what happened over the weekend\nWell I'm only a doors are pretty close at this synagogue political is because Saturday\nThey have the doors open and a ... a walked in and um it was kind of ... meeting in different parts of the building and uh you know pretty uh [noise] you know just went from one to the other\nAnd the you know this was a a one of the rabbi normally would not have a cell phone but by taking training in a security consultant so you know this is a ... a cell phone and he recounts that earlier today\nHow you know he called on on a ... it's\nA at his so this would take us started eight were backed up and it seems like to point out the early ... the back of others public thought the ones who the fuck you was able to you know he didn't see that she wouldn't be heard it was ... he was able to help get out\nOr the one on August ... of the eight or ... or killed ... and ah you know the girls and then went to the rest of the building and and and you know just pick people off your account at the story of those who\nGo in the stores alien or an advantage to avoid being shot an escape or the rabbi said he was in a a a safe place so it was extricate it by the tactical police when they came and a ... he was questioned about this a couple of days ago said well\nYou know maybe have a good luck would have made a difference\nLikely not a\nForeign concept responded were shot so what these guys are of course yes the\nPops spot it was shot a shot on the exchange of fire with the suspect as he was exiting but building a you know as for the off guard you know a suspect ... Gluck a weapons uh you know it all on guard does not have\nNow and that is silly response I mean an armed guard half of them are mall security they're not response in like a cop or a swat unit I mean these guys responded and they're trained for this and they got shot so enough of that rhetoric it's ridiculous I ...\nI mean click click click clearly it you know\nLook ordered have dissuaded ... good question we don't do ... one of the things that have the you know the police officials said they did not know or if he ... the synagogue ahead of time although the setting during the week is a little different for a week at what you know the doors are open so that\nPeople can come in and pray there is a little more secure the doors are closed and I think there's only one in ... during the week said a little\nDifferent situation but nevertheless ah gained access or whether he targeted this we don't know why do we know about ... or\nWell you know you heard this persona where the ah anti Semitic remarks and er he did the same uh verbally or during the attack but\nYou know ... and it almost sounds like a cliche when people talk laborers they're all stars that he's the guy and it it's you know it's this is not the first\nTime we've heard it seems to be just sort of a status thing where the neighbors are like\nYou know oh it can be this guy at least the sky but there's a very quiet and uh the neighbor next door so that you know he said he was a truck driver and the climate basically to to store things they say about was Carl is radio but\nYou know basically kept to himself except for what he wrote a book\nWhen friends with him on Lucia media because typically people who are willing to post stuff like that what we read people's posts without being their friend you can read you know if it's a social network of people you can get messages from people that you don't know which ... you know let me turn to on their privacy settings yeah right and of\nCourse that you know he he posted them on this website gab which is up and take down\nWhich has been a four white nationalist than others ah you know advocating or a hate crimes and and that kind of thing and so uh you know\nWhy authorities didn't see these postings excellent question we don't know the answer to that because the police that he was not notice and so there you know there's a lot of a lot of\nStrains that are going to have to be told to try to piece together\nA an accurate picture of his past and and exactly what prompted all this\nAll right Jerry bowed lander Kate ABC News corresponded live in rural hill things so much for joining us Jerry\nLet's go ahead and bring Dr Kelly victory into this conversation because Dr Kelly I have to tell you to a point that Julian made earlier is a point I was thinking about over the weekend and I reference back to a conversation that we had with you some time ago\nWhen we were talking about the suicide rate and the old opioid raid and how you believe that social media plays a role in in spikes in both of those two things\nWhen I look at the shooting and I look at what this guy was posting on social media I Wonder if there's almost a component of social media component to what we saw play out yesterday [noise]\nI I think I I think that there is and as you know I I'm a if nothing else I'm a student of disasters I spend my life doing that and certainly active shooter scenes I spend a lot of time dissecting after the fact in hopes that we can learn from the past and and do better going forward\nThere are clearly some things about this particular massacre that are very very common um including the fact that he was a male and those sorts of things and importantly that\nThere were warning signs it is a myth that people just snap\nViolence does not just happen there are almost always warning signs that eighty to Ninety percent of all these shootings there somebody at least knew that the person was planning this and that's where social media plays and\nAbsolutely some of these people are have the persona of being a loner meaning they don't interact face to face with a lot of people their neighbors their coworkers think of them as quiet but it is not\nQuiet when you are out there perhaps hosting to thousands and thousands of people tens of thousands perhaps of people who are you and your stuff on line so a lot of these folks who are disenfranchised or in their daily lives are actually very much connected\nIn their own worked minds because of the number of people who follow them or like their post or give them feedback in these on line yeah social media sites so it's really on it's a very different because\nThey they don't eat this person probably didn't think of himself doesn't think of themselves as quote a loner ... instead of himself as having\nA whole lot of support out\nThere and you bring up an interesting point were years ago if you were a Nazi sympathizer white supremacy is if you were you kind of went in your bedroom and read books or you didn't have online now you've societies and you also people that are like minded\nAnd they give you you know you're all kinds of ... yeah and so this particular diluted this gab um you know social online plays a big got taken down\nI was looking in researching some of the stuff that they posted is of course it's hateful but do you found out like minded people with the same rhetoric and the same hate and you think well OK I've got a family here and uh you're so right there's there's always some way to trace it back um but I think yeah\n... and the ... the problem with some of the social media stuff is that people are very happy to jump on board and get huge end up if they think we will do some yeah there\nIf you think about you know getting together to K. K. K. rally say you are obligated then you are a participant in it and therefore guilty but if you go on the line and you simply say yeah that's a great idea Jillian do that\nAnd I just sort of push you I feel I get a sense of accomplishment if and when you do something I feel that I'm part of that that I was a piece of it but I Hope to cause a damning but I'm not\nGuilty and so it allows a whole lot of people to participate in the violence or participate in the effort to do something well only one person ends up being held accountable so I Do think that there's that aspect of this and that um it's\nThat were meant to help treat mentally ill\nAnd that was passed in two thousand and four so after nearly Fifteen Years prop sixty three the mental health services are\nBooming is with dollars were steered the counties across the state\nBut massive sums are unspent when we need the money to be spent I mean they could have done something all along\nExcept the way the rules are written how this money can be spent and how it can be processed and then you know some colleges are nervous because when times are good the money's recruiting but they're holding some back for for bedtime so it's almost like money is out there but these groups have no idea no oversight and how is that it's not like it is that\n\nI Know you just say that on purpose [laughter] I Know you know I Know you know a friend and I can't wait\nTo see Wednesday we have to change voting TV is the\nBest pod cast oh don't they Steve Edwards Dorothy Lucien Jillian host okay LA all the dish all the fun all the craziness\nDownload the latest okay LA podcast right now it's free and uncensored downloaded subscribe right now when I tunes tune in and Kate ABC dot com [noise]\nAll right Dr Kelly standing by she's going to analyze the response to the big shooting in Pittsburgh over the weekend don't go anywhere we'll also take your phone calls at eight hundred to two two KBC if you went away and one eight hundred to two to five to to to the right now it's time for headlines [noise]\nABC News is alive and the local at three thirty I'm Jeff will and authorities are investigating a deadly officer\nInvolved shooting in Hollywood that took place inside the gym locker room you officers\nResponded to the twenty four hour fitness on sunset inkling of boulevards around eight o'clock in the morning after an LAPD spokeswoman says a man got physical with an employee\nIndividual was able to gain control of one of the ... the individual and what struck by gunfire and went to a charming city deceased here at the same\nOne officer was transported to the hospital for moderate injuries and it's not clear what led up to the fight between police and the suspect who's described as a man in his thirties and it's unknown at the live nearby or was homeless James Rojas KABC news\nOf man charged with shooting eleven worshipers to death at Pittsburgh synagogue on Saturday made his first court appearance today correspondent McGill mark as reports\nRobert powers in courts cost in in a wheelchair or physically charged twenty nine count journal from murder to obstructing the free exercise religious beliefs a hate crime the government may seek the death penalty\nPresident Trump and first lady Melania Trump will travel to Pittsburgh tomorrow the Florida Man who's accused of Sunday and at least fourteen pipe bombs are prominent Democrats and CNN says are say oc made his first court appearance today corresponded Rosa Flora's reports from outside the Miami courthouse\nThe judge informed him of his charges after a very brief discussion the judge determined that there would be a pre trial detention hearing and status conference hearing scheduled for friday\nMeanwhile a possible fifteenth package bomb address the CNN in Atlanta was intercepted to day at a male facility in Atlanta talk radio seven Ninety\n...

the doctor's oh I've already got a picture of it go ahead I'm Sorry Kelly victory starts going victory who you can get on Twitter at Dr Kelly victory so Dr Kelly there was a shootout at this Pittsburgh shooting over the weekend with the cops officers were injured four\nOf them yes and eleven people exit a perishing in this senseless attack\nUh what's your take on the response on the police response to this shooting\nAs well as you as you know I Do a deep dive analysis of all of these events afterwards including very importantly the timeline of how things play out again not to be critical of\nTheir response I uh but to really see is there anything they could have done more quickly or better and what can we learn from them this was interesting because again this as you said it was a shootout towards please\nThese have got to be terrifying incidents for anyone in law enforcement to respond to their completely unpredictable and unstable\nThat is the definition of an active shooter in ... there there are still on going threat that's what an active shooter seeing means it has not been contained the first report here we know came and the shooter entered their at nine fifty the call first call to at least was four minutes later and they responded\nIn six minutes which is which is certainly reasonable what's interesting is when they got there at ten the began almost immediately to take fire\nSo they're hunkered down and swat is called swat the the job of the first arriving officers\nTo stop the threat their job is to get into that building as quickly as possible and stop the shooter now if they're taking fire they may be held in place and not be able to move and that's what it sounds like happen swat was cold and interestingly the swamp did not get there\nUntil twelve minutes after so now you're ... you're twenty minutes into this event but at times swat\nArrived at ten twelve\nWhat is somewhat um concerning to me and I would need to really well we'll need to look carefully at the details swamp did not enter the building until twelve twenty nine seven teen minutes later that's an extraordinarily long delay for ... what\nIs it because they're not the end of the building\nAnd I'm just I I have no idea of tactical and how they do this but is it because for officers were already shot at that point and they thought maybe there's two shooters maybe there's three oh my gosh you know like they had the world cares that\nThey said they're absolutely unpredictable but this is almost if you think all the way back\nTo Nineteen Ninety nine to Columbine High school in Colorado which is the first big active shooter seen that people can really call it a mind generally um that was one where back in those days the protocol was to have everybody law enforcement stay outside\nReally sounds like the opposite of this marker\n... eighty they'd most are to talk to someone without noise today\nTake a look under your bed\nFind stuff under there what about jobs no snow try your basement there is a terrible profit overall you're not so into anymore for perfectly good laptop that hasn't seen your lap\nAnd months and even more stuff but still no job

who is accused of mailing more than a dozen pipe bombs not active pipe bombs and that's what worries me okay and worry me but if they were active I mean he could do they have the death penalty in Georgia I think so\nRight well he better not ever get out of prison yeah but you know our our our laws it's a joke like the fact that they were but nine they weren't actually\nActive bombs can work in his favor which sucks and those who were just ... some people\nThis guy I was ...

solid a Democrat that it's you know tough on crime and you know somebody more down the line\nBut why is it that this isn't even a Republican or Democrat yeah it's just a politician thing or potential politician thing\nOf them want to look ambitious none of them want to say it would be governor yeah when president\nI guess they want to hold their cards close to them and they don't want ... of probably giving you know they don't want to give their enemy any sort\nSome insight but you know talk to someone you talked to a a six year old girl who's an ice skater and you say why are you doing this\nI Want to go to the Olympics and what a gold medal yeah like any other aspect of life but he paused very upfront about their ambition nobody ambitions I don't think anyone's honest in politics too you know I think they're all liars both sides\nOut ... got the last laughing to\nMegan Kelly disaster because sources connected with the network is telling TMZ rogue or will be back of the ... acre chair during the ... hour after being replaced by making Kelly let my camera and haul replace making ... it was the two of them\nOh so what else forget ... ... that's ... ... what about Kamron home where she was fine he makes billions of dollars a year he still has a job who cares about you know they shuffle you around big deal they did that to me at Fox who did it to Steve\nThey move you out of it happens you still get paid your paycheck you just sit quietly and smile they fired town hall and making last well she saw the writing on the wall right near the bill bring her back\n[noise] I don't know they don't like to listen they don't like to make admit mistakes do you think Megan Kelly will go to Fox I don't think Fox will have her but I could be wrong because I'm hearing that Laughlin\nMurdoch is running Fox and he's not really did you see the article written about it\nHe's not really a hands on guy kind of comes to the meetings and he listens 'cause he wants to be respectful because he's never done this position before he had differences with Roger ales and so he's trying to not sort of um rock the boat too much right now in with Bill shine out he's sort of sitting back and letting things and there's a woman a right underneath\nThem than Scott I'm yeah ... yes well into their ratings are fine it's one thing if you leave a network and the ratings tank and write a oh my God we made a big mistake they did that with Jay Leno Jay Leno lessons Tonight Show they brought Conan O'Brien and the ratings what the toilet and they said we got to bring Jay back\nThat didn't happen at Fox one Megan Kelly left the ratings what\nAbout when they brought back Jay Leno which they did how are the ratings they never they never got back to what they want to ... they were okay yeah so I was in the although he okay to ten o'clock when they put them and that's why that's why I ... yeah that was bad but then when he went back to his regular he was good everything was back to go to satisfy up as his own when they asked\nFox News if they would consider bring her back Fox News said we're very happy with their light up yeah I Do in your Megan Kelly would you go back to Fox if you were a big time primetime hosts to go\nIn the middle of Fox audience will respond her I don't think they like or uh yeah I mean they used to love her well they look at her you know that's the sad part about audiences are fickle they are very loyal and if they feel that you portray them which I think this audience might um as opposed to just sort of like well she had to go with the\nMoney and the opportunity were I mean that's just the way it is she's got three kids she's the breadwinner and you take opportunity where we're where it happens because it will always happen again so you kinda have to spread your wings and she was never going to do anything more than she was doing at Fox already and this was an opportunity for her to see okay it didn't work out but somewhat\nAnd TV watching his had big trouble too it's like part of your routine a lot of people have that with sixty minutes on Sunday we watch sixty minutes starts the winding down process of\nThe week that's true I watch the um the morning show there I like that yeah you have my coffee I watched that that sort of a ritual bill Marr is my friday night ritual and then that on Sunday Morning and that's it\nBut if they were preempted because they're showing a tennis match or a golf tournament or something like I find something else yeah and I bet you you may get out of the habit of doing it the next week or the week after when your program is back maybe if if ... if it was an ongoing thing yes\nThat's what happened to baseball when they went on strike in the nineties I remember that one of the habit of watching\nIt was so weird because my my ex was back and it was August and we're here in California and he was surfing and we're living in Huntington Beach and it was just what you're doing here it was such a weird novel I was exciting because we were you know for me man for him it was very weird yeah always gone yeah\nI can imagine Mike Tyson is shopping a new TV show based on the boxer's life has been marijuana grower marketer ...\nTyson will start new scripted comedy called rolling with the punches\nFormer heavyweight champion shooting but showed his Tyson ranch office in El Segundo which drugs Ito reprised his real life roles are my bodyguard and Russell Peters playing as usual as best friend so and so it's a show like Larry David curb your enthusiasm is loosely based on
