propositions and I feel good I did my ballot last week\nAnd it took for ever to go through these propositions\nSo we're going to spend a few minutes on each one to let you know just exactly what's in there because they are trying to trick you so we're going to make sure you have all the information you need before you cast her ballot\nIf for fifty nine one more hour coming up on the drive home John Philips and elections ... infant Julian talk radio seven Ninety KABC\nFor six nine three here the national key word and testing nine five eight one\nNight or your shot one thousand dollars\nAnd the Supreme Court judges of which there are seven and they're about a hundred appellate court judges they are appointed by the governor and they just stand for what's called retention election and that's the way on our ballots were just voting yes or no they're not against anybody but then\nUh for the superior court judges the vast majority of them are appointed if they fill a vacancy but the vast vast majority of them\nWe'll never appear in a ballot because you don't show up in a ballot if you run unopposed and it is absolutely against the culture to run against an incumbent judge\nI had a bunch of those on my ballot the last time superior court judges were there were signs yard signs up all over and they they were buying the sleep mailers and they were actively campaigning\nYeah which is exactly why am I Want my judges to do when really their job should be just looking at the facts\nAnd applying the law is sometimes not particularly popular thing by the way and really they should be focused\nOn not on how will this play in for the slate mailer crowd but is this the correct decision under the law and so one thing before\nWe go on to other topics that I Do want to make sure your listeners know is if you do not vote for the appellate court judges or the Supreme Court judge judges it's counted as they know\nAnd so I think that it is important if you\nFeel that we should not be for instance constantly weighing in on whether or not these particular judges to be subject to a popularity contest that we allow them to see that uh we will vote yes\nAnd that they can stay secure in their jobs and again these are judges who are heavily vetted by a judicial counseling appointments there than nominated by the governor and then they're approved by judicial counsel on nominees\nBut every once in a while a bad one slipped through like the guy in northern California or I remember Ron climb in orange county who I think was doing something inappropriate sexually whether it was clearly porn or or something along those lines and he was coming up\nAgain and people voted him out of office so every once in a while if they had lifetime appointments you wouldn't be able to balance those people as easily\nWill so those two people are superior court judges and they would not have other ever stood for attention election and so what would happen if we really think we shouldn't have\nThem is we could recall them and I think you and I totally disagree on whether or not it was a good idea to recall judge Aaron ... this so called Stanford swimmer judge or you could have someone run against them so\nIn in the federal level I mean it's incredibly rare but there is a mechanism you can impeach a federal judge\nAll right let's get to the propositions here because professor ... has has really gone a deep dive into these things which is difficult to do because I still not convinced there an English how 'bout prop one which is blogs for housing programs\n[noise] yeah one thing I Want to say is that it's really important when you look at all the propositions to figure out which ones are put on by the legislature and which ones are put on by the initiative process so prop one was put on by the legislature as he said it would authorize the state to self four billion dollars in bonds and\nThis would be used for housing programs and you talked a little bit about how the attorney\nGeneral ... helps to name these propositions and it's not really a non partisan\nA office and I would say this is an interesting one because it's named as if the\n... the money is going to help\nHouse military veterans and that's partly true but it's about a fourth of the billion so two billion would go to giving local governments low interest loans to help build affordable housing one billion goes to loan assistance for military veterans and one billion goes to existing housing programs across the state\nSo they took the most popular aspect of the bond and they were ...\nWere in a shocking to us we have with a sign of ... yeah yeah I was oh I Will react though on your in so I think that what we should both do maybe it's just stay home because we'll cancel each\nOther [laughter] prop ... using mental health funding for housing what is out one\nYes so um there's about a hundred and thirty four thousand homeless people on the streets of California and about a third\nAre seriously mentally ill and this is actually based on a dispute that deals with a um\nA proposition called proposition sixty three that was passed in two thousand four\nThat was the so called millionaires tax and it imposed a one percent tax on residents with an annual income over a million dollars\nAnd this is a fight over whether those funds can be used just for services which is what that ballot measure had suggested in two thousand four or whether it can also be used for construction\nThere's a court case that's currently pending that was stayed dealing with whether or not this could happen and the ballot proposition will essentially if we say yes use that a hundred and twenty million dollars per year for housing\nIt would um it ... the need for the court case it would decide it if we vote no then the judge will decide whether or not is permissible\nAnd the construction industry is the industry that really wants this road\n[noise] well I think the construction industry but also a number of people who believe that you don't get better living on the street and so that part of the solution of trying to solve homelessness is to get them out of your set off of the sidewalk and actually into permanent homes\nVoted no on that one too [laughter] how 'bout prop three witches bombs for water projects\n[noise] yeah this is an initiative so the first two were put on by the legislature this is um put on largely by a large agricultural businesses in the Central Valley and it asks the state to sell a point nine billion\nFor water and environmental projects and if this sounds familiar it's because in June of twenty Eighteen we actually approved a legislative measure which would sell bonds\nFor water and environmental projects but there was a group that felt like they were largely left out of that money and the construction projects that would be used for that money and that was largely big farmers in the Central Valley so they put this measure on the ballot\nMost um newspapers in California except for the Orange County register which I Know you are\nRight for have said no on ... three they say yes on one and two that the good public policy but no one in three because it looks like and if you look at the\nNewspaper endorsement or ... or a newspaper articles the phrase they use over and over his pay to play it looks like the Central Valley farmers putting this on\nBecause it's a lot cheaper for them to get this money from the state than it is for them to construct these projects on their own\nI wouldn't know on that one just as a reflects ... but I understand why the Central Valley once this on there because they they feel like San Francisco and LA pretty much just dominate things in Sacramento and they feel that they and their and their needs are just left out\n[noise] ah they do and there is something to that and so this is I mean a broader question which I Know you could talk about at length which is\nIs can water policy ever really be geographically it's kind of sector by sector or is water policy always a statewide issue and so part of the criticism of ... three is that it will require the state to sell bonds but it would really only benefit a small portion of estate\nBut you could argue the portion of the state that's been left out\nHow 'bout proposition for this bonds for children's hospitals\n[noise] yes so this would authorize the state to sell one point five billion in bonds and we'd go to basically three different buckets of hospitals but for time's sake what we can say is it would go to hospitals that either have\nUm are fully dedicated to Pete after care or have a dedicated pediatric center and the argument for this is that a\nOutsized percentage of the pediatric patients that these hospitals serve are on government insurance programs and they have very low reimbursement rates so the hospitals don't have money for for instance\nUm infrastructure making sure that they're seismically up to date advancing technology and um so the ideas that we need this bond to allow them to update their facilities I went on that one\nBut maybe if you have the time wrong you would accidently forget to vote and then that would be able to get their health care I'm basically okay\nWith ... with us for one more sick for sure All right it's far too and he died or justice professor

Costa Hopkins the rent Housing Act so and it was centrally would repeal the current rent control system in California and\nIt would allow states and localities to impose rent control and so if you\nBelieve that rent control is problematic you do not want to repeal our current system and you do not want to allow more cities and counties to impose rent control if you think it's really important that we keep rent control you would be voting in favor of ... ten this initiative\nOne thing I Will say that a lot of analysis shows is that even if you're very worried about affordable housing rent control may may actually exacerbate the problem and that's why a lot of for instance the newspapers or organizations there are more liberal leaning and you would think would be a yes or actually\nOh I think we're losing your connection are you with us are Eighteen or anything oh there you go you're back up\nDid you hear my perfect explanation up a lot of like newspapers that you think would be supportive of this\nOr actually a opposing it because it could make sense that access to housing\nWell what mark aren't doing it in California it's so stupid how the cost of housing is is going up dramatically and\nThe solutions that everyone is is prescribing for won't do that but will ruin everything else and I think that that in part that's what's going on here\nOr rent control as you said that makes the cost of housing goes up even go go up even higher and suddenly the problem is worse so you think you're doing something that will make it better and the reality is is it when you check on the same apartment\nI'm like well I dont look the guy's name I thought I had seen kind Facebook the missing all the crazy stuff and law the hold it was\nAnd I went on Facebook and now it's gotten really bad where he was talking about killing me killing my kids are eating my children ah Arab stuff\nAnd uh so I think my wife involved at that point and she got the the FBI and the police over and printed ... hundreds of pages of this guy stuff up or just horrible vitriol\nAnd uh she stood in front of the computer whether detective was there for the past and police are very nice man she goes do you see this do you see this he's talking about eating my children you're saying\nYou need to get him you have to get him there next it was I'm not afraid to die I Will go get him you do not have to go get him or or I Will fair to say so I always proudest moment for me I have and uh the cubs ...\nCalm down do we need to like you know it was and they did they found him he was

to two to five to to do it learns found out to do this as mid day live\nDrop program it is amazing to me that now that it's come to the light that the new chief LAPD if you've\nGot a one point to seven million dollar pay up and then was hired because of the drop program and the drop program was made to be abused you can what they're doing this a try and keep senior members so that you don't leave them they're going to incentivize them\nTo stay an extra five years she retired you come back you get your salary and you get your pension\nThey found out that you don't need them for firefighters because they're incentivized enough\nAnd with the police you're finding out that they can abuse it by claiming a disability rights right at the very end of their career and then coming back taking the drop money\nSo they get that and they're not even working so it used to be when I was growing up when you were growing up that my mother always said you know when you're not going to make a lotta money working for the government\nBut it's a secure job you'll never get fired you'll never make a fortune today you work for the government should the government you make a fortune ... and you don't get fired and you get benefits of the world to do and we're sitting you're paying for the most amazing benefits ever I'm not saying police work is not dangerous\nAnd somebody who has a disability because their police work shouldn't collecting the disability but the system that gives you one point to seven million dollars for retiring without giving up your job is a great system and an Greek system to abuse are why wouldn't you do with disability claim\nRight at the very end sign up for the drop program get the benefit of retirement and disability leave which apparently people are doing and we found out that a I'm a firefighter got one point four million last year\nI'm Talking ... right at the top list of highest paid retirees\nIn other cities have dropped this program ... and\nWho um initiated the program said you know in retrospect bad program I didn't realize all the abused now that I see in the program so what is our city do\nOur cash strapped cities with pension

they are actually doing the second amendment up\nThey put you through the ringer ... I Hope that put you on your look you up and down projects right yeah and\nIt makes it less likely that this person will get one so that we're seeing in California is actually doing the second amendment a favor and you'll have a lot less of it and you hear about around the country here because a lot harder to get one that all of them it's easier to have them in a way right right I pointed\nIt the right thing for the second amendment\nI Am and you asked certainly don't hear complaints about California you know what I mean I don't hear people going I don't hear people rattling sabers about it as well I'm moving to the gun laws yeah next year and a lot of other things we're talking about this on one of them\nYeah they don't there may be people who may watch you go you will write you know they're not getting their weight I ate it California's really down job and and really anybody who legally I only got their act together believe me\nYou know I mean it's of course there's always the problem with illegal guns and that's true anywhere but that that's good to hear you say that because I I really never thought about the fact that I I knew a little more stringent here but I never thought about the fact that people don't complain about it is not a big people don't want them\nGet them people that can handle them have them and uh and it's true I'm trying to think if we have any excessive\nIncidents here of problems with people I mean our big problem here is sort of a a you know people that do ... aggressive things with cops rather than to them you know what I mean like they get themselves shot up by a crazy but I mean\nThose even those people I think you follow it those people are gone in an unlawful way yeah yeah I think they do it every day I mean I Can't think of all the time and in a long way if you look at it right but I'm just saying\nHow do you do you have a concealed carry\nI Would like\nTo do but listen I I just I heard there was some just reading about the fact that that that has been loosened up a little bit it sounds like like it's easier to get a concealed is that what I'm reading that it's easier to do that or no\nNo I mean the white guy kind of strange if you say well\nYeah I'm not only that not only that I have friends that are that are I have friends that are eligible for that sort of thing they were like FBI agents things like that and they all they all say that they often not to do it like Bob ... is one of these guys\nYou said that he would not care even though he's perfectly eligible and well trained to do so in that there's a lot of upkeep training that needs to be done if you're going to be really be responded\nThen what happens when the bad guy you know open fire we need these good guys concealed carry listening\nI Want you to carry a gun but the point being is that what you got to put it in the time and effort to be ... to ... if you are responsible person in order to feel and B that responsible person if you're going to carry a gun around and I get that I get that I Wish he would put the time but I Can't force them to do it\nOur number is eight hundred to two to five to ... to ah let me just spend admitted saying ah be super careful\nTonight it is Halloween a I we do not want any\nUnfortunate accidents those of you that are driving vehicles to get out of our cars as much as possible tonight ... it it's just why do you want to go out and drive around tonight particularly not in neighborhoods where there could be kids running around if you have kids and you're going out with them flashlights reflect ers what are those little the little\n... knows that those bend the little white glow sticks low stakes\nAnd um and be careful with the gummy bears for sure and\nAnything that has the roster title in the rapper ... pieces is not ready to be very careful with that it's all I'm\nSaying be reasonable will be safe thanks for listening eight hundred to two to five to ... to Lawrence five ...
