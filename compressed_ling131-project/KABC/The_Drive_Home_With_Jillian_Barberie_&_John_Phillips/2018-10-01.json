I was one of those people that I have been running an independent bring it on and now I'm so pushed that\nI'm going to register to vote after all those [laughter]\nBecause Trump's sort of set a fire and I think he's done that he split the Republican Party there is no doubt there the Republican Party is the ... the other Republican like I said to John the other day are you your dad's Republican in other words they use that kind of Republican that you grow up with it he said I'm I'm Trump all the way he said I think he's much better for\nHe likes him better than you know what let's McCain's of

you to do and he did it doesn't really matter is is ... going to be the greatest drifts and this doesn't matter right there's a feeling he's on our side is that your side and that's really all that matters here's\nMy my issue with the roe v Wade stuff and I'm pro life I'm thankful I was adopted and I wasn't a board and all that great great stuff is using abortion should be outlawed\nUm I I don't judge other women do after me buffer may be pro life but you are not myself yeah but you are not I would not tell other people what to do with their boss so the withdrawal from a lot of men in the position\nTo tell women what to do and if they're not allowing birth control and then\nThey look at birth control is that after like the abortion pill excuse me it's preventing something it's not killing something a get your facts straight and be\nWhen you're ... talks about facts right as I'm not used to this Oh thank you I think I Know and then you know they say well what are they going to do with all these won't unwanted children I just don't understand whether whether going with that\nIt's not simple but if you have a basic belief everything for two and a place\nOkay if you what about this goes over the Republicans that pooh pooh the family life people that poo poo other people if you don't live like them and they're the ones out\nThere very ... around and I'm Adam and I live here and you know and I only like ours pick on other Christians but I'm surprised that the evangelicals are so happy to embrace Trump\nIf you believe that abortion is murder them down to wars murder mhm than usual\nAnd then they made aware well number ... ... what about the hypocritical ones that get their mistresses pregnant and then pay for their abortions but there are pro life it just makes no

I think she was actually kind of sense here we have some other major stuff but you you brought up you tease the while ago yeah about open minded and fired yes\nSo about two weeks ago Sharon Osborne was on the Howard Stern show that I was listening to and she was on for when you listen to our lives are which are the two of you enough and so she was on and as only sharing can do she was being very funny and and south facing of course\nHoward asked her about Les Moonves as you know Howard hates Les Moonves and he has for thirty something years because he called snake and the grass and he tried he sued Howard and they have a horrible to pastors relationship but Howard Stern to his credit twenty five years ago never went on the late night show or Letterman or I think it might have been Leno with that\nI hate Les Moonves shirt so he was going up against and many moons ago and so he and he does ago many moons ago yeah Sharon\n... joke is beneath you through the metal kind of joke I always joke that is neat ... jokes\n[laughter] but but by the way that it was just an act of self loathing on my ... so\nHe she was very diplomatic and she read a statement she said you know they asked me to make a statement and this and that and Julie standing behind her ... then again that I signed the towel and Howard said how can you work for that snake and she said and he said I'm account she goes\nHe's\nAsked me as a judge and to see it\nAnd then he goes well do you go over there she goes oh I don't go vote on those little leaps don't cab lived up to I have to fly\nAll the way over that listen to that whole voices and then the subject of Simon came up because how can you he's a snake he went in those emails during the Sony hockey tried to get my job at age ... and pull it out for me which he did he went to the boss is is that all worked for cheaper than Howard and you need to get rid of him and that may Howard nuts and then\nWhen Simon whatnot an affair with his friend's wife and got her pregnant however is like ... he's not a moral person how do you work for him\nSo she was kind of going with the flow you know you sound more like Sharon and Sharon does the and so he fired her today that\nCalled around and said you no longer needed and Howard fired\nHer ... her appearance on Howard ... yeah I got that I tell you the time and say why\n[noise] why she was hired that because he heard the show he heard the question for you yeah and I wonder about this because your passions friendships a lot of people who end up hating each other mhm yeah we are and\nI always wonder how you
