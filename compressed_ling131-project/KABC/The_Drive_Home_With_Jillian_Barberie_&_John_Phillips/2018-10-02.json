I Know boys will occasionally be boys but that doesn't mean that I was going to accept that from him right or encourage it so yeah\nSo Schumer got up and I'm a ... point was they wanted to let it because they just didn't want this guy and the Supreme Court and they wanted to weigh in some of the opposite is true but then Schumer gets up and says delay Merrick Garland you delayed for\nOne year you you you you Senator McConnell respond to that you were kept this\nGuy just in January when McConnell says delayed delayed delayed from\nGoing before the committee you wouldn't even let them start there was no discussion you just wouldn't well this\nIs a partisan thing in other words they wouldn't be so hard lame thing if this was a a Democrat nominee for the Supreme Court they wouldn't have the same attitude oh does evaluated\nListen there's so many levels politics is probably the largest level let's go to a tour of some Ninety KBC you're on the air ... low\nTar you know what to do it huh oh did I go\nLike oh here we go here we go I go people don't see nothing yesterday when you premature I was ...
