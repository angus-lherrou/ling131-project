they're not going to win all these these progressive accomplishment\nYeah let's talk about the politics of this Heidi Heitkamp\nA Democrat in danger for her reelection senator from North Dakota a recent poll came out that showed the Kavanaugh story is absolutely devastating her in her reelection bid she came out today and said that she is going to vote no on the confirmation what does that tell you she pretty much given up at this point\nPlus one man plus one or for sure to\nGet a they got to get another seat in their average already look when ... when liberals come from red states and they face these kinds of boats they look in the mirror and they still it's an eye when my race if I think I could with the space I got to vote in this case I got to vote for Brett Kavanaugh she looked at the mirror and she realized I'm not going to win this race took down double digits every poll\nAnd if I Do for Brett Kavanaugh none of my ... are going to like the yeah I get to do it my next that job so she definitely voted for a life in the swamp against churches just shorts and I'm really excited that a district where it's going to be a senator\nAnd listen you you work in the swamp of you\nLobbyist yourself you know how the business working so you and you interpret this vote Heidi Heitkamp going against got to this is the the this is her audition for her next gig that means she's going to go to a think tank she's going to be a lobbyist or something maybe even a media figure but she's got she's got to bolster her credit that's what this is about ...\nYou're on when you're a left wing or representing a red state your fellow court is either a attached to your people in your state or to the uh powers in Washington DC and she picked towards one\nThat is attached to she wants to make sure she preserves her credibility or in the DC area and so she's got the right to do that I think it's a great decision for her to do that I think it's a horrible decisions\nTo vote against Brett Kavanaugh but I still think he's going to get the votes\nAnd I think we're going to have a better senator replace\nA let's let's talk about her argument though because I find this fascinating and I'd love for you to speak to this 'cause she said uh you know the reason I'm doing this because of a it Kavanaugh's temperament you hear this a lot from people they don't even want to talk about the unfounded uncorroborated accusations outrageous accusations that can't be proven\nFrom a doctor Christine Blasey Ford now they're saying well Kevin I was so angry and made it so hard to say in in his performance that I don't think he has the temperament to be a judgment could you speak to that for a moment\nSome believable you sit there on national TV and you don't just called the guy a sexual predator you don't just call him a rapist\nYou call 'em like gang rapists or at least you read you reiterate that ... these outrageous charges on which they're still going back and forth on this devil's triangle is it a drinking game\nIs man it's actually raping a woman I mean I just ... it's ... and then they expect demand in this case just simply look their\nPassion Leslie and\nSay oh no that's not correct\nYeah senator they would have to be a robot they bought them to be an Thomas Trotter something had shown to show no emotional reaction at all Republicans\nDon't do a motion Democrats too emotionally we do logic we all know\nHow this works we usually talk numbers we talk about our policy and we leave the emotion to the Democrats Democrats usually are considered better communicators because they connect to people on an emotional level well God Bless Brett Kavanaugh he didn't do it because he's such a great politician he just was honest it was a moment of complete\nAnd utter honesty which lasted for hours and hours and he said his his standing in the Senate because he connected to the American people and Larry the race to patrol the United States Senate and much of the house is going to go through these red states\nAnd I understand that in some areas a wreck have it on that like be a tough vote for some people if if these house members were centers which they're not but in these red states it's overwhelming even when it in the jury are less likely to vote for Claire McCaskill in her reelection desert\nBecause of her indifference to cabinet to that actually her opposition to cabinet so you know the polls are with us and I think we're going to have a big night\nYou know Matt and obviously you're a partisan for the Republicans as the head of the American Conservative Union the organization that puts on the ...\nBy the way we're speaking with a ... year also ...\nAnd all ... I I I you know as you do as well yes I'm a Republican I criticize them a lot 'cause yeah they don't always get it right yeah\nNo absolutely you are but you but you're also you're a savvy political analyst and and\nLook look at our state of California here for a minute you know Dianne Feinstein is one of those senators is up for reelection of course it's a blue state and and no one suggests that she's in any danger but I remember when this whole thing started when she released that letter the letter got leaked somehow in the Washington Post had an article\nThat said this will be a legacy defining moment for Senator Dianne Feinstein who has served for many years in in many ways a very respectful and patriotic service to her nation as the United states senator\nBut if her legacy does boil down to her participation in this cabinet hearing what is that legacy them because I don't think it'll be kind [noise]\nNo I don't think it will be kind either and you know it it is a sad thing because Dianne Feinstein was the type of senator who even Republicans would say on a couple of issues um you know she seemed to not be just in lockstep with a party and I do think that there is a danger we all face and all\nOf our professional careers where you know there's a time to know uh\nThere's time to do in the hang up the spikes and uh I think she has looked\nA way more ... than she has it any other time in her life she looks like her staff is almost in control of the process or than she is in control of the process and more ... yeah she she violated what was her greatest strength\nShe always seems fair and reasonable and instead she looks partisan and mean and nasty and now she's become famous in a household\nNot because of her great career but because of the nasty and I would say illegal way which they handled confidential information and really make Dr Ford of it as well\nYeah I think you're right and a doctor for it looked like she was used by these people are totally not in the long run for the run in and they'll cast her aside I mean she's got a nice go fund me at the end of the day but a big yes absolutely\n... deals yeah we'll get her vote feels\nTo get her co funded she'll give her speeches but in the end it's a shame she couldn't have control of this process the way she wanted to\nMess up as our guest American conservative union chairman or they put on the pack and I got I hate to break into your bed we're in October man the pack is actually coming up and obviously you're going to be so let this year you always figure out a way to invite one or two people that kisses everybody off have you figured\nOut who that's going to be yet you know how do you do that or is in the top three and all the you know everyone loves me mad [laughter] or\nNot it's not intentional it just kind of look at things and we say these are the right people to invite this year that you're right it's like there's always one sometimes you it's easy to know but sometimes it's really hard to know like we invited\nYou know marrying Le Pen the the granddaughter of a racist you know kind of a far right French leader but she separated herself for her grandfather right and uh and she's got you know she says she's a devout Catholic um she uh she doesn't believe in big government yadda yadda\nAnd er and everyone ... crazy because they thought we invited her aunt who had more kind of reactionary use\nYeah a little bit more of a goose step or yeah [laughter]\nTotally we did invite\nHer so I to this day where people sit down with their why did you invite wearing looked at it I'm like oh my gosh what is wrong with people in the media it's like you know you think they get these details right but the uh but this happens all the time and I I I I ...

that train the LAX and I can't fix that he has a pothole or any of the broken roads that I'm supposed to be in charge of now\nAnd fixing right now because the roads are my responsibility and I can't be trusted to fix them unless they can continue to protect your gas in your registration and that's what mayor Eric Garcetti said yesterday coming up full throated against prop six well is that a fair political argument\nAgainst this proposition or is he being a duplicitous\nHack again to answer those questions is that well he might have an opinion on it called the ... is a reporter California he helped get props pick on our ballot or is that a fair argument Carl\nWell look I think you hit the nail on the head that you've got these politicians who is lied to us they've stolen the gas tax year after year they were caught stealing the gas tax after repeatedly saying oh we have a lock box give us money\nHere's another locked box give us more money and then they violate those lock boxes and that's what's so infuriating about this whole situation is that the politicians continue to claim that they are putting\nMoney exclusively into roads what in fact the money\nNot only can go to the general fund if any\nWithout any sort of a a transportation is funding the the money that does get the transportation goes almost everywhere but roads transit high speed rail bike lanes a walk cats uh and so you can't trust these people with another penny\n... the reality is we already have one of the highest gas taxes and the country yeah we had the worst wrote now with the gas tax increase they're giving us the most expensive gas tax in the country and we're still going to be having bad roads because you cannot trust them that's why\nYes on prop sex stops them from\nMore of your money and wasting it ... and let's just be clear this money is being constantly diverted\nFrom roads and from the DMV and from various other projects as well as if it is it is a consistent thing that they're doing and putting into the general fund so they can pay for whatever you know glorified project that they want to do that has nothing to do with transportation this is\nNot an a false claim this is this is a proven fact\nThis is a proven fact and nothing proves it better than the alternative plan that we released last week in Sacramento I filed in a a a ballot measure\nThat basically fixes the roads because we don't disagree that the roads are crap we need to fix some uh we believe that the money's already there so what we did was we drafted a measure that said step\nOne all gas tax should go to roads and roads only you know what that does\nBy just mandating that the existing gas tax go a hundred percent or roads\n... our plan get two billion dollars a year more\nIn increased funding for roads above and beyond what you would get with the higher gas tax and so what we're showing is that proof positive dollar for dollar you don't need to raise taxes to fix the roads\nAnd in fact the existing gas tax if you a hundred percent dedicated to roads not transit not general fund\nNot high speed rail hundred percent for roads you can have two billion dollars increased funding annually each and every year for road improvement and then of course we\nHave the other part of our plan which is a putting the sales tax on cars into transportation which can include transit that's fine alright find your buses and whatnot or other roads\nAre that's another five billion dollars of increased funding for transportation\nWhich by the way Carl is exactly how they sold these taxes to us in the first place and look people don't like taxes people don't like politicians who vote for taxes and they certainly don't like the tax themselves\nWhen there was a proposition ... statewide ballot but if they justify it and they said listen our roads are terrible the budget is pinch right now we got to fix our road we got to do more\nFor our roads so it makes sense if you drive a car and you fill your car with gas then we're going to charge you a little bit more and that'll go to fix the roads that's how they sold it in the first place and then from the moment it got past they've been doing the money for other things it's you're old you're proposition is only fair\nRight and and you know what a ... in a in a in the ... that they don't want to fix our roads and they really don't want a true level of accountability\nA eight hundred to two to five to to to uh let's see let's go to Ed Ed go ahead\n[noise] [noise] Hi I'm some people are honest about their opposition to Capitol

beginning\nWith Kavanaugh's nomination and there was never much doubt as to how people feel the two parties would would ah ah agree on the on the matter what happened was one because he had a boy in the free judicial record they couldn't attack in any other way and then they brought out this\nSummer this craziness just absolute character assassination and yet people on the left I think that's fair\nTo put a man through that with with with so little evidence and vote and arguing that this crazy sweating the woman I mean this whole week claimed to see what the two parties where women were

let's let's admit to our political considerations\nYeah oh let's face it Sean Joe Manchin could have made that speech he could have gone up and said I'm a Democrat and I'm voting for this man in February Susan Collins take all that black\nAnd and get all that betrayal and then ... in the hallway afterwards he said oh yeah I'm going to vote for him to come on what a towering jello this guy turns out to be\nYeah well I mean he he understands the political winds I mean the high camp a announcing that she was going to vote for no makes me just you know ... that I I think that she is already looking towards the next chapter of her political career nail put the nail on the coffin of her reelection chances are as if it wasn't already\nA turning out to you know that that Kramer what's going to be the next senator\nBut it's sad I I think that like look I Know Republicans in when I was a nominee sometimes took flak floating in front of the folks but I think it was the right thing to do I'll say that again should we ever like Democrat president uh I I just think that it's amazing how safe it is no one in the media were brought up the fact that ...\nAnd the columns that so many of these other Republicans actually did vote for democratic nominee was as if it didn't happen\nIf Lindsey Graham and Susan Collins didn't tell it themselves no one would know and the problem is is that the media frankly was complicit in this with the Democrats there's no question in my mind anybody who thought that there was a degree of objectivity left and that\nThe coverage by NBC News and people like Andrea Mitchell which was both fault and defamatory it lack all sense of objectivity and\nI think whether you're watching NBC or CNN or the Washington Post or the New York times which sent a reporter who had publicly\nBashed Kavanaugh on Twitter feed can cover the story as the reporter record your shows you how\nLittle objectivity there is left in this mainstream media\nYou know and and nobody knows that better than you Sean Spicer is the former White House press secretary you face them down every single day by the way your book I said I loved it and I really did the briefing politics the press and the president you spend a lot of time it it's not an autobiography but there's a memoir aspect to it and you talk about\nHow you grew politically or from the Reagan years and then came to DC or right after the Bush years er during the under the Bush years and you've been involved in Republican politics since then I've reflect for a moment we touched on it briefly but reflect for a moment on on what this means\nFrom a conservative Republican perspective having ... the Supreme Court now made up into peers in the way that it will be with Clarence Thomas and Alito and and and Gorsuch and and Roberts and now Kavanaugh that's that's a heck of a a a picture\nFor a true conservative who wants to the Supreme Court to focus on the true meaning of the constitution\n... yeah that's right because I think that before it ... you know we had\nA Justice Kennedy who who is good and obviously John Paul Stevens pointed lied for it I Believe um but they they seem as in particular was was hardly was as best they swing vote as a Kennedy these are solid conservative court such and cabinet are going to be strict construction list they will be the kind of judges that conservatives will be applauding and\nThanking President Trump for putting on the court and this is a true conservative majority of the first time I think in at least in generation if not longer um and\nI think it's going to have any real impact in in the way that we live our lives and it's going to be less legislating from the bench and warned interpreting how the constitution was meant to be\nWell and given that you know ... you know there was a lot of splintering within the Republican Party over the Trump nomination and you speak about it in the book there were a lot of voters who at the end there ah they they got themselves to vote for Trump because of the Supreme Court\nWith one person was going to make these nominations and they knew they didn't want it to be Hillary Clinton so they went with Trump in Trump made that really remarkable political gambit of laying out a list of of acceptable or judges that he would appoint a given that I mean that that that's a heck of a validation now for the people who voted for Trump just because of the Supreme Court\nI I a hundred percent and it's not just the Supreme Court what we've seen at the ... circuit court level as well is a historic number of judges being pointed but the thing that's so beautiful it is it if you look at the average age of a lot of these folks are you know they're they're in their\nTheir early to mid forties late fifties early sixties rather somewhere and I think we are talking about twenty to Thirty years of potential service for a lot of these folks which means that you are really going to see a conservative and to the federal judiciary that to me is what I think Trump's legacy first and foremost is going to be and so\nYou know I I don't think that really fully appreciate and or recognizes the importance of the judiciary when it comes time to vote for president but I Do think that President Trump has made it very clear what the differences and the impact\nOf the court will have so I I think that you know every one of these folks that were the never Trump\nOr they didn't fully appreciate you know what Trump what's going to do I hope and I think that now\nThat he has shown not just in the Supreme Court level with cabin\nOn Gorsuch but at both the federal I mean at the circuit and the appellate court level a demonstrated that consistent conservative bent all of these historic juror number of jars they've put it on the court that he he really is transformational I mean this is all this hasn't happened before and we've had\nGreat Republican leaders like Bush and Bush and Reagan and\nNext Senate and yet for the first time ever you're seeing a true true unwinding of the federal judiciary in favor of strict construction is that it\nIt is remarkable what's happened already in a less than two years of this presidency we're speaking with Sean Spicer of course\nI ah people know you as a former White House press secretary that was sort of your your daily television show that I got better ratings than half of the things that get shrugged out here of Hollywood and you know way out of the TV studios [noise]\nUm but I got to ask you listen I I Know you as a strategist too I mean you you you you're great is a spokesperson but you're a heck of a strategist put that hat on for a minute as we're looking at these midterm elections\nWhat do you think about this idea of a Kavanaugh effect that the Republicans might now have newfound energy to vote Republican in these midterms that maybe they didn't have before\n... yeah that's absolutely right I mean you look and uh you know thirty days ago the Democrats held in many polls upwards of a template and things you asked me that they were excited they were motivated there was a level of intensity that they hadn't seen in the audience sometimes and frankly the Republican Party didn't have\nThat same on part of it was that you know people have gone out and voted for Trump\nDidn't necessarily see how it translated they didn't see that binary choice that the Republican ballot the Republican agenda and policies that is inextricably linked to Donald Trump if he doesn't have\nA Republican House the Senate it goes away what the Kavanaugh nomination has done it is motivated it as a enthused in has intensified it has\nBrought together the Republican base like never seen in ... the most recent all you saw jumped twelve point\nDemocrats romaine or main fired up but this did something that I don't think Democrats fully appreciated they overplayed their hand and\nIt it could be devastating consequences for them politically now I'm a big fan that they did that but I think where they they they did what Republicans have done a lot in the passengers they overplayed it and I don't think that they recognized um\nYou know how that that that they they went a little too far in this\nIn any self or is it a self reflection there any anybody's circumspect any of the the wise old men and women of the Democratic party or they picking up a phone saying you know look at the polls your look what happened just known North Dakota look at what's going on in in in Missouri Florida\nIndiana the states that that looked OK and now we're almost losing them or if we have an outright lost them maybe we need to try different tactic maybe we don't keep listening to the screaming Mimi is in the in the crowd with a pink hats and let's look like we're statesman is that possible or is it going to get worse\nYou know normally you would suggest that that would be the remedy but because of where their base it which is increasingly to live far extreme left they can't write I mean that's just the reality of what's going on now that that they are they might see it they might know what they're probably looking at data that shows that that it's not smart but the reality is\nThat and again you see that their their party percentage of enthusiasm remain about eighty eighty two percent meaning that\nThey're still the historic numbers the problem is is that they're firing up the Republican base in the same time and that puts him in a ... which is okay our own base loves what we're doing\nBut unfortunately the Republicans love it too and so then if you do what you do you lessen your own date the problem is that they could have walked up to the water's edge without jumping in and they could have probably had\nThe same effect with their base without firing up the Republican base the problem is it's just too late for them\nSean Spicer uh who had an incredible incredible run they're getting a the defeat number one defeating Hillary Clinton number to having a victory for Donald Trump which I still know sounds like the same thing but I ...

I Am Larry O'Connor in ... and John today we've got former Senator Tom\nJoining us in thirty minutes had him reflect on the dysfunction that we're seeing in the nation's capital and and maybe how we might be able to fix that\nI mentioned a moment ago that I had I had a good sense of the center Susan Collins was going to go the way that you did before she gave her speech\nAt two big reasons the first is a she's a person of honor and and you know she's a mixed bag as far as conservative Republicans are concerned but one thing that she's consistent on us her support for the United states military and and she's very much involved in the military\nA military spending she's on the um the arms committee she's uh she's also very much operates closely with not just the brass at the Pentagon but also the men and women who we referred to as the boots on the ground the actual troops and when you have that kind of relationship with the military you understand honor\nYou understand the principles and values that they fight for and there's no possible way that someone who understands that and and it's part of her DNA could possibly validate the dishonorable despicable tactics the Democrats have employed the last two weeks in\nIn ... a good man's reputation without any proof\n... going back on principles that we have all fought for our entire lives our entire history things like innocent until proven guilty there was no way she was going to validate those tactics but then there was the Senator Marco Rubio didn't get a lot of attention earlier today he gave his own speech on the floor of the Senate listen to this part of it\nBut after seven background checks for over a hundred and fifty people interviewed [noise]\nWe don't have any independent evidence to cooperate these allegations against him [noise]\nSo with regards to the specific cases of the fact that I have the for me that we have for us or fax am I supposed to not just voted down this nomination but in the process of doing surrender forever be perceived as averted the guilt\nOn the basis of what facts anyone say or do that\nThat's right you see a no vote on judge Kavanaugh especially as Susan Collins who had already been in line to vote for his confirmation if she had voted no that could only be interpreted and perceived\nAs a verdict of guilt against this man and there's no possible way she was going to do that not not what the evidence as presented the uncorroborated evidence as presented\nA that said there was plenty of evidence to support Brett Kavanaugh's position I I saw nothing that supported Dr Ford's allegations but there was plenty of support for who judge Kavanaugh is\nWho judge Kavanaugh was back then and it came in the form of\nOf literally hundreds of women who were ready to speak on his behalf who signed letters immediately on on his behalf people that worked with him known him and many of those women were actually on Capitol Hill yesterday you didn't see them they didn't get covered the way all the screaming protesters got covered but they were there\nI I Know that because they were there with our next guest Kelsey hardness she is a senior reporter and producer at the daily signal and and you actually had a whole legion of women for judge Kavanaugh ready to to do media appearances and talk to senators talk to me about what happened there yesterday Kelsey\nWhy Larry thanks for having me you're exactly right there were certainly protesters out on Capitol Hill against Kavanaugh but there were um\nThere were dozens of women out there in support of him and he's Lyndon or just some form of organized protest it they were all women who all\n... out of it they can't trust me with it\nOr if it's too fragile it's like a ... you don't want to break it so uh no news with today but we will have Senator Tom Coburn joining us at four o'clock so you'll want to hear that\nA ... joining us right now many Johnson Daily Caller he's a reporter at large Benny has made a name for himself as a ... he's got a great I\nFor great stories there are always very visual and up and he has a great way of telling the story this happening behind the story I still love it frankly Betty I Want to talk about what happened last night with Amy Schumer but first what are you seeing right now you're actually there with the protesters with the mob at the Supreme Court what's happening\n[noise] well the yeah the ... the mob looks sort of what looks more like a gender as study a group\nRight now at a unity college yeah oh oh about ...\nFirst yeah yes this is a this like fresh and freshmen sociology gender study or a cafe group\nA and like it yeah so it's all burqa doctorate no heat yeah that's too bad\nYes I I actually heard a a a police officer Capitol police officer remarks to another ... police officers I'm wanting to do this eh yeah where do they all go and the one does ah hopefully to a bar and the other guy the other top literally says this layer he goes yeah they're going to need it\n[laughter] you know the party is over so if if if that's sad moment after a good old Georgetown Prep keg or where someone is just sort of got to clean up all the red the red cops afterwards and it's just not\nYeah All right I'm ... I'm a cake half full kind of guy [laughter]\nBut now things were more exciting last night though when ah you know Hollywood's own Amy Schumer does she live out here by the way I don't think she does that it doesn't matter she's a Hollywood gal she got arrested and it was such a defiant a moment there with her\nFifth rushed in the air red did they did they mistreated as you get thrown to the ground was she kicked was it a march from Selma moment what did you see\nOh it was it was it was incredibly powerful Larry let me tell you it was incredibly power so that I saw Amy Schumer they're the only Siamese Schumer is just sort of loitering around\nMy area of the protest it just sort of loitering or on the air the protests that was going to indefinitely get arrested now sure why they were ... they weren't a recipe for free they ... they want to risk because ... fascist they're arrested\nBecause it is illegal to stage a nasty demonstration inside of a Senate office building if we're allowed to do this and that was all it would be a ... way\nUp in St people screaming in St Louis and habits or can't have it as models have let ... left right doesn't matter they are going to be people are going to come in and scream and so you can't have that so it's a it's not allowed them at ... Angela is standing there I thought oh my God\nShe's got a tweet she's waiting to be arrested she didn't do that to the tweets where she says I was arrested\nToday right and I so that it was a martyr for the terrible\nOh oh I Can't believe so I said I'm not summer let's do it well see what happens\nAnd what happens is the cops the cops go by and very graciously\nVery graciously or is it like Mr genes of the police ... would you would you like to be arrested or would you like to be too often take your time thinking about it but this is he a rest area and this has been on a rest area may\nGo over here or shear up to you and Amy Schumer and I have is on video I tweeted it at least on the Daily Caller it she says\nOh yes I Want to be arrested yes\nShe looks at ... high bongos I Want to be arrested oh what is happening\nThere is a violent way she volunteered to be arrested she could have stayed there and not gotten arrested were moved to another side of the room but she'd she'd volunteer to be arrested please arrest me\nShould live tendency to not\nTo and that but so now how was the actual color was it rough was it\nOh yeah yeah I I mean it was it was it was horrifying you wouldn't believe it I mean she was um you know she she was a bound right by a small wristbands that they put on her arm with a paint designation pink wristbands that said I'm just as a special VIP person who is not you know who who who who don't\nTouch her her empire little higher ... she was with all those little\nPink wristbands and then they were chatting laughing and dancing I had all this on film you can go check it out I Would if you saw it on the Daily Caller you also check on my Twitter up any jobs in a way or they just they Latin dance for thirty minutes sat on the ground and then the arrest element\nLarry was I mean it was harrowing they just stood up and walked out with\nThat was it so they got a little pink wristbands and then they got up and were ushered out by the police and and did they even get a find do we know was it was there anything yes\nLately I overstayed my parking or in my Joan yesterday and I got I got a sixty dollar ticket they got a fifty dollar tickets so my parking ticket was a more than their arrest a for a way they don't\nYeah they may not even that don't even enforce these fines but do they have they don't really even afford to just let them do\nShe doesn't have to be there basically it was like getting into VIP leftover rage in West Hollywood alright good good to know I Know about rage because I have friends don't don't get her heart ...

Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh is set to become the next Supreme Court justice\nNow now a lot of people hearing the Senator Coburn will probably think of themselves that may be true but boy the genie is out of the ... you just said you're never going to reverse the seventeenth amendment\nAnd and you know we're we're never going to be able to change all these things even if we could pass a constitutional amendment to try to reverse some of this trend it's so hard to do what it's going to be hard to get it out of DC and it's certainly going to be hard to get the requisite number of state legislatures to pass a constitutional amendment but since\nYou know I think so well well you you you've left the Senate and you've actually taken up a a a different cause not exactly a constitutional amendment cause you want to have a new convention of the states I understand right\nThat's right it at our founders matter of fact the Eighteenth founder of George Mason colonel George Mason instead of three days before the convention was over so we agree this era do we think that I got let that my ...\nIt will automatically give up its tyranny because people want him to and so they put in the second part of article five which says the state's if two thirds of the states want to call in amendments conviction they can\nAnd all they do is they come together and meet and make recommendations to restore the constitution back to what our founders intended it to be\nAnd that doesn't have anything to do with civil rights\nThat didn't have anything to do with with social justice what that has to do with freedom and decisions made by the state\nDo you think we would be the divided country we are today if their decisions over marriage shifted the pigeons over ... over a abortion if they had been made in state legislatures instead of the federal government\nWell you know what\nWe're having this conversation on a KBC in Los Angeles I mean I I was I I\nRemember the fight over proposition ... in California that was the year I was two thousand and it was the year the rock Obama was elected president overwhelmingly in the state of California but I'm that exact same ballot the majority of California and said we want to maintain the definition of marriage\nConstitutionally and the state constitution as one man one woman those are the same voters Rocco bobbing in the White House also affirmed the traditional definition of marriage so I agree with you\nOr they should have never been left up to the Supreme\nCourt so so go back to see why we're having this newest victory Arctic\nSide over one justice\nWhere we've ignored the presumption of it since ... Nord collaboration uh uh where we've ignored cooperation where we've said if somebody occasionally or something you have to prove yourself innocent well that's exactly how the federal government works with all of this that citizens out here in the country and how\nYou ... you all you said some agency comes in say he did wrong prove you did\nAnd so what we have to do is we have to restore it it's it's not about making a hard change it's about restoring limited I Would I you know I was at Berkeley\nI ask this of this sense of what would you say most decisions ought to be made by you or people in Washington you know what they say that overwhelmingly we make our decisions\nNo brainer absolutely\nNo brainer for anybody whether you're a liberal or even if you're a socialist do still think your own freedom you ought to be able to make your own decision\nWest we used to be called people power yeah [laughter]\nWell back again if you go back and look at the enumerated powers and then you look at the temperament and that's what\nIt says is here's what the powers of the federal government everything outside of this is reserved for the people and what we've had since Nineteen since it in the sense of the great depression is we've had a slow creep toward socialism where most of the decisions\nThat affect our lives significantly or not late in our state or city is our our counties or city council they're made by somebody has never elected\nTo anything you know try telling us what we will and won't do social time to\nChange that we can't we have three point six million volunteers right now working on conventional say it's a ... you know it's four times and alright\nAlright ... or to\nGo ahead you can you tell me what this convention of the states looks like because I hear a lot of opposition to this idea lot a\nLot of conservatives who say well we don't want to do that because then all the all the left left the Bernie Sanders socialist tied full then bringing some convention or some amendments to the convention and faith and they'll do away with the second amendment and things like that how\nIt's really hard it first of all do it it is difficult to get thirty four states to say we oughta at the convention so you know first of all there is no way the second amendment's ever going to be impacted\nOther than commonsense background checks that's never going to happen because I travel in ... and almost now forty states in the last three years and I you know I trust legislature whether they're Democrats or Republicans they want to do what their citizens in their state one death\nAnd so they're not going to give up his eyes and and there's no way it can happen because we're doing subject matter only there's only three areas that we would discuss one is\nHow about having the government being fiscally responsible\nAbout living within your means getting rid of the waste fraud and duplication which is four hundred billion dollars a year\nAnd how about living within the parameters of the ... powers so and then have generally accepted accounting principles all the federal government but the second is is limit the scope and jurisdiction of the federal government back toward our founders intended to be\nWhich was the enumerated powers\nNot everything not every decision made by somebody in Washington ... that she surfing the power of your elected legislature which is supposed to impact you your life you can actually have influence on that\nHow many people as a U.S senator you know I travel I did Seventy town halls here\nI I I went on all across my state I ... I tried to see as many people in Washington as I could yeah I didn't see ten or Fifteen thousand people out of for me\nBut you can actually I actually have the phone numbers that most citizens in my county in our state no the total number of the home phone number of their state representative in state senator yeah so you can actually influence to those people\nAnd so we've we've just lost control we've lost control of the principles that a Republican and our debt which is now at depth plus unfunded liabilities a hundred and forty four trillion dollars by the way that's twenty thousand dollars over the next Seventy five years for every millennial yeah that they're going to have to pay back\nFor us seniors my baby but\nThey're gonna have to pay it back and I think that is a moral question of our day\nIs it not our responsibility to assure a bright future for our kids as long as they're responsible and have good character yeah and they asked unqualified yes\nAnd and the future is wrong\nAnd that is a bipartisan disgrace and in a real crisis as well we find went out Tom Coburn is a former member of the United States Senate for the great state of Oklahoma and uh\nHe's he if you're upset and frustrated with the dysfunction that we've seen transpire in Washington DC this week I mean it's been heightened this week in the last two weeks with the Kavanaugh nomination but it it's really just a a broader indication of the of the bigger problems in D.C\nThan you might want to look at the convention to the states or an article five convention or that we're discussing now that the Senator Coburn is trying to spearhead your ... ... what does it take to get those two thirds states to go for this thirty four states how many do you have now\nWe have twelve and do I think we're past six this next year this year coming in starting in January of ... but remember why I left the Senate I didn't leave the Senate 'cause I didn't like my colleagues in the Senate\nI came to the conclusion that what is wrong with America isn't going to get fixed in Washington and achieve your listeners will just think about that permit it based on what they're seeing\nNot just with Kavanaugh but with all the partisan bickering with all this idea of the the the most important thing in Washington is the next election\nAnd as soon as it's over then the next the most important thing is the next election the most important thing in the future of our kids it in keeping our country from going bankrupt it is solving the crime\nAnd a and social minimization that occurred so a lot of people in our country it's about the politicians\nAnd I couldn't take it anymore I cannot see us continuing to function the way we're in Washington without offering a solution and this one works and if they build a convention of states dot com wary about it you don't have to agree on what we're trying to do\nBut at least look here's an option through history that our founders gave us\nThat what we see Washington acting the way it is today\nHere's the solution yeah and most people don't think they can do anything about it and what my messages as to most Americans we can fix this we don't have to let Washington go down to two we can actually change it and restore back to the very core principles of virtue\nLimited government rule of law that we had and the free enterprise system that built the greatest country ever in the world\nSenator Tom Coburn thank you so much for joining us its convention of ... states dot com or just convincing convention\nA state convention estate from all the information there and I think that they're also\nWas there that will just put your right in touch with who you're going to be in touch with a four Sacramento to try to move this thing along it's a it's an uphill teddy bear Lee here in California but it's worth the effort Tom Coburn thanks for joining us or appreciated\nOur kids are our kids are worth it amen to that amen to that and held a rally and boomers sooner you are that are over there\nFor what you hear a seven Ninety KBC I'm kind of infer Jillian ...
