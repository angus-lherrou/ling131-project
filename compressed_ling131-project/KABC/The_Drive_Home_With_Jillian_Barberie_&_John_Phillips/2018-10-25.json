P. P. and we do love ... and all of his hard work\nComing up in just a couple of minutes we're going to talk to Steve Moore retired special agent for the FBI because a series of explosive devices were sent to former Presidents Clinton and Obama a number of prominent demand\nGeorge Soros and our our boss he came in and said something that I echo an earlier today George SARS is was dropped off at his home and his mailbox he's a billionaire you know he's got cameras up the was yeah and if it was you know delivered by a particular person this could be you know\nSolve the little quicker [noise] all the latest details on that plus Henry Scott publisher of we hope bill or daddy on the scene is going to be good because there are allegations in West Hollywood people are purposely poisoning dogs oh\nWhat's going on there we'll explore don't go anywhere shepherd Ninety KBC [noise]\nFor six minute injury or the national key word and testing nine five eight one\nSolving dollars\nDuring\nSpring under some\nForward on JV Los Angeles county cumulus station [noise]\nFrom cell phones or just motion switches\nOh wow okay do we know which ones this these bumps had\nSnow and I was looking at the pictures trying to pick up some kind of idea there um you know he's he's wrapped it up I assume that he dropped it up in ...\nKate ... or so it's hard to see my I Can't even see a power source there needs to be a power source to cause a a and they ah causes spark so I I I Can't tell anything in there what I don't know if it was a badly made or whether it was\nNot intended to go off but um you know I I've been hearing that they are they are viable devices\nWhich means that they were set up a lot\nNow Steve wants to shift gears for a second and talk about the investigation because you are a CNN employee you're familiar with the bureau's you're familiar with how CNN operates\nWhen we go down to CNN to do our heads their bulletproof glass that separates\nThe CNN bureau from people who are just entering the building they've got security they're out there was a zoo or they consult with other organizations and they're constantly in contact with law enforcement if there are threats that are made there also cameras all around the perimeter really buying\nWhile back with the knife trying to get into CNN that's wrong I haven't been\nRight here in LA so my guess would be Steve that if someone dropped off a package\nTo the New York bureau or any of the other bureaus they would be on camera from every possible angle and there would be tons and tons and tons of evidence\nYeah and first I don't know if you said I was an employee or not I'm actually a contract on contract to them so not technically an employee but yeah in the New York office off Columbus Circle where I've done a few a hit um\nThere are they have a a ... even more robust security system going into that first war in the studios are well up ah on the higher floors but\nUm what I have\nHeard and and this is unconfirmed but you know the bicycle a a careers that are delivered these things are deliver packages all over my understanding is that that was delivered by a bicycle career\nOkay wow we didn't know that so when the ...\nFrom okay\nFine so I I'm ... socks because you've worked in in this counter intelligence and you understand them and and I and it's all just you know based on ideas not any facts at this point them because they will eventually have facts and maybe surveillance video hopefully\nI'm ... you think the same people same person because obviously they all came at the same time ah did that yeah I mean it does make sense correct I mean that's just the way it is absolutely\nAnd and one of the things about bombs um and and I've been trained in bombs investigation of the bombs themselves the devices themselves we don't even call them bombs by teacher would ask me for saying that uh I E D um that that we've got there is is going to be\nSo similar and they don't build them one at a time they build them probably five six at a time almost in their little assembly line process usually and they are very distinctive and very\nThey're very fingerprint is because uh you can look at a device a and and you know put it in front of a really experienced investigator maybe not me but you can put five devices in front and say two of these were made by the same person and they'll tell you which ones are\nAnd that's you know the Unabomber was that way the way he crashed I mean he was ... he was a craftsman with these weapons um and and it sounds so horrible to say it that way but uh he took pride in building devices to kill people\nHow ... that's ... yeah no kidding how much information do you think they have on the bomber or bombers right now that they're not disclosing that the public\n[noise] oh no [laughter] well they've got there there is so much information\nRight at this moment that they are that they are trying to just digest\nA first of all you know they don't have enough actionable stuff to go out and get somebody yet but the fact that none of these devices detonated means that we have everything I'm from from this bomber he used a lot of it he ... oh my gosh it's so\nEven even if you have gloves you're going to be able to pick up some information on\nIt he needs to take Dustin House they'll fine dust they'll find a certain kind of ... in the envelope and said this dirt is is you know native to this part of the country are you guys are awesome\nAnd so then they'll also and you know right down to I Can't ... where you know like pollen they'll go in and find pollen say came off of willow tree you know that kinda stuff while and so I'm so they'll find stuff like that you also have a lot of information on the profile as the choice of his targets are just a\nOr just a treasure trove of information and my guess is that this is not going to be another Unabomber case I don't think that this person was a spin the enough to get a\nTo get this done in a way that would keep them from being found\nAh okay so you think will be found sometime soon the next few days\nAnd you know I I I don't want to predict but I think he's going to be found fairly soon uh they're probably not going to just busting when they find them interesting they'll probably watch him for a day or two at least\nA they're also going to be obviously on on heightened alert for any more of these devices a you know these people send these in waves sometimes and uh once the first wave comes out and it makes the media like it did today this is about the time they'll try to send out the second wave in the\nGoddess wave 'em\nSo this is this is it time to do that but\nRight now uh they've got a lot of profiling information on on whoever it is is and um you know things like he spelled Wasserman Schultz his name wrong well\nYou know somebody who really careful is not going to make a mistake like\nThat right or good hasn't been done somewhat on purpose because obviously they're going to go and we know who Wasserman is but I eat you know what I mean I don't know I just I'm throwing theory out there who knows\nYeah I think I think ... generally and that's that's really a a good question and that will be um you know one of the things are any of these things uh like like you know left left ... a curve share you know are they trying to throw us off\nBut um I think\nIt in things like that that's not an obvious enough mistake for that to be in a burden or intentionally inadvertent a third intentionally um you know set out there to throw people off I think there's going to be a\nPossibly some uh attempts to conceal who they are but really this\nThis person kind of laid it out I mean he went right after people who had a call for a ... ... instability or an civility in politics and the people who you know they they went after the uh the right wing ...\nDo you think it's one individual or do you think it could be multiple people because sometimes when we we talk about bombs you talk about terrorist organizations you talk about groups of people who are trying to instill some sort of fear in a community or among a group of people\nAre other times and by the way Timothy McVeigh was one of those guys were you had a couple of people who are helping him out but then if you talk about the Unabomber you talk about the guy in Texas who was recently caught after sending bombs in the mail you have the lone wolves you had one person who is doing all the bombing or or making all the bombs themself\nRight and and that's a that's an excellent question I Would I Would probably guess that this person I'm is acting alone to people are going to make a\nBigger bombs than the type that were sent I mean these things or if I if I judge the size right they're not very large not that\nThey couldn't kill someone but they're not going to take down the front of a building so my guess is that this is a this is a lone individual and the fact that he chose that gauge of pipe to me means that he was probably trying to avoid\nGoing into a Home Depot and saying I Need a three inch diameter pipe one feet long with with two aunts caps threat it\nI mean all immediately but you can go into a home\nJoe Myers one of the intended targets of the five pipe bombs that arrived at different locations in New York Washington D. C. and Florida Today was former CIA director John Brennan whose name was on the envelope of the bomb that was sent to CNN's New York headquarters\nSpeaking at an event at the University of Texas at Austin Britain instead President Trump's repeated heated rhetoric and his political opponents can spur some people to do violent things\nHe needs to rethink what he is doing and saying he should not be beating the the Tom Tom's of of\nAnger and animosity and war\nHe should be trying to bring us together and he'll us as a people\nPolice say to people have died in a shooting at a Kroger grocery store on the outskirts skirts of Louisville, Kentucky the police chief in Jefferson town Sam Rogers says one person was fatally wounded inside the store a second was gunned down outside\nAt this point the earliest stage here that the race\nAnd closer to home a judge's unseemly in a search warrant and the rape case against the Newport Beach doctor and his girlfriend and attorney for one of the victims Dan Gillian says an sealing the war it could prevent other victims from coming forward\nSeveral women claim Dr grant robust show answer is to Riley drugged and sexually assaulted them but both of pleaded not guilty to the charges talk radio seven Ninety\nABC's sports the Dodgers are in Boston at Fenway looking even up the world series it a game of peace against the red Sox and the Lakers are in Arizona tonight they're looking for their first one of the season versus the Phoenix Suns tip off at seven PM\nAnd that sports on seven Ninety KABC traffic a market check whether and more of the drive home with Jillian and John next KBC news time is five thirty two\nIf you were a loved one or looking for a senior community ... unlike anything you've never seen before standing in welcoming apartment homes unparalleled lifestyle and exclude the dining ... the artist creative living visit Monticello drove ... or just schedule a personal\nTour hey Ben Shapiro\nHere today's world violent crime convicted by anyone at any time when it's your time well you'll be able to protect yourself and your loved one in ...

that position they pay you out and they pay you to shut you up essentially and and you do it because you want the money and that's the end of that\nBut sometimes they're greedy about these things [laughter]\nBut I think it's nothing for them and the big picture\nAlright so we have some more information about these bombs would have been showing up everywhere so Robert\nDeniro got one after we got off the air he got one you have the money on that to solve stop ... how did you get to your mom did you get in trouble\nRecently for saying that the liberals did this and themselves no you didn't say that somebody can do so and so now you said something\nLike that it would be historically anomalous if this were a right winger\nYeah now here's the thing I mentioned this earlier with Dr Drew we have a president that insights violence\nYou guys cannot argue with me he just said he love reporter got ...\nWell guess what he's got people in the audience that that aren't as smart and has evolved into a little chimney here there are a little too friends in the pudding nice little FBI investigate and we'll see who it is and if you think it's a Democrat I I don't know who it is a good thing but I\nFlag out not this is very rare I just do not think this was an angry right winger because we don't do that we found out what the PowerPoint demonstration and clean up the park afterwards and\nNobody wants to do Blaine one but there are crazy right winger and there are crazy left wing or that's what I'm going to it's a story mullet agreement with the possible but it's very rare the hope it's not rare that had gone to all Democrats why do you take a Democrat and this\nFall flag yeah to make it look like a rival [laughter]\nOh God Bless you and\nI'm going to happen right after Trump was elected with all the women allegedly getting the heat jobs ripped off them but I Would have said hold on winning all turned out to eat the synagogue burnings totally a false like\nTrump was blamed for that and it was an Israeli ... we try we human beings that we're blamed on Trump they were all\nWe do have a president who loves to have these I'm so over these stupid Frick in rallies can we stop with this now for ... to watch them it makes him excited there's my vase and and then he robs people of ice that money body slammed that reporter what a president who talks like this it's so stupid and I'm like\nI'm older people definitely knew that before the election but\nI Will tell you why you didn't have the labor is a rally but some people don't you don't have a lot of the audience was laughing they think it's some hotter cheer lazy but so far we have\nOne hundred percent left wing bombings and one that's unknown so I Am I going to be her right now the unknown I Will see what the ... about the okay but on but I don't think I Will pay a hundred dollars if NATO right wing or\nLeft wing or I think it's somebody who is not necessarily saying left wing or you know who knows it can be a former Russian but it's not a right wing or it'd be like that for a\nHundred thousand right what I find it out in his bedroom but when I said I I Would point something out to ask Julian yeah and this is why you I think you should support the rallies number one you don't have to watch them at the lawyer them if he's already got it on and on top of them is I mean it was really great\nStuff that he has promised that he is not done like a lot of things we would all agree it would make this country a better place this is like a focus group for Trump\nSo there's only one joke and it's just these rapid follower for things that is you know thirty thousand people that he had done their walls or your name or\nHe he promises everything and delivers nothing well that would like to join your if you would pay attention to what I'm saying well what I said no and he said I don't I don't have to listen I don't see a useful thing\nIs to get him to to actually fulfill his popular promises because you'll notice he does not get wild cheers and he knows he doesn't get wild cheers for promising to bring his neo ... more on a son in law to to Washington and let him run everything\nDon't want to bring in June to Washington he never got to cheer for that he's not getting a cheer for it now when it reminds him what he gets cheers for and maybe he will eventually\nDo the stuff he was about how come nobody will in these cells you know that's why you shouldn't be for long\nEnough and he said the same thing he gets his base all wrong I'm Out there I don't\nWe just you you know keep tabs on whether he said he's going to build the wall or the same thing at every around and you know you if you want to mention we do we do every single day and I say oh it was a young man rally\nYou know where he was talking about unfair to your right Montana Fleming reporters out of any ... and the good part\nOkay so the answer to your room you're in the media and\nSo you don't have a problem with him slamming us that we're all liars he's a snowflake you have to do that not all ...\nYou know but some are most of the mainstream media they've just completely dropped objectivity there it's insane who do you mind by news is not biased at all I don't watch Fox News okay what I watch MSNBC and CNN and they are constant inveterate perennial vicious liars what\nWhat are they a lot I just want to get one last week I wrote about it that\nThat woman Anna ... changed it in an entire segment altering a Trump quote in the middle of the Kavanaugh\nHearings he had said this is a scary time to be a young man in America you can be ... or something you didn't\nDo what you can bring interests she just to close to it's a scary time to be a man in America did an entire month on white men brings in large lawn white supremacy whites that is a slip of the tongue and this was\nA premeditated lie about the president in June racial Adrian to create these divisions that ... that end up getting people killed when you think the president just talking about scary time for a white that's all like\nA slip of the tongue and let me ask you a question that vicious law and he said the other day that he's a white nationalist or he said he's a national uh same thing what he wanted anyway let's say they are no more I can tell me he said he's an hour now what does that you love your country as opposed you can browse the brown and love your country\nYou can oh he didn't whites uh-huh okay you're the one who's injecting race into that he said nationalist that he made a good laugh it's been a good thing\nAbout the people in your country follows you caring about Goldman Sachs they are the globe oh he loves Goldman Sachs he's half of them ever he said that he wasn't going to have it on his his regime and now he loves he loves to go to rallies where he says things that are popular\nOh to Washington and does the thing I don't know if you're one presenter but he loves one percenters and he certainly has tax break a lot of them they're in good positions\nIf I find like really ... around and other things he said you're not going to get much argument none of the ... the the the tax on telling you if you're going to have our our ... I don't I mean we're discussing the things Trump has done as opposed to the things he said he was going to do\nIs he is he responsible for any of the I hate to say hysteria but the anger on the part of people like me where he's not translucent he doesn't show is happening so we don't know we're like well is he doing business is he making profit I don't know All right hold off on it out and said I don't know\nWe'll be back we'll be wild animal\n[laughter] [noise] oh it was up to the middle you have is futile is available\nOnline that Amazon dot com and culture dot com thanks so much thank you so let's take a look all the latest headlines\n[noise] ABC News is live and local at three thirty\nOne I'm Jeff whittle FBI investigators are still trying to determine who sent pipe bombs to several prominent Democrats and CNN\nAnd whether they were meant to detonate or simply to sow fear at a briefing with reporters this afternoon FBI assistant director William Sweeney says they ruled out one possible threat posed by those packages\nParents to the device was located in New York which continued to counter the initial analysis indicates that the powder in those particular ... did not present a biological for other analysis is only going\nThree more package bombs were intercepted early this morning to founded separate male facilities in Delaware that were addressed the former vice president Joe Biden another pipe bomb was sent to Robert De Niro production company in New York\nA man and woman died after falling from tapped point in Yosemite National park the national Park Service announced today park rangers were trying to recover the bodies this morning\nBut it's still not known what the two people were doing or whether anyone else was with them when they fail and the two victims of not yet been identified a re Donovan actor accused of driving under the influence of alcohol with a two year old son on his lap and crashed as a band into a parked car\nPleaded not guilty today the felony andme misdemeanor charges Marion pooch hall of Sherman Oaks was charged yesterday with one felony count um child abuse and to a misdemeanor count some drunk driving and according to the LA county da's office all his new back in court in Burbank on December Eighteenth\nAnd government scientists of classified Eighteen volcanoes in the United states has a very high threat because of the likelihood Bello robbed and how close they are the people the U.S Geological Survey has updated its volcano threat assessment for the first time since two thousand five\nIn Hawaii is killer way at tops the list that has been a rough theme for much of this year rounding out the top five are mount saint Helen's mount Rainier and Washington Alaska's readout volcano in Mount Shasta in northern California\nThe other two California volcanoes on that list or mount last and and long valley talk radio seven\nNinety ...
