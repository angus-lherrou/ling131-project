[noise]\nWay to get some\nCommon\nSense you shouldn't headquarters ABC Los Angeles Orange County a cumulative station [noise]\nThey're they're definitely test that you take and you have symptoms Yes sir yes\nSo now that she knows what she has how long will it be before she's totally gone or where she starts to to a show symptoms of Alzheimer's to the point where she starts to forget about who's around her or what she knows all those things\nWill it I suspect that this has been going by the time she has made this this announcement as she has a um she's quite a private person but she's made this announcement out publicly that she's suffering from dementia and therefore wants to remove herself from public life because she cannot be certain what she would for example say or do\nIn public life she can't be held accountable now and she knows that and good for her for making that announcement\nThis old timers itself is a progressive and\nNone curable disease and that does ultimately result in death she's eighty eight now Sandra Day O'Connor's eighty eight now so the progression to death would be generally over a period most\nLikely of two to three years with progressive worsening of her disease now at the age of eighty eight you know already a two to three year lifespan wouldn't be uncommon for somebody to\nDie in the early nineties so how much\nAh how much worse for symptoms will get I Can't say but it when people have onset of Alzheimers for example in their seventies and would otherwise have been expected to have a life expectancy injured maybe their middle or late eighties\nThose people can die very premature death people can die over a period of three to four years with old timers and therefore if they've onset of symptoms in their seventies or late sixties might not make it anywhere near their their life expectancy\nOf a doctor or would you do\nYou think it's kind of crazy that we're point the Supreme Court justices for life I mean I I we're lucky that she's stepping down some people might have more hubris and they might say and it might be narcissism it on a fair amount and I don't know what's happened and I don't know when I'm presenting over I don't care\nHaving fun [laughter] I I have to tell\nYou I mean I you know I thought Ruth Bader Ginsburg and been replaced with a wax figure some\nYears ago [laughter] I guess we have a background yeah you know bad at one point [laughter] everybody held oh era and her nose yeah not yeah\nI I'm not sure it's so so I think though that you are right I it takes a big person to be able to say I am feeling I Am I Am not in full control of my senses of my cognition and therefore I'm going to remove myself either from this job\nOr certainly from public life so that I can have this in private it's a very old timers in dementia are incredibly debilitating and one of the hardest part is generally it happens like this where people are unfortunately\nPainfully aware that they are losing their faculties and when you're someone who was as brilliant as Sandra Day O'Connor who is now watching themselves be\nYou know in this kind of decline in some ways it as more painful and more brutal than watching a physical\nDecline where you can't do the things physically you could be four to lose your your men patient to lose your ability to reason or to make sense of things is incredibly difficult and as with great grace I think that she made this announcement I Do think that\nThe problem with these lifetime appointments on something like the Supreme Court is what is the method that we have to say to somebody hey you're not seeing it yourself or you aren't aware that you are not making total sense all the time and therefore it's your obligation to step down and we don't really have that\nSystem in place yeah\nI Wonder how often people were in denial when the doctors told them this is what you have this is what you're suffering from and they say no no no no no I'm just forgetting because I'm older when it's not a disease mhm\nIt is very common and yeah and really it's the spouse frequently frequently one\nOr the other uh generally the spouse was the one thing I'm\nHoney I think you should go let's go talk to the doctor this doesn't seem right and sometimes it takes unfortunately sort of a critical event where somebody gets a last for example on their way home last doing something that they did all the time in other words they went to the grocery store and didn't come back for for\nOur yet and they finally say yeah I I was lost or they have done something they have for the umpteenth time misplaced their wallet misplace the keys done something that is\nDangerous gone to bed while leaving the stove on so for example you know gone to bed while leaving that this water running ... things where you were some it takes a family member to walk in and say mom mhm the stove the\nBurners were on on the stove and you are sound asleep and you'd gone to bed you know forget it and when that person can no longer make an excuse because you're exactly right on\nMany people try to write it off as oh everybody gets for that for once in a while I was hired you know I just wasn't thinking on and so it takes a a a family member or a family doctor to say\nOkay this is a little more ... let's go ahead and just do some quick tests and see kind of where you are now because because dementia all dimensions from your old timers are progressive if you do neurological testing things that test memory and cognition those sorts of things\nIf you repeat them six months later and you're seeing a decline you can surf show people progressive declined and nice and say\nThis isn't going the right direction and there are medications are are things we can do there's no cure for Alzheimer's but there are medications that will improve some of the symptoms including that forget bonus or agitation depression sleep disturbance the sorts of things that commonly go hand in hand with dementia\nDo we have any idea how people get Alzheimer's and I asked that question because not only has the Supreme Court justice been diagnosed with OCD her husband got it too and she was part of the reason why she left the court was to take care of him and he got a girlfriend exactly you\nKnow and we we really don't\nWe do not know there is clearly some genetic component to it and there's actually a genetic test on that will help that you can take that will show whether or not you have the predilection to develop Alzheimer's disease\nThere are some indication that there are some environmental factors certainly exposure to certain heavy metals and things of that sort\nDo in order to interrupt the need to do that and the twenty three me I get all my medical and tells you all that stuff which is you know up to ... yeah yeah I think it's great and you know it\nDoesn't mean that if you if you have the gene it doesn't mean that you will get old timers just like if you don't have it it doesn't mean you can't but it is a\nA predictor it there's an increased incidents in ... people who have certain genetic factors now interestingly and one of the things that you can do there are things you can do to help to decrease your risk of it to things in particular are the are taking vitamin e making sure that you are\nGetting adequate among the vitamin E. and interestingly\nAnti inflammatory medications like ibuprofen Advil\nUm ... there's some indication that some of those neural tangles those things I said we're short circuit in the brain a and the different nerve connections that some of that may be inflammatory and that taking\nRegular low dose anti inflammatory medications I mean on a daily basis ... things like Advil or that that decreasing that inflammatory response may in fact be protective\nDo you get enough vitamin D from a multi ... should you take it as a as a stand alone pill\nYou you can get enough ranked as a multi vitamin frankly you can get almost not if you eat thoughtfully those things that I always preached those healthy fats\nThings like nuts I caught a lot of them and red wine all the things that are and why are far neural protective narrow that\nThey really are very narrow protected in fact you decrease it is not necessarily sort of counterintuitive drinking daily but drinking model very\nModerately on a daily basis and\nFree protects against not only all comers and all forms within mentioned but Parkinson's and other neurodegenerative diseases so\nEating a diet that is adequate in those healthy fats avocados nuts salmon those sorts of things in addition to drinking moderately unless you have a some kind of a confrontation to that drinking you know are\nYou going to be like why why\nThat from what you're saying but it is more to the left and there may be a rise from violence coming from the right but that's a reaction to all these years of being ... on at rallies having hats hold off\nYou know having fake blood thrown on you there's only so much you can take\nYou know no matter how calm demeanor is there's only so many insults there's only so many times you can get pushed before you push that my wrong\nWell I I mean you're not wrong but I'm ... you might be right in the sense that these far right groups have sprouted up in ...\nYou know in response to the left but what I Would say is when I worked at a uh right right leaning news station I can tell you this that people on the right tend to be in my experience anecdotally people enter I tend to be more tolerant and people on the left and I've noticed that more after moving to Los Angeles\nAnd seeing intolerance to anyone who did not agree with your political view and that's why people can't walk around wearing those hats or you know have a Trump bumper sticker because it it literally doesn't site if not violence then you know harsh rhetoric\nWill keep this going eight hundred to two to five to two to Lawrence wanted to

C.\n\nWritten by the\nTime\nEffort to you all three when you say either\nYes Hi thanks for taking my call Dr Laura I just wanted to say that on well uh there are life\nTopics involved here that weighs heavy on my mind and what bothers me the motives that I think what I derive from a lot of callers is that we have to normalize that behavior that is absolutely not normal\n[laughter] we're asked to kind of accept things that we had been observing and sing and let him go because our president does a terrific job on some level if he does but it's important to note that this president any president sets the tone for the country\nAnd I think and that is part of the job\nAbsolutely learn and I think that it has had a cumulative effect on our country so rather than dissecting what percentage and who's to blame and what and where I think that by and large as a country we've been affected because imagine for a moment during the Obama administration\nSix seven Republican strongholds would have received these kind of pipe bombs what do you think when it happened\nI I Would I don't think would have been accepted him not to read what your point is I mean that was never happened\nIt would have never happened to begin with because we had a president that set the tone for our country and we will relatively United so the idea that\nHis demeanor his behavior makes no difference I think is is really a fallacy\nOkay that could be that could be I I Know I don't disagree with you but but I'm just thinking about the country not being divided I I've always thought as President Trump the symptom of how divided we were we just didn't know it I agree fully lines when word of either we just didn't realize we were to buy a thank you to read I appreciate it and or Lisa go ahead and say we say\nHey I'm stuck to true I think that you guys have been very fair and most of your conversation about this number one I liked the fact that you guys go back and forth I'm On this and you get kind of dialogue and talked to a true but the one thing that concerns me is that when did we start you can look at\nThose caters bank yeah frightens me yeah people are allowed to vote\nYou know but that was that I that was my first thought when I called and listening to other people the second thing that came to my mind was the lady was trying to justify and ... that you on your opinion can your data\nBut if you listen\nYou can hear how her aggression was writing a right she was negating completely everything that she was trained to\nWrite and unfortunately that exactly where we're at through her baby so hard to talk to anyone with a differing pre I\nLiterally wanting to look at her data and she wouldn't have it and the other thing\nThat was concerning was that when you did look at the data and it wasn't what justified or support at her opinion then she said look deeper so\nThat is looking at what\nLet me just say as a reporter if I relied on a Google Search to make light of mine I Would be fired you name it scientists but to recall\nWhat what's even not just a scientist but you know my my personal as it is an investigator would if I can attest to get in a client exactly only looked at that information that justified that person being guilty right they can't do that as a society\nThat's not worth thinking is I I did earlier today I Dreamed breakfast and learn and we just under educated we just not being smart really what's going on your\nWind or do we do see now I think I think like choosing to be naive because that justifies our opinion and it makes us feel better to be right\nThank you yeah better to be accurate then write better to be accurate than writing a very important thing Lisa thank you so much that you off guard that you're listening to science friday Dr

have you back\nPoliticians and the president um you know I'm In our history you know a lot of people believe you know when they talk about\nViolence in the United states is usually talk about gun violence and gun violence has nothing compared to the violence of the United states you know a hundred years ago I mean there were cases of the massive bombings that we just we just don't talk about in public discourse today\nThe LA got bombed at one point right went out so it out so this situation right now waiting right they were they were intercepted they were alive bombs so correct they could have been detonated\nThat's what they believe that yeah that's what they're saying now show um here's the thing was you know none of them went off that's a good thing or did did they not go off because they're not good builders or does that go off because\nThe timeline or the triggering device wasn't um triggered or were they\nNot supposed to go off and just draw attention and that's what the FBI we'll find out in the secret service and they're also working with the ATF alcohol Alcohol Tobacco firearms\nAnd um although in you know in my book secret to the secret service I'm ... I'm ... I'm critical of\nThe upper echelon of the secret service and the FBI but the guys that are in the ... men and women that are doing this investigation or the G. S. you know ten eleven twelve Thirteen four teams that are good working a hardworking men and women and they'll they'll get this done they you know give them a couple of days\nAnd they'll have their sorted out um it's hard to your past behavior when it comes to the\nThe the people's behavior past behavior is dictated or future behavior is going to be addicted but past behavior the wherever this is\nGoing down it right then and then\nThey'll leave you know the people will say oh I'm not surprised you know look what happened when they eventually found the Unabomber you know um they found them because his brother recognizes writing that right so so so ... there's a lot of things that that has to happen and they will happen and if they could have done\nWhat I hear that let's talk about the investigation because not long ago we had a guy mailing bombs in the state of Texas\nAnd those packages every time you drop 'em off at a post office or a FedEx what have you they put a sticker on with a bar code\nAnd every time they move that package they scan it so they know exactly where the packages\nThey should be able to find out where these packages originated from and I would imagine that some of these post offices or mailboxes et cetera wherever it was that he mailed it from the video surveillance and they'll be able to go back and see just exactly who was the drop them off at the post office right\nThat's exactly right now they didn't do the one little hiccup that may be and you're in that scenario and you probably have it right but you kind of mentioned earlier is\nIf he delivered on himself or whoever the builder is had suddenly deliver it where they wouldn't have these\nStickers and there wouldn't be a real process to uh to investigate but you can't get around the fact that wherever they delivered there was some kind of video surveillance if it was not the building it was in it was the post office across the street or the bank across the street\nThere that the chances that wherever these packages were dropped off that somebody wasn't caught on video surveillance\nAre the chances of their work on a very high so\nThat they were I'm just going through the whole last year a pipe bomb was founded billionaire George Soros is home mailbox now that could have been hand delivered\nI'm sure he has to care on he's a billionaire right there were kill a additional explosives intercepted on route to Hillary Clinton and Barack Obama another suspicious package and CNN's newsroom as you mentioned John\nAnd I can tell you by the way there is video surveillance are moving them around the perimeter of building or if your hand delivered to CNN he's on tape guaranteed\nAnother suspicious package was found in sunrise Florida at Debbie Wasserman Schultz his office\nOr the offices of the San Diego union Tribune and other businesses were briefly evacuated a after suspicious packages described his priority mailboxes near palm\nRespond and I don't know if that was a bomb and then police intercepted a suspicious package that was males representative Maxine Waters um and now it's just it's just package also sent to New York governor Andrew Cuomo act to his Manhattan office so I mean that's like seven right there\nThat were today\nSo that many packages for one it's you know it it is it more than one person doing it and it's coincidental and the timing or is it\nYou know one person who's been working on it for very long time and gotten his ducks in a row so to speak or is it a group of people doing it um at one time and like I said the FBI will and the secret service and the ATF and their and their local partners in these areas that they will figure this out and you just got to give them a little bit of time\nI'm ... and you know like it a lot of these cases they may end up stumbling on to the the clues or that the people by accident look how we got Timothy McVeigh because if you had a license plate it out um you know through history we've stumbled over\nUm wanna criminals by accident and then realized we had who were looking for so that's always a possibility too\nWhat about the contents of the bomb itself because I Would imagine that you know how to go to a local hardware store or do you do a pipe bomb and it's easy to get in there right\nRight there absolutely is and the other thing too is\nThere's more evidence than normal because they didn't detonate so it's pretty hard to build you really have to be sophisticated to build something and not leave some kind of DNA whether it's saliva or from your drilling while you're building a fingerprint some anybody can put gloves on but it's not that simple um\nIf if you know if they mix if they actually made a mix if the if the explosive they were using was a mix it's possible that fall hair follicles\nGet a felon it while they were doing it I mean you really have to be sophisticated to keep all you know DNA evidence out of something like that so um\nYou know it it will tell it will give them a lot of evidence and a lot of stuff to investigate I'm not just that but the way it was built the or the FBI and the ATF had this huge data bank of explosives and the military it's actually that they they pull all their information of\nEvery bomb has been made in the last hundred years you know whether it was just twist and wires together with the radio battery or something incredibly sophisticated so they have a lot to go on and a lot of stuff to uh\nYou know to fall back on as far as you know this was used here in this bombing is this bomb different than the one that was found it at one office as opposed to the other with a bomb center President Obama different than the ones I'm center Mrs Clinton that type of thing so\nIs this something that you can teach yourself on line or do you have to have some kind of ... very good of you to you can see\nBy more chili yeah unfortunately it can but here's the thing you have to be pretty damn good electronics I mean you can\nThirty right thirty seven percent\nI remember during the uh the the height of the of the war with the British with the IRA and thirty seven percent of the bombs that were built didn't go off and Seventeen to like\nTwenty two percent actually blew up while they were making them I'm In the middle east there's this kind of a running joke and are investigating bombers that you just look for the guys that are missing all the fingers\n[laughter] so yeah no absolutely yeah oh\nYeah yeah so um you know and then again I'm you know past behavior can dictate future behavior and and\nSo if this person has a clean record in just snapped but I ... in my mind I find it hard to believe that somebody just snapped and all of a sudden had the ability to to build these devices\nTeams you've been in this business the secret service agent you stand yeah it seems like this is calculated and time consuming and what do you think the odds and this is just your opinion\nOn that in more than one person a given the you know different locations and the numerous people involved that were on the receiving end the ...\nI Do think I Do think it's likely or at least possible and the reason I say that is because I fall back on the like the experiences we've had him in the Timothy McVeigh did not pull that off by himself\nRealize it was a little bit larger of a of a deal but this this is pretty coordinated and although being a couple of some of the stuff around a couple of days at different times\nThat doesn't mean it was just one person it just means that they were trying to stagger there if it was more than one person that we're trying to stagger their deliveries um for many reasons um you know to avoid detection who knows\nUm but you know again getting them give the authorities a couple of days a week or so and when they should have a lot more information is not anything that's going to die away you know as they are going to have to have some answers there surely\nEvery so often you hear a story about a building that's evacuated because of a bomb threat or an airport the evacuated it's my understanding that there weren't any prior threats before these devices were starting to show up in the mail is that uncommon\n[noise] no it's not but but I find it hard to believe it might not have been any threats to deal with this one incident but\nIt's all these um uh the news agency of the\nPeople that were that we're a target it had been threatened before many times you know politicians they just can't get away from it\nAnd uh and you know CNN you know I'm like them or not they you know they they um have a generator Tamil will uh unwillingly and and I'm sure they've been threatened before you know whether it was just by you

are a white person or\nOf course and it puts out a white with like a kid that was okay as long as you're addressing other character\nOkay so that one of the comments have got her in trouble\nRight and I'm just me I sort of interject here\nI don't know many black people that are doing white face but here's they just fell here's the difference that's right when he's the anchorman or that's not very funny when he does the white little like here's the thing you know a\nBlack people this was done as a joke on them when they weren't allowed on TV or radio and they they had Amos and Andy that were to midway rye menstrual act which were done to over exaggerate and to make fun of and ridicule so I\nI was listening to a a a Robin quiver so they put it very succinctly 'cause I was on the fence again like I get it I Would never do it she said you\nDo that for one day it was a mockery of black people for for very long time we wear black face all the time so you do it for one day of Halloween and and and the history goes back and it's not pretty for us so it it's it's if it represents that and it's ugly then don't do it it's pretty simple\nThe minstrel shows were definitely racist and always have led faces racist so All right let me give you a scenario yeah you have kids mhm let's say ... four years old\nAnd he wants to go out of Diana Ross [laughter] I mean like a no go ahead let's say Rocco comes to you and say I want to be Black Panther for Halloween oh yeah of course he was here last year okay but it's not it's a cop mask\nOkay so it was a mascot paint\nCorrect but I I did paint the black panther on his face because I wanted him to go to school and not have the mask on okay but it's not Black Panther like it's the black panther yeah it's really more of the animal than it is the guy who played by panther footage that allowed because not\nMuch of a different race yeah it was if your five year old comes to you and says I Want to be an Indian yeah is that allowed yeah and are you allowed to put the war paint enough\nI Would historically speaking if he wants to be someone like that I don't\nI I don't have a problem with that either but but again you know black people minstrel shows those were meant they weren't meant to be fine they weren't hiring black people it was two white guys pretending to be block on the radio and then when he was an anti came along with in the fifties I guess they weren't black they were right when the black or where they two white guys playing black again\nI'm so confused well there was a radio show and then I think they were Whitey show\nYes that is correct yeah but either way it was it was done and and and it's a hurtful for black people for forever or they weren't allowed to be I mean do you see the the big lips and the extra wide no yeah I mean it was meant as a ... of it was ... so\nYou know if she doesn't understand that you know I I don't\nThink there's anything racist about a five year old being Black Panther I just don't\nAre heroes they want no no no no this was based on ... you know the whole backstory this was based on one of the Beverly Hills housewives who is a grown woman she's like fifty five years old and wanted to go out of Diana Ross and want\nAn afro and deadlocked face oh I thought the conversation was about ... fickle correctness now it was about it was about Lou and Lou in so from that
