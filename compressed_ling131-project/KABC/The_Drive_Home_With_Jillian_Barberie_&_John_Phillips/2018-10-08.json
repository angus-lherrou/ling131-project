{"content": "Tony Bennett with rags to riches and you know the estate taxes and probate and all that kind of stuff it's actually designed to do the exact opposite is designed to take you from riches to rags and we do not want that to happen to you so every week at this time we have our estate tip of the week\nSo but this week as I said we're deviating we're going to talk about your blood and most valued spouse okay so we're going to talk about a Q tip trust so\nWhat is a Q tip trust will basically\nYour if you live in a community property state or if you have divided up your state for a state tax purposes and all of that you're half of the state is what would normally go into the Q tip trust or some portion there up okay now the ... trust is designed\nTo benefit your spouse so therefore the rules of this trust or set up for their benefit\nSo what does that mean it means that they can your spouse can get to the money that first of all your spouse can be the trustee which means you're your spouse decides where the money's invested your spouse decides on distributions from the trust so there there's very little lack of control that has now happened for for your spouse\nThat's number one there is a little bit of control and that is because the trust has some rules and the rules are that the money can be distributed for what's called hams H. E. M. S. health education maintenance and support\nSo what the heck does that mean I mean how you define does and that's the point okay health education maintenance as well so anything that your spouse needs for their health for their education their maintenance and their support\nThey can take money out of the trust for that for their benefit and they're the decider as a trustee if it fits that definition\nSo essentially what it means is that the trust has to keep them in the lifestyle that they become accustomed to okay so that if they are accustomed to a a Toyota lifestyle they can't suddenly have a Ferrari lifestyle [laughter]\nOkay [laughter] so they have to\nHave to live within what they were living before but you know most spouses I think would be okay with that so what are other advantages well suppose your spouse is not good with money\nYou can name a different trustee to help with that also if you had the Brady Bunch family you know if if you have different children\nAnd you want your spouse to be taken care of while they're alive but upon their death you wanted to go back to your kids you can do that with a with a Q tip trust so there are lots of advantages to the Q tip trust and they can protect your spouse from lawsuits and if they get remarried\nThan the new ... husband or wife that that is in the picture and have no access to this money so there's all kinds of benefits that distress can provide okay so it's one for your spouse and it's called a Q tip trust qualified terminal interest property but\nTo tips easier to say any way hum if you'd like to talk to one of our financial advisors about your estate planning about how to pass onto the aforementioned greedy and washed undeserving airs a than what you can do is you can go to our website is money matters dot net money matters dot net\nAnd you can click on meat with an advisor\nAnd what we'll do is scheduled time to visit\nNow when we visit this is for those of you are over fifty who are retired are retiring soon okay so that's you when we visit we want to talk about your entire financial life not just your estate planning so we want to help you with Social Security decisions\nWe want to help you with a retirement planning decisions or income tax decisions you know all those kinds of things that impact someone who is retired are retiring soon we want to help you to make those decisions\nAnd if we can help you that's fantastic will do it at no charge obligation\nAnd if we can I help you that's fine too okay so either way we will part friends\nWell Dorothy it is not too wonderful to be true because it is true so do that okay\nNow if you don't want to go directly to an advisor then what I Would recommend is that you go to one of our seminars okay and we have seminars near you if you can you hear my voice there was a seminar near you pretty much\nAnd uh you can find those again on our website money matters dot net at the same or we're going to talk about uh several things were going to talk about you know a Social Security decisions are going to talk about how to protect yourself from the next market crash which we think will happen in two thousand and twenty\nA we'll talk about ah do you have enough money to retire on all those kinds of things we will talk about at the center or some money matters dot net for all of the above\nWell you know what Jack I cannot believe that the show's over already well ladies and gentlemen I Hope you've enjoyed it as much as I have enjoyed doing it for you will see you next week same time same channel by by everybody [noise]\n[noise] [noise] information presented should not be regarded as a complete analysis on the subject was God's hands and not being construed as an offer to buy or sell any of the security has mentioned [noise] none of this show's content you viewed as personalized investment by a professional\nAdvisor Cindy consulted been more implementing any of the strategies presented numerous times and other methods involve varying degrees of rent and therefore getting no or anything any specific invented the strategy will be suitable profitable for outlined more slowly tax\nPlanning information offered on this program is general in nature always insolvent attorney or tax\nNational regarding years that they make legal taxing the way she sounded ... should not be construed as\nAn endorsement of ... or ...

and reserve those seats the number is eight eight eight nine nine one\nEight seven to three that's eight nine nine one eight seven to three if you end up being colors nine or Twenty one sorry about that but his up at free O T H class dot com and see if you can scores of passes\nLarry as we start to kind of continued on this path of making money in multiple directions we got the job market we've got the down market you know what are some of the hurdles people have to overcome we touched on a few minutes ago as far as the Bush by us that we already have is being consumers\nMaybe maybe you could take that into it into a ... expand on that WIPP for our listeners and even even anything else that that you work with or that you deal with when you're working with new students whether they have twenty years' experience or their brand new to the markets on how they really can structure things to make sure they're poised to profit as the markets are coming down\nGreat question right in the number one mistake that most people make when it comes to trading are investing is they try to do it on their own\nThey don't get themselves educated said no it's okay I'll do it on my own and eventually maybe I'll get around to some education the problem is to very costly less and why would you want to spend all that time energy and money\nWhen you can learn a system and what I Love about the term system Ryan it's saving yourself stress time energy and money\nAnd so we teach our students is to trade again like banks do back in February last year Goldman Sachs had a ridiculously large winning day was ... million dollars in one day simply by shortening the markets and so I Want to use the analogy hurt me use it before\nIt's like driving a car if anyone said T well you can go anywhere you want to go in this world right now but the car can only go and drive you can never put it in reverse\nIt'd be pretty frustrating Dr number one you're educated enough to know that the car goes both directions well most people don't realize so did the markets you can trade when the markets are going up you can trade when the markets are going down to what most people have learned\nBy coming to the academy ... coming educated and not trying to do it on their own is if there's a simple step by step process of system regardless of how old you are your background your education level if you're somebody who's coach ... someone who is committed you can make money trading the markets like the banks do\nYeah and when you look at how we learn how to do anything that's really how we learn how to trade and invest as well it doesn't change just because we're in the investing world and and the thing that the thing I was stressed inside my classes that we focus on the skill and that was one of the things that my\nMy mentors really pushed on me about Fifteen sixteen years ago was focused on the skill and the money will come the the the issue ends up being is it's a natural tendency for us to stare at the money right out of the gate and we want to make I got to me I Want to make a hundred dollars a day we got to be that starting right now right rather than building the skills you have the skill you can generate the money but you have to have the skill first so many times\nWe tried to put the cart in front of the horse there and that's where the appropriate type of mentoring and teaching and different things like that can can can really help you know too many times we we\nApproached the markets in and and when I talk to people is very normally that did they say that I say I I lost a question are you looking for a get rich quick program you know and and everyone always says oh no no no I'm I'm not looking at looking for that and I say well good 'cause that's not what the financial markets are this is where you really have to develop the skill to be able to go in and generate the income but once you have the skill\nYou can generate the income at the skill has to come first and it's that the patience of developing the skill that really determines in my opinion whether or not somebody a successful or not it's just like I I I compared to flying an airplane I mean how comfortable would you be if you sat down a inside of a seven forty seven and you're about to fly from LA to New York\nAnd over the intercom you heard the pilots say well good afternoon ladies and gentlemen I just finished my Youtube video on drag versus lift we are ready to take off\nRight and that that's not going to get you there you have plenty of knowledge on on how flight actually works the mechanics behind it but as far as the skill to fly and navigate that plane up across the country that's a\nThat's a whole different conversation we would never get on that plane because that's the life or death situation but unfortunately we do that with our money all the time we did that with a lot of things all the time and and when we're dealing with our money is a financial life or death situation that we can be putting ourselves to\nAbsolutely let's face it we've been doing this for over Twenty one years right now we've had over half a million students have come through the academy to learn how to trade the right way the way that the banks make money at the end of the day what you're really hoping to do is find freedom you want to be able to\nFind a way to generate income to allies spend more time with your family some people want to move on and do a different type of job maybe one a volunteer locally in your community the thing that we want to do most is get back the time that we don't want to lose and so\nA lot of our students have been very grateful to come in to spend a little time with us and learn how they not only can generate more income but also save themselves more time\nYeah absolutely we're coming up next to a break when you say we squeeze in another give away let's do it All right well we've got our ... class coming up and

way the market is going and whether you're just tuning in maybe your first time was there maybe you've been with us for the whole show\nDon't worry the best is yet to come and learn a lot of our listeners are looking to really replace their income with trading investing in some of them are just looking to you know fulfill that New Year's resolution of upgrading their lifestyle with a little bit of it is of additional income\nUm knew some of them are looking just to kind of supplement things other people are really out in that situation where they want to fire their boss there's a whole a whole gamut of kind of ultimate goals that people have when it comes to generating more income but there is that one consistency between all of these groups it all boils down to another source of income we've talked a little bit about multiple streams of income passive income\nActive income and I want to use as you were saying the last in the last segment want to spend a little bit of time kind of diving a little bit deeper into these topics and and when you guys are working with people specifically looking to to branch out their streams of income what's what's that starting point and what does that pathway kind of look like\nWell starting off with your whole idea about resolutions I mean we're coming up at that time of year Ryan\nWhere we start getting a barrage of videos and and ... and all this stuff about why we have to go to the gym you start seeing TV commercials because one of the biggest resolution says what losing weight the second biggest is getting out of debt and there's just something that a lot of students come in now the reason why most people are poor\nP.

C. [noise]\n\nYou're listening to power trading wage welcome back if you're just tuning in us Larry Jacobs director instructor development and having structure it on I ... really shed some light on income over ... we talked a lot about multiple streams of income we\nTalked about different types of income passive\nIncome active in a little while ago we did a whole a whole series on passing versus versus active income\nAnd and it's so much fun to talk about income everybody needs more income whether it's whether it's for income for today or whether it's income for tomorrow and I'm not income for tomorrow is what we want to spend a little bit of time on in this segment talking to a little bit about the retirement accounts\nAnd so one of the things that may be missed out on that last segment as far as talking about more a more generating more income will do where we're gonna be doing it in this segment but really focusing on that retirement side of the the income equation\nWhether you're tuning in for the first time maybe you've been with us for the whole show don't worry get excited the best is yet to come and Larry sometimes I'll be talking with a lot of our listeners and and that happens a lot via social media we got the Twitter we've got the Facebook\nRose got all these different avenues where they can reach out they can ask questions we have different the different ... in our series and stuff like that but one of the things that we hear a lot there's two things really that we hear a lot\nNumber one we're hearing from people saying that they don't have enough money to retire even with the markets at all time high is right now\nThey don't have enough money to retire and those that do have enough money to retire are consistently saying they're not quite sure what to do with their money so maybe if you could address a few of those topics because I'm sure we got a lot of listeners in one or two of those ... one or both of those situations listening to us right now\nLet's talk about urgency because right now historically statistically the markets and to correct about every ten years or so so here we are ten years later like I mentioned earlier in the show we're seeing the Federal Reserve continuing to raise interest rates were seeing the housing markets starting to reverse so what does this mean for you\nWho are listening right now with the first thing we got to do is go back to how this all started if you have a four one K. where you're only able to trade and mutual funds the biggest concern you should have right now is the fact that prior to\nTwo thousand we came into the mutual fund world at Nineteen nineties where it was a roaring bull market well the first time we experienced any pain was back in two thousand so what makes this different than most is if you have a pension where your boss is set aside money for you\nThose monies were protected because it was coming out of our their payroll are coming out of profits and it was put aside the separate account and it wasn't subjected to what was happening in the markets will everything in your four O. one K. is not protected in fact if you think about a congressional people in senators they don't have for one case they have\nPensions intentionally because they want to make sure that they have this money available do our taxes will right now you should be thinking about especially if you're putting money in every two weeks into your Ira\nFour one K. you're investing at all time highs\nAs you might have mentioned I don't remember but let's just worth repeating that the market falls three times faster than it goes up so right now if you're investing the majority of your money in the last couple of years at all time highs right now than it is a lot more room for this money to fall you should be concerned\nBecause we saw what happened back in two thousand eight it was a four O. one K. the became a two oh one K.\nAnd again it took about six years to recover\nWell this is much higher than we've ever seen before in fact if I look at the Buffett index speaking of course of Warren Buffett right now it's higher and more extended\nThan we ever see that index have been in the past and they simply means that if we have a correction and things continue what's to say this for all and K won't become a one oh one K. and do you have the time right now to be able to put off your retirement and still work when you thought you were going to be able to finally retirement and start living your life\nThe the the the the way to make money in the market hasn't changed or a thousand years we're talking about it earlier when you brought up shorting and making money as the markets are going down it's always been by low so high and it will always be by low so high so what's the probability of buying an all time highs as being you buy low opera opportunity\nRight can markets go higher than they absolutely can we're taking on a lot of risk in those situations there's ... there's constant pull back there's constant wholesale offerings even as the markets are going higher and over paying for things is is really what limits are potential upside and what opens up the downside for uh\nFor for risk you know we we talk a lot about the the bullish biased and how as consumers we just usually sit there and buy everything we Bye bye Bye bye bye And right now the markets are going higher and higher and every payday the average person buys more stocks they buy stocks through their mutual funds to their four one case\nBathroom there are a speed through their IRAs doesn't matter what account type it is that ... that the general practice kind of around the world is on payday we just buy stocks\nIt doesn't matter what the prices though just matters that it's payday and so we are going to invest into it now is the markets are collapsing our financial advisors have a brilliant way of of of talking to us about why it's okay to continue to buy as the markets are going down\nRight they call it dollar cost averaging as the markets are going down they say by more by more by more is it's going down and then when it comes back you're going to be rich and while that math actually makes a whole lot of sense the problem ends up being is we don't stop buying when it's on its way up if all we did was by on its way down dollar cost averaging will be very powerful strategy but\nWhen you're averaging your price back up buying it these all time highs offsets all the money that was invested in that for a while and came back in two thousand nine and we're taking the\nAverage price up with us which which raises are risk exposure and lowers are profitability and in the end it's for one reason in my opinion my humble opinion and it's because Wall Street's businesses to sell us products and that's OK right we just have to know that\nA Wal Mart's businesses to sell us products too and that's how they make money and I don't think they're evil right into the wall Street's evil but as the customer not client noticed I use the word customer\nAs the customer we have to understand\nThat what we're what we're doing when we're when we're engaging with somebody when I go to Walmart I realize that I'm not planning on making money I'm just buying something from them and if that's the same thing that that's happening with us with Wall Street we've got to kind of take that into consideration with the\nWith the kind of analysis that we're doing on the situation are we planning on making money on this transaction if the answer is yes how do we plan on making money on this and usually the answer after that unfortunately is is I don't know but that's where getting a little bit of it\nBased on how the markets work can go a long way and I say a little bit can go a long way and it really can a little bit of education\nWill put you miles in front of the average investor one of the ways where we can help you do that as we got a few more tickets so we can do a little give away as long as there's it's OK let's do it right now I've got to have their class coming up in your area the happy classes where you can see exactly what it takes to keep that retirement grown whether the market's going up down her sideways have more income for today and more income for tomorrow\nIn just a second you're gonna have a chance to win a set of passes to one of

eight seven to three that's eight and eight nine nine one eight seven to three if you end up being colors nine or Twenty one sorry about that but his up at free O T H class dot com and see if you could scores and passes there\nYou know we've talked a lot about kind of the growing side of things with the retirement accounts really getting those retirement accounts to generate more incomes what about the protective side of things we got we have a group of people out there who have made a bunch of money as the markets have been going higher than piling money into those accounts and what can they do to protect against the downside without limiting the upside well\nMost importantly you need to understand where your risk reward rely so many people imagine if I took it back to two thousand and seven what if you learn a skill that have told you to go to cash back in December of two thousand seven and then you would have had cash in your account\nBasement bargain prices buying stock back on the way up and that's really what banks were doing they had one of the best years of their lives in two thousand eight fact I speak to our students all the time they're waiting for the next correction Wall Street has been waiting for the next correction at some point they'll be another decade long windfall coming back\nAnd it's almost like you have the opportunity here to get a nice financial do over but most people again think they know best a lot of people I talked to don't even know what happened to retirement accounts\nHow much they're paying fees I mean what if I told you\nThat about thirty percent of your saved retirement money is going to go out the door in fees to your brokerage company that would probably infuriates you\nSwitch you have to start doing right now is thinking well if I haven't been able to put aside money right now learning how to trade for income enables you to start saving money what you can put toward retirement once you understand the right

everyone\nNoticed it right away I thought he just had some sort of tropical disease pretty brazen to you know go walk around like that like showing it off I think that they last for a while even if

this outbreak is yet and it's a fully borne so this is what really is is you know because I was thinking well science isn't going to affect us right 'cause it's we're not down in the river a shooting up and withdraw homeless people but this is a fleet this is frightening\nIt's an epidemic levels according to experts so they're going to be here to talk to us about that also Dr ed crop from the Griffith Observatory is going to be here because space X ...\nAnd then landed falcon ... rocket from Vandenberg air force base the people all over Southern California what a side light up the sky did you see it I sure\nDid I saw people starting to talk about it and I was like what is this I thought here to a few months ago when we got out of the show and the sky was lit up it's really interesting and no one knew what it was and now everyone knows if he especially now it's out that it's it's face sex right oh yeah so it was really a sight to behold\nI Wonder if the people who used to stay up late to watch those time life books marshals thought that the aliens coming down to ... to ...\nThat's what I you know what I thought when I wrote Rocco is here with me that day and he said is North Korea attacking us I was like what what do you like where did you get that from his age [laughter]\nCereal that's Hawaii [laughter] do you watch the news [laughter] that's right\nAlso did you see this story involving a Banksy paint all ... self destructive moments after being sold for one point four million dollars at an auction\nYes stunning I I couldn't ... did you see happen yeah the shredder he he\nPut a shorter and then he went on his Instagram because we follow each other I don't know if you notice that cohesion with him as a whole bizarre thing because he's unknown nobody knows where he is\nAnd he very you know I Wish I did very ... he was messaging me and he said are you someone I should know and then I was like this was years ago and then I was on good deal at a question yeah and very loaded and very yes and obscure and so I was\nIn um I was younger Dalai and our he was here and he was doing a show okay he had like an ... a big ... exhibition and all these who is who we are going and he left\nA T shirt that said Banksy and spray it has on my producers car in Malibu and so she drove to work and she said something very strange for you wake up at it was for you correct open it out yeah\nAnd I said I Wonder if this is really Banksy and it was it was really ... and the reason we know is because he then asked me if I Will be covering the exhibits\nAnd I was like was that you left the T shirt and he wrote maybe dot dot dot so it was him but I'm very very elusive yeah there's so many I've read so many books on him and I've seen his movies\nWhat he did was he put a shredder inside the girl with the balloon and the girl the revolution and and and so\nBut he had to be there to activate it for someone has to be ... they said someone had a remote control device that's right\nAnd it was at ... and you know they don't take this lately it so the person so but now they're saying it's going to be worth more because it stopped halfway down so you've got the the shredded parts hanging out of the the gold frame and then the rest is still up there\nSo it's still somebody who is a collector is going to say I want that because he did that this is still his art and they're saying now it's ... it's worth more than what the end so far\nSo who do to belong to at the moment that it was destroyed did it still belongs to Banksy do belong to someone else who was selling it their own\nThing is very interesting because he doesn't like you know he doesn't like corporate greed and his whole thing is he's this renegade and he's this\nYou know out on guard artists to ambushes you with his street art and and that's all fine so I you know I don't know but his stuff does go on auction like Brad Pitt owns a six million dollar pieces stuff goes for millions all the time so does he get the money or does the people I don't know I it's so strange\nI don't know who owned that when it was put up there\nThis guy has never sat down for a new ...\nThe ads but he's

I don't know Texas yeah\nSpace acts successfully launched and then landed a falcon nine rocket from Vandenberg air force base the people from all over Southern California saw light up but\nI mean it was beautiful it's the second time I've seen space acts only this time I knew it was based on the first time everyone's like one guy that was like the Nineteen fifties wow so it's pretty uh it's a sight to see apparently\nIt wasn't just those of us in Southern California ... people as far away as Arizona oh wow captured studying videos and photos from the rocket is it a shot through the atmosphere that apparently created a bright squirrel blue and white light all across the sky is so cool\nJoining us to talk about this is the astronomer and director of the Griffith Observatory Dr ed crop Dr ... power you\nBuy 'em well and I was on the roof of my house last night watching\nThat child in your view Dr crap and are you where you want a good area to see it are you in um Pasadena area in the valley I'm In the west valley it was beautiful\nYup almost to Pasadena in eagle rock and you can't see the actual liftoff of the rocket from here you can from Griffith Observatory the shot up to ... it's pretty clear\nBut I knew was coming and so just as it reached over the tree tops of course I could still see the the red exhaust and then it started just developing into this and unimaginably crazy fireworks\n... now I Would imagine the people the Griffith Observatory had quite a show no question\nUh and it's the second time we've actually had one of these uh you you mentioned that coming in uh oh I think it was last December ... and that one was a little unannounced for people I knew it was coming and so I went out on the west terrorists and then it took off and of course everybody was convinced either aliens had invaded\nOr North Korea has launched\nOh he's actually that's what my\nSon said the eight year old mom is North Korea attacking us honestly I was walking to my car from the studios here and we all were gathered outside looking up and just in awe of what it could be because it lights up the night differently maybe you could speak to that it wasn't like seeing\nA jet or anything like that it's just it was bizarre and it was beautiful and what creates I mean is it the rocket\nAh ... what what exactly is it that creates this beautiful lights\nSeveral things are going on but of course the main thing has to do with the exhaust and the condensation at high altitude around that material or some of it in fact gets a illuminated fluorescent least some of it is picking up light from the sun that's already down below the rise and then when you don't\nRight off the four oh five Institute a Baker at at ten in the morning you're saying yeah total for ... for what we want to encourage people to come out if you're thinking of you know adding a dog to your family then this is our cat or a rabbit this is a great place to meet bring your family get the kids and the and they get to see them and meet them up close now I\nI've done a lot of pet adoptions and I always used to talk about designer dogs and\nThere was a time when people just were going crazy for them spending thousands of dollars not realizing what those dogs were going through to get to the pet store or to the breeder you've written a dog a book about that called designer dogs and it's an ass expos they talk about the criminal underworld across breeding because\nIt's huge and it's a huge money making venture but it would be a failure without people and people buying and I think sometimes people don't mean to be cruel but they're ignorant\nRight and this book you know is not a a scary book but it's meant for anyone who has any interest in getting a pet or know someone who wants to pet because it talks about two things I Wonder if that will talks about a lot of things but one of the things that talks about is how\nHow dogs are made period in the early in the old days the designer dog we're the elite pedigrees and then of course we learned about the puppy mills and how those dogs are literally manufactured um with the gold basically being spend the least amount of money to make the dog and make the most on the cell\nBut in the eighties with the advent of the lab or doodling the book talks about the story of how the elaborate doodle was how was that may well it it started\nAbout a Labrador and a poodle those are the least to that you think would be together\nWell right and that's I Will tell you the story but that started this massive epidemic of these designer dogs which are how these custom made in dogs that people just pick breeds to mix with other bring them to see how funny they are and it's become an international trafficking problem so they'll ... doodle\nUm started with a gentleman named Wally ... and he was in Australia he was a a breeder\nAnd um he was approached by a couple who needed a guide dog one needed a guide dog and one was allergic to dogs oh so he was trying to find a dog to train the dog that wouldn't hurt the other oh okay and out of the intention was good right so he said I Wonder what would happen if I mix a poodle\nKnown to be there are no such thing as hyper allergenic dogs but poodle sometimes are aggravate less yeah\nAnd a Labrador which is really well known to be a guide dog and so he put them together um he did these puppies then he sent hair and fiber you know hair samples and saliva samples to the couple\nTo see adults they all the puppies if any of them didn't aggravate the person and of course they all did now\nHow many of you who bought elaborate doodle or any dog that claims to be high bold allergenic got hair and saliva sample first I Would say nobody like nobody yeah so then he read another round a bunch more puppies did the same thing and then narrowed down you know one or two\nThat seemed to aggravate the allergy less um and at the time he claims that he couldn't get anyone to foster them because they were much and and in Australia in the eighties these people would only foster the pedigree snobs right so I mean this has everything in it", "show_name": "The Drive
