like people just stopped smoking crack because method just took over\nSo mess amphetamine it has a a unique effect when it's combined with someone dealing with schizophrenia or bipolar disorder they can't\nProcess information in the same way that a normal functioning human brain can\nAnd a lot of these individuals because of their mental incapacity whether it'd be by by itself or whether it'd be augmented by a chemical overlay they can't do what the officers telling him to do and when an officer saying something like show me your hands to them and found I Would do is what it sounds like to them and he's screaming at louder\nShow me your at that and the person who cannot comprehend it and and you can see the situation to play out and then all of a sudden it's just a hail of gunfire there have been a lot of inroads in terms of dealing with individuals and mental illnesses that have happened recently tell us a little bit about\nWhy I think you've hit the nail on the head Brian societal problems include right now in law enforcement sized dealing with emotion disabled person that is just a huge issue as we sometimes joke you can't deal with crazy well there's truth to that that\nSounds like my personal life after a while ago they're\nGoing to go there to stay on their alright um our officers\nAre getting more and more training than every before and dealing with emotion disabled it's not enough still because if I arrive on the scene of a situation and I have someone who is obviously going through a psychotic breakdown but yet they're armed with a machete or a knife or a gun\nAnd there's people in the area I have to deal with the threat they present before I can get them to medical attention that they deserve and people say we'll call this psychologists call the pet team you know\nThe sudden I got to work that's not going to work you know that's not going to come in but the officer can do certain things now again you've got to understand this if I'm telling you are okay I needed a touch that wall gene I Need you to touch it and I keep saying you're not doing it I found these are tested and it keeps screaming at me and you're not such a wall it should occur to me that you're not going to have to walk because either you're\nNot able to process what I'm saying any rational\nHuman being if an officer is yelling at him to do something or pointing a gun at them they're going to do it they're going to get on the ground they gonna do any rational for the person that doesn't do that you say they have a knife knife shootings are very common under these circumstances the officer is always going to say well we've got to take care of this and I first I take issue with that why do you have to take care of that night first if you have time\nAnd distance let's look at the circumstances if we're out in the middle of the desert and there's no one else around okay I'd buy your argument let's back off let's leave him alone if you're in it okay if you're in an urban area and you have enough people on scene and you can surround the person or a lot of these don't have to become fast moving situations I agree with you which slow it down but sometimes\nThe person that we're dealing with ... ... it up or ramp it up but there has to amp it uh it depends on where they make for an hour with a knife you're not going to do anything I'm going back I said if you're out of your mind I'm going to back up what if you get back up anymore well I'll tell you that we talked about buddy Kim's video\nIs very useful in these situations now probably the most amazing video that we get are at gas stations and like convenience stores because you can really see everything in real time it happened and what you see is you see a person who is clearly out of their mind knives are ... are very ... and they're not really doing anything but there are civilians perhaps in the area\nThere's a report of a man with a knife this is just such a typical fact unfortunately arrived good outcomes of drawn you'll have multiple officers given commands drop and drop the nicer than I thought that\nThe person driving the knife they'll get closer and closer and closer to up and I got closer and closer and closer and then when they close the distance to within fights and feed the person will do some provocative act it could be lunging it could be in the van Ives case we just got taken hostage I'm looking at this and I'm going you know this person has a knife but if you are right but at the scene and you say hey\nI'm trying to help you it looks like you're having a bad day something's going on with you\nThat's when we use or other tools taser pepper spray maybe bring in a police service Starbucks people get upset over that but that is a way in officers are trained to use these other tools you know sometimes you put in a bad spot and you have to react what about\nThe escalation as a consciousness as a mindset looking at this person truly I Know they\nBut they're still human they're dealing with a sickness now if I'm dealing with cancer that's one thing it would be able to have sympathy for me the person literally can't hear what you're saying and this is what boggles\nIt get it took me about Twenty years to really understand this concept the person looks like they are disobeying you but they really from their perspective they can't understand what you're saying and they have a sickness and that's why they can understand how long do we wait\n... hours five hours today's obviously I'm point we've got to do some I understand what you're saying but I mean these are these are concepts that are really at the cutting edge of what we're talking about and they are difficult for all of us to deal\nWith I'll give you that so folks listen I could probably talk to Jane Ramirez for several segments but the looks like you've got more important things to to do so he's going to be getting out of here jeans I Want to thank you so much

up at free O T H class dot com and see if you can scores of passes there\nNow John just just a couple of days ago I was reading a few articles and one of them that I stumbled upon was why there are no it was titled something along the lines of why there are no cell recommendations and uh the the thing that was the kind of hit me with that is we have that bullish biased and we've been talking about but it really hit me and it's one of the things I've been talking a lot about in my classes\nIs we really have to recognize that we are customers of Wall Street\nRight and their job is to sell us products they selves mutual funds ... and they sell us they sell stocks now when you go back through time that that they had a broken down in this article where they showed\nWhere they ... they showed that even in the worst financial market conditions the S. and P. five hundred stocks didn't even reach eight ten percent sell recommendation over Ninety percent of all the stocks even during the financial crisis even during the tech boom\nStill had by and or hold recommendations on it and my question to you to be how is that how is that uh uh how is that recommendation that we can trust as far as consumers as far as investors go\nWhen we know the market goes down and the only way to make money to buy low and sell high yet there's never a recommendation to sell\nWell not only just Wall Street in the business of making money when they sell you a product or service\nThey basically are also acting as the custodian of your assets and they make most of their money not off transaction fees mulatto people misunderstand how Wall Street really makes money they make money banking your assets when they are the custodian of your assets for instance let's assume you own ten thousand shares of Akron me\nThey have and you give them the right to alone though shares out to third parties are two individuals are institutions that would like to short those shares\nAnd that's where they make their money there is a banking fees that they earn so Wall Street makes most of their money not in what are called ... daily average revenue trades they make their money being the custodian of your assets\nIncluding being custodian of your cash but Wall Street always want you to be long equities they never I mean rarely I shouldn't say never but they rarely give us cell recommendation\nBecause it's bad PR and you'll notice if you watch most of the financial media out there\nThey have that same message out there that buying hold works and we have shown data has shown perpetually that buying whole does not work if we're in a bull market buying whole works pretty good until the next bear market comes along and then we're looking at a potential forty to fifty percent haircut on the price of equities\nYeah absolutely and when you look back at the financial institutions they don't own the island of Manhattan because they charge five dollars a trade\nYou know not only are they have the custodians but they also use are investing our investments in our capital as leverage for their own investments so we're like they're collateral that they use right they have a whole lot of buying power out there but it's one of the reasons why they can influence the markets so much\nI was well if we are coming up against a break here John what you say we try to squeeze in one more give away let's do it in just a second you're gonna have a chance to win a set of passes to one of these half day classes switch phones ready and if you're driving now is a great time to pull

Instagram\nSee what's hot with looking great and then they asked their friends about particular stores and branch so she joined me today to talk about the importance of social media and how it's done at Frasier communications we have Melissa Miller who is a social media strategist Frasier communications Melissa welcome to the show\nI thank you so much for having me today\nWell thanks for being here Melissa Melissa how many years is that you've been with Frazier communications\nI Believe it's my abs\nGoodness of lost track well lifted had two children wonderful little girls well she's been associated with Frazier and we're delighted and on the list has been a great contributor on the social media side prior that she really was an account person with us but we're going to focus in on the social media campaign\nThat we've done for our client Jonathan Lewis and how you were to create the content\nFor people who are looking at the website but also for people who are looking on social media or tell us first what are the social media channels you create content for and you respond to\n[laughter] so we're really on on the major channels right now we're on Instagram Facebook and can trust and it really honed in on Instagram as our sweet spot for this client mainly because a great deal of the interior design community and influence or they're on Instagram so we've really found that to be a sweet spot\nThat makes a lot of ... usually grown in popularity and you know we are we just cut up a Facebook out of our buy for\nThe campaign to reach teenagers to alert to the facts about weed and I got a brand is clearly the preferred location for people to be we hear that also in our focus group she with ah with older folks as well [noise]\nWell let's talk about it then Jonathan Lewis in their use of social media\nJonathan Lewis is a brand that came to last about seven years ago\nAs they were ... themselves as a a real brand they want her to have a brand new presidents be positioned properly with the website and cetera\nAnd recently Frazier developed a new brand look and feel a new logo as well as a new website for them but it's part of that exercise we our position them as a brand that helps women and men but particularly women because women are very into designed to express their personal style sure the issues and their homes\nAnd that's right All right how would you describe the persona of a typical customers 'cause you relate to them on social media what are they like\n[noise] Oh absolutely well I can tell you that about Ninety percent of them are females so you're absolutely right there\nYou know as far as the the demographic it is twenty five\nTo thirty four majority I'm and these are mostly customers who are really seeking to be able to make a statement in their home without having that cookie cutter furniture that you see everywhere you know they're looking for a way to express themselves through color through configuration really having their their personal style comes through\nRight they want to if they wanted to look like them and ... who they are as opposed to something you might see on the floor necessarily at West elm although those are beautiful when you go into a store you see a great but you wanted to reflect you your lifestyle\nNow know exactly night we know that I'm most of the shoppers who by the store do online research before they buy it of course photos influenced them\nHow do you choose the content for Johnson Lewis what types of images tell tell us about your process\nOh absolutely so really what we have found over the years is that user generated content attempt to perform the strongest so these are actual customers and sometimes influence or two that share their content online so real living spaces not those stock\nReally staged a showroom photos but rather Perfectly Imperfect homes you know where you can really see yourself\nIn that they let me say that you sent Perfectly Imperfect her right [laughter] yeah they're they're natural\nThey look real they lived in but also very pretty\nExactly so it really makes it feel like something attainable uh but ... but also still very inspirational because most of the content on on Instagram tends to be very visually stunning beautiful inspiring and so it's really you know trying to\nFind a balance between the two and I think the user generated content which we curate very carefully we don't just post anything you know we we go through and find the ones that\nStrike that that right balance\nThose tend to perform the strongest we\nAnd and you know how do we judge that well we see a lot of comments a lot of inquiries a lot of questions whether they come through as post comments or as direct messages on Instagram sometimes they'll even you know contact us through the website directly you know based on an image that they saw on social media\nShow when we talk about a user generated we know that term in our business right it means ... in the real world took a picture of their home in Santa and and how do you get it how do you decide to utilize him\nYes so a lot of times we do you know search it via hash tag a lot of you know customers out there actually had us in their photos or they'll use the hash tag\nWould your capital you choose to come to the market and\nProvide for your family this is a skill and boy you hit it right on the head when you talked about skilled development earlier\nThis is not about knowing what to do it's about knowing what to do and then executing your strategy in a sustainable way but trading is part and parcel to development of civilization or wouldn't we be Ryan and we had all had to go back to barter what do you think your life would be like\nYou know it's an interesting point you bring up and I love how you take that back through work you know because we do we trade we're constantly trading we trade time for money and then we trade money for those goods and services right with trade money for that loaf of bread\nBut initially it all starts with us going out and doing something to generate that capital trading time trading now trading skills\nSo that we can generate the money just to go train it to somebody else now one of the things that one of my mentors told me a long time ago as he always said I always want you to use this phrase and I've used that thousands and thousands maybe millions of times hard earned investments dollar and that was afraid he told me to use every time I'm Talking about my money and Everytime I'm pondering\nShould I make this decision should I make this investment\nAnd he said at the end of your analysis you should always you should always end with\nThis trade is or is not worthy of my hard earned investments dollar and he would always take me back and and have any kind of paint a picture of the hardest day I had at work\nAnd he said that dollar are you willing to put that dollar into that trade and it just goes back to that trading time for money now trading money for those goods and services or those or those investment opportunities and how do we know\nIs this investment worthy of our harder and investment dollars as a you know we go back in time we go or we go back across the nation we go back across the globe and we ask you know I've asked thousands of people this millions of people really when we started when we do all of our online workshops and say how much time has the average person put in\nTo being educated how much time we invested into ourselves so that we can have the confidence to say yes\nThis is worthy of my heart or an investment dollar and unfortunately the answer that echoes across ... echoes across workshops\nIs near zero which is one of the reasons why we don't have the confidence of what we're doing it's one of the reasons why we don't generally have the returns that we want as well but I Would love to tilt the scale right now I'd love to tilt the scale and get that zero number climbing as high as we possibly can\nBy getting as many people educated so at the end of the day they can look at their investments and say yes or no this is or is not worthy of my heart or an investment die but one of the things we have to do to get that process started John we got to give away these tickets let's do it\nRight now we've got half day class coming up in your area\nThat have

the bag\nBut my parents can loaned me the money can they do that we want to hear from you eight hundred to two to five to two to\nLet's talk about some of these loan programs that we're talking about it at the beginning here okay there's something called a debt service program which one of you wants to take this on Steve why don't you go ahead\nWell I I think to process the debt service program or I Believe uh what you're talking about is\nPurchasing a investment property that basically that services exactly what we're talking about it is it is exactly what the states it's a debt service so to clarify that it moved means if you were buying an investment property\nThe rent that you got for them investment property would have to cover the debt which would be the mortgage payment that which would be PI GI principal interest tax and insurance so that payment we'd have to cover one hundred ten percent of\nThe mortgage ma'am okay meaning has to be a little bit more than you pay for your mortgage property taxes and home insurance correct correct just a sad but more so folks it if you're listening to this\nWhen you collect your rents as long as it covers your principal and interest payment your insurance and your property taxes you\nCan get approved does the individual to have to do a qualifying or is this just on the property itself well\nOn this type of loan the individual has to qualify because they have to guaranteed along okay uh so there is an interest or there is a credit check\n'em that that goes along with this and also when we checked to make sure that to have the proper assets to be able to purchase the property we also check to make sure that the have reserves\nSo that God Forbid something happens or and they can't rent the property or if they lose or rent or something like that or will be able to rely on their reserves to make the mortgage payments so that they don't go behind and and ruin their credit\nBut they also get to use the income from the building so you know if it's just a little short of covering everything then that individual uses their own income to help cover those types of ah that's no\nSo in the debt service a type of product\nWe sold e qualify them based on the income from the property itself okay hands uh when we say stated it would be you know that that's what that would fall into now it's also important to note\nThat the debt service program and then no racial program and the fix and flip program that you're going to be covering today falls on the business purpose loans and I think that we're we're going to have to take a a a a little break and we'll talk about that when we return\nYes we have to use the little boy's room not just getting folks were going to the right here on the house calls

on his answers give you the options that you need when it comes to buying selling and investing in real estate Lisa\nTexture questions in my home ... now face kill forty seven four seven five sat and one more time my ... all one ... for seven forty seven so I sat and\nNow to Tony we had a tax that came in during the first half of the show why don't you read the text and let's see if we can formulate an answer here\nYeah the question was what's the minimum down payment on the no ratio program\nUm well let's just clarify some stuff about the type of ... programs that we have okay I'm opposed\nTo as opposed to the debt service product\nWhere we the home has to be rented and the rent have to cover what we discussed the pity right the principal interest tax insurance right the no ratio program is no dock the only thing that we request\nIs that uh we check to make sure that the bar or has the requisite assets a prior to purchase and they obviously they have to have to credit to 'em but to the no ratio or we don't even have to look to make sure that the rents cover okay\nSo if I were short on my rent I can still get alone correct\nOoh I like this tell me more but that's basically what it is I'll tell you more is that like fixing not spread it and I said well you know I'd like to apologize to everybody we don't have a fiction fetch that's a real perpetual fixing products it's a fix and flip a I just made up of us are I have to\nThe giants were buried he was at the eagles concert last night and who knows what was in the air\nSo have you with a great concert though the problem is I mean what was in the air as effectively and that's that's where the fiction fish came in um ... that's just ... [laughter] I did not brief um\nJust to reiterate so we'd have to products a debt service\nWhich again uh the rent to cover writers payment no ratio where the rent do not have to cover\nThe mortgage payment now or to answer the tax question uh on the no ratio product\nYou would have to put down twenty five percent on the debt service product or you have to put twenty percent now Barry I I'd like to get into something um\nThese loans the debt service to know ratio and fix and flip that we'll be talking about shortly not to fix the official fed okay I'm not too perpetual always fixing the product um\nThese loans a fall out of uh the uh Dodd Frank act that was enacted and we're going to get into that in two thousand eight when there was the mortgage meltdown\nThese uh or fall under what are called business purpose loans okay on now the business purpose loans and if you remember we had a conversation\nWith 'em or I Believe was Christine that was on the phone or and when we specified that we don't do commercial loans I'd like to clarify business purpose loans\nFall under commercial transactions\nWhen they fall in the commercial transactions they do not fall under the qualifying mortgage purposes that were put into place on the Dodd Frank okay um when you could say what does that mean on his enemy well\nWhen we had the mortgage meltdown a dot Frank uh enacted some laws or to put some safeguards against um unsavory lending practices right let's just put it that way um however\nPutting that fence the large fence around lending also prohibited some very good candidates are that deserve loans right All right uh necessarily doesn't have to do with\nPoor lending practices um and I believe some of my colleagues have talked about that with the knock you I'm not qualified mortgage loans so that we do\nUm and we're in the forefront of not qualified mortgages\nJust because something is not in non non qualifying mortgage\nA doesn't make him more risky be does it make you a ... non proven lending right and I believe that some of the ah ah listeners might be ... you know listening to this and saying oh you know what where it's a repeat of of of poor lending practices I'd like to say it's not\nA you know when the passed in the past ten years when we had borrowers though we're self employed part to in particular um these these people had the requisite down payments whether it was Fifteen twenty twenty five thirty forty percent\nHad the requisite\nCredit six eighty seven hundred seven twenty right right of the like a and but uh fortunately they weren't a able to participate in real estate transactions because of the whole\nMortgage purpose ... uh uh uh you know a terminology so for the ... like what their tax returns that most\nEntrepreneurs here and self employed individual if they get to write off a lot of their businesses actions and other expenses depreciation and such so when it comes to tax time even though they may show great money when it comes right down to it because of their deductions that are allowed by the government they don't have the actual income to qualify\nRight well it's not listen again a lot of small business owners rely on every ... every dollar that to have bright for business going right\nSo instead of giving it to the government and God Knows what the government does with their money they're able to\nPick the talk shows that there are a lot by law and put it back into their practice or whatever business that they have right so when it comes time for the local business owner to go down to the tax accountant and sit down and filed taxes and\nWhen they sit there to have all the best intentions to file\nWhat you know a ... in enough to qualify for mortgage right but unfortunately when they're faced with with how much they have to come up with and and take away from putting that money back into the business they opt not to read but that keeps them out of the market\nAnd and and these types of loans\nWere created for those people were ... and it's important to note however with that said\nThe business purpose loans for investor properties that's not just for the self employed bar or any bar or whether they're W. twos or self employed\nOr on a fixed income can qualify for these loans and it's important to note that\nUnfortunately right now because of the lending practices that were practiced for the past ten years a lot of people don't know that they could qualify for these more you just today and that's why I'm here to explain to them hey if you guys have the requisite income\nYou have the requisite assets and the requisite credits for comeback into the market we can help you out and and get you when you know into a house or permanent residents we could refinance your permanent residence or we can help you buy\nA non owner occupied investment property\nNow that's one of the things I Love about him beg folks as they are a national lender\nWho uses their own capabilities when it comes to approving a file they have their own underwriting guidelines they're not like the big banks where if you don't fit in this little teeny box you can't get it done their boxes you just not a square boxes that a triangle box it's a circle which means\nThey're going to help you every step of the way it's a circle we keep going round and round had died and but you get it done I mean\nI was really close loans just for that's about right and ... it's about closing loans I you know where he could sit there and talk and talk about it but the difference between us and the other non Q. one lender especially in the market today\nOr pretend there's I think and and you know they're in they're trying to do to you know trying to get these loans but not knowing what to do with them\nThey're going to take as much time as necessary to help you understand what your options are what the capabilities are whether it's you and your mom whether it's your mom or you yourself\nThey're going to explain exactly what your options are so you can make in the TV decision what's best for you and your family and your mom how's that\nSound like a plan thank you so much for your time I appreciate it\nThank you that's eight hundred nine eight zero one two to three eight hundred nine eight zero one two to three they're going to sit there they're going to educate you and give you as much time as necessary so you can understand that that's an immediately go to the fix and flip program so\nThe fiction flip program is exactly what his stated a him again like we discussed before it falls on there are non ... business purpose loan products\nUm with that said again you don't need to be self employed to qualify for this or do you get to higher financing however\nYou do need to have experience\nWith that said you can still qualify if you don't have any experience but it will require you to put more down payment down um bucked secure that problem or we have a mentoring program right now going on where uh once you\nFinish and fix and sell three properties with our mentors um then we'll be able to give you credit line of your own uh and you'll be able to qualify for eighty five percent loan to cost\nUm meaning if it was a hundred thousand dollars to purchase the property a hundred thousand to 'em fixed the property with finance a hundred and eighty thousand right so it would be um [noise]\nWell I have a question what what you're doing that I'm Sorry so you have a program if someone hasn't done to fix and flip because there's all these newspaper articles east television shows these other radio shows that are dedicated to fix and flip you actually have a program\nThat people can call you and joined with you and you will actually teach them and then teach them how to finance their own opportunities\nCorrect where what we do is we meant for them for three properties or and then we'd give them once they fully have gone through the mentorship we offer him a credit line of their own where they can go out on their own and purchase and solve this problem\nNow you also have a couple of other programs that I'm aware of four experienced individuals that learn how to flip program ...\nSo could you give us some I mean there's all these companies and say I'll finance eighty percent of the value to purchase it I'd give you a Ninety percent to fix it up and then you could you explain a little bit more about that\nWell uh yes so again based on your experience level we could finance up to Ninety and sometimes Ninety five percent of arches price of the costs of acquisition of chaos\nThe cost to fix wow that's tremendous nobody's offering that well you know nobody's offering correct\nUh buffalo ... vantage of this folks call eight hundred nine eight zero in two to three why because no one's offering this program there the only ones take advantage of it right now\nEight hundred nine eight zero one two to three eight hundred nine eight zero one to two ... I'm Sorry to cut you off but that's such great information they need to react right now but by the other thing a lot of fixing flippers\nThe ad but for some flippers professional for some clippers the biggest issue assurance that issue the biggest hurdle that to have is\nThe down payment portion of it they always\nRun out of the money right not that they don't have money it's a it's very costs intensive to run a fix up a business for those people will suffer preferred equity um a option that they take the best show that's like a joint venture with around or something and it was later correct see once you go over\nThe specifics are the specific details and features of the of the fix and flip because it has some unique pitchers itself along with the ability to to help in and have the mentoring\nProgram yes so just like our regular financing options you specifically in the physics of flip\nThere is no have you been uh besides the you know people are out of the box and and buried rich as we said we do it in a circle I mean this has had stuck on a circle octagon it's everything right um so some of the officers that we have we should finance their payments into alone\nWe can finance um they're closing costs again we go up to Ninety loan to cause we go up to Ninety five months of cost um those are the different options that we were very aggressive in the market we have the mentoring\nA options available we have the preferred equity partnership to be available for people or give us a call and ask one of our professionals ... uh I qualified\nYou know folks since they create their own guidelines which means they know how to approve you are not approve us more times than not they approve you 'cause they're in business to make loans\nSo they create their own guidelines they lend their own money at great interest rates and they help you accomplished a deal I mean where can you go to a one stop shop that if you don't know what you're doing\nThey're going to teach you all the steps necessary then they're going to help you understand what your financing is yeah Steve\nOr just to jump in um\nIf you're an avid fix him flipper the other thing is a lot of friction flippers don't understand that they can hold onto these products right right it's very important for them to know that with the financing options that are available today don't necessarily need to fix and flip that could fix and hold\nWhile you know folks over the next several weeks we're gonna be talking about these programs we're going to have Steve back I 'cause he's an expert we're going to have ... will have Tony we're going to have the least so we'll have ... there are so many people that are experts at eBay give them a call right now to find out what your options are\nEight hundred nine eight zero one two to three eight hundred nine eight zero one two to three eight hundred nine eight zero one two to three this is Barry to coat and you've been listening to the house calls radio show will be back next week thank you so much for listening have a great weekend thank you [noise]\nThe loan experts at N. bank will continue to take your calls after the program call now to find out about these new loan programs you can start your home loan process at eight hundred Ninety zero one two to three [noise]\nThis show furnished by any chance a mortgage bank of California and unless I eat three to three to this show furnished by any chance that mortgage bank of California and I'm a less id three two three two\nMy name is Dale ...

greedy I'm giving [laughter]\nWashed and very deserving spouse okay and that's called a Q tip trust it's a special kind of trust designed to protect your spouse so we'll talk about that at about ten to ... to dive end up before we do I just got to have a quick update you know it's interesting Jack Jack is my producer extraordinary [noise] um\nYou know I I'm I've kind of talked about we have this uh now seven month old puppy and just puppy now ways fifty pounds I mean this this is when you look at her she's like a big dog and you forget that she's just a baby um and so you know but uh her name is noodle and she's a noodle such noodle dishes noodle\nAnd uh so the the update because people apparently are interested in this I don't know why or is that a noodles house training has progressed okay we had a moment there where it wasn't going well so now she she doesn't ever poop in the house anymore okay so that's a big plus I Would say right\nHowever and she doesn't pee however what she does do is this the mission P. thing it's awful it's like the first time she sees me she squats and ... a gallon of pee on the floor and I'm like what the heck you know\nAnd I can't stop it it's like I've tried like being outside\nAnd opening the door so she comes out to me but then she pays right on the patio and colleague I don't know how to stop this people tell me they they outgrow it eventually but\nI Hope so [laughter] anyway so let's talk about interest rates the economy or the jobs numbers that we saw this week uh looked pretty strong now the strongest some forecasts were expecting but still two hundred thousand jobs you know a month is what the economy is producing right now there's some talk\nThat the unemployment rate has rates so low that it can go lower than\nYou know the problem with that is that we always look at what we called the ... what's called the participants labor participation rate which is the number of people of working age that are actually working\nAnd that number is still very very low relative to history so therefore there are a lot of people that are now coming into the workforce that weren't in it and if you're not in the workforce you're not counted in the unemployment numbers\nSo that the unemployment rate number the headline number is actually one that we don't really look at we look at the labor participation rate and it's still low so there's a lot of room for people to come in and start working still so the economy strong\nAnd so the fed most likely is going to continue to raise interest rates and we've seen interest rates spike here in the last few days would that realization now we've been telling you that this is something you should be thinking about for several months now\nNow that the question I Would ask you is have you reviewed your bond portfolio if you have bonds and your portfolio and and we do we believe that bonds are part of a diversified portfolio\nUm you need to look at what's called the duration of your bond portfolio because longer term bonds bonds that are ten years Fifteen twenty thirty or bonds you no longer term bond even longer than five years\nAs a Federal Reserve raises interest rates the value of those bonds historically has gone down now that doesn't mean it will in the future but the likelihood is very very great that as the fed raises interest rates those kind of bonds are going to lose value\nSo you need to look at your portfolio and ask yourself what do you think rates are going to do over the next year or two and a so we believe that we are actually in a bond bear market\nThe difference though is that bond markets are the death of a thousand cuts you know it's not like the stock market where it falls and crashes it's like this this general decline that last for several years and that's what we're seeing\nSo as you know a a a couple of months ago we\nThe direction of our bond portfolio we actually are put half of our bond portfolio into government a cash equivalence because what happens with those is that as the fed raises interest rates the interest rate that you get in those kinds of ah accounts goes up\nAnd ... because it's directly correlated and your principal is very very safe so we wanna we wanna make sure that we can\nMake money when you know as to the extent that we can make sure that we make money when the fed raises interest rates in our bonds and not lose money okay so one thing that you may want to do if you have not reviewed your bond portfolios talk to your advisor or better yet go on our website money

thankful we not work with over a thousand four hundred families in forty three states and\nWe are a retirement planning specialist so we work primarily with people who are over the age of fifty who are retired are retiring soon and so that's you we would love to meet you and become your friend have you become a member of our family\nAnd help you to get through your retirement we call your retirement your second childhood without parental supervision so we want you to go play going to have fun and not worry about all of this boring financial stopped now\nFinancial Times named our financial advisory for money matters one of the top three hundred registered investment advisors for the second time this year so we're very proud of that\nBut again without our clients we would be nowhere so thank you thank you thank you so we're going to talk now about a topic that comes up I Would say just about in every conversation we have with our clients\nAnd even with people who are in our clients who are considering it and that is Social Security okay and so one of the big questions that if you haven't started collecting Social Security that you probably have is when should I start\nAnd then there's another which is how should I collect it\nAnd it's very interesting but if you look at all of the different permutations of that decision whether you're widowed\nWhether you're married difference in ages difference in income different in health all those kinds of things there actually eight thousand combinations of that the answer to that question\nHow how and when I take my Social Security\nAnd what's crazy is that one of those is yours [laughter]\nSo how do you figure that at all well I mean I'm thinking right it could be just one maybe there's more than one but it seems to me there's only one that's right for you so you got to figure that one out and it's not easy and I mean it's complicated\nYou know our advisors in our farm we put a we we have in fact a starting next week we're putting them through intensive training I mean it's it's someone who spend their time learning about Social Security still has to stay up on it the laws change I mean it's it's it's complicated\nAnd so for you and I'm Talking about you ladies and gentlemen listening to the show as a lay person that doesn't do this for a living you know I Would say that the odds are stacked against you that you're going to make the right\nDecision so be that as it may I Want to help you to have some of the criteria you should be thinking about so one of the questions would be you know should I wait until I'm Seventy\nAnd start claim Social Security then now just to set the stage Social Security you can actually start when you're sixty two assuming you qualify so you could take six to start taking Social Security at age sixty two but if you wait\nFor every year that you wait the benefit that you're going to receive increases and from sixty six through Seventy eight increases by eight percent per year\nThe benefit that you received us okay so it there's an incentive\nTo wake because the benefit is larger however you're giving up the money while you're waiting so there's a disincentive to so there's some math involved in that\nBut let me give you generally what we believe to be the reasons why you may want to wait to your Seventy okay one big reason is that when you die your spouse has a choice of getting your Social Security or there's whichever is the higher okay\nSo if you are in bad health or or something where you have a low life expectancy\nThan it may make sense for you to wait till you're Seventy because then the benefit that you'll receive will be the highest and then upon your debt your spouse will take over that benefit and get that highest amount and so that's one big reason why you may want to another reason that you may want to is that you know you don't need the money\nBut as I always tell clients when they say that as well if you don't need the money then started taking it a sixty six and just give it to me [laughter]\nIf you don't want and I'll take it [laughter] but uh anyway yeah so if if you feel that uh you know you don't need the money you may want to wait because also one of the things that can happen is that your spouse can collect half of yours and if you both weight than the benefit that you get at Seventy could be a lot higher as well\nSo there are some reasons to wait until you're Seventy generally speaking though they are few there there's very few reasons why sixty six is normally the best time to take\nBut ah there are reasons to take it at Seventy now if you are over fifty if you are retired or retiring soon\nIf you are within five years of retirement or five years after retirement that ten year period
