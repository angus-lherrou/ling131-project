Ninety five eight one\nOne thousand dollars\nWell just just didn't want to know what to do more\n... said if it's a very short report that Democrats are not going to be happy with it and they'll try to do something with it\nAnd I'm ... I'm ... because I expect the Democrats will be happy\nUnhappy no matter what yeah probably it on a lot of ways\nNo matter what at this particular moment that's what the Republicans of course are accusing them of love just not being satisfied with anything that happens the reason we got this delay though was actually because of Republican\nSenator Jeff flake in particular who decided that he would vote to send\nKavanaugh out of the uh the Senate Judiciary committee Jeff Flake says that was okay with him that with a favorable recommendation to the Senate floor\nBut he wouldn't vote for Kavanaugh on the Senate floor until there was an FBI investigation into this pristine block it poured accusation at least and ever since then of course we heard a lot more and more are a couple of other accusers have come forward\nWe're hearing more and more about Brett Kavanaugh's behavior\nIn high school and in college and uh uh some serious drinking that apparently one on there but is that something that would disqualify him for the Supreme Court\nClarification though the FBI did not talk to the two major of people here now\nThat we know they talk to ten squeaky and they talk to my job\n[laughter] yes [laughter] I Can't believe we're calling inherently about whatever\nAs last night to thirty and save the FBI had not spoken a with the Ford at least we hadn't heard from Brett Kavanaugh's camp\nNecessarily but many of the senators so at least ... senators seemed to be striking that off and saying well the Christine Ford has a lot of time in front of\nA the microphones last Thursday as the judge Kavanaugh up they are the FBI at least as perhaps looking for any kind of cooperating information either for or against a Kavanaugh\nAnd uh that's probably why they may not FBI agents may not have interviewed\nBother to Laurie principle lob and this guy Bob do we know how many people were interviewed\n[noise] we don't know ... I don't know truthfully I'm been coming out in dribs and drabs of this person has been interviewed and that person who's been interviewed um\nBut the FBI does have the ability to I mean they have offices all over the country or to or send an agent to go interview someone with a set of questions [noise]\nUm you know if if that person is involved in this so I don't I don't see that as being a major issue for the FBI would I suspect or go wherever\nThe information Mike Lee and try to find people at least who may have some who may have been a witness in one way or another\nAh for this alleged incident to that of course so we have to say may or may not have really occurred but the uh the FBI does have that ability and that's why uh uh the uh the the FBI certainly didn't fall that\nThe notion that they could do this not second dairy kind of background check on Kavanaugh within weeks time\nOr you know we're we're all talking about the drinking now and it doesn't seem like the FBI is looking at past behavior that involved alcohol\n[noise] well you know that's up to the listener the senator the American people whatever you want to say\nTo a you know take the leap and then figure well if you were in heavily into drinking or were you also into other things obviously the Democrats with like\nThe the senators and the American public in particular to say well if you were drunk a lot\nAnd and then to do a good day to that kind of behavior than it might be a logical progression to the idea that you would misbehave in some way\nWhen you were under the influence of alcohol to the point of stop or what she has alleged Christie for his alleged is a sexual assault a that's a that's something I think the average listener is going to have to try to\nTo figure out whether they can make that leap or not we all remember how we were in high school I'm a you know ah drinking beer with not out of the question for most of us are at\nThat stage in our lives\nI think you're getting a phone or Bob Steele thank you so much of a winner waiting to see what we're going to hear a leak who does the leak Bob thanks a lot and Dorothy thanks you from the bottom of her heart\nThing when you are now ... you can get that phone calls and coast importance breaking the bottom line is\nBreaking news we are now hearing that Kavanaugh's college roommate is saying that Kavanaugh lied roommate assignments about drinking right in the room and and the yearbook admitted he lied about an\nHour now he's going public with the news going on on the media needs to be kept on line we're we're going to go to these calls right now the question we're asking you if the election were held tomorrow would you be voting for Trump or somebody else or numbers one eight hundred to two two KBC or one eight hundred to two to\nFive to to to tell us\nWhat you think one other thought before we go to the first call\nThe Supreme Court's started meeting the session mhm and it's for to for it's for the for\nA it was four and a four for a long time\nBut it's a different for the for the Ford for before involved Anthony Kennedy who the who warning for before who could go either way writing about it now if there is no swing vote it's four to four is deadlocked so pretty much everything that comes before the Supreme Court will revert back to the lower court decision\nSo in other words ... nothing's going to be going on there were no big cases coming up right now by the way abortion and gay marriage and all that will not be before the court right now\nWhere did you ... yeah\nI uh would you vote for Trump or somebody else if the election were held tomorrow we go to Los Angeles we'd go to Phil Phil welcome to KBC\nSteve yeah you can\nYes uh I Would not vote for Trump

it to say what they expect to the taxpayer to take care of with costs\nAh Iraq deal that was going to guarantee that they had a nuclear weapon in ten years and now there's enough pressure on Iran that their economy's falling apart there's real hope that that's not going to happen um we got it took the the really\nDifficult situation with a with Korea and it made it hopeful said it yet but it's

F. fifteens the senior executive service bureaucrats and for two hours on an important issue whether it's\nDefeating ISIS the threat of China\nCrisis in ... whatever it is ... bureaucrats ...\nMentions the president's name or what he said yesterday in front of Congress about ISIS will walk his objective is all with regard to the issue it disgusting and it's me it's the guy was a funny accent at the end of the meeting or have to say\nExcuse me ... and ... are you to know what the president said yesterday about X Y and Z [laughter] that\nThat the state these people to think hey I've written I've written government for is I don't care who's elected president I'll be here all the all Trump is long gone bats that the state and if you don't like the phrase call it the permanent stay but it is real and it has been around for at least Seventy years\nNow and I think people also have a misconception about this and the fact that you worked in the White House you would tend to these meetings you can give us a firsthand look at this is after Sebastian Gorka\nDid we do we believe it was like this under Obama do do we think it was the St Louis and we had this permanent government and our share of the Obama wants to lead us in this direction but you know we were all working for eight years under George W Bush and we had a different tack or or was there something different about Obama\n[laughter] so you're so sneaky\n[laughter] you know didn't know it didn't happen under Obama his his his his his\nFormer student of mine super smart guy Hispanic kid\nHe started a new post graduate studies with me and\nHe got a posted to the state department in a very ... in a very important losses let's say I was getting any more than that and uh he managed to smuggle man for the state department ... elections to get a a lecture and this kid is telling me\nThat the day off to the election he went to work for you bought in the state department and his colleagues\nWere openly solving out that that is not unique to internalize it I I I don't think any conservative votes or how's that the\nCried at that desk [laughter] when Bill Clinton was elected this is a cultural issue yeah they've taken over institutions\nAnd they believe that they are so powerful that they can't openly cry when quote unquote the wrong candidate wins so no unfortunately the deep state has a political identity and it is very left wing\nOur guest is Fox News contributors Sebastian Gorka either brand new book coming out by the way why we fight defeating America's enemies with no apologies and you are in national security guy when you say defeating Americans enemies are you focusing mostly in your book\nOn our enemies abroad on on radical jihadists on on the red China and North Korea those kind of enemies\nGood good question or my last book was a defeating jihad that was about ISIS or al ...\nThis is the whole enchilada it's everything it's global jihad it's China it's Russia it's a direct or fat political warfare but perhaps what will be of great interest to those at all you know ... ... all the ... like your eye is in between the strategic stuff I've into ... stories\nGreat American heroes going back to the ... where he was two hundred years ago captain Stephen Decatur youngest captain them in in the U.S navy led a\nBrave group of Marines against the Barbary pirates of the coast Tripoli through Korea with chest you pull up Marine Corps ledge and captain\nEugene O'Neill spent six and a half years the Hanoi Hilton during Vietnam and the last I have a chapter ... would occur chambers so the book isn't just about Florida enemies it's about our internal am an enemy meaning do we have\nThe will to win because as the president said in Warsaw an incredible speech I really cards to listen to check out his also\nWarsaw screech because the speech with a very simple question and it's a chilling on he said the question about time\nIs um does the west how what it takes to protect the values of Judeo Christian civilization that's what I call the will to win the will to fight and that's what my books about\nWell in coming on the heels of the president's week in New York where he addressed the U.N General assembly he shared a meeting with the Security Council a ... and of course China\nOr North Korea and Iran were really a topics are one two and three not necessarily in that order uh what do you make of how the international community is a embracing or rejecting\nHow Trump is leading the free world right now is it is it a as dire as we were told it was going to be the day after the election\n[laughter]\nIt it depends on who you're talking about you can divide the world into two different types of country all I Know\nWe're not generalizing about seven billion people but we're talking about the dominance of specific countries unless to boss gets number one those governments those nations that live in reality and those that believe in some kind of utopian garbage of post modern multiculturalism\nIf if you're in the last uh you'll horrified adult properties think heat babies are and and you'll never understand why why America is a good thing that saved western civilization it's three times\nIn the last hundred is if\nYou live in the real world if you'll you know a country upon during South Asia that that intimidated by China is you'll polled in that scene Russia gobble up Crimea if your the people in the u._k. that voted for independence from Brussels and Brecht said that you love\nDonald Trump and you understand that a world without America leadership\nIs a dangerous world that's the last eight years of Obama's so ... it's a very simple metric you live in the real world if you do you get the Donald and you like to talk\nAbout the you know we did see listen by I don't think there's any suggestion that prime minister Trudeau and Canada are the things that Donald Trump probably eat babies however they still got to deal with this guy
