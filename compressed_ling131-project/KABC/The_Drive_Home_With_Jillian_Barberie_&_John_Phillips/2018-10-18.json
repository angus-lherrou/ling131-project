traders\nBecause Roseanne created that show and they wouldn't be there they wouldn't have the success that they have they wouldn't have made enough money that they made a number of years that they have if it weren't for Roseanne and now the network turned on her and instead of ...\nIt is Roseanne they're going back to work to collect that paycheck\nAnd interestingly enough recently a a a network executive came out and said that they had acted a little quick and ... and ... and the firing of Roseanne and\nAnd I'm sure that a lot of them think that I Do not believe that the ... are going to last you can't have Roseanne without Roseanne none of care how you name it and how many titles you come up with the change at the ... it's not the same and it's not going to work\nUm and I believe that last night was a novelty was just people curious I agree and that's the end of that\nAnd she has a fan base by the way it makes either way the big time is understands you see\nHer Twitter if you go on and read the comments underneath her tweet uh-huh\nNinety five percent we're all in favor saying don't worry about it this isn't gonna last and and I think that right\nWell I was a big fan of Roseanne in the eighties and nineties when you can say that she was on the the liberal side of the political spectrum uh-huh she now has changed your politics she's more conservative mhm and I like her I mean now her politics my politics are fairly similar but it's beyond that when you're talking about a sitcom\nThe question is can they make you laugh\nAnd Roseanne has been making audiences laugh for decades and they liked the raw honesty that that show puts out there because it's not one of these canned sitcoms right where everything is resolved in thirty minutes it's one of these shows where\nYou combine that and then it's like well that was a scare do on Roseanne the person's actually pregnant right away it ... life respond to that people love that\nIt's interesting because the show became really diverse in the sense that you know it had different ethnicities and and you know get gay characters a and so you know look if she were to think about this and go back and we have so many people tweeting idiotic things um\nYou know I see somebody videos of her screaming about it now like just like\nSaid I'm but it was stupid yeah it was in ... but to lose a whole career over it I don't know catchy and now I guess it would be hard for her to go to a network and say look I'm going to start something else because they're not\nShe had her own she could go to maybe she could talk show Dr yes you could go to Netflix Netflix lot of people go to Netflix to do I mean they knew what I mean there are a lot of different options for her yeah and her audience is going to go with her because her audience is Matt I'll tell you the other thing is a fan of the show that really pissed me off\nThey killed her character off with a drug overdose that it out get insulting\nOkay so I saw yesterday that she wrote I ain't dead bitches and then at some other people were like I Can't believe they killed you that way and I thought how do they do it so they did it with\nLike they they ... drug overdose they turned her into a frequent junkie really kind of a drug\nPrescription drugs oh that that that ouch\nOuch and and and so you got I guess there are Gilbert and John Goodman are they have to go along with it because they are now back employed with the networks that are like okay well like I guess at the beginning I I thought John Goodman was really support of her I don't know what\nHow she was put the pressure of the world was put on them because look at your job to be walked\nOut together they the in the network really wanted this they would have made it work with her essay students solidarity like friends did but they are out on her while they just started to think of their own skins I guess\nAnd that was a huge mistake because guess what Rosanne skin to always work you think what a lot of those supporting players they're supporting players have a joint government\nDoes a ton of movies every he he does movies he's a movie guy\nI look at them as we know Sarah Gilbert Scott the talks are going to be fine all those writers from Whitney Cummings to uh you know uh what's her name is Wanda Sykes they're all still employed\nBut they were on the number one show on TV and they'll be able to work but replicating that is very difficult to do especially with a big void\nLike not having gross [laughter] so look I'm not a fan of of what she said or a ... a lot of her politics but she has she's brilliant she created that show and she's she's the reason that it's on air it's got to be very frustrating to get kicked out of the party that you created\nWhat do you

that you just get paid a settlement to be quiet and not only did especially to keep their job but that they used our tax money to do it and we have no idea I mean it's just right here yeah\nSo what I think about you know ... yesterday I was reading on the idea that there are people some of them elected some of them on in other organizations that are mandating and making decisions that are affecting the safety wellbeing save homeless people that are affecting the safety and well being of\nHumans throughout the greater uh San Francisco Los Angeles area\nI Want them held accountable for that those individuals I don't want to do with the tax payers held accountable for that I went the if I as a physician\nMakeup bad judgment or immigrant engage in reckless negligence somebody tells me

prevented from getting the help they need by people who won't allow the caretakers to go in and get the care what does this have to do with sexual harassment again what I'm saying is all the different things where we should be holding people accountable\nOh but I don't what politician is going to say no this is the play we need to you know we need to provide that the defense for ah these workers who are no\nNo no no I I mean that's what I you're right I I Am\nI my brain is doing crazy right now I'm looking at all the other things where I'd been upset about the same thing like people who are elected officials that have engaged in sexual misconduct that our taxpayer dollars ... yeah this is our county dollars going to protect county employees it shouldn't be protected or who to pay out for their miss behaviors that should've been carefully dealt with\nWe have homeless people can't get their care and who because they are getting sick and they just built it was just reading the community

definitely\nMore often I mean you just hit a nerve because I was in court a couple of weeks ago and involve family and just everything came out of the mouth of\nThe law [laughter] a lot of lives you're saying and it was very very frustrating clients individuals that courtroom not withstanding raising your right hand the guy\nPeople live in the courtroom sometime you can't get away you can't you can't stop it you're hoping that the judge can see through it if it's frightening how often\nDo people tell you things if someone's claiming to be a victim if someone's claiming to be wrong in some capacity how often do they make a claim to you and they seem believable they seem sympathetic and it's still turns out to be a lie\nQuite more often than not I start off with the premise when I have a client I said don't take this personal I don't believe you [laughter]\nYou know I don't think it's wrong [laughter] I don't believe you because I don't want to be caught off guard later on and so you're going to prove everything that comes out of your mouth because I'm telling you clients will come in and tell you their story and then why\nAnd that's just from from having maybe over six to eight hundred clients over thirty ... and I tell them that right up front I don't believe you\nBefore you say anything don't get upset that just how I operate so I went\nBack and I was trying to look at a very famous case where the whole public was was told one thing is by the media and they believe that and it turned out not to be true yes and I went back and I looked at what happened to Gary Condit\nIf you don't remember exactly who that is he was the congressman from Modesto he was the guy that was the blue dog Democrat and he was in Congress for a long time before that he was part of the gang of five to try to take really brown out yes in Sacramento yeah\nRemember and he befriended this intern not in his office she worked for the Federal Bureau of prisons her name was shawndra levy and it was alleged that they had an affair that was going on\nAnd when he was asked about it by the cops he essentially said if you can explain to me why that's relevant I'll answer if not I'm not going to answer it and you can surmise from that whatever you want for your investigation\nAnd then all of a sudden the news media goes bonkers and the story started coming out that he's the one that killed her right the tabloids were after him they said that she died after having kinky sex with him they said that he was into bondage and then he had are tied up and that she died in his apartment\nDominic Dunn who is writing for Vanity Fair said that he talked to this horse with for [laughter]\nWho told him that he had his motorcycle friends abducted her they put her on a plane and they push for the Atlantic ocean when they were somewhere in between the east coast to\nThe United states and Europe and that's how she died\nThe Washington Post said that he was having affairs within turn this ... this was a regular thing for him\nAnd they had some woman in Modesto who was Seventeen at the time who whose father who was a complete crackpot I guess was their stores they allege that he had an affair with her and never talk to her about it she said she never met the guy before in her life\nAnd as it turns out\nThe source of a lot of these stories ended up being the levy family themselves and the dad\nI read your article as you keep telling as you continue the story with KBC listener I didn't know that I learned that a little bit last night after reading your article and when they finally found out who it was the killed there was this illegal alien from El Salvador is now is a mark on the gay and he was being prosecuted\nThe prosecutors were going nuts because the levy still were convinced that Gary Condit had something to do with it so they were leaking stories to the Washington Post\nWho were printing the stories essentially accusing Gary Condit of doing all these bad things which turned out not to be true but they were printing it because the ... were telling it to them\nAnd so instead of going out and trying to independently verified they just put it in the newspaper and it damn near screwed up the prosecution of this guy because the defense was he didn't do it and Gary Condit that listen to what the victim's mother said listen to what the victim's father said look it's what's in the Washington Post\nI'm trying to figure out what was the motivation based on your story line what was the motivation to lead me to focus on Condit well that came up during the trial because Dr levy Bob levy ... father was called as a as a witness in that trial\nAnd the defense attorney was asking him about all of these things that he said and he eventually broke down and admitted to making it up\nHere's the direct quotes of the question from the defense attorney was\nDid you tell the police that your daughter had a five year plan that would involve are getting married to the person with whom she was involved\nAnswer I might have said that but I don't think she actually believe that we were mad at ... at any rate so we just said whatever came to our mind at that time next question I understand I'm just trying to find out what you shared with the police at that time answer yes at that time I was trying to paint him as\nThe villain that's ... that's a nice defamation lawsuit statute of limitations not withstanding because they destroy them\nThey did oh he was a strong word I mean I agree I mean I follow that story and just a day to day hammering of ... and by the levy family every day and the media just gobble that up\nBut I think it was one of these situations where they were the sympathetic figures in oh yeah\nSo no one wanted to question them and no one wanted to ask themselves the question well what if they're lying because they have some other motivation and it turns out they did they were convinced that he did it and they also thought that by tying him to the case\nThat it would get generate attention and that that would be a that would likely cause to people finding their daughter was missing\nAnd they didn't know for a long period of time that she was dead they just knew that she was missing she managed so she could have been living somewhere or alive and save well they use condoms yeah they used him but they had a motivation to do it yeah\nAnd so when you're looking at people whose name is on the ballot now or you're looking at people who've been appointed to something and there are allegations out there against them and there's no evidence to back it up\nDon't just assume because the people who are making the allegation are sympathetic that they're telling the truth because people frequently life\nI agree and you know what it's funny even with someone's convicted and then they get the case reverse that people just remember the conviction and my my point is simply this\nOnce that story give out there you can't stop it and I think now because of social media is impossible you can't you can't even wash it off the you know the the the Internet is is there forever so those allegations are they all those stories about time that they're all there and it used to\nBe in the old days you could just move so he could move from a desk they'll go to Arizona go somewhere else and no one will know who you are and no one will know your past but because of Google you move in everything catches up with you all the way to hit the reset\nButton no people don't understand that don't put anything on the Internet Lewis again\n[laughter] don't do those pictures have you on the skin rug lowest they're going to come back we're going to come back I tell you it's amazing that you're absolutely right and in your article I encourage all the afternoon drive home listeners to read it is fascinating when I read it last night I call you back immediately of ethics\nWell thank you but it's something that the media really never learns from they repeated over and over and over again\nAnd I don't know and you would know this a lot better than I Do it's very hard to prove a defamation case yes but if you print something just because someone else says it and you don't do due diligence and you don't make any effort to find out what they're telling you is true and you ruin someone's life\nThere should be something illegal about there should\nBe but uh if there's just ... something without taking credit for the accuracy was some people was a lot of these people do they're not going to be a ... is that first print and they got to retract her oh they're in trouble but someone subsequently just reporting was out there\nAnd frequently the the cops in the investigators will take the lead from the media\nSo this was part of the reason that it took so long to solve this crime because the media kept focusing on Condit so any time something would be in the newspaper that's where the detectives would go yeah and they are the ones that caught the detectives to blow this for a long period of time and I bet you this happens all the\nHere in California there's no Republican on the ballot it's
