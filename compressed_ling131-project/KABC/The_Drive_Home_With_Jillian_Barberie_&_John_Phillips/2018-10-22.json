{"content": "\nAnd of course that is Tony Bennett with rags to riches and we use that because the estate taxes\nAnd probate and all that kind of stuff it's actually designed to do the exact opposite design to take it from riches to rags and we do not want that to happen to you so every week at this time we have our state tip of the week now this week we're going to talk about trust for your spouse now the field our show this week\nUm has been our vision one hundred as a firm for money matters\nAnd as I mentioned a little bit ago ... we ... we not work with a thousand families and the responsibility that comes with that is one that we did not take lightly it's not just taking care of them that is important in guiding them and helping them to have an actual security but it's also their families\nAnd one of the things that you know I've often said as you don't want your financial advisory firm to die before you do so we created in our firm will be called vision one hundred vision one hundred means that a hundred years from now we want money matters to be as strong or stronger than it is today\nNot only fascinating Mr Spock but also very logical um and so that's kind of ties in with this segment of the show which is an estate planning and passing on to the next generations and we have a a core value that we live by which is core value number eight which is that everyone deserves love\nAnd what I mean by that is that no matter who you come into contact with including that person to cut you off on the freeway and then flipped you off as they were going by they deserved love you give love always okay\nIt's not you don't get love because you think you're going to get it back you give love because it's the right thing to do you give love unconditionally with no expectations coming back at you\nIf you do that I think you live a very happy life\nBecause then your happiness is not dependent on other people coming back to you and saying I Love you back or doing stuff for you or whatever it doesn't matter you don't need that if you're if you're the giver of love\nThen somehow and you know in in different religions are different names for it but it comes back to you the more love you put out into the universe the more love will come back to you and you don't have to force it you don't have\nExpect it it will come to you so our core value number eight is everyone deserves love everyone that comes into contact with us as a from as a person and our family everywhere we want to make sure that we give them all the love that we have to get and if we do that they'll be better for it and in in some magical way so we'll wait\nAnd so a state planning which is the topic of this segment is that so let's talk about someone that I Hope you love a lot which is your spouse okay so the Q tip trust that is a kind of trust that upon your death\nYou leave the money for your spouse in a trust\nNow people tend to freak out about the word trust they don't like that word but you know what trust are are are not black boxes that you put money in cannot come out no in fact just the opposite a Q tip trust is there for your spouse to be able to have access to the ... for whatever they need it for pretty much I mean there are some limitations but not many\nAnd but what it does do is to protect them\nFrom if they get divorced if they remarried and get divorced which maybe you don't care much about at this point but could happen or if they get into a lawsuit or if they have a a you know if they if they go bankrupt than all the money that's in the Q tip and the trust for them is is protected from all of that\nAnd then you may have a spouse that isn't so good with managing money and you want to have a trustee that helps them with that so that again is the value of the Q tip trust\nOkay so think about your spouse protecting the money that you want to have them have for the rest of their lives in the event that you diapers and if you want to put it in trust a Q tip will do that for you okay something for you to think about so this shall we talk a lot about all of our core values I Hope that uh you got some ah some of it if you didn't hear the entire show\nOur website is money matters dot net money matters dot net and you can podcast didn't listen to the whole thing and uh you know I I feel sort of like maybe I surmise today somewhat but uh

be an inability of the United states to cover it short term I'm borrowing made and whether or not if you do agree that the United states faces or a bankruptcy and the next well much\nI don't think we have a bankruptcy and the next twelve months John but I I have to tell you that there was nobody in Washington\nWith any power that I'm aware of that\nCares at all about the national deficit or the national debt the annual deficit or the national debt it seems as though the whole topic of the national debt and the annual deficit has completely vanished from the radar screen\nI'm not hearing anybody in Washington DC in a position of power talking about the topic is vanish got the debt to Dennis Dennis with us and vanished but\nDo you have a concern over the uh the short term that we could face a some financial issues because of our ah inability to borrow the money necessary to cover a short term debt even if it's not\nAnd they don't know well ah for the next twelve months I can speak clearly I Do not have a concern because I think that uh there are enough people out there willing to\nTrust the full faith and credit and taxing power of the usa to buy our bonds they may demand more interest going forward\nWouldn't be surprised at all going forward if they demand more interest for the debt but I think there are buyers out there for the debt and for the next twelve months I've no

as you know vanguard has a a a low cost advisory service I knew something in the area of\nThirty five basis points which is close to one third of one percent a year look I think if a person is is out at sea without orders and they have no idea what they're doing I think they're way better off\nWith a service like that than making a lot of mistakes\nWell a with a robo adviser you are saying\nWell the one that I described yes I think that if somebody has available\nYeah something like that at a low cost and is going to provide them with some guidance as opposed to being out there and having an absolutely no idea in the world what they're doing that's a recipe for disaster so I think in a case like that uh it it makes sense to me\nThank you for the call money\nTalks come your way each and every weekend as we talk about subjects financial Steve's on the line in Nebraska Steve welcome to Monday talk\nI have a question about my four oh three at work I'm sixty years old\nAnd I can't find

I've known Lewis forever and I'm not making excuses for him so please don't take this that way we're peers were equals when we were kids and he asked if he could\nPleasure himself in front of me some time I'd go F yeah I Want to see that it's not analogous to the other women that they're talking yeah what he did to them he could offer me nothing we were only just friends of times yeah I wanted to see it it was amazing sometimes I'd say ... gross pizza\nYeah that's how close they were and so I Love the fact that a she's on us and be she says I really can't put myself in that category of me too because I was like yeah bring it on that serious personality she's just one of those people and I so\nI I think it's great that she's honest but did it give way to hit for him to think he had license to do it with other people I don't know that she was the first but she certainly has known him or the longest well\nWhat we've been hearing was that people do this because it was a power thing right I could do it in front of you and you really have no option you had there and watch\nAnd that was Rebecca ... problem with him she's coming in on the show in a couple of weeks that's right she um was ... this is different because they were they came up together when she says they were kids they were in their twenties and they were\nWriting together partners and so she didn't look at it as a a subordinate thing at all she's like yeah sure or no not\nToday [laughter] you know I'm not feeling it\nPut your ... [laughter] I'm not into it but your friend for your friend it was a little different\nYeah Rebecca Corey wrote a whole article on it and said that it helped to you know squash her career in in the sense that she was grossed out by it and didn't want it and then suddenly she's not working with him and then there's a career soul because he's powerful I mean this was many years later this was\nThis was many years after Sarah and Louis were hanging out this is like Fifteen Years later because to Louis had already become a big star but yeah when I was driving today I heard it and I was like\nOh wow okay that's Sarah that Sarah being honest I Love Sara I Love her honesty she's like I Can't I'm not going\nTo the white guy [laughter] I don't think she's helping her friend belt though well but it's it's her truth yeah it is I I don't have to be true oh this is true but I ... who like who cares that Sarah story my other friend Rebecca stories a different story\nLike we all have you know I myself I've said this many times on the show I cannot be part of the me too because I might have been ...

an advantage and Rachel knows that Rachel said\nYeah okay well there's an advantage\nBut guess what doesn't matter because the most important thing is to make sure that I don't feel oppressed that's
