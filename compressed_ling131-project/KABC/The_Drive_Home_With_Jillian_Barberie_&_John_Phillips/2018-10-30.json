S. citizen is a citizen if they are subject\nTo the jurisdiction there of know what does that mean and\nThat's the problem that the the Trump approaches to say look\nIf you are already a citizen of France or Guatemala or someplace else and you come here and the parents are illegal and you're born here or or the parents were already citizens of those countries what that means is that the\nBaby is sort of has dual citizenship the baby also is subject to the jurisdiction of France and so Trump's position is to say well the constitution doesn't give\nUs birthright citizenship to the baby a born here of French parents who are here illegally because the baby already is subject to the other jurisdiction now you can imagine not everybody agrees with Trump's position and of course at this point with a week to go before the midterms\nThe Democrats are saying this is a dog whistle racism or racist Trump pandering to a racist base But Trump's position is no this is a legitimate issue I've been told I can actually change this by executive order because we don't need to\nAlter the fourteenth amendment we just need to issue a clarifying executive order or\nAlternatively Lindsey Graham wants to pass a law out of Congress that will again clarify the amendment to essentially say no there's no birthright citizenship\nWell I don't think anyone can reasonably argue that when they were writing the thirteenth fourteenth amendment that they had people who are here illegally or tourists in mind when they put that in there that was expressly about slavery correct\nThat's exactly right and to the extent you want to pay attention\nTo what the founders thought and the people who passed the amendments then you're right that's that's a legitimate argument to say it had a very narrow focus and of course it's all about politics in the early nineties\nHarry Reid of all people running the Senate or a big guy dude and the Senate he tried to get Congress to pass a law saying no birthright citizenship only if you're\nA mom and dad are citizens or legal resident alien ... do you become magically an American citizen that of course why with Harry Reid do that well we've got you know on tape\nFeinstein Clinton read pandering to the unions in the early nineties that hated immigrants taking union jobs they were railing against illegals and so Reed and the rest fell in line and then\nThe international service union came along change their mind they liked\nLetting illegals in because that boosted their power and their rules and suddenly every Democrat left of center was totally in favor of opening it up so he got a lot of politics on both sides but at the bottom it's a very technical legal issue and now with our new Supreme Court with the justice cabin on there\nCould well be that Trump would win this fight because you know the four liberals automatically would vote against a changing the\nFourteenth amendment or or interpreting it in the way Trump once said so then it really comes down at this point to weather chief justice Roberts would flip over to the liberals or we stick with ... with all the the new conservatives on the right wing of the court to uphold Trump's view\nWell it seems like you open up the newspaper and every time you do you see a different story about this being abused in some capacity or not long ago we did a story about birth tourism where people would fly and wealthy people from places like China and they would have these entire homes where it would be a bunch of pregnant women would\nMean that Congress can sell part down the road when they see hunting constantly and now we're in a position where you know like you said ... people who are surprised by that shouldn't be surprised and talking about it\nNow and he's actually deciding to do in the week before the midterm I just wish you know I just wish it wasn't there an executive order I wished congressman get off their back and do something\n[noise] yeah I think there's a lot of pressure toward a having a change based on what Congress says or\nMaybe even a constitutional amendment or a decision out of the Supreme Court because just to to let the president do it it seems like he would be really flexing its muscles to an excessive degree now one thing he's saying now is he wants to get rid of the\nAsylum rule the now says you step across the border you're illegal and you're saying all old on before you send me back if you send me to Honduras I Will be executed so I'd like to apply for asylum\nRight now you can do that what the president wants is an executive order saying they only make claim asylum at a point of entry of some official places like San Diego or\nOr or Miami if you're just cross the border illegally and your claim I ... I Want asylum or the president wants\nTo say no you're going to be set back and of course that's kind of time into this this looming issue of the caravan of immigrants headed north right now and I guess we heard what fifty two hundred soldiers are going to be heading toward the borders of that's going to be a pretty dramatic clash\nWell it's interesting that you say that because remember when Trump was quoted as saying that a lot of these countries are crap holes and people say oh my God I Can't believe you use that vulgarity or insulting their homeland you can't say that\nNow they're on their way from from Central America and they're saying oh we can't go back into the crap all over there and we we got to the United states\n[noise] yeah I think they use different language for what the president or use of it but you're right it's it's a little bit ironic a and you know of course\nIs just for the political standpoint or the Democrats are are pretty angry about this they want the subject of the debate heading into the midterms next week to be\nHealth care saving preexisting conditions a you know the climate of\nHate allegedly created by the president with all the bombs to the Democrats in the synagogue shooting and I think what Trump is doing now you know of all times for him to sit down and sort of break this News I'm going to get rid of birthright citizenship you look at the clock\nAnd were seven days out from the midterms I think he wants to get back to his issue that this is an existential threat we don't have a country if we don't have borders open borders are what the Democrats want and it's the worst possible thing and the Democrats have been totally opposite the standpoint\nOf viewpoint on this uh again it's all leading up to the big clash next Tuesday\nAnd this puts red state Democrats in a very difficult position because when they run for reelection and places like West Virginia and North Dakota Indiana Florida whatever they talk a tough game on immigration but then when they go to Washington DC the party and tells them to vote\nNow by Trump raising this issue at the eleventh hour they're going to be asked about it by reporters they are going to be asked about it and they're debates they're going to have to come down with a position on what the president's trying to do and if they come down against them my guess is their electorate is going to side with the president\n[noise] yeah it's and it's a big issue I mean the statistics tell us about eight percent of all births in this country or each year about three hundred thousand or or ... to undocumented immigrants so\nAh it of course the President Trump was saying to the reporter this morning I think well we're the only country in the world that does this is ridiculous and I was noticing on Fox News earlier today a shepherd Smith the kind of a sarcastic we looked in the camera and said\nNo Mr President in fact thirty countries around the world do this including Canada so Trump's going to be accused of once again of course sort of creating its own facts\nBut at the end of the day as you point out the the politicians could be on the hot seat in those red states are regardless of whether Trump got his facts right or not uh it it is a very emotional issue that they're going to have to face\nRoyal oaks ABC News legal analyst thanks so much for stopping by we always love chatting with you\nYou bet bags All right how do you think this is going to play as we're what two weeks ahead of the midterms actually will know next week one me boy we have a look at the column I think\nIt's going to play I ... I mean the timing of that I I'm extremely than uh I mean this is obviously and the vet he's making to rally in may then again that's something that he had been talking about doing\nFor a long time you talk on the campaign trail this and then any sort of surprised this is all part of his plan and now I I think it's going to create more of a divide and sending all these troops in the corner I Can't see them again and again right\nWhat is the knee jerk reaction of the every man if he were to go into a Starbucks in the morning or going to a diner or whatever and you were to to sit there and find some guy eating his eggs\nAnd say hey if a wealthy person from China gets on a plane and comes here and has a baby and the should the baby be a citizen or is that an abused them to process\nWhat is the knee jerk reaction\nI doubt that every day man reaction to that would be I think they would side with Trump that there's something inherently wrong about somebody coming over here just to have a baby just to get citizenship I think a lot of people would see that as an abusive system for sure I\nGuess but I just don't like about this is that Congress has settled on this issue for so long and then now we have someone in place you know and I think it's with any prizes that you know to legislate through that could have order is not an ideal situation\nThat the average guy in woman's gonna look at the huge crowd which looks more than seven thousand to me and and and the Trump or something and say hey they're coming to a town near you\nKnow uh in the city at work and he is to have three or ... or\nA trauma care hospitals\nSo expensive that run because of the gang shootings 'cause that's what it's going to have the audience people can't get\nJobs or they can't read you know they're going to search for many crimes are forced to like him is Thirteen and then eventually what happens the hospitals get overrun social trauma shootings again shooting and\nMost people will eventually a sea of that and probably vote for towards Trump\nAnd independent but and I'll tell you you know after seeing what's going on there at the border or like a and if they get through you know the other ones are going to start coming\nWell if yeah if it is to actually works out this is just going to be the new way to come because the way you come now if you're coming from that part of the world is you pay a coyote and the coyotes are frequently the cartels and you pay them a lot of money and sometimes it works out sometimes it doesn't if it doesn't work out guess what you're still out the money\nBut if you can just come with a big enough group and you get in and you apply for asylum and that works then the cartels and the coyotes are put under and suddenly you have a lot of people
