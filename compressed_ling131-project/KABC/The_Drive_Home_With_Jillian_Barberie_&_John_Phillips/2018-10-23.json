a tape I mean then you really get yourself in trouble but it's amazing to me how the story has stayed in the news for this long I mean you know the the New York times story about the president's taxes\nAnd allegations of committing tax part was gone and two hours a story about a you know one journalist who was a perimeter or is it has is is on the top of everyone's mind and I think it's because of how horrific it is but also frankly I'm going to be honest the Jason Bourne element\nYes it's like a Dexter ... yes yes\nYeah yeah I\nI'm I'm Still trying to figure out okay so ... and John

dictatorship because first of all\nCorrection were monitoring\nThat a family on the ground time yeah family of the guy that we chopped up holy cow what\nHere's here's the thing there are I heard I I I Will\nBe very honest I'm not Walsh wars in the Sunday will ever come all folks I heard from one of them and the other reporters have reported this with multiple sources that ah the crown prince was done\nBy the reaction and I don't blame him for being stunned because I said earlier today he got away with kidnapping the prime minister of Lebanon ... got away with you know locking up over a hundred of his cousins and other relatives in the ...\nUm you know a without a trial or anything else he got away and getting away with the Yemen stuff\nThe war so he and he's like what the hell why is this a big deal then\nThis is one guy we do this all the time the facts of the matter is I I I if I Move myself I forgive me I have said it was on the last time I was um [noise] if\n... was in ... had gone to Saudi for whatever reason and they put them through a BS trial and then they you know ... is head off\nAnd we actually will be five percent of the book it's because it took place at the council\nOn foreign soil us resident\nNow I'm I'm a question about a half the world in the world stage\nUm you know we've had harsh criticism is coming from people like Branson and you had you know are a\nPatrick why telephones endeavor William Morris pull out of a four hundred million dollar deal a ... an angle and Merkel said we took a line and said we're not going to deal with them I'm ... ... ... what do you do I see I thought Steven Mnuchin wasn't going to go over there and then I see a picture of him with the prince today\nHe wasn't going to go to the future investment conference which is you know the conference that a lot of people pulled out of you know they were perjure Davos than the desert um but he never canceled\nThe trip was element to his trip\nThat was about anti terrorism financing and all that sort of stuff which is something that we often meet with Saudi about because there's so much money moving out of the kingdom mhm but you know the reaction from the ... has not been surprising but go running\nBecause you know countries like the United states go after this kind of stuff we\nWe criticize and we will hold people accountable stuff simply because number one it it it's who we are but also we don't want to have it happen to our people\nAnd you\nGot to head while I was just going to ask you who should by seeing the crown prince right now because that is not a democracy in Saudi Arabia so it's like he's got to worry about getting kicked out of the next election if he's tied to some big international scandal\nBut he does have a population that he has to keep under his thumb or under control to some degree\nAnd he needs to keep the world\nStage happy because he does a lot of business internationally\nHe's got to be listening to someone at this point whose advice in him who's telling him about the geopolitics uh surrounding the situation right now\nHe's surrounded by the way\nIt's not the case with all members of the Saudi royal family in fact there's there's\nThere's um you know uh in in previous rains and if you're talking about the um the law and it can cause and you had them have advisors that were very it can be very Frank with them or their family members because you know there's only twenty thousand members of the world family\nNBS everyone's terrified of him because he's through so many of his relatives in jail and we took away their money and you know he doesn't have any\nClose family members I don't know if you remember that he has his mother under house arrest basically he reported knowing earlier this year that um\nHe has been keeping his father's favorite wife his mom more weight from his father because she was concerned\nThat I'm In for your listeners are all three of the article talked with us again when he was concerned that his mom would prevent him from you know doing the things that he was doing and there's\nA scene in the story from NBC News that is unbelievable where Obama sitting down with king saw him on this has been your twenties Fifteen or twenty six Shane king Solomon says to him oh my wife my wife is in New York right now receiving medical treatment\nAnd Obama looks as Susan Rice and and they did not acknowledged him that they knew that wasn't true\nOh my wife was behind lock and key back in ... oh my\nGod oh my God\nThis is what we're dealing with the way that is that not to get a little juvenile it was like I'm going to call your wife for a\nWhile [laughter] [laughter] I was gonna say which one would [laughter]\nYeah it was one I think he's got a couple but but but um but that's the kind of person we are dealing with here and you know I don't want to get too much your audience although there are a lot of Iranians will suddenly worried\nAbout he reminds me so much of

not as type\nNothing wrong with that I Would never know you never know you learn this show by the way let me\nJust ... and his story has weeks slash months of shelf life ... there are so many\nLayers so many things we don't know yet and reporter desperate to get\nIt gets a story let me ask you one more question before you go if you were giving advice to to the crown prince right now what advice would you give him if the possibility is still out there that the story could have legs like that to just make this go away\nI Can't I'm not a big issue giving advice but I Will say is this the very wise members of the royal family like prince Khalid who was sent by the king to turkey last week and came back and told the thing you're not didn't we're not getting out of this one this is Bob\nAnd

I have a\nAn egg and if I disability ...\nAlong with that a lot of people just aren't even aware at and the kids that we do have in school I getting married and that because we're so overwhelmed with all these issues that we're having to deal with\nThat not to mention all the different languages you know these people are coming from rural areas it's not like they all speak Spanish\nOh absolutely absolutely and then as a teacher were held accountable for it at the end of the day you know our scores are affected everything acted and come back down on that\nWhy not yeah Hawaii army or the Big Mac you for your surfers talking to you that I speak to the military is like I I'm so appreciative of the teachers are doing the hard work so thank you on the front line you\nKnow I went into it with a different philosophy and just you know working for five years it's totally changed my perspective\nThat's all unfortunately I'm really not in a good way that's what I always hear so but thank you spend less for fighting the good fight\nWe appreciate you being here we should you try to help us struggle with these issues they are not easy to solve or they were already be solved a although again a little will everybody a little will to to make a difference and move things in a direction even it's politically expedient I'd love to see a little bit of that our government\nEight hundred to two to five to two of the number four is why the doctor knew this been been alive [noise]\nRemember that thing your wife says you couldn't live\nWith for gay and day you can and she doesn't even have to know about it\nA shot at a grand is coming up in just seconds so even\nOrange County cumulus station by\n\nOne thousand dollars right now just take the natural he was rich denied five one nine that's rich are icy eight to nine five feet\nRight and left Democrat and Republican we never really talked about we talked about issues we talked about I was always pro death\nI was always pro life pro death for the bad guys pro life for the guy um and so she would say well that's a more Republican's stance and I\nAnd he'd say how do you feel about gay marriages and for it was more of a Democrat stand so I was always sort of down the line\nWhat this administration has done for me at least I'm watching Trump and his rallies and you know now he's supporting Ted Cruz Ted Cruz is an idiot Ted Cruz killed ... dad killed Kennedy Kennedy and his wife as well as I was you know she's ugly\nOh I Love you had terrific tapped what's it called ...\n... well first she called them beautiful dead then he amended in their name to Texas\nAnd now has legislator ... thank you you're you're you're ... I mean President Trump so I have a real problem with all the BS but you guys that that always exists in politics right to sort of the bigger but I think now they are ... than ever yeah I agree it's\nBigger there's and there's more talk radio cable TV news\nHere blaming the [laughter] shelling\nJon Benet Jon we have a different side we agree on some things and we disagree on things but what this is done and I was asking you guys am I Alone I felt like I was voting more passionately as opposed to why\nEverybody's angry and I'm like yes\nMy brother filled out his ... he and his wife are right of center and they forgot to mail it in the primary was sitting on his desk he never mailed it and I talked to him on the phone because he's all ginned up about the cabinet I think he's very upset at what they did to him and I asked him are you going to vote in November\nThey did the Kavanaugh Supreme Court justice now\nNo I Know but how they they smeared him and so he and his wife are absolutely going to vote in November based on that issue and so I think a lot of Republicans are going to get motivated by that and the caravan so Democrats are going to get motivated by their hatred for Trump Republicans\nNow what happened the timing of the caravan is at all interesting or and I\nAs I slept are there any terrorists in a caravan yeah I mean he said there were I'm looking for them as\nWell and then the president was asked this morning how do you know and he said well I don't know\n[laughter] it sounds like there was there there might be heard one guy\nWell that's falling on Fox say that I read an interview where somebody said there were one hundred a ISIS people perhaps involved that he heard\nThat the only needs are they the same ones that were celebrating when the twin towers\nYou know it's interesting to look at Honduras and I wonder why there are so many people right now and there are reasons for this visit was television and the doors and that's what new stories ... and ... and suddenly\nPeople they they became a cohesive thing so it's two hundred here and three hundred there they they all started coming together feeling of safety in numbers and you don't have to pay the seven thousand dollars to the coyote if you're a Republican you believe the Democrats are paying them to come up but\nI don't think that I you know there was a confluence of events you know there are people who think that yeah I've been I think it was early it helps from\nOh it does yeah I think it does complete the\nTime they are going to show up here like the day you get hit by the hurricane which might help oh God more human suffering that hurricanes about to hit right where they're supposed to be at all I've\nSeen from those pictures are women in strollers with kids it's like I mean I\nJust have such issue but and it's not that I'm from Peter I told John in the beginning I really try because I Know Trump and you guys know Trump ... and I spent time with them and he finally hit all the ... many times you work for um I work ... hours and hung out with them and but I\nI I I just every day it was a new something and a new low and I said I Can't do this any longer and the lives and I\nJust I cannot do it all if I were a mainstream or middle of the line Republican I'd be down\nFor that firearm and become an operative I Would try to choreographed this caravan or mob as some people call this ... you mentioned the time of the exact while I was going to last image that you see is\nSeven thousand people trying to come back we're going to hell or whatever it is\nNow I'm really worried about the hurricane that is another category five\nI don't think it is really could be hurt me through the roof this point it could be a five and it's supposed to hit those resort towns in Mexico and the Pacific coast so I think it's the part of a art Basel la ... topic area\nWhat's the name of it will ... will think something like shocked about well I Do I feel that the full name [laughter]\nBut when they give these like nice name with like you know you can you imagine him saying things like Barbara just killed several thousand people well All right I've got you got him when I was ... ... or you know Central America\n[laughter] well\nAnyway so here we are it's a very polarized time and I wish it were were not I just\nAnd it's like ... and this has got to be interesting to see if a lot of people like John you were talking about your relatives are more motivated to vote seems like I I I don't think so I don't know if it's going to be what we said before not lose soon on me a little four foot wave clue but it was going to see who else isn't everything really voting our young people do you\nKnow a lot about voting I've been reading a lot about how they've been moving votes and so that the blacks and Latinos can't get to them that irritates me that voter suppression ... what\nAbout why John you this is your party ever\nEver ever it is in no hurry\nMan during his went out on its where where Republicans are ... their constituents instead of the constituents picking the politicians\nEvery every ten years in most states different never stood you know states over ten years the recon figure the district in the district\nSo it's not as if you're if you're a Democrat a party and you have power in the state house you're going to ... district that all about the other and vice versa and vice versa and there were more Republicans empowering states than Democrats so\nFor example are moving them to areas where it's hard for the did you see last is on board to take a lot of the Latin Americans in a certain area to vote there saying we're gonna we're working with this ... Latina and Latino area\nAnd I think that that's great because well I don't know what happened I don't like when they're they're trying to hold people down here's\nWhat happened in orange county show there is a congressional district that Santa Ana garden grove Anaheim base when it's when I read a Sanchez had for many ...\nAnd when they did the redistricting that was always one that could go either way because Bob Dorman had it before she did\nAnd there's a heavy Vietnamese population there were there Republican because they're very anti communist and Ronald Reagan embrace entrepreneurial yes and so what the Democrats to to make sure that of Vietnamese Republican didn't win that district is they put them into different seats\nSo they split them with the Long Beach seat and they split them with the Santa Ana see right so that way no Vietnamese candidate could theoretically come in and win\nBut I think gerrymandering what you're talking about and I think just talking about voter suppression so there's different ... well\nOf gerrymandering is a form of voter suppression but you're talking about what was happening in Georgia let's say yeah\nI mean we're talking about what what's going to happen in the mid ... where were you may\nOr may not have ... and people can vote and I don't like ... ... one of them are African American like that\nI I think that's wrong and every single and the president I don't think it was this morning said you know a lot of illegals are voting when he had that whole commission that found no illegals voting\nExactly what I'm saying is he says things and it and it it fires up his base which seems to be that this whole administration get these rallies that makes them feel good they're all ...\nAt the bottom line is he's throwing stuff out like he put he put Middle Eastern terrorists in the care of that I haven't read meat yeah well it'll it'll how it works I like to talk on my\nWork about ... years ago they finally realized that negative political advertising works was really effective prior to that everybody was embarrassed to be doing it but then they realized you got to do it it's what works\nWhat do you think the Democratic position on the caravan is going to be [noise]\nGo away [laughter]\nNo no no no no we we ... we love you but not not many of them want to abolish ice right I think that's a more extreme as somebody\nI mean I Can't imagine we are a lot more left of center all of us and we would never abolish ice and I'm not from this country you need ice that's ridiculous I think that the you got a hardcore ... allowed to think that oh my God all the Democrats want it to be open borders that's bull but ...\nYears what's happened and you make a good point here John just by suggesting this\nWe are so polarized and so attacking us\nThat only the extreme positions other positions you discuss yet another as you don't discuss about ice you discuss about abolishing ice because some percentage of the Democratic party but not the larger percentage Eleanor who's going to be one of the presidential contest contenders she was one of the ones who shot but she's she's also way where's that party going\nThe the the Bernie Sanders Ocasio wing of the party that's where they were going\nBut I think when you have three presidents saying over and over again over the Democrats just want open borders it's tough to have a conversation about policy and God Forbid nuance\nDemocrats have changed dramatically at very well look at the Dianne Feinstein\nWell her position on the border you find similar findings ... very similar Trump's is now yeah I'm In the Nineteen nineties she was hardcore fewer Harry Reid was hard core and\nThen on I ... truck was very liberal he was supporting Hillary Clinton and Obama\nWas fairly hard core a lot of people were deported but don't forget we all alone when Obama was\nWell the president did say today when he was answering some questions in the oval office that we've already started building in San Diego so I don't know is it there\nWill it pre existed him but yeah there is a ... they may have those ... those fruit and then they've been fixing remember
