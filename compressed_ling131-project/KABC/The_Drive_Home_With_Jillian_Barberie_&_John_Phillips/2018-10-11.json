N. G. persona non grata if if it you know the the Turkish president or the one can declare everyone every deployment Saudi diplomat which includes intelligence officers persona non grata and kick them out of the country they can shut down the embassies um but when it comes to diplomatic immunity in any crime\nIt's very very difficult and the reason that country's often don't go after it is they want they don't want it to happen to them\nSo how's it going and turkey because that I think is going to determine what they do\nOr how they respond to this because Saudi Arabia is a is a very wealthy country it's a country that does a lot of business internationally I Would imagine in that part of the world turkey\nTrade with yeah what what was the topic was just grabbing the arms ... wasn't that Saudi Arabia I see a year ago when\nHe was I mean it's one of the challenges we're going out and and Jared Kushner is they elevated you know the crown prince yeah they were former um ... when\nHe was the actual reminds me of treated reminds me so much of how the shah of Iran was treated you know is this like sort of oh he's a western guy and he and Lee and\nThese were or where it's like he was a brutal dictator ... they've killed and stole money and it did other things but\nBut going back to turkey in terms of turkey you know the Turks have a very very tense relationship with the Saudis the Turks are more aligned with the Iranians courses Saudis number one enemy Iran\nUm that are but in terms\nOf of um\nIn terms of the house weighing in Turkey it's going to play however air to won't wants to play and he has to take full advantage of his mom was a really light a fire under them and it sounds like this he cares frankly if somebody has been murdered or not I mean the guy's a total dictator and throwing people in prison and journalists in prison left\nAnd right nothing he doesn't want something to happen in his country that doesn't go along with is planned that's what this is about um and so you know I I this\nIs not going to play well it's it's certainly cannot play well in the u._s. it's globally something walk Saudi Arabia and I'm going to say something that is a little bit provocative but this is how revolutions gets started these little things or how people start to get really pissed off and\nStart asking questions mhm it's always the big stuff yeah these little sparks that start people and people start getting angry\nI let me ask you this because you're from a I'm a are you from Tehran wearing Iran\nI wasn't born there but I I've spent a lot of time there my parents were born in Iran my mom's from the from Toronto my ... from the south from a very small town\nSo my girlfriend is also from Tehran and she lived there uh during the revolution so she was

her father used to work for the ... was a mathematician that taught the size family\nAnd I'm a life was completely changed so yes you're exactly right when you look at the shah of Iran but when you
