bill\n[laughter] I I'm I'm I'm all over the place on that I you know um [noise] my exposure\nThat folks that I had locked up for that I Know that have been in prison and it and you know it's really well known the last thing it is about a rehabilitation you know for\nThere are in about ... they say they're about rehabilitation but they're really not so there's a lot that's going to go into this metric so did the folks that are the four thousand let's say how long have they been in\nHave they been rehabilitated or have they even been more heart and to the life and what are you what are you now letting out on society\nYou know that that's that's the interesting question that needs to be asked\nAnd build on something like a case by case analysis that you just described them the fact that you are to you I Would agree and they were all very from him make him make\n[noise] right yeah I mean it it it it it is a tough call but like the scenario that you guys put to attempted murders and then one what it was it one drug arrest right so\nLet me go this sort of mix\nThat someone is is that person got caught on\n... yeah you have to assume that if they're still out out committing crimes committed labs\nAre saying is how do you know they didn't succeed at some crime I didn't get caught exactly and you know you don't get caught and every time they committed a crime so you know the the three strikes how many times my question is and it's and it's probably rhetorical\nIs how many times where they it back forget about strikes how many times with a bat\n[noise] yeah that's a very relevant part of the story that we don't think about because people commit committed criminal acts all the time and we don't catch a lot of um a lot of crimes go unsold sometimes I don't even reported crimes if they're criminals themselves or or they don't want to talk to the police they don't trust the police\nSo you have a lot of you have a lot of factors that go into this that leads you to believe that if someone hasn't gotten their act together after they'd been convicted on three different serious accounts two of them being violent\nThen we're better off with them in prison\nRight and then it becomes a course listen make no mistake this is a cost benefit analysis by the state\nYou know it they crunched the numbers and they want to say they're altruistic they want to say there you know they want to be kind it's like you know California's going bankrupt [laughter] so they're like OK let's release them and now what is that what is the costs going to be to society down the road\nI Would I Would do things always get the economic interests and that's a factor men as not being brought out in these articles but if the if the elephant in the room I agree\nExactly ... exactly\nAnd all of the surge to the we have about crime tells us that the ... of criminals is through the roof\nAnd if people don't get with the program especially after a certain point after you've tried to rehabilitate them a couple of times and it doesn't take and they're still out and there's still preying on people then that's the die is cast that's just who they are\nWhat you know you're actually right now there is a moral there is a social commentary there is a societal commentary on this but the but\nThe bottom line is is if you have someone who had three strikes and you have to get there not graduating Ivy League college is they you know they got tattoos all over their face and body and the ... and they're going out\nInto the world where are they going to be gainfully employed\nRight what their options you know you're really not you know which I have three strikes you're you're out well guess what\nNow it's three strikes and you're back in society they're already at the game\nYou know it it it it just it just as much a disservice you know in in in my guess is that many cases to the cradle by releasing them back into society you know it's almost better to keep them in\nBut wouldn't that argument assume that they have no support system a family and extended family someone who's going to give them an opportunity not withstanding mostly a very low ... again it goes back to me\nOh you look at it on a case by case basis 'cause we might be able to save a percentage among the ... mall I'm saying that you know the road block would be the judge to make that ultimate determination I mean because of the alternative leaving the gym for the rest of his or her life versus may do it go ahead please\nYou'll live in a much more beautiful place that I Do meeting that yes on paper and in the movies or would be nice to believe it's a wonderful world so when you say of support a family system my guess is that typically most of the family\nIn that cell block you know I'm being facetious but you know when I I Know most of the\nFamily is is in that cell block you know unless you could put to me a a a a proven you know a a quad this quantifiable way of the ... step by step\nRehabilitate them back into life as opposed to saying okay you're waiting for life you're waiting for Twenty years you have no discernible skills you know what ... you have tattoos all over your face\nYour back and go to find a place to live good luck you know that doesn't work for me as opposed to this is it this track where you have been rehabilitated and Seventy six percent of people released in this program have gone on to productive lives if you could show that\nOn with that woman went from my standpoint bill do you see do you put your trust in a judge who could look at all those various factors and make the right call\nAbsolutely not [laughter] yeah me either so absolutely not make a meal on the line so we we tend to look at\nThings through rose colored glasses you know we bring our own biased seize oil experiences you know looking through the lens up the lives that the people have lived that have been incarcerated you know\nIt's it's tough and as much as we want to have faith in ill people doing good you know while they're all good people and there are people that can be rehabilitated when you're in for that long and you have committed restructure Alison if it went three felony arrest for pot\nLet's say you're a teenager for selling pot in college\nYou know that's a lot different than something that you've seen in training day you know\n[laughter] I don't want to put them in advance of like those three [laughter]\nYou know still goalie overshadow it bought a little bit different there\nOkay are is three strikes a victim of its own success\nThe sense that it it successfully reduce the crime rate because we took\nPeople who continually a broke the law and we put them in prison for a long period of time and the crime rate went down to to record lows\nAnd then people stop complaining about the crime and they started complaining about the costs of incarcerating people so they said well maybe we are incarcerating too many people and maybe we should look at that person with the drug arrest after the first to violent crimes as a nonviolent offender and not a violent offender\nAnd they said All right maybe we're being too harsh let's go ahead and start to let them out and save the money\n[noise] [noise] yeah I Know you bring up you know be careful what you wish for\nYou know and it's it's interesting it's been my experience usually the people\nThat screen let them out\nYou know they just were chance they they are rehabilitated are the folks that live in the dorm and buildings gated homes and the neighborhoods that have no

I Can't do that type of a conversation and I have a five year old son who who over and over the words I Can't or or just not even really allowed in our house because we do start to put\nThose uh would you start to put those binders on us and and make it so that we realize oh if I jump high it's gonna it's gonna hurt my head as we stop even trying\nYou know a while ago they are you know I'm ... years and years ago they they said it was physically impossible to run a four minute mile\nA vis the about a week ago there was a world championships for Iron Man and Kona\nAnd the the winter and about a six minute mile for twenty six miles after doing a hundred mile bike ride wow if you can't run a four minute mile you're you're not even on Olympic on Olympic track and field team anymore at least one for a minute mile not not to mention back to back to backs right\nSo so so these these these these restraints that we put on ourselves we also put on our finances and we end up kind of\nPainting that our own picture that we ended up residing in it and if you're if you're willing to kind of challenge the norm and you're willing to put in a little more effort\nOr a lot can be granted to you and it really just does come from getting started and putting a little bit more effort in but we could help a few more people get started\nWe've got a second tickets here the show is just beginning what are you saying we do know they give away let's do it right now I've got to have their class coming up in your area and a half day classes where you'll see exactly what it takes to really generate that consistent income in the market whether the market's going up down or sideways\nNow in just a second you're gonna have a chance to win a set of passes to one of these classes and so if you're driving now is a good time to pull over and get that phone ready included with your passes is going to be our professional insider skit it's packed with lessons from some are top instructors now the professional insiders kids critical because it makes it so you can get started right now\n... century twenty when he did a call now and reserve those seats\nThe number is eight eight eight nine nine one\nEight seven to three that's eight nine nine one eight seven to three if you end up being colors nine or Twenty one sorry about that but his up at free O T H class dot com and see if you can scores of passes there\nWe're up against the clock Larry when you have a force next\nYou know lots of students keep asking us all the time half I'm looking to make more hands does that mean I have to get more jobs and the answer is absolutely no let's talk about that [noise] multiple streams of income on the other side of the break ...

the show [noise]\nWelcome back if you're just tuning in you miss Larry Jacobs director restructure development happens structured online training academy shed some light on consistency in the markets were talking about generating more money we're talking about generating more income\nWhether the market's going up down or sideways we're talking about how much the market dropped a little bit ago you know it's been about a week or so since we had the big drop in the markets\nBut when you look at those opportunities they are they are that they are opportunities to generate any given generate more income and especially give yourself a raise and it really is important to remember that\nThe more that money has made on the way down just like the money has made on the way up and so really we wiped out number one we wiped out three months worth of games on this last market drop\nIf we didn't know how to make money as the markets were falling if you do know how to make money as the marks were going down if you have that skill you're able to generate as much money in a week as over the last three months combine so it ends up being these great opportunities as one of the reasons why\nWhenever we have a market crashed there is a new wave of billionaires that come out of it yes billion with a B right billion with a B come out of it and a lotta times they are looked at as a a a not so they looked at with not such a plug in light we could say because\nWhen they made all that money a lot of people were losing money no a lot of people were losing money in there and those are individuals though who look at a down market as a bad thing now these individuals that were turning themselves in for millionaires and billionaires\nThey were looking at a down market as an opportunity they have that skill set they had that knowledge they knew how to approach that down market\nSo to think about a job if you had a job where you got laid off one third of the time that wouldn't be a very consistent stream of income but a lot of times with the Bush biased with only making money is the markets are going up that's kind of situation our income in retirement accounts or in if we are reliant on just one simple direction the markets go up down or sideways\nAnd if we only make money when the market goes up well there's two thirds of the time two thirds of the direction\nWhere where especially laid off or we're not allowed to go to work and so that's one of the reasons why\nIt's very difficult to follow kind of that classic just simple bullish biased and have consistent growth you look over the last nine ten years we've had this great bullish move\nBut how much opportunity has been lost on those down opportunities how much opportunity was given back in two thousand eight when the market crashed and if we don't have that skill set going forward this could be the beginning of this next big downturn\nWhere we could give back fifty or sixty percent of our retirement account how 'bout instead of that instead of going through that process again how about we understand how to make money of the market going down we start doubling up on this stuff\nAbsolutely you know it's funny because one of the things that most people don't understand they strike trading on their own and they make mistakes all the time and here's why the number one mistake most people making their lives when it comes to trading if they want to try it on their own first and then maybe get some educational ... later on well here's the problem that most people don't understand\nFive percent of the wealth right now is being shed\nThe population were Ninety five percent of the wealth is shared by five percent of the people so that means there was five percent of us who have understood the right way to trade how to make money\nAnd what's really scary right now and I talked to a lot of students as I ask them a simple question do you work for more money or just money work for you and most people are working for more money they always believe that they're going to get ahead if they're going to find their freedom and let's face it\nSo called residents are

O. B. right stands for just over broke because if we're just relying on it we are just over broke because if it goes away we're in a world of hurt well in this segment here we want to spend a little bit of time on retirement accounts\nThe markets have been super volatile right we've had ups big us we've had big downs and so what can we do to protect those retirement accounts and whether you're just tuning in maybe your first time was there maybe been with us for the whole show get excited\nThe best is yet to come and Larry whenever I'm Talking with a lot of our listeners sometimes has to be a social media and a lot of them when it comes to retirement accounts are saying number one they're saying they don't have enough money to retire and those that do have enough money to retire\nOr just not quite sure really what they should be doing with it and so what kind of the consolidated message that you can or individual messages whichever direction you'd like to take it\nThat that you and your instructor team early giving to those people who are concerned about their retirement accounts especially with the with the big drop we had in the market the other day\nWell the simple thing I Would share with our audiences the cavalry ain't come and there's nobody is going to protect your capital better than you can right now in the way to do that with education\nI mean right now statistically about every ten years the market has corrected we saw fifty percent correction in two thousand or fifty eight percent correction in two thousand eight\nWho's to say we might not see a sixty four sixty seven percent correction in the market and matching your four one K. becoming a one oh one K. and the reason for this is this is the first generation right now that it's been subjected to market fluctuations in your retirement accounts\nThink about it prior you had pensions that was completely outside of the market you're basically boss put aside their profits or payroll to make sure you had a retirement account and right now that's gone away you're completely dependent upon your four O. one K. and here's a scary\nThought Ryan you know I've talked about this all the time\nRight now people have been told and have been doing this pretty\nPretty habitually of putting money into their retirement account every two weeks when they get paid but here's the big problem and I want everyone to listen to this 'cause it's kind of scary right now is that you've been putting money into this market the last three years an all time highs\nNot when the market was low so imagine when there's another correction the first money that's going to come out is the most expensive amount of money that you've been saving towards retirement\nA lot of our students come in they want to learn the right way to be able to preserve capital how to make sure they're in the right funds when they're putting on their traits to be able to maximize\nFor their retirement and well a lot of things that we hear right now is can you see or do you see how this can really help you pretty much preserve capital over the long term\nIt's always buy low so high it has been for a thousand years it will be for another thousand years that that has never changed and that was one of the topics are ahead of my class last night as is the markets don't change the\nMarsh don't change we look at it on a phone instead of looking at it on a on a on a ticker tape but getting print it off right but the market still don't change it's all about by low and it's all about so high\nAnd somewhere along the lines we kinda got distracted from that and I think the average investor is out there investing their money on payday and they plan to sell when they're sixty five and none of that has anything to do with price and so if we're not buying it a low price and we're not selling at a high price\nIt's pretty much impossible forced to make any money now one of the fun things about the markets whether it's your retirement account or whether it's your income account\nIt's it's the same right it's it's all about just identifying a low price and buying and identify a high price and selling\nNow we get kind of caught up in this whole emotional back and forth of maybe stocks that we love her or or or things that we want to be invested in rather than be invested in the right things and and uh there's this guy Dan that uh when it first started trading I I I did a lot of work with Dan he was a great friend ... you know acted as a mentor and many different kinds of aspects\nAnd Dan used to always say you can't live your stocks they're never going to have you back and he would talk about and he had a little story to help you remember it I Want to share it are there but it was just kind of funny ... you'd say you can't let their stocks they're not going to have you back\nAnd think about it if you're invested into a company right now it doesn't matter what it is if you called them up they wouldn't even know who you are right but for some reason we fall in love with potentially invest the end of this company who number one doesn't know who we are number two doesn't care about us they don't care about us at all and honestly why would they write and Larry you're talking about\nYou know taking care of our retirement accounts and how nobody's going to take better care of it than we are\nAnd and it's it is true and the reason\nThat I firmly believe that is because nobody has to live off of our accounts except for us right nobody has to live off of your account except for you\nNobody has to live off of Mike accept for me and so in the end that was kind of courses that can sound nobody cares\nRight there's there's not an institution out there that they that they stay up at night going men I Hope I Hope John and Mary have enough money in their retirement account you know what they say that because they want to make sure they have enough fees being paid to them as long as their monies in their retirement account but every day there's a new\nTwenty two year old that opens a retirement account replaces somebody who is closing their retirement status perpetual\nKind of ... income stream that comes from that anyway so at the same time though we stay up at night right the average person has many sleepless nights over money but how much time as the average person\nSpent getting educated on how to make sure their money is growing re I find the financial markets very interesting because we go to a a car dealership and there's a car salesman there and we really don't take his advice on what we should buy but yet we go to a car dealership\nThat has the uh financial institutions name on the front of it where they're selling mutual funds that we take the cells persons advice to heart we go well he's the professional in the situation\nNow with a lack of education that's kind of where we end up ah falling behind the eight ball and the financial world one of the things that we can do is we can help a few more people out with that because we still got some tickets we can give away let's do it\nRight now we've got to have to a class coming up in your area that the cost of ... ... exactly what it takes to really take control those retirement accounts and have them growing generating more income whether the markets are going up down or sideways now included with your half day class including with your past is going to be our professional insiders kit now this is packed with lessons from some of our top instructors\nThe professional insiders kitten makes it so you can get started right now\nBecause tender twenty when he did a call now and reserved those seats the number is eight eight eight nine nine one eight seven to three that's eight nine nine one eight seven to three if you end up being colors nine or Twenty one sorry about that but his up at free O T H class dot com and see if you could scores of\nPasses there now now Larry still kind of on this retirement check I Know there are a lot of people concerned about growing their retirement how can somebody number one protect against this potential downside but also inside of their retirement account is there a way for them to continue growth as the markets are going down\nAbsolutely a little a lot of our students have figured out they can use other types of leverage assets to actually start accumulating wealth well our stock market isn't a downturn so this great ways that students can protect their wealth they can hedge against it they're learning about options\nAnd that's why they come to this three hour session to understand what's possible in the marketplace I can tell you firsthand talking to our students students like myself and you too we've been waiting ten years for this correction think about that\nMost people are dreading a correction we are\nFrantically waiting for it because it could be one of the best years of our lives a lot of people don't understand that again the markets go down there is an opportunity to make money just as the markets go up so imagine learning a skill right now to preserve your capital where you can lock in profits imagine you did that back in two thousand eight\nAnd you had money sitting in cash waiting to buy those bargain basement prices of stocks when they got back to two thousand nine well this is going to happen again it's been happening over and over again\nBut most people continue to do nothing and wait for something that happened like I said again the cavalry ain't come in\nAnd the reason why so many people are poor P. O. R. it's just they're passing over opportunities repeatedly so all this did right now by spending three hours of your time is help you learn how to preserve more capitals so that you can retire and the lifestyle that you're interested wouldn't that be worth it\nIs is when you're doing everything's pro active when you're proactively investing you're able to be strategic you're able to be logical you're able to be rational and you're able to set things up ahead of time proactive\nThe average kind of trader investor out there is more reactive something happens and they react to it which keeps them in an emotional state and the lesson last night with the class was was all about kind of a mental makeup that we need to have for to to really have consistent income in the market and it's all about being proactive rather than reactive and I also think\nThat that is a point to bring up in this conversation because the pro active side of it is what allows your lifestyle to be whatever you want your lifestyle to be right it's something where you can schedule the market around you rather than schedule in your life around the market you know look Albert Einstein had one of the greatest quotes ever about\nInsanity and you know step initiative insanity is doing the same thing over and over again and expecting a different outcome most people\nLimited very negative comfort zone they fear everything and I get it made people may have tried on their own like I said earlier in the show the number one mistake people do when they first start learning how to trade is they read a book to go on YouTube and they think they can do this on their own without getting educated or coaching\nWell I can tell you it's amazing\nThat what I Believe here is that the average layman can most of the time and it's the only profession you can do this trading where the layman can outperform the professional with some coaching and some education\nSo right now a lot of our students are realizing that the excuses are kind of dwindling I mean and the twenty first century right now as long as you have a laptop and you have an Internet connection and you have a series of simple steps that's really what we teach is a simplified trading system of step by step investment strategy\nTo help define the way that people make money on Wall street there's no excuse not to and Sam side innocent this many times the architect of our core strategy that really what trading is is just to transfer money from people who don't know what they're doing to people who do know what they're doing\nI think that's an important concept to remember because it's not like the money just grows on trees and all of a sudden it shows up in our account right what happens is there's a buyer and seller and there's a transaction that occurs and there's a winner and there's a loser and a lot of times we we forget about that side of the market but the markets are really just a conduit and this is one of the ways I explain it to my classes as\nThe markets are a conduit that just hooks us all together that's really all the market places it's a meet up\nWe all go there to hang out and what do we do that well we buy and sell stocks and people who want to sell stocks show up with their stocks and people who want to buy stocks go there to buy stocks it's just like a farmer's market but at the stock market or commodities market\nBut it's just buyers and sellers and money transfers like a farmer's market when I buy tomatoes money transfers transfers from my account into somebody else's account and it's the same thing in the financial markets and\nLot of times we don't realize that as we're losing somebody else who made the right decision is actually out there making\nAnd they're also living their lives most of us right now with jobs are stressed out we're worried about losing our job especially for the correction comes again\nMost people are just one paycheck away from poverty and so a lot of our students are figuring this out how do I go from being emotional to becoming strategic\nAnd the way they do that is to get the proper education learning how a three hour session can completely change your life and you know why and you know I've talked about this over and over again\nHolidays are coming up it's that time of year again everyone's going to make their resolutions yeah right well that's kind of silly because the resolution is basically your intention to do something in the two biggest ones we hear what I'm going to lose weight\n... them out of ... you know out of out of debt and made our money but the difference here right now is don't just make it a resolution make it a promise to yourself that you're going to figure out a way to get more financially secure\nYeah I remember my grandpa used to say this and I remember hearing somewhere else too but I'm just gonna give him credit for it but he used to always say\nUh the goal without a plan an executed will plan is this is a dream you know go without a plan is a dream and and that's one of the things that we spend a lot of time on an online training academy is that step by step plan that step by step process on how to accomplish the goal because in the end we are we going to come up to the holidays here pretty quick\nAnd all of a sudden everybody's going to plan out their New Year's resolutions and I don't remember all the statistics we went through it back in January on the show but it ends up being something like within four weeks eighty percent of the people have completely given up and I'm not even thought about their New Year's resolution and part of that is there wasn't an executed will plan they didn't know exactly what to do\nTomorrow and the only attributed plan right now is the gyms knowing they're going to start running their commercials in their ...\nAnd they're going to make a killing thirty bucks them up to the gym membership skyrocket but at the same time\nThey putting our our best foot forward and giving us an opportunity to reach that financial goal is critical out there as well and we have to do\nWhat we have to do what it takes to accomplish the Gulf we want to lose a little go wait we've got to spend a little more time on the treadmill\nAnd we want to make a little more money we've got to get those skills and one of the places where we can really start bringing the knowledge that we can work our way up into that skill set is that at one of the half the classes and we've got this tack this stack of tickets is dwindling we must be towards the end of the show but we got a few tickets left we do do they give away let's do it\nRight now I've got to have to class coming up in your area and they have their classes where you'll see exactly what it takes\nTo really live that life that you won't get your money making money and and I would like to see what he got two dollars or two million dollars you'd be able to see exactly what it takes to get that money generating that income that can really sustain that lifestyle that you deserve now include with your passes is going to be a professional insiders kit and this is packed with lessons from some of our top instructors\nLessons on topics like enhanced the retirement strategy how to make money when the market goes down income generation capital preservation crypto currency them much much more the professional inside our kitten makes it so you can get started right now ... century twenty we need you to call now and reserved those seats the number is eight eight eight nine nine one\nEight seven to three and eight and eight nine nine one eight seven to three if you end up being colors nine or Twenty one sorry about that but his up at three O T H class dot com and see if you can scores and passes there\nThey would have some of the other things you guys are working on right now as far as your instructor team to really help people take control their lifestyle help people do the things they want to do\nTo help them get over procrastination Ryan I mean it's amazing how many people spend so much time watching TV procrastinating\nComing up with the reason why they can't do something and what if you only need it to take maybe a third of the time that you're doing right now either procrastinating are watching TV just to learn how to trade and make more money\nSo I asked you to solve the time you ever wondered what your life would be like if you can quit your job or if you could spend more time with your family a lot of our students now are starting to actually make money while they're on vacations I have June\nOne of my students recently and she sent me a postcard from Costa Rica and she said it's great I'm playing golf this has been my dream but I'm also trading on the trip and of course when she came back I asked you trade before after and she went\nBefore of course says you get up early in the morning because the one thing about having an education and being able to trade in any time\nWith an Internet connection that computer is there are several markets to trade it's twenty four hour marketplace right now so the rules have changed and people are finding that they can take back their lives and actually start doing some of the things they want to do as opposed to working for someone else which is what is the required to do of themselves\nYou know there was a there was a book I read a little while ago called the world is flat and it talked about a lot of outsourcing in a different kind of business strategies but it talks a lot about technology and how technology has really kind of level are made the playing field\nA very level and it makes a it makes it difficult on some businesses to be competitive and it makes it easier on other businesses to get going and that's very true inside of the markets because with the with the Internet connections that we have with the data streams that we have ... it really is this this this market place where it doesn't matter what your background is\nIt doesn't matter where you from it doesn't matter even how much money really you're getting started with\nEverybody has access to the same information inside of the markets and so it doesn't matter where we come from it only matters where we're going in that we stay focused\nKind of on that go hand in that we do everything necessary to accomplish it and that's kind of that great it's that great relief point where you you get to a point in life when you go you know what\nI can do whatever I whatever I wanted to I don't have to go and do this I can

intermediate range nuclear forces treaty with Russia and says Russia is not living up to the agreement\nRight and one of the interesting things Glen is that I Am dedicated my career to analyzing police shootings but I don't get involved until months after they occurred and I'm looking at a situation from the perspective of reading a police report or looking at photographs the officers that are actually in these situations are dealing with something very different\nAnd they're in there and a lot of times they don't understand the acute stressors that they're going to be presented with and I have to make quick decisions yet some officers seemed to always do the right thing and by the right thing I mean they don't shoot unarmed people they don't shoot individuals that are running away from\nYet some other officers do and again if my phone rings it's usually because it was on some level or a shooting that someone has determined has got some problems typically\nAn armed individual along those fact parents we hear that the person was reaching for the waistband or I thought that they were armed with with a weapon and and they turned out not to be have you been able to determine why it is that some officers seem to get involved in these situations while others do there's really no\nWay to there's no way to pick that out because of the variability of human beings and some people will have a greater ability to just naturally deal with stress and make decisions under stress some people will have a much more difficult time doing now\nIs there any way you can test for down there is psychological or is there any test with any letters behind it that will allow us to be able to figure out how the person's going to react when they're in a certain situation\nNo and that's and that's unfortunate because what we do is when we hire and we're looking at somebody we are actually makes me hiring them according to the curriculum or the criteria put forth by the state do not have a felony can they do this have you done this um\nThey pass a background they tell the truth none of those diagnostic test that even in this in the uh the site that they have to take\nWill tell us whether or not they're going to be a good police officer or make good decisions now if you think about this we're looking at their past right\nWe're looking at how they dealt with stress as a high school student or is in college or something well but they didn't have the authority of a police officer they didn't have the the experiences of police officers and they didn't have those things\nAnd you know Abraham Lincoln said he wanted to test a man's character you don't give him diversity you give him power\nPower and and that's a very interesting concept because a lot of what percentage HTs categorical uses of force someone has disobeyed a police officer it sounds simple\nBut someone has said no or someone they might be dealing with the effects of a narcotic or mental illness or both but they're not doing what the officer tells them to do now under those situations we have a critical component which is a lot of people use the word the escalation is the officer going to with his words or his actions cause the stress level to go up cause the anxiety level to go up\nCause of panic level to go up or is the officer through his words and actions and demeanor going to cause it to go down going to cause it to de escalate\nAnd one of the things that's so interesting about the work that you've done is you actually are able to get into\nThe physiological things that are happening with an officer under these circumstances the psychological stressors that are happening I don't get involved until later I don't get involved until something bad is what is it specifically about the work that you do that has enabled you to isolate these factors as contributing to uses of force that could have otherwise been avoided\nWell there's there's a great deal of research out there that has nothing to do with law enforcement or specifically\nThere are elements of science that we don't particularly look yet there are social sciences and social studies that we don't really pay attention to him in one of the um one of the issues are one of the areas of research is emotional labor\nEmotional late or emotional labor it's it's when we're talking to somebody it's putting forth um one attitude why you feel something else in in police work we have to do that we can't take on everybody's emotional strain and you know we can't feel that deeply because he he would never have\nCaught and you're going to come across a lot of difficult personality must face absolutely different I mean if you're like for example a flight attendant a flight attendant is going to deal with difficult people\nIn a situation where no one can get away repeatedly but you've never seem to see them get flustered you never seem to see them get upset and I've been told that it has to do a lot with the fact that they have caused these kinds of de escalation techniques or\nEmotional labor or that they somehow mastered the ability to take a situation that is unpredictable and potentially stressful and be a calming influence under those circumstances\nWell it's a good comparison because they they do the same things apps and the you know incarcerating people arresting people things like that\nBut they have to deal with that and and the emotional labor research is is really is for retail thing customer service and we're starting to move toward the service\nSociety now absolutely we have to be able to deal with people that are difficult we have to be able to deal with people and bizarre situations I'm with the emotional labor though we it's a situation where we do it very superficially we not our heads and say well I feel for you and then we move on\nThe problem with that is it creates other problems within the officer there are more long term and that's where the chronic stress comes in\nAnd we're going to talk about some of these issues in the context of an actual cases when we return uh we are KBC seven Ninety talk radio you're listening to the nation

A. B. C.\n\nWe are KBC seven Ninety or listening to a nation divided I Am Brian Dunne here with commander Glenn Hamas\nThere's been so much emphasis on so much talk about issues regarding police accountability issues regarding excessive force but rarely a voice comes along that looks at the situation in terms of\nPerhaps we shouldn't be here and the first place perhaps the way that we should approach field contacts with suspects\nIs to try to get it so that there is not even the need for force and if there is no need for force than we can effectively accomplish our role we can apprehend suspect we can go home to our families and nobody has to get hurt we have in the studio one of the pioneering voices on exactly this type of approach to law enforcement I Know that it hasn't been easy for you\nBut what I'd like to talk about Mr Glenn Hamas is that you became S. H. A. S. folks uh you became commander of a police force and casino city and you had developed a curriculum and actual course curriculum that talks about concepts that may be typically a foreign to the ... the consciousness of law enforcement\nConcepts such as empathy or concepts such as listening as opposed to taking action concepts such as modifying one's voice mannerisms to de escalate the level of anxiety\nTell us what happened when you became the one that was in charge and how your reactions changed as it relates to the community's response to your police force\nWell in about two thousand eight um we saw our use of force staff there always probably about the same year and you're out there they might between thirty to forty maybe a little bit over depending categorical uses force categorical uses\nFor relations I mean that's something serious that's something where somebody got hurt a weapon was accused um perhaps the shot may have been fired but it's something different than just to get on the ground kind of think he'd gone\nExactly and and it could be pepper spray or ... or any of those things but um\nBut we had an idea of what is it that we can do to try to reduce some of these and so we broke it down and we we categorize the types of force and then we broke that down into other categories and said which one of these can we address and ultimately you can't really go out and say this to especially to cops because I think that you're\nAttacking them and their ... their ability to protect insurance not where we were doing we were trying to actually protect them by giving them other options and showing them that there is a more efficient way\nOne of the things that's so interesting is that it actually protects them it protects the officer keep going\nAbsolutely um so what we did is we slowly started instituting some things and positive feedback and basically what we did was we started encouraging the problem solving\nFor officers all started in ... we we started kind of patting him on the back of the times that they could've used force and they decided to wait talk a little bit more great point and those are the discretionary uses of force the ones that that had to be immediate we didn't really deal with because those you have to protect yourself and you have to be able to do that\nSo ah two thousand Thirteen a local paper out there um they ran as a study and everybody's uses of force were pretty much the same ours went from I think it was thirty eight and two thousand Seventy thousand eight don't\nThree and two thousand Thirteen\nFrom thirty to three right okay I I don't want to do the math but that is a several hundred percent reduction right how do you think specifically what Utah was able to trickle down to the rank and file police officers because you can't be there when they have these contacts well how how were you able to to change the way that they approach the situation\nWell I think what we did that really worked out is that we we told them it's OK to try something else it's okay to talk to people it's okay to do this and we were battling this kind of institutional need to be a warrior and there's a time when you have to be a warrior but being a warrior and a time when you shouldn't be is problematic\nAnd that is such a great point I'll tell you why on almost any profession you're going to have quality control measures you're going to have\nA you're going to have to change the way you're doing things if it doesn't work we've talked about flight attendants you can talk about really anything you can talk about attorneys who can talk about psychologist therapist\nOr doctors any profession you're gonna have to revamp your way of looking at the world if it's not working\nFor some reason the law enforcement doesn't fall into that category law enforcement it's very hard to penetrate that the inertia\nOf years and years and years of of entrenched thanking us against them\nThinking or thinking of it that that this is a this is a very brutal world we have to get onto our families and there's a way of doing this and that's if some people get their heads cracked along the line that's just the way it works your challenging that you're you're saying now that doesn't have to have you got to be at some point running against some resistance from the brass\n[laughter] yes that's absolutely at the time do we did we had a chief that they're valued that and let us kind of run with it and see where it came out well in the newspaper came out in the the statistics were what they were then obviously he was in a very good light right or is there resistance yes there always will be but I think what happens\nNow is that we're at least where his changing in such a way that you know whether that's because of video it's because of the ability to share that video around the world [noise]\nThings are changing so quickly in the industry is not when you said well you'd have cracked heads and do these things ... years ago that might have worked back then but that's not going to work anymore\nAnd I think we're ... don't they could ever has really worked but [laughter] but it out they always word for it it's not in the shadows anymore\nRight right so now you go on YouTube and you can destroy departments reputation with one Fifteen seconds video excellent point but you can also and there's some very good videos out there that we kind of overlook is there some very good videos of good police work where you just shake your head and you go\nAnd that's the point where no one pays attention to good police work I had never makes headlines anymore when they actually solve a very difficult I've seen one or one new show where a good guy was getting ready to he was going to jump over a bridge or something and they formulate a planet brought him off the bridge\nAnd they actually hoist them it was amazing police work and I was just so happy that the local news at the news outlet chose to say something good and give them kudos because this is a type of thing that you know the you know right and if you only focus on what's bad if you only focus on bad shootings if only focus on\nOn the kinds of things that have got to you know build walls and between the community law enforcement what result do you expect or I can tell you what\n... what result you get as you get a lack of police legitimacy and that happened I Ferguson and people look at that and until they really look into what happened in Ferguson they just see it as like using us versus them and even as I was referring\nTo for the for our listeners he's referring to a very high profile shootings unfair to send them to leave it was Missouri an individual that was fired upon an armed after a very brief confrontation with law enforcement but it resulted in an awful lot of national attention being drawn to these issues right\nAnd now we can look at that very superficially or we can go in and look at the report on what Ferguson did over years and years and years with their court systems and to the citizens and you can almost watch the police legitimacy in that town just degrade degraded degrade and\nAnd I have always analyze that in terms of\nThe frenetic energy that happens when there's yelling and they are literally asking themselves up in that ... the proceeds to shooting the driver of the car is so incredibly drunk that she cannot understand what's happening but his crime as drunk driving\nAnd so you have a situation where the car was effectively contained it wasn't going anywhere they had box demand but this shooting just erupted now you've talked about the fact that yelling and just for lack of a better word panic\nEnergy the energy that makes the anxiety level rise that it's contagious and it actually has psychological and physiological consequences can talk about that for a minute and the context of war we just saw\nIn a situation like this there's nobody that's not going to have some type of stress right okay so we talk about stress arousal ... and what happens is you have a part of your brain that is always active and it's always looking for threats it's part of our dilution\nAnd it actually bypass as other parts of your brain in order to stay active and it does that again for your survival right it's an amazing component to or another amazing component which is our brain so what it'll do is once the once their stress okay and it's a state of arousal\nIt will create a situation where a this stress hormone is released and that will give you the best chance of survival rate increases your ability to see when\nThey looked into our DNA for when we were running from like woolly mammoths them like saber toothed tigers at stuff right\nExactly exactly right but the problem is there's a point where it's diminishing returns it actually works against us and there was an actual law there is a year he's nine dots and law that says where it will progressed to a certain point and then it will actually work against us diminishing this is this is how much this this has been studied\nSo in a situation like this and you know the officers can ignore the direction that can comment they can fire to ramp data\nI didn't want to I just want to isolate that because you just nailed twenty five years of my life is but I can comment or they can fire it up I don't think I've ever heard it said more succinctly bring bring\nBring well I'm going to follow up with this saying that in in some cases when they get to a point they don't have the control to really\nMake those decisions to be going to be on the phone and overturn exactly and in there and the physiological effects of that stress hormone is now pushing out and it's actually difficult to problem solve or to think they're relying on kind of the repetition the training the yelling stop the car stop the car and that's unfortunate unfortunate for the\nOffice of blend cannot solve problems and things like it would before after this point of no return\nExactly okay you're going so and and this this is our research that's that's already out there so um you have a situation where you have less ability to make cognitive choices right right\nAnd now you're just kind of running on auto pilot bright and perhaps the path he went down isn't the best path maybe you don't realize that you're ... or you have the person bucks maybe you don't realize that there are other alternatives\nWe weren't in the path of the car the thing is and we looked at the police reports after and they said that the other car with what was going to run 'em over but they were well outside the path that vehicle it was completely logical way and I were completely say\nHere's you know here's I Will have to say this and you might not like this part of it part of that physiological response from the system", "show_name": "The Drive Home With Jillian Barberie & John Phillips", "station": "KABC", "day": "20", "state": "CA",
