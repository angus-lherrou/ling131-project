theater and Victor bill and they were leaving and it gets pitch black column in the desert freaked out already walking to their car by themselves off at yeah and she said it was the one of the scariest things that she's ever gone through\nOh my God that was just saying the member remembering what he did in his lifetime 'cause you can sit here and go on eighty nine year old man was attacked in his wheelchair this guy was bum Rudolf killed a lot of people killed a lot of people in was merciless about it and and so you know it is what it is\nAnd if you're wondering if there was any doubt as to who did it according to TMZ surveillance cameras captured the for inmates walking into Bolger cell and walking out with their clothes bloodied okay I have a question how by the way was not caught on video\nHow long does it take for an attack like that to happen and we're the guards do they just turn a blind eye to this because they know what's coming like there's a whole hierarchy in prison where they sometimes let things happen\nYeah sometimes the guards are working with the mob strike because they're fine with the head\nLet's bring in an expert to talk about this\nLet's bring in Jeff Schumacher who's the senior director of content of the mob museum in Las Vegas is a mob easy and how can I haven't been there there we we were invited to go down there by the mayor remember the guy has not been let's go we need to go yeah thanks so much for joining us\nHey thanks for having me on jak from\nWe live for them I mean I I you know we I we do and and and just like the whole beginnings and Meyer Lenski and Vegas but we hear about the Irish Mob and ... this it's brutal it's is brutal as\nAs the Italian mob ... tell us about Whitey Bolger and in dealings with the Italian mob to write it wasn't just said I'm\nAn Irish mobster\nRight well you know he he came up in the south Boston you know what they call south the right\nThis was a pretty tough neighborhood\nAnd so even when he was real young he was a you know involved in crime really from the from being a ... at a very young age and a ... was convicted in the fifties a bank robberies and went to Alcatraz Susan Alcatraz prison for several years well he gets out of prison in the early sixties and he then\nUh proceeds to get involved with more sophisticated organized crime Irish you know organized crime groups in Boston multiple early in the late the late seventies he becomes the boss she is the top man\nAnd the Irish Mob up in Boston and I'm from there is reign of terror begins and you know you mentioned earlier that he's killed a lot of people when he was a tried and in two thousand\nThirteen at the court or he was accused of Nineteen murders and I think that really are those are just a Nineteen that that\nProsecutors new you know men to him I think there were more and you know he was also there was also a guy who often buried as victims so he yeah he did not live but I mean he would bury them so they could out so really are in those cases you're depriving the family\nEven though the barriers are there to mammoth also kill women which is not so that\nThat's what I wanted to and specific ... it's a very rare thing with with usually with the time on them and they'll say you know women know kids and they have a hierarchy and you know people like John Gotti sometimes go astray and kill the cost of London's but usually it's\nA whole hierarchy what's it like I mean and this is a movie if I'm not mistaken Robert Deniro is going to be playing him is that correct\n[noise] well I'm not sure you know I think the one you're thinking of is called the Irish or which is going to be about a guy who who claimed on his desk that he killed Jimmy Hoffa\nDown and think okay this is a different outlook I suggest you tell us a little bit\nAbout oh I cannot wait I'm\nA little bit about a ... Whitey Bolger what makes him so different and and and some more ruthless because he killed women I remember that the story I think he killed a couple of women didn't name\nYes and and you know it the thing about why do you think he was one of these guys who for whom power was intoxicated and you know but he was the boss and he also a ... unlike a lot of other my bosses in history\nHe committed a lot of the murders himself you know he didn't just passes on to somebody else he's like no I'll I'll take care of it things\nAnd I mean he's I don't know if he enjoyed it but the point is that he was he wanted to be participating in these murders and you know it was just a lotta times\nWith him you know it was about business like a lot of things are you know you're there you know on\nEarth in some way or you're causing a problem for him as a businessman but in other cases it was personal was Bolger\nAnd I think he developed a really a fearsome reputation in Boston ah it wasn't really widely known around the country and tell after a flood and let it went on the lam in the early I\nTalk to us about that because he was on the lam for a long period of time but he did have a relationship at one point in time with the FBI\nYeah [noise] yeah and this is this is probably what led to his murder of the other day so in the\nIn the mid seventies or an FBI agent who also had grown up in South Boston and who was an acquaintance of Whitey Bulger's as children gave him an FBI agent he then are convinced Whitey Bolger to become an informant for the FBI\nAnd Bulger's argument all onto his death he always claimed that he wasn't a rat and the reason he claimed that is he said he cooperated with the FBI but and he never told them that are sitting in Port that was his argument\nAnd his brother was a big time politicians they're right he was president pro tem of the of the state Senate in the state of Massachusetts though I Would imagine that if the government favors minded the FBI to to maybe give them a path ... giving them information that wasn't any good or wasn't that important\nHe had the political connections to get that done\nIt and of course Bolger would claim that he never involved his brother William in any of his criminal activities and and you know there was a lot of accusations over the years that\nThat a bill Bolger William balls or his brother had been tainted in some way by by his brother Whitey but I'm\nA prosecutor's investigators could never put the two together are involved in any crime and so that's why William Bolger a joy to instill a joy look very you know a ... career has been very successful why do you though as an informed that he would often give\nThe FBI tips about Italian Mafia because that's what the FBI was really interested that unfortunately the FBI was allowing and protecting Whitey as he committed all these horrible crimes and they weren't prosecuting him\nSo the brother is still alive he's got to be thinking wow you know my brother you know died pretty violently and in a brutal way but in the back of his head he's also got to realize that that's how Whitey lived why did he come Whitey as it 'cause he was white is Irish as it did was his parent where his parents born in Ireland what's and what's his real name\nWell his name is\nJames or Jim uh but as a young man yet you know like a lot of people do it very blond hair as a young boy and so he got that nickname Whitey from the color of his hair okay um yeah but uh uh a lot of people called in Jimmer James or as well as why do we know him as white Haley laws ... and the\nWhole you know his his\nGirlfriend 'cause she essentially I think was the reason that he went down and they I I if I'm not mistaken I can be wrong\nYeah well they live you know as you know they they lived in an apartment in Santa Monica for a good long time I rent controlled apartment amazing\nWhen you reach so they portray themselves as retirees\nFrom Chicago and they would walk in straw was their dog and they would just have a good time meeting the neighbors and whatnot somehow nobody recognize the guy for years wow I'm however [noise] um you mentioned earlier that America's most wanted they would out this television show and they would broadcast\nPictures and they broadcast a picture of what they thought why the balls or would look like an old ray wow a woman a woman who\nUm [noise] it was an acquaintance of his girlfriend Catherine agree this woman was and I can't pronounce your name 'cause she's from Iceland is you know how that name dream but she was she was miss Iceland at one point well she looks at a picture on TV says oh my God that's that guy I've met\nAnd so she contacts the FBI and a away we go and they ended up getting a captured in two thousand eleven\nNow talk to us about what went on in prison because this guy was was tried he was convicted yeah he was sentenced to prison and then he was during the pot and prison causing problems which caused them to to change his facility what what exactly was he doing behind bars that got him in trouble\n[laughter] yeah so I'm I'm actually a let me say a couple of things about that first of all he spent most\nOf the time in a sense too that was eleven when he was a it was first put in jail in two thousand and he was convicted in two thousand Thirteen from tips are two thousand Thirteen to the president most of that time he was in a prison in Florida\n[noise] and and for most of that time in prison he was not causing problems as far as I Know in fact he was in a lot of letter writing back and forth with people and we actually have some of those letters in our possession oh museum\nAnd we have another a friend of the museum has ... was in regular correspondence with Bolger for for a number of years well anyway\nSo a ... little from that Florida prison allegedly because he threatened to guard I Believe that's the that's\nThe only way we're doing yeah necessarily here here is a is an eighty nine year old guy in a wheelchair guards is like started actually afraid ... it was\n\n\n\nIn the morning TV news the best hot restore tells you usually have a new host OJ LA all visual
