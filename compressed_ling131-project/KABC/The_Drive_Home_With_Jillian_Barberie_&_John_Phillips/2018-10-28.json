{"content": "If you instead find music like we're not going to be slaves forever and we were not born is saved the music that's clustered around the book of exodus go down Moses tell oh pharaoh to let my people go that theme is a major theme\nIn the literature songs like that and I'll go down Moses is the one that I\nLearned as a child you see but there are many other pieces of that literature so they did not come in large measure to the horror\nOf slavery but they sang music that said we are not slaves we our children of God yes and so there are a lot of fight songs I if I could do it over again I wouldn't mind doing research on what would the fight songs out of that\nPeriod the seventeenth century Eighteen century nineteenth century I Know the steel away to Jesus was a fight song because I've found it in my readings and at least three or four different places in the south east word slave saying it\nBut if the kind of fighting without weapons and without people getting a\n... fighting with soul escaping the sole intact\nThe spirit intact and the character intact\nAnd making certain that they kept alive the notion that we are children of the universe we've been created by God and so this slavery has to be temporary and that's\nOne of the reasons why the underground railroad was such a massive undertaking and it's one of the reasons why the plantation owners pushed to Second Amendment in the\nConstitution of the conventions because that gave them the power to chase after\nEscaping slaves to formed militias to go after slaves\nBut the point I Want to make is that that huge treasury of poetry and song represents a language of transcendence and ate treasury about the spirit and the mind and how human life can overcome massive\nCruelty and torture and circumstances so there are in the biographies therefore out of the nineteenth century many examples\nOf slaves and former slaves who are used the more familiar language who in a moment of hostility turn the other cheek\nSo I Will accept that you may not have been the first one around the track yes but you certainly picked up the baton\nWell I Do admit I Will admit without eagles is that\nI was one of the handful of people who in studying this phenomena of non violence historically and otherwise that I recognize its potential for allowing the United states to be an experiment in we hold these truths to be self evident with outgoing to civil war\nNow we sit here all these decades later ... and we read about what you did in history books and we read about what you did as a blueprint for things right\nAt that time if you could just reverse and go back in time when you were there when you were dealing with it when you were in the trenches yeah did you know that you were making history did you know that people would be talking about what you were doing for the next notes generations and generations to come in\nIn fact I did not that wasn't my direction my direction as being on the right side of history and seeing how we can make Jim crew law practice and as I look back upon it I realized that we were making history and that's fine but at least I don't remember having that streak of thought in my consciousness\nAnd the reason why that is so fascinating is because we've had this discussion of law and we're not always aware\nConsciously of what's happening we're not always aware of how we are being used and this isn't such an amazing thing because things that start off small turn into things that are judge air and proportion yeah I I say okay that is the universe working through you\nYeah I feel that I Know that I see that I hear that for an example but when I say I did not know what I was doing some of the day I landed in Nashville I was working with the Little Rock nine in Little Rock Arkansas nine\nBlack youngsters wonderful people who had begun the process of desegregation at Central high school who want it the laboratories and the better equipment and the better books or Central High so these are all lies youngsters well what year is this this is Nineteen fifty eight\nPosted around the board of education by the way we did go and keep fifty for his\nShow I had never before counseled a group of young people who were under harassment intimidation and bullying every day seven\nDays a week literally because the clue Klux Klan and the white citizens council from a five state area around Little Rock Missouri\nKentucky Texas Louisiana Mississippi Tennessee were determined to drive those nine students out of school and stop the desegregation in spite of may seventeenth Nineteen fifty four\nAnd in spite of Eisenhower saying to the governor fall of is that you have to enforce the court action it was a unanimous decision that segregated education is unconstitutional\nSo when we come back okay this is the end of the first episode of revenue loss and I were going to have another hour with Reverend Lawson next week\nUm but if you were sleeping you wouldn't call it one of the most important things I just heard was the man that has made more history or that hasn't been responsible for the creation of history just told us that he didn't realize at the time when he was doing that he was creating history when we come back next week\nOr we're going to talk about exactly that history we made it thank you for tuning in ah

emotions in the market and really just ties back to that\nFear and greed you know we hear good news we see something going up we get a little greedy and we over pay for it and then all of a sudden we

few articles and one of them that I stumbled upon was why there are ... it was titled something along the lines of why there are no cell recommendations\nAnd uh this is the thing that was the kind of hit me with that is we have that bullish biased and we've been talking about but it really hit me and it's one of the things I've been talking a lot about in my classes is we really have to recognize that we are customers of Wall Street right and their job is to sell us products they selves mutual funds ...\nAnd they sell us they sell stocks now when you go back through time that they had a broken down in this article where they showed\nWhere they ... they showed that even in the worst financial market conditions the S. and P. five hundred stocks didn't even reach eight ten percent sell recommendation over Ninety percent of all the stocks even during the financial crisis even during the tech boom still had by and or hold recommendations on it and my credit question to you to be\nHow is that how is that a ... uh how is that recommendation\nThat we can trust as far as consumers as far as investors go when we know the market goes down and the only way to make money to buy low and sell high yet there's never a recommendation to sell\nWell not only his Wall Street in the business of making money when they sell you a product or service\nThey basically are also acting as the custodian of your assets and they make most of their money not off transaction fees mulatto people misunderstand how Wall Street really makes money they make money banking your assets when they are the custodian of your assets for instance let's assume you own ten thousand shares of Akron me\nThey have and you give them the right\nTo alone those shares out to third parties are two individuals are institutions that would like to short those shares\nAnd that's where they make their money there is a banking fees that they earn so Wall Street makes most of their money not in what are called ... daily average revenue trades they make their money being the custodian of your assets\nIncluding being custodian of your cash but\nWall Street always want you to be long equities they never I mean rarely I shouldn't say never but they rarely give us cell recommendation\nBecause it's bad PR and you'll notice if you watch most of the financial media out there they have that same message out there that buying hold works\nAnd we have shown data has shown perpetually that buying whole does not work if we're in a bull market buying whole works pretty good until the next bear market comes along and then we're looking at a potential forty to fifty percent haircut on the price of equities\nYeah absolutely and when you look back at the financial institutions they don't own the island of Manhattan because they charge five dollars a trade\nYou know not only are they have the custodians but they also use are investing our investments in our capital as leverage for their own investments so we're like they're collateral that they use right they have a whole lot of buying power out there but it's one of the reasons why they can influence the markets so much\nAs well but we are coming up against a break here John what you say we try to squeeze in one more give away let's do it in just a second you're gonna have a chance to win a set of passes to one of these half day classes switch phones

Jackson from the Santa Barbara area ... and it will amend it it does speak to twenty four and it will and\nThe ... civil rights act which was passed in Nineteen fifty nine I'm to ensure that everyone has equal rights in California and it will include sexual harassment protections by prohibiting harassment and unique business relationship so\nSo this is um [noise] um\nYou know elected officials and lobbyist so I don't know I don't work for lobby and I\nBut we have to work with them the famous true for investors and entrepreneur for directors and actors for producers and filmmakers so again it goes to you know all you know a lot of Hollywood situations where\nPeople have to have to feel they have to do things and if they don't they will they will suffer or have suffered economic watchers to manage or personal injury as a result of it than appropriate conduct so this bill um um\nYou know it causes these interesting and unique relationship there already are laws on the books of course they're prohibit any type of sexual harassment this will now specifically say you know these relationships are now covered under the under civil rights act\nI got it I you know it's interesting because uh I actually invested in a small start up operations in particularly those run by winning and they'll often talk about the difficult position they've been put in some investors so\nNow they all have a cause now of course they could always claim a I uh am I guess a civil action but this gives them a protection and specifically under\nThe sexual assault last I mean how does it really understand ... got Santa going it's ours viability I got it okay which is really important and then of course in Hollywood very important right\nFor a winner any more involved in trying to get roles now we know that even though this didn't exist so people who were\nUh the victims and survivors of course stronger survivors of people like wind she were able to get some reaction and and uh some accountability what was that under how was that different\n[noise] um I Believe has to do with\nThe the study but those are civil cases there there was such limitations I Believe I'm I'm not exactly sure okay how are you know with mhm yeah I Know that but this is this now gives this is now changing the law to say you have of course there that we are now establishing that course for you to be able to\nUm sue under these these unique situations I mean it all comes down to um who can who can impact you through power and influence right and let's take a lot of that ability to do so away from your\nRight exactly and and\nAnd you need to know that that that excessive that that's a possibility now you know you you as a producer can expect someone to to do something I'm a legal or that's harassing and and not have an absolute defined passed now to be able to bring the cause of action\nNow I think it's important to people understand is on both sides though the women as well as the men and who are perpetrators how do you get the word out about something like this new legislation how does that become known to people\nWell you know fortunately or unfortunately there are there fortunately there were a lot of organizations and\nTrade associations that are following what legislation is being passed and the women's groups are are very very connected to one another we I run a lot centers to all the law centers throughout the state um are very connected with those ... organizations and it it is very much an application process right especially because\nInsanity and you know step finish them insanity is doing the same thing over and over again expecting a different outcome most people limited very negative comfort zone they fear everything and I get it made people may have tried on their own like I said earlier in the show the number one mistake people do when they first start learning how to trade\nIs they read a book or go on YouTube and they think they can do this on their own without getting educated or coaching\nWell I can tell you it's amazing\nThat what I Believe here is that the average layman can most of the time is the only profession you can do this\nTrading where the layman can outperform the professional with some coaching and some education\nSo right now a lot of our students are realizing that the excuses are kind of dwindling I mean in the twenty first century right now as long as you have a laptop and you have an Internet connection and you have a series of simple steps that's really what we teach is a simplified trading system of step by step investment strategy\nTo help define the way that people make money on Wall street there's no excuse not to and Sam side innocent this many times the architect of our core strategy that really what trading is is just to transfer money from people who don't know what they're doing to people who do know what they're doing I think that's an important\nConcept to remember because it's not like the money just grows on trees and all of a sudden it shows up in our account right what happens is there's a buyer and seller\nAnd there's a transaction that occurs and there's a winner and there's a loser and a lot of times we we forget about that side of the market but the markets are really just a conduit and this is one of the ways I explain it to my classes as\nThe markets or a conduit that just hooks us all together that's really all the marketplace it it's a meet up\nWe all go there to hang out and what do we do there well we buy and sell stocks and people who want to sell stocks\nShow up with their stocks and people who want to buy stocks go there to buy stocks it's just like a farmer's market but at the stock market or commodities market but it's just buyers and sellers and money transfers like a farmer's market when I buy tomatoes money transfers transfers from my account into somebody else's account and it's the same thing in the financial markets and a lot of times we don't realize that\nAs we're losing somebody else who made the right decision is actually out there making\nYeah and they're also living their lives most of us right now with jobs are stressed out we're worried about losing our job especially for the correction comes again\nMost people are just one paycheck away from poverty and so a lot of our students are figuring out how do I go from being emotional to becoming strategic and the way they do that is to get the proper education learning how a three hour session can completely change your life and you know Ryan you know I've talked about this over and over again\nHolidays are coming up at that time of year again\nEveryone's going to make their resolutions yeah right well that's kind of silly because the resolution is basically your intention to do something and the two biggest ones we hear what\nI'm going to lose weight this year Meg Ramadan I'm Out of out of out of debt and made our money but the difference here right now is don't just make it a resolution make it a promise to yourself that you're going to figure out a way to get more financially secure\nYeah I remember my grandpa used to say this and I remember hearing that somewhere else too but I'm just gonna give him credit for it but he used to always say\nUh the goal without a plan an executed will plan is this is a dream you know go without a plan is a dream and and that's one of the things that we spend a lot of time on an online training academy is that step by step plan that step by step process on how to accomplish the goal because in the end we are we going to come up to the holidays here pretty quick\nAnd all of a sudden everybody is going to plan out their New Year's resolutions I don't remember all the statistics we went through it back in January on the show but it ended up being something like within four weeks eighty percent of the people have completely given up and I'm not even thought about their New Year's resolution and part of that is there wasn't an executed will plan\nThey didn't know exactly what to do tomorrow\nAnd the only attributed plan right now is the gyms knowing they're going to start running their commercials in there and you know\n... and they're going to make a killing thirty bucks a month but at the gym memberships skyrocket but at the same time that putting our our best foot\nAnd giving us an opportunity to reach that financial goal is critical out there as well and we have to do what we have to do what it takes to accomplish the Gulf we want to lose a little weight we got to spend a little more time on the treadmill\nIf we want to make a little more money we've got to get those skills and one of the places where we can really start bringing the knowledge that we

a great option um yeah I I have a garage\nBut I also was thinking if I have enough room in the in the back yard for for building is their recommendation of what\nWhat is better is something you know do the permits um ... you know are they different depending on what what you're building converting your garage or or adding something to the back yard and and then what happens if if the law\nYou know is is is rescinded are retracting what happens after the fact when you still have\nA you know something built [noise]\nOkay well wants to end your and so once you have the permits in place that they can't change those and as far as you know can you put this in the garage in the apartment the open planned a one bedroom apartment no can you put a guest house in the back yard all kind of depends what you want to four\nAnd um you're gonna rent it out for income is that correct\nYes that would be you know some passive income\nOkay so we can look at both options and see which one makes

that homeowners have so let's talk to Sandy dunkley our real estate moneymaker she's in Studio today Sandy and our team of design and construction professionals specialize in putting these gas homeless on your property or converting your garage into a living space that you can rent out\nAnd this is all thanks to a new California law that allows homeowners\nTo do this on their property so Sandy you heard the senator yeah and it's an amazing opportunity for homeowners right now to do something now that could produce passive monthly income especially for the rest of their life\nYes and I really applaud California and the Senate ... ... he was very instrumental\nAnd he still is what can dispel the bill has cost guy no question about that but he's making it more streamlined wet it's going to take a lot of the arguments processed out of it with the local government they want to streamline everything to release all the Barry is\nAn impact fees that come aboard to make sure that people can get this done and not a hundred and twenty days to get a permit but now trying to get them done in sixty days and if they don't do that\nThe cities are going to be accountable to the states and the state is going to take precedence over the city and tons of those you know I'm situations that might occur\nWhen it's taken so long when dragging out to get the permits with the city's because\nSome cities that make any kind of difficult but this is a state federal and state takes precedence over the cities you know trying to do these types of things and senator or ... is going to make sure that makes a lot of sense for homeowners to rent the place and they can absolutely meant these out\nFor money and they're going to also includes basements and some people that were basements that they're not doing anything with basements now we can have a basement\nAt the living space because his space that you know in New York City that people have basements to income and in California and some cities and California have basements so\nWe're gonna make it streamlined and so I'm very excited about what's happening in two thousand Nineteen because things are going to be a lot easier for these ... and ... you know people that are doing this as so many people\nHave called me and I've actually talked to them on the phone I've got to meet them casually with sat down had a cup of tea you know without pinky fingers out\nIn an English to teach you know I was like oh I never refuse a nice ... but in all honesty we've gone out there's a chance to win that called me in tyrants his father had early on you know case of ...\nAnd I'll assignments and he said you know what I was thinking about putting him into a nursing home and he said I Hope this show and I thought to myself if I can come but this garage into a\nPlace for him to be comfortable you know a the a compliant with the we'll check and go through\nAnd half a cake ever come in to take care of him that's going to cost him so much less\nThan if he were to pay ten thousand it's up to fourteen thousand dollars a month was nuts and homes that expensive\nSo he decided to do this conversion and have someone coming in and more importantly\nHe's right that does seem every day to make sure that he's taking cash because I've heard horror stories about some of these places there's some great ones out there and there's some that you put horror stories about you know taking the ... ... people and I don't my head that type of ethnic people people by the way\nAnd we all do and I think of so many people are concerned about what they do with her older family members so here's some options if you're interested in putting the guest house on your property\nOr converting your garage into a living space\nImagine moving a family member closer to you so you don't have to necessarily put them in senior living or in a nursing home another idea is build your dream guest house\nRight now on your property so so this new California law and then have it exactly the way you would like it so you now have the option to move into it later in life and then if you move into the smaller property then you could rent out your larger existing home\nFor maybe three four or five thousand dollars a month now think about that you're moving into a place that you design for yourself later in life\nAnd then you're using your existing property to generate income on a monthly basis that's called living the dream look\nThat's living the dream life because that's what it's all about if you're not living the dream life you need to and we can help you to do that and that brings me to another story a gentleman he called me he's in the south bay and he said you know Sandy I Lived in the house to like Thirty years I mean thirty five if my kids have gone\nAnd you know his wife as she passed away the last five years and he's just he said almost some of the rooms he hasn't even touch them still in touch anything you know 'cause he's kinda depressed now and he's you know but he wants to get along with his life and he goes to the gym every day still works out so he said if I was able to convince my garage into something that I\nLiked you know that would enable me to move in there\nAnd also he has a reverse mortgage so he's not even I'm making any payments every month he's really struck still the money because he has like you know roughly twelve hundred dollars coming in from says trips he doesn't have a mortgage payment but it's still not enough for him so he said if I'm able to tap this main house pull a little bit ... out of my home\nAnd moving to this new construct area that I'm gonna make how I Want to eat left the ... by the way when he comes from the gym\nAnd then that would give him more income to feel more comfortable because even though he doesn't have a mortgage he's still strapped to income and he said you know what I don't want to\nHave this happened to me when I'm getting old days audio no senior guy but he wants to be able to make a little bit more money and that brings me to when you look at I being in the banking industry for years and I found that\nPeople have less than ten thousand dollars saved up in the bank account 'cause I'm looking at you know documents all day long and I'm like how they can manage when they retire they're\nPushing you know retirement age like baby boom as we know that ten thousand people tend to sixty five years of age on a daily basis of what we called the baby boom as how are you going to manage with this you know small amount of money and they're living paycheck to paycheck you maybe you get another job at the job of false job a second job\nThat this is what the rents going for you did this\nBut this is what we can do and I can come out and sit with you and we can go openings in more detail\nBut when I go out we kind of see what design they want and the flaw pan and we'll let them know that this is a separate address its self sustainable from the main house and you have your privacy and not going to have any encroachment with the neighbors we can put a call ... so they can feel more secure with the you know the opposite official tough\nAnd then you walk in the ... we have to shake a cabinet so white cabinets we have the you know the granite countertops it could be the courts\nOpen plan we have that nice engineer with flaws that looked really pizza pulled their very terrible but also tankers ... has a ... ... and everything is soundproof\nAs a one hour firewall between the ... everything's energy efficient with title twenty four and like I said it has its own separate address\nAnd whatever they want like a terrorist saw him you know anything nice like some garages have kept the chill ceiling those are really nice when you walk in and see like open plan so we can keep those and the ... utilities all said that\nSo what about this person wants we can make it work for them\nWe measure up when we come out the design of comes out with me in some cases some cases I go out and and you know take pictures and\nYou know you know did all the measurements and then I get that information to the designer and then he knows what he's doing but he'll actually do a lot that did damaging says well before he goes out and then when everybody decides you know this is what we want to do want to move forward then we'll you know did the joints and everybody will have proof\nThat home and it was say at this is what I Want but can you move the window on this side maybe um can you make that that\nThat you moved to this side can you make that bought them on this side and then they kind of sweet cats but it's a space that's brand new and every square footage utilizing so because John it's one of these brand new space say it's ... it's actually you know you can receive top dollar than men so I mean some people have received in twenty five hundred dollars a month\nSome people have received in three thousand dollars a month depending on whether they are then this other sort of the than anywhere from twelve hundred said Fifteen hundred Seventeen hundred so all depends\nAnd I'll tell you what you can obtain from cannot this space but like hell let's say every week it reminds me of the ... the policy that will tell because this faces brand new it's not like a thirty forty year old built in ... you know had maybe like five or ten tenants it's brand new and it looks nice and you wouldn't mind moving into yourself John\nAnd I think that's the key is to design the guest house the way you would like it or if you're going to convert your garage so now you have the option leader life to move into\nThe smaller unit and then rent out the existing larger\nProperty for maybe three or four or five thousand dollars a month so imagine using your home as an income source as you get older and most people take a pay cut as they get older when they only collect Social Security but imagine living the dream life right here in Southern California not leaving because you do this one time construction that could generate this passive\nMonthly income for the rest of your life so folks rents are skyrocketing especially here in Southern California so as the rents increase so could your monthly income and that's why I'm doing this now could really set you up financially\nFor the rest of your life to reach out to Sandy entered designing construction professionals to take a look into having a guest house on your property or converting garage into a living space that you can rent out here ... number eight

cents and then we can put their living space in the Bakken up front could be the you know ... open pan in the kitchen ... so\nIt makes a lot of sense and also the value of your property will increase by doing this by the way because now you have more\nLiving space like for example if it's you know I used to ... because if the garage is four hundred square feet wet hand them off you know side by side to talk of Iraq but it's now and living space and the price ... areas four hundred dollars\nAnd four hundred square feet that increase the value to a hundred and sixty thousand dollars so you know if that isn't that need something that you can rent ... later on off your kid is gone\nAnd on and you can get that income and more so if you wanted to move out of your main home and make I don't know if you're alone or whatever the case says that he could move into that space you can make it nice when you south and ... the main house the costs more money and I can tell you what you can obtain from ... in the area that you'll end\nAlthough you very much into oh no problem I thought to meet you I mean we can get this done about can be quickly by the time you get it in place now in two

thousands of people gathered at the six Presbyterian Church where an interfaith service remembering the eleven people killed in the tree of life synagogue among those speaking was Israel's minister of education and diaspora fares Naftali Bennett\nIs a loss of thirty seven percent okay so it's an average now two thousand and eight the S. and P. went down to fifty seven percent and Y. two K. it went down forty nine percent so those were bigger than average so but let's just go with the average thirty seven percent\nSo I'm gonna ask you a question which I'll answer later on in the show but I kind of leave it with you a and the question is if you if you had to of course you don't want to but if you had to\nWould you prefer to lose thirty seven percent of your money at age sixty\nOr at age Seventy five\nWhich one do you think would be better age sixty or Seventy five and a if you answer like most people do you got it wrong [laughter]\nSo so we'll talk about that now you know what jak most shows would actually stopped there that's a ... show that his chalk\nAll of great in though right and so most shows are just stop there but on the show do we only go where people expect us to of course we don't we boldly go where no financial show has gone before and therefore at about ten till we're going to have our state tip of the week\nAnd normally that's you know that's part of the show we talk about how to pass onto your greedy and washed undeserving airs the fruits of your labor but\nThis week we're going to talk about how to educate your greedy and washed undeserving heirs and so we're going to talk about paying for college and not having to pay a gift tax okay because the IRS [laughter] [noise]\nYeah those guys they want the tax\nGifts and college in most cases has more is is is expensive\nAnd you don't want to have to pay a gift tax so I Want to dive into everything but I Want to have a quick thing that I Want to share with you um money matters and and my family we are a we think the boys and girls clubs is one is a charity that uh you know really helps young people to it to become\nSolid citizens go to college all those kinds of things contribute to society in a positive way have a better life and so we are a benefactors of that and over the last six years are the boys and girls clubs we've we've sponsored a program that's called a sponsor a child [laughter]\nAnd uh so we want to raise money for that and last weekend we had the gala at a ... in in Plano in North Dallas and uh\nWe raise over three hundred thousand dollars in the sponsor a child which was really phenomenal and now six years of doing that we've raised over two and a half million dollars for the boys and girls clubs\n[noise] and uh it is it is\nIt is really really something it's amazing how\nYou know if you put some energy into something good things can happen well let's talk about two thousand seven um you know are we we have as I mentioned they sell strategy or we don't believe that by and hold is enough that you should also have a cell strategy and it's because the people that we work with primarily are you know wanting that they work their entire life\nYou've you've saved and everything and now you're retired and you're living on that money and you can't you know you've got to preserve it\nAnd so our philosophy is is mostly defensive okay we want to preserve that we have to be able to grow it in the future\nAnd so you know with our by holding cells of philosophy we have certain criteria that says it's time to get out of the stock market and as I record this we haven't reached that yet so don't don't don't panic yet uh but this is very reminiscent to me of two thousand seven\nAnd what I mean by that is that you know one of the things that that kind of happens is that uh I guess I'm I'm human and I want to be a hundred percent accurate whenever we do something\nAnd so what happens is that you know when you get close to yourself signal where you're about to pull the trigger and say okay we're going to get out of the stock market you want to be right you know you don't like being wrong obviously\nA and if you're wrong you know we're in for example in two thousand Fifteen and two thousand eleven our strategy said to sell both of those were very very near to bury markets but they actually missed it by a little bit and where and\nAnd so technically those were you know bad calls if you will but if we had to do it again we would you know the market went down Ninety percent in two thousand eleven so that's not too bad the ... the U.S and pick 'em\nBut be that as it may\nThose two which we call false alarms I was very convicted that that was the right thing I was like yes our strategy is right it's going to kill it we're going to be right this time perfect wonderful I'm Glad we're getting out\nAnd uh those turned out to be near misses or they were close to a bear market but they weren't and the market rebounded quickly after that but in in uh in November of two thousand seven\nWhen that one came I was like oh no I Hope we don't you know I didn't want to sell because it felt like the economy was generally okay it felt like things were generally okay there wasn't a lot of bad news everywhere\nYou know it was the news wasn't great but it wasn't terrible and so I was very feeling now I don't want to you know but of course we did and we we follow or discipline\nUp and then the same thing is how I feel now\nYou know you look at it we just got GDP numbers it looked pretty good you've got a you know the consumers and this and that and generally the the all the indicators tell you things are looking good right now\nBut yet our indicators telling us and we're close to getting ready to sell and I don't want to sell when things are looking good you know I don't want to be wrong but what's interesting is that that's how I felt to two thousand seven and of course are so maybe I have a contrary indicator when I think it's right and wrong and I think it's wrong them right\nOr it's right anyway whatever\nPoint being ladies and gentlemen is that if you are retired or retiring soon do you even have a strategy to protect yourself from the next market crash what if this is the market crash what if we're about to go into a trade war with China which I think we are now I changed my mind I think we're going there\nAnd if that happens we can see the market go down to another two or three thousand points from here or maybe more if it's an average bear market it could go down another seven thousand points from here and are you going to stay in for that do you have a plan to address that if you don't you should be talking to one of our advisors are coming to one of our seminars to learn more about it

are retiring soon and we currently work with over a thousand four hundred families in forty three states we are blessed we are honored\nAnd in two thousand Fifteen Forbes named our financial advisory

all your clients that are listening to the show and those of you who are not yeah there you go as well kissed\nFor those of you are not clients or if you're over fifty if you're retired or retiring soon\nI invite you to go to our website it as money matters dot net money matters dot net and\nWhen you're there we have a everything we can think of to put on the website to help you to plan your retirement okay so go their mind about Social Security estate planning all that kind of stuff\nWell this is the second to the show where I normally talk about Social Security so let's do that so here's a question uh can you enroll in Medicare at sixty five\nRefrain from claiming Social Security until Seventy and still receive delayed credits meaning\nYou know if you wait till you're Seventy\nWhat happens is is that the amount of your benefit goes up each year that you wait by about eight percent so if you're sixty six you wait till Seventy the benefit you're going to receive from Social Security of journals for years goes up about thirty two percent which is a pretty good increase so the question is if I enroll in Medicare at sixty five\nBut I don't collect Social Security I wait till I'm Seventy well I still get those eight percent delayed credits the answer is yes okay so you can take Medicare without Social Security but not the other way around okay if you file for Social Security you must enroll in Medicare part a All right\nSo a second question\n[noise] um this one is a a a a person who has never applied for Social Security and is eighty years old\nAnd he apply for retroactive benefits okay so you never applied you waited Fifteen escapes twenty Fifteen Years okay so if you apply is now well his benefit including adjustment to make up for the last benefits\nAnd the answer is that uh the you can get six months of retroactive benefits but that's all okay so he's not going to be able to go back and get fourteen years' worth but he can get six six six months' worth\nAnd it might come to it could be ten thousand dollars or more you know if you think about it six months at age ... eighty um with all the delayed credits that went to late Seventy\nUm one more question we have time for you okay so ... it's kind of person born in Nineteen fifty to repay his Social Security benefits to ... uh received to date and then re filed to obtain a higher current pay out\nOkay so it's my understanding that uh I can do so but ah I went to the local Social Security office and they said they didn't even understand my question [laughter]\nThat's good so here's the answer if it's been less than twelve months since you filed\nYou can withdraw your application to repay your benefits and re file okay so there's no need to go down and asked the local Social Security administration worker okay you just file ss aid form five Twenty one\nSo so if you're if you're if it's been less than twelve months since you filed you can get you can repay what they paid you and then re filed later All right\nSo uh that's funny I I asked them and they didn't even understand the question\nOr whatever you have this talk with Tom I Am too so um as I mentioned uh we are a firm that specializes in retirement planning so all the things that ah that requires we want to help you with so uh we have seminars that I'd like for you to go to because\nAt

where'd you get it from that kind of stuff\nOr we want to talk about should you roll over your four O. one K. um when should you take Social Security when you're sixty two when you're sixty six when you're Seventy when's the best time to do that we want to talk about the fact that the IRS\n[noise]\nMan she's afraid of that I arrest guy [laughter] I Can't blame her ah the IRS less attacked eighty five percent of your Social Security benefits did you know that eighty five percent\nSo we want to [noise] I agree and you know we want to show you how to beat that if it is\nA tall possible we want

a few diamonds here and there anyway we are back I Am can rewrite the host of money matters with Ken my rape and I've been a certified financial planner professional for the last twenty\nMarvelous wonderful and very exciting years at all the idea that we talk about on this show these are the very same idea that we talked about with our blood and most valued clients and that we are affirmed that specializes in retirement planning so we primarily worked with people that are over the age of fifty who I retired or who are retiring soon\nAnd do we not work with over a thousand four hundred families in forty three states and we are honored and blessed by that and Financial Times named our financial advisory for money matters one of the top three hundred registered investment advisers and this is now for the second time [noise]\nThis week we're actually going to talk about paying for college\nAnd the gift tax laws so if you were not aware a gift taxes come do if you give anybody more than Fifteen thousand dollars in one year\nOkay and so that's the gift tax and college in many cases more than fifty thousand dollars a year I Know I have one in college right now and so you could end up having to do a gift tax if you don't do it properly so we're going to talk about that now but first jak and you\nKnow I\n\nWould say\nMy dog and may be\n\n\nAnd of course that is Tony Bennett with rags to riches and you know the estate taxes and probate and all that kind of stuff it's actually designed to do the exact opposite it's designed to take you from riches to rags\nAnd we do not want that to happen to use every week at this time we have our state tip of the week so this week we're going to talk about a college education paying for that\nOkay so as I mentioned the gift tax exemption is Fifteen thousand dollars this year so let me give you some history on that one okay so that when when the IRS [laughter]\nAh almost cut you off guard on that one when the IRS came up with the notion of estate taxes this is a tax upon your death and it goes to whoever um\nThey wanted attacks that so they created the estate tax but the IRS is a lot of things but it's not stupid and they figured out that if you have a tax that happens upon death\nThan what people are going to do is if they know they're going to die they're going to give it all away first and then when they die there's no tax so we can't have that that would be downright on American not to have some taxes paid\nSo they came up with the gift tax which means that if you try to give it all the way we are going to tax it anyway so you can't get away with that but they also realized that if you tax every single gift you know if I take you out if I pay for dinner with with friends or something that's a gift\nAnd so do I have to file a tax return for that so we get kind of onerous and they'd probably be thrown out of office for it so they made a gift tax exemption and to give tax exemption is Fifteen thousand dollars\nPer person that you can give to and as a married couple you can give thirty thousand dollars to as many people as us so the gift tax exempt amount that fifty thousand is you can get that too many people as you wish um and and that's how that works so college is part of that\nSo one of the things that you want to do so there are additional exemptions too that gift tax\nAnd by the way if you exceed that fifty thousand a gift tax is the same as your state tax and it can get all the way up to almost fifty percent okay so you give a big gift and you may oh half of that in taxes think about that one [noise] so\nHow do you not to pay gift taxes on college uh on on a college education costs the answer is", "show_name": "The Drive Home With Jillian Barberie & John Phillips",
