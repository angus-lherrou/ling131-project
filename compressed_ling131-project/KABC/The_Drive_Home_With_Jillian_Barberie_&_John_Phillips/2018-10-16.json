river hero plenty we can clean the drain\nRow and okay sounds like a name that you'd like a like a my Sharon a check her own you know if he is the creator and producer of HBO's cat how the series and he got the right show\nOh yeah and he got to know ... very well over ... ... ... what do you think is going to happen to the business because I don't do much of that business was hopping his personality would you take him out of it what happened I don't know here's the thing those girls love him to\nGirls love they called them daddy they love to Dennis Dennis took care of them he wasn't it you know the old school day should think of a certain\nType of person running up a brothel and you'd think oh ... ... exactly but boy he was anything but these girls and I spoke with a lot of them are we talked a lot of them here on on on the show and they really loved it Dennis so\nUm and the tributes have been pouring in all day from the bunny ranch I don't know if you've been watching that on Twitter but I have I been monitoring it [laughter] I don't view to Dennis well\nThose businesses are always under attack there are certain ... what he said he is but it took his labor and it took his involvement to make sure that they kept their licenses so yeah it opened the money they advertise\nThere were a few times his license was pulled but not for nefarious reasons he would put an addition on and maybe not get a a proper permit so they're always looking for ways to kind of pull the rug out from\nUnderneath him um he is an interesting guy I was reading all kinds of things about him a and I guess he was also accused in this whole me too movement did you see that I saw that for nothing really came up with nothing came of it as far as I could read 'em and wanting to not\nForget is when she became a politician and when he specifically became a viral viable politician the game changed and so in this me to\nArrow lots of people are coming out I was just talking to a friend of mine who's a former local elected official here in Southern California and there are a bunch of city council races all over California\nWhere you're having people come out of the woodwork without substantiate should write a this person I dated ten years ago and they were physically abusive and emotionally abusive and then has been around for them ... because that's the theme right now so that's\nThe ... yeah that's a complex and there's no doubt about it but there's no way to find out what's going to have lost their careers over allegations not over facts I mean this is just the way it's been\nAh we've seen it happen up and down so it's nothing now I'm not surprised that it's it's you know and and I think there are I was reading a great article today with horse face a Stormy Daniels and um\nShe said in it ah\nShe's not part of me too because she's willing participant in her own life and she's not a victim and I thought I like I like her I like what ... thinks there's a huge distinction\nBut right now the whole thing is is the lines are blurred and there's a million things in between a dirty joke and someone who's a rape but\nBy the way we just um send a lot for the fact that Donald Trump called her horse face he chose to sleep with horse face that's his type and he also ...\nSaid you remind me of my daughter calling her daughter a horse said he's got to stop this nonsense it's out of control anyway back to Dennis Dennis was a great guy always called in or are we were mutual fans of each other\nThat's right now and an entertaining interview every time he was on\nYeah oh gosh I loved we'd say\n... current currents against this kind of\nLike a ... and she wants to say hello to ya\nMembers he would do that all the time with the money for the call yeah sometimes it wasn't just one sometimes they don't make up all of them in there oh yeah and he would Gail us with ah the things he was doing before he called my house right now I Know why is our gave out I was thinking the same thing I said you know I Hope the half went out with a bang I really do\nAll right let's talk to George chicken Rhone who is the creator and producer of HBO's cat house the series George thanks so much for joining us St George\n[noise] All right out of the grocery store their George or you're backing up [laughter]\nGeorge I we were fans of the show when you first got the show together was he the one did he take it you did you take it to him did you already know him 'cause he was larger than life personality that really um I think the series a word to be a largely in part because of him\nYeah well actually the sewer his whole ... worth I Believe um I had met jealous when I was a correspondent tool or an affair and er what else to get a story probably back in Nineteen Ninety One they shut me up to a\nPerson city ... story the woman's name Jesse ... and she was running for governor\nAnd she was a a prostitute as dumb as his place so you know I went there and it was like the first fight over you know been in it to a ... awful you know and I had no idea what church\nWell that's the story or a secondary [laughter]\nI I had no idea so anyway what I got to know devastate just recently bought it he was doing real estate or something you lord of the time and uh\nYou know it wasn't what I expected you see like a pretty down to earth business guy man battling we read the stories and I look back I was working as a kind of the same but heart healthy or that show and this was back in Ninety five\nAnd I used to do all the features ... my boss said listen to those in the ... of them work a little blue pill given because this was back in ... new new thing\nHe says can she says the thick of the only way to do something different machinery or I Know this guy does anyway here's one by I've had the idea to do is a\nDocumentary and I approached him and his all for it and it took us going around here is the do it you know HBO to grow coal ratings were college level which I Believe it's still stands for all of that time slot\nAnd the documentary shares\nWhat was he liked to work with I mean we knew him you know as a guest and ... and just say this large in life personality was he because he thought he was very approachable easygoing funny and kind of was mentioning earlier about the girl's name really uh like tennis and\nAnd that what was your experience working with him on that side of things\nSo much the same thing as a you know he was easy to like and I think you enjoy with people like Tim yeah you know as you hear them being\nAnd er [noise] I really can't say anything bad about the guy a it's a matter of fact I was a A R belong to a lot of small look into the station here in Las Vegas or the ... Americans and and ah you know I was wondering\nFor his seat and I called them up and said do this once you've come down it's a good day or something for lunch and and uh you know say a few words and you said you know no problem he came down\nI Believe that was in trouble or you know it was really the last time I ... into he had a big party this weekend uh up in a place up in Reno and look I was invited circuitry Tea Party and or or you know I heard some of the work to do and I couldn't make it oh\nWell yeah so we get it in a while and I looked up to this nation is working it just kind of way to be\nWell you know I was reading about this party has a three day party any Seventy two and I'm thinking okay did he party so hard that is hard just gave out did he uh you know did he in ... in ... he lost a lot of weight by the way we can house first came on he was a bigger deal if you see pictures of him\nMore recent pictures you can see the the the weight loss and the drop is pretty significant don't know how much exactly\nBut um I just wonder how his health was because you know in Seventy two or three day party man that's a party and\nAnd you know I I just hope that I Know they're going to investigate they're going to do the toxicology tests and whatnot but they're saying no foul play which I Would you know ...
